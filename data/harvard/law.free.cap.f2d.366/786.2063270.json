This rejection was affirmed by the Board of Appeals. We find the rejection to be improper and therefore reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-30\">After an extensive prosecution, the appealed claims stood rejected in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the patent previously issued to appellants. While the rejection has been sometimes couched in terms of \u201cdouble patenting\u201d below, we will first set forth the relationship between the appealed claims and the patent claims before attempting to ascertain the basis for the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">\n<em>The Applications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The facts are relatively simple and not in dispute. Appellants are the inventors of record in the appealed application <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the patent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appealed application results from a division of a parent case. The patent relied upon for the rejection issued on a continuation-in-part application based on the parent case. The parent case is not involved here. No requirement for restriction was made by the Patent Office between the appealed application and the continuation-in-part application and appellants do not claim any benefit here under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 121. The patent is not prior art under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 because it is not entitled to an earlier filing date than the appealed application. It is not prior art under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) because it was filed by the same inventors.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\n<em>The Inventions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The subject matter defined in the patent claims and the appealed claims may be described as follows. <em>All </em>of the appealed claims define a resin <em>per se.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> All </em>of the patent claims relied on in the rejection define a hair setting composition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The patent claims define a hair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>setting composition in which the resin of appealed claims 1-6 provides one component.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The examiner rejected the appealed claims as \u201cunpatentable over\u201d the patent claims. The examiner\u2019s answer before the board states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">The Examiner\u2019s position, succinctly stated, is that <em>a polymer is not patentable over the same polymer dispersed in water. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">Applicant firmly maintains that [the patent] * * * is not prior art because the application on appeal takes priority to the filing date of [the patent] * * *. That such a position is untenable is clearly shown by In re Ockert, [44 CCPA 1024, 245 F.2d 467, 114 USPQ 330] * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">That if only one inventive concept is present, two patents cannot be granted <em>regardless of the order in which the applications were filed. </em>(Italics added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-12\">In summary the Examiner submits that a clear unequivocal case of double patenting has been made out. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The board in its opinion expressly declined to indicate whether the basis of the rejection was \u201cdouble patenting\u201d or whether its rejection was based on the patent as prior art. The board found instead that the appealed claims and the patent claims claimed the \u201csame invention,\u201d citing 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101; that the claims \u201cdiffer in scope only;\u201d and that there was no \u201cpatentable distinction\u201d between the appealed claims and the patent claims. The board agreed with the examiner\u2019s reasoning and added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-17\">* * * We do not consider such solutions of a soluble polymer to constitute patentably separate and distinct subject matter. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-18\">* * * aqueous solutions of the [resin per se] * * * such as those claimed in appellants\u2019 patent, would be apparent to the polymer chemist of no more than ordinary knowledge and skill. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-19\">A terminal disclaimer as to the appealed claims was filed but was given no legal effect in overcoming the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-20\">The solicitor in his brief, apparently recognizing the contradiction between the board\u2019s positions \u2014 that the appealed claims and the patent claims claimed the \u201csame invention\u201d but also claimed different inventions which were \u201cpatentably indistinct\u201d \u2014 argues primarily the broader ground that the patent claims and the appealed claims are \u201cpatentably indistinct.\u201d However, concerning the terminal disclaimer, the solicitor argues that our decisions in In re Robeson, 331 F.2d 610, 51 CCPA 1271; and In re Kaye, 332 F.2d 816, 51 CCPA 1465, are not controlling because of a difference in \u201cfacts.\u201d It is reasoned that in <em>Kaye </em>and <em>Robeson </em>there were \u201cseparate inventions\u201d and the claims defined \u201cmutually exclusive subject matter\u201d whereas here the appealed claims and the patent claims differ only in \u201cscope\u201d based upon \u201cthe same subject matter.\u201d The solicitor\u2019s brief <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-21\">* * * the fact that the appeal claims will dominate the patent claims is a sufficiently important difference to make those decisions <em>\\Kaye </em>and <em>Robe</em>son] inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>From this background, only briefly commented on, we must determine what is the basis for the rejection. It is readily apparent that the terms \u201csame invention\u201d and \u201cpatentably indistinct\u201d provide little assistance in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\n<em>\u201cSame Invention\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Do the appealed claims and the patent claims define the \u201csame invention ?\u201d We would comment at this point that the patent bar was cautioned some 33 years previously by Stringham, in his book entitled <em>Double Patenting, </em>22, 24 (1933), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">* * * The term \u201csame invention\u201d is too broad a term to fit in with the law of double patenting, because of the diversity of meanings of \u201cinvention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">* * * -x- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">The undue breadth of the term \u201csame invention\u201d has occasioned, at least in part, the difficulty which inventors have had in getting proper protection on more than one related achievement. It is not even approximately true to say that the law does not permit more than one patent on the \u201csame invention.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">We think the 1952 Patent Act recognized this warning. The term \u201cinvention\u201d as used in the 1952 Patent Act means an \u201cinvention or discovery\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 100), or as stated in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, it is the \u201csubject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d Before such \u201cinvention\u201d may be <em>patented </em>it must meet the requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Whatever meaning the term \u201cinvention\u201d may have possessed prior to the 1952 Patent Act, it is clear that the term \u201cinvention\u201d now means the <em>subject matter </em>which the applicant claims and regards as his \u201cinvention.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. Accordingly, before two sets of claims may now be said to claim the \u201csame invention,\u201d they must <em>in fact </em>claim the <em>same subject matter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">The failure to conform to the terminology of the 1952 Patent Act has created unnecessary problems in communication and resulted in confusion. Nowhere is this confusion more evident than in the maze of law included in the term \u201cdouble patenting.\u201d We need look no further than the record here for confirmation of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">Do the appealed claims and the patent claims define the same subject matter, that is, the same invention? We think the proper way to determine whether claims in two applications or in an application and a patent define the same subject matter is to determine <em>independently </em>precisely what subject matter is defined in the two sets of claims. Where it may be concluded after comparing these independent determinations that the subject matter is in fact the same, the appealed claims are properly rejected in view of the patent claims. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The inquiry is factual and requires that <em>all </em>of the subject matter defined by the claim be considered. We may not ignore or discard any portions of the claimed subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, considering the patent claims, the subject matter defined therein is a hair setting composition comprising a resin dispersed in a solvent. Considering the appealed claims, the subject matter defined therein is a resin per se. Comparing the respective subject matter, we must conclude that the subject matter is not the same and therefore the respective claims do not define the \u201csame invention.\u201d Numerous decisions of this court support this conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">There is evidence of record that the Patent Office considered that the appealed claims and the patent claims did in fact claim the \u201csame invention\u201d <em>meaning </em>the \u201csame subject matter.\u201d The reasoning in support thereof is that both sets of claims include the resin. This method of comparing the inventions defined by the claims is improper as it corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>pares only a portion of the subject matter defined by the patent claims with the subject matter defined by the appealed claims. Finding that we are dealing here with different inventions, we will now consider whether we are dealing with \u201cpatentably indistinct\u201d inventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">\n<em>\u201cPatentably Indistinct Invention\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Considering all of the arguments of the Patent Office and the opinions of the board, we think that claims 1-7 were primarily rejected on the ground that they claim subject matter which is not patentably distinguishable from subject matter claimed in a patent previously issued to appellants. While the board stated at one point the basis for the rejection was that the respective claims defined the \u201csame invention,\u201d we think the real objection is that though there are in fact two <em>inventions, </em>only one of them is considered to be entitled to a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\n<em>The Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The solicitor argues primarily that the appealed claims are \u201cpatentably indistinct\u201d from the patent claims. Appellants traverse this argument and also argue that the Patent Office has, in effect, utilized the patent as prior art in rejecting the appealed claims. We will first consider the solicitor\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The solicitor in his brief explains how the patent claims and the appealed claims define subject matter which is \u201cpatent-ably indistinct.\u201d The explanation involves an interpretation of the patent claims. First, in interpreting the patent claims, we are asked to ignore that portion of the patent claims which states that the composition therein defined is \u201cfor setting hair.\u201d It is reasoned that portion indicates \u201conly an intended use\u201d which \u201cis of no patentable significance\u201d citing In re Sinex, 309 F.2d 488, 50 CCPA 1004; Kropa v. Robie, 187 F.2d 150, 38 CCPA 858. Second, it is argued that the portion of the patent claims which recites that the polymer is dispersed in \u201ca solvent,\u201d as an element of the \u201ccomposition for setting hair,\u201d \u201cthat is selected from the group consisting of water, lower alky] alcohols containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and their mixtures\u201d is of no \u201cpatentable significance.\u201d The solicitor reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-10\">* * * Common sense and common experience indicate that it is common practice to dissolve resinous materials in various solvents to produce coating compositions for various uses, and that the lower alkyl alcohols, such as methyl or ethyl alcohol, are common solvents for that purpose. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Interpreting the patent claims in the above manner, the solicitor concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">* * * Therefore, it is manifest that the claims of the patent and the instant claims depend upon the same essential element for patentability, namely the specific polymeric material. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">We do not agree that the patent claims before us can be interpreted in the above manner nor is such a method of analysis proper in determining whether two sets of claims are \u201cpatentably indistinct.\u201d First, we do not agree that the portion of the patent claims which recite \u201ca composition for setting hair,\u201d may be ignored in determining what invention is defined by the patent claims. An examination of the patent specification, including the objects of the invention, the discussion of the prior art, and the examples set forth, reveals that it is directed solely to compositions for setting hair. The only interpretation of the patent claims consistent with the disclosure is that the invention, the subject matter claimed therein, is a hair setting composition. \u201cIn our judgment those introductory words give life and meaning\u201d to the claims. Kropa v. Robie, supra, 187 F.2d 150, 38 CCPA 858; In re Sinex, supra, 309 F.2d 488, 50 CCPA 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">We also find it improper to ignore the introductory portions of the patent claims for another reason. The record shows that during prosecution in the Patent Office the claims were rejected as being obvious in view of hair setting compositions disclosed in prior art patents. The Patent Office then considered that the patent claims did in fact define a hair setting composition and not a poly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>mer dispersed in a solvent or a resin per se. Appellants successfully argued the distinctions between their claimed subject matter and the cited prior art and the rejection was removed. In view of this circumstance it seems to us that any argument here as to whether the patent claims define a hair setting composition is foreclosed. The arguments here must be consistent with the position taken by the Patent Office in the file of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Second, we think the solicitor\u2019s method of analysis whereby the appealed claims are found to be \u201cpatentably indistinct\u201d is incorrect and contrary to well established principles of law. It appears that the analysis is based on a principle of subtraction wherein all that is old (water and lower alcohols) and all that is allegedly obvious (dissolving resins in solvents) may be deleted from the claim. That which remains is the subject matter upon which \u201cpatentability\u201d is predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We know of no authority, and the solicitor cites none, where, in a rejection based on double patenting, it is permissible to dissect and discard portions of claims in a search for or an attempt to isolate \u201cthe essential element for patent-ability,\u201d whatever that means, common to two sets of claims. Following the solicitor\u2019s reasoning, no other patent may issue which includes, as part of the subject matter sought to be patented, the resin per se. Also, we note that this reasoning process looks to what elements in the claims are the <em>same </em>and casts out the <em>differences. </em>We believe this is also improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The solicitor infers, however, on the facts of this case, that all appellants did was \u00bf0 disperse the resin in a solvent. And, apparently for emphasis, the solicitor points out that the patent claims include dispersing the resin in <em>water. </em>The solicitor\u2019s position apparently endorses the examiner\u2019s question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">* * * where resides patentability when claiming a polymeric product, whose dispersion has been earlier claimed. [ ?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">As we view the proceedings below, we think the objections and reasoning of the Patent Office are improper. The inquiry below is consistently cast in terms of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 which is not permitted in view of the facts of record. The subject matter defined in the appealed claims is treated as prior art and we are asked to determine whether it would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to construct a hair setting composition utilizing the resin as an element. But the patent is not prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Perhaps the real basis for the position here taken by the solicitor is that a patent on the hair setting composition never should have issued. Concerning that invention and patent, the solicitor states in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">* * * While method claims, such as claims 12 and 13 of the patent might be patentable as a new use under 35 U.S.C. 100(b), the composition itself would be unpatentable. Consequently, it is submitted that only a single patentable concept exists, and that under the established principles two patents cannot be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">The patent is presumed valid, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. The gist of the above argument again requires that we utilize the appealed claims as prior art and additionally take judicial notice that the specific resin defined therein may be dispersed in the solvents disclosed in the <em>patent. </em>We are to <em>assume </em>that the <em>composition </em>is <em>old </em>in the art and that appellants merely discovered that the composition was <em>useful </em>for setting hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">In summary, the invention defined by the appealed claims is a resin per se and the invention defined by the patent claims is a hair setting composition. There are no other references before us. As we view the record, appellants discovered a resin which is novel and unobvious. They also discovered that this resin was a useful element in a hair setting composition. The hair setting composition now protected by a patent is not a bar per se to the appealed claims. Based on the facts of record, we know no theory of law concerning \u201cdou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ble patenting\u201d which permits us to find that the inventions are \u201cpatentably indistinct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Our analysis of the rejection before us is in no way dependent upon the fact that appellants have filed a terminal disclaimer in this case. In view of our disposition of the rejection, the terminal disclaimer is not necessary to overcome the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">WORLEY, C.
