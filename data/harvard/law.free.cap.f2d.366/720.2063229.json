After a jury trial he was convicted and sentenced under the Young Adult Offenders Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209. He filed a timely appeal to this court which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"Apo\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU8\">\u201cWhoever utters any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communication shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-18\">The evidence established that at the time of the offense charged appellant was a 23-year-old male with a limited education. He had a citizens\u2019 band radio license which he operated as a hobby. Without going into the details, it is sufficient to say that a prolonged argument developed over the air between appellant and one Sartain, each broadcasting over a citizens\u2019 band radio in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sartain testified that he heard appellant make over the air certain statements which are set out in the record but which we feel need not be set out here. Suffice it to say, it was not parlor language.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">Appellant contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464 is unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment because it is an attempt to exercise police power reserved to the states. It is well established that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause, Article I, \u00a7 8, el. 3 of the Constitution, to impose penal sanctions on what it considers to be morally objectionable conduct so long as \u201cthe activity sought to be regulated is \u2018commerce which concerns more States than one\u2019 and has a real and substantial relation to the national interest.\u201d Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 255, 85 S.Ct. 348, 356, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964). See, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290 (1964); United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L. Ed. 609 (1941); Brooks v. United States, 267 U.S. 432, 45 S.Ct. 345, 69 L.Ed. 699 (1925); Duncan v. United States, 48 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>2d 128 (9th Cir. 1931). Cf. Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 492-493, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"> Appellant argues that the activities here involve wholly intrastate transmissions because the normal range of a citizens\u2019 radio transmission is from 10 to 25 miles, which would mean that transmissions from Las Vegas, Nevada, would not cross Nevada\u2019s borders and because there is no evidence in the record that the transmissions of the appellant were in fact heard outside of Nevada. There is evidence in the record, however, that transmissions of the type appellant was sending are capable of traveling beyond the Nevada border and of being heard in other states under unusual atmospheric conditions. The fact that transmissions over citizens\u2019 band radio may cross state borders, either because of unusual atmospheric conditions or because the transmitter is located near a border, justifies a conclusion that such transmissions have a substantial enough effect on interstate commerce to empower Congress to regulate all citizens\u2019 band radio. The fact that appellant\u2019s isolated transmission may not have traversed state borders is irrelevant since it is the cumulative impact on interstate commerce of all citizens\u2019 band radio transmissions which enables Congress to regulate all such transmissions. Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, supra, 379 U.S. at 275-277, 85 S.Ct. 348 (Black, J., concurring); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942). In addition, radio receivers located in Las Vegas which are designed to receive interstate transmissions may also be able to receive local citizens\u2019 band radio transmissions. The fact that some radio receivers could receive both interstate and intrastate citizens\u2019 band communications, thus inevitably creating the probability of interference with interstate communications, also brings the local transmissions within the ambit of the commerce clause. Cf. Weiss v. United States, 308 U.S. 321, 60 S.Ct. 269, 84 L.Ed. 298 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\"> We also hold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464 does apply to all citizens\u2019 band radio communications even where it is not proven that the transmission involved did in fact cross state lines. The original prohibition against \u201cobscene, indecent, or profane\u201d language was enacted as section 29 of the Radio Act of 1927, c. 169, 44 Stat. 1172. It was repealed in 1934 and replaced by section 326 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1091, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 326.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1948 the last sentence of section 326 was deleted <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, as part of the comprehensive revision of the criminal laws under Title 18 of the United States Code, the deleted sentence became 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464 with slight changes in phraseology. The unqualified language of section 1464 and its predecessors indicates an intended application to all radio communications affecting interstate commerce. In addition, the jurisdiction provision of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, Title III, provides for coverage of intrastate communications affecting interstate communications, which is an explicit Congressional indication that the prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1464 and its predecessors are intended to apply to transmissions over citizens\u2019 band radio. Federal Communications Act of 1934, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>652, \u00a7 301(d), 48 Stat. 1081(d), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Other specifications of error are directed to certain jury instructions given by the court, to other instructions requested by the appellant and refused by the court, and to the action of the district judge in sending to the jury while they were deliberating certain instructions in response to a question sent by the jury to the judge. The latter action was taken without the presence, consultation or knowledge of counsel on either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The government concedes that two errors occurred involving the instructions to the jury. We agree and find that each is sufficient for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The judge\u2019s secret instructions to the jury were given at the written request of a jury member who asked:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\u201cAre we to determine the <em>intention </em>-of the use of profane and/or obscene language or just the use of the words over a citizen band radio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The judge responded by memo, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\u201cYou are to only concern yourself with whether the Defendant used Obscene, Indecent, or Profane language over the radio. You are not to concern yourself with the reasons or motive for such use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">The giving of this instruction was prejudicial error because it directly contradicted an earlier instruction given by the trial judge, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the effect that specific intent was an element needed to be proved in order for the government to secure a conviction. It was also error because it was an erroneous statement of the law: the defendant\u2019s intent is a very pertinent and necessary element in a conviction for use of obscenity, see Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 969, 16 L.Ed.2d 31 (1966); Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16 L.Ed. 2d 56 (1966); Smith v. People of State of California, 361 U.S. 147, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959). The giving of an instruction to the jury concerning the substantive law of the trial without the presence or knowledge of counsel for both sides is error of itself, Shields v. United States, 273 U.S. 583, 47 S.Ct. 478, 71 L. Ed. 787 (1927); Ah Fook Chang v. United States, 91 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">In its instructions the court defined obscene language as follows: \u201cAn obscene word or words is defined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Supreme Court of the United States as follows: Tf to the average person applying contemporary community standards, the word, or words, have to do with the prurient, the lewd or the lascivious.\u2019 \u201d Counsel for the government concedes and we agree that the above instruction was erroneous and not in accordance with the definition of obscene as given by the Supreme Court. In a book named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of A Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 418, 86 S.Ct. 975, 977, 16 L.Ed.2d 1 (1966), the Court stated: \u201cWe defined obscenity in Roth [354 U.S. 476 at 479, 77 S.Ct. 1304 at 1311 (1957)] in the following terms: \u2018[W]hether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Appellant also contends that his motion of acquittal should have been granted because the language alleged to have been used was not \u201cobscene, indecent, or profane.\u201d The government concedes, and we agree, that the language alleged to have been used can in no way be considered \u201cobscene\u201d because the language as a whole can not be viewed as appealing to the prurient or calculated to arouse the animal passions, but rather was made during a moment of anger. Roth v. United States, supra; A Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of A Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, supra; Duncan v. United States, 48 F.2d 128 (9th Cir. 1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Although the district court\u2019s instruction defining \u201cprofane\u201d is not criticized by appellant, the government does not contend that the words used were \u201cprofane.\u201d Since the only words attributed to appellant which could even remotely be considered as being \u201cprofane\u201d were \u201cGod damn it,\u201d which were also uttered in anger, there is no basis for holding that the language was \u201cprofane\u201d within the meaning of the statute. See Duncan v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The government\u2019s only argument is that the words used were \u201cindecent\u201d within the meaning of that word in section 1464. No instruction defining \u201cindecent\u201d was given by the district court. The government urges now that the three words \u2014 \u201cobscene, indecent, and profane\u201d \u2014 have different meanings and \u201cindecent\u201d should be defined \u201cas including the extremely vulgar, coarse and offensive use of sexual terminology in a manner far exceeding the bounds of common decency.\u201d The government relies heavily upon United States v. Limehouse, 285 U.S. 424, 52 S.Ct. 412, 76 L.Ed. 843 (1932), which held that the word \u201cfilthy\u201d which was added to the postal obscenity law by amendment, now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461, meant something other than \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious,\u201d and permitted a prosecution of the sender of a letter which \u201cplainly related to sexual matters\u201d and was \u201ccoarse, vulgar, disgusting, indecent; and unquestionably filthy within the popular meaning of that term.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whether this contention is or is not correct is not before us at this time. The jury should have had the word \u201cindecent\u201d defined for them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">It is for the district court in the first instance to define the word \u201cindecent\u201d in the event there is a second trial. Whether the definition then given is correct or whether such definition violates any constitutional standards is a matter to be determined on review. We do not reach these questions at this time inasmuch as the reversible error referred to above requires that the conviction be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>versed and there is a possibility that appellant will be acquitted at a new trial if one is held.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">. \u201cSec. 326. Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication. <em>No person ivithin the jurisdiction of the United States shall utter any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communication.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added) The language is virtually identical with its predecessor in the Radio Act of 1927, section 29, 44 Stat. 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">Violations were penalized under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, c. 652, section 501, 48 Stat. 1100, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-20\">.

Appellant possessed a license which he apparently obtained pursuant to these regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b772-17\">. The jury also requested the use of a dictionary, which request was denied by the trial judge without the knowledge or presence of either counsel. We do not see how this action by the trial judge could have prejudiced appellant. See Ferrari v. United States, 244 F.2d 132 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b772-18\">. \u201cIn every crime, there must exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent. The burden is always upon the prosecution to prove both act and intent beyond a reasonable doubt. With respect to major crimes, such as charged in this case, specific intent must be proved before there can be a conviction. A person who knowingly does an act which the law forbids, intending with bad purpose to disobey or disregard the law, may be found to act with specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">\u201cAn act is done knowingly if done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake, accident or other innocent reason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\">. See Cain v. United States, 274 F.2d 598 (2d Cir. 1960); Verner v. United States, 183 F.2d 184 (9th Cir. 1950). See generally, 16 Stan.L.Rev. 463 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">. Appellant argues that obscene and indecent as used in section 1464 are synonymous. We do not agree that in Duncan v. United States, supra, the court equated \u201cindecent with obscene.\u201d A careful reading of that case discloses that the court said that certain language quoted in the opinion was not indecent or obscene. It did not, however, define indecent or say that it meant the same as obscene.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
