When the parties were unable to agree, the Union threatened to strike. The Railroads then brought this suit in the court below to enjoin the strike. From an order granting such an injunction the defendant Union appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">Following the extended disputes between numerous railroads and their operating employees relating to rules and working conditions which are recounted in detail in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 372 U.S. 284, 83 S.Ct. 691, 9 L.Ed.2d 759, and in Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 382 U.S. 423, 86 S.Ct. 594, 15 L.Ed.2d 501 (January 31, 1966), Congress undertook to avoid the consequences of a threatened strike by the unions through the enactment of provisions for compulsory arbitration of two of the issues between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>carriers and the unions. There remained other disputes, not comprehended within this arbitration, which the parties undertook to deal with in what the parties refer to as the \u201cWhite House Agreement\u201d dated June 25, 1964. The particular portion of that agreement, involved here, was contained in Article II, \u00a7 1 thereof, which provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u201cARTICLE II \u2014 EXPENSES AWAY FROM HOME:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u201cSection 1\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u201cWhen the carrier ties up a road service crew (except short turnaround passenger crews), or individual members thereof, at a terminal (including tie-up points named by assignment bulletins, or presently listed in schedule agreements, or observed by practice, as regular points for tying up crews) other than the designated home terminal of the crew assignment of four (4) hours or more, each member of the crew so tied up shall be provided suitable lodging at the carrier\u2019s expense or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof. Suitable lodging or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof shall be worked out on a local basis. The equitable allowance shall be provided only if it is not reasonably possible to provide lodging.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u201cIf an allowance is being made in lieu of lodging as well as other considerations under provisions of existing agreements, the amount attributed only to lodging shall be removed if suitable lodging is supplied, or offset against an equivalent allowance. This shall be worked out on a local basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u201cThe provisions of this Section shall be made effective at a date no later than 80 days following the effective date of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The lodging referred to is the lodging required by the employees during their layovers at the end of their runs.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">At conferences following this agreement the parties attempted to agree on what would be considered \u201csuitable lodging or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof,\u201d but without success. On July 24, 1964, the appellee railroads issued and served on the appellants its \u201cCircular No. 65\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">\u201cSPOKANE, PORTLAND AND SEATTLE RAILWAY COMPANY SYSTEM LINES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">Portland, Oregon</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8P\">July 24 1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-14\">Circular No. 65</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALP\">ALL CONCERNED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-15\">Effective July 25, 1964 and until further notice, whenever a road service crew is tied up at a terminal other than the designated home terminal of the crew assigned for four hours or more, each member of the crew so tied up will be provided lodging at the following locations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-16\">Spokane \u2014 Coeur d\u2019 Ale\u00f1e Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-17\">Pasco \u2014 Pioneer Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">Wishram \u2014 SPS Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-19\">Bend \u2014 Colonial Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-20\">Albany \u2014 Albany Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-21\">Eugene \u2014 Lane Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-22\">Astoria \u2014 Astor Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-23\">Seaside \u2014 Chillquist Rooming House</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-24\">Vernonia \u2014 Hy-van Hotel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-25\">A survey recently taken of lodging then being used by train and engine-men at the above points indicated that while some were using accommodations listed above, others had made different lodging arrangements. Therefore, although accommodations will be available at the above named establishments, if any crew member desires to keep his present arrangement, he may do so in which event he will be allowed $1.50 for each layover period during which he is tied up for more than four hours at the away-from-home terminal of his assignment. This allowance may be claimed on the service slip for the particular trip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-26\">While the above arrangement is in effect, the allowance in lieu of lodging presently being made to certain train crew members in pooled caboose territory will be removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-27\">J.

Room to be maintained in a suitable manner with linen to be changed after each use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c(2) The lodging mentioned in Paragraph (1) to be located not more than one-fourth miles from point where crews are required to register and/or off duty, or suitable transportation furnished between lodging and points of reporting for duty, or going off duty. Call service will be provided by carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c(3) In lieu of requirements of above Paragraphs (1) and (2), an equitable allowance per trip will be six dollars ($6.00) to be paid by check separate and apart from wages and earnings. \u201cPlease advise me promptly whether you are agreeable to these provisions, or as to a date for conference concerning this proposal, as provided by the Railway Labor Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">For the purpose of clarifying what next happened, we note that the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.) provides two separate and distinct methods for the settlement of disputes between carriers and their employees. Section 3 of the Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153) which establishes a National Railroad Adjustment Board provides that disputes \u201cgrowing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules or working conditions, including cases pending and unadjusted on June 21, 1934, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.\u201d (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(i)) Disputes of this character are known as \u201cminor\u201d disputes. Their submission to the National Railroad Adjustment Board is \u201cconsidered as compulsory arbitration in this limited field,\u201d and awards in such cases are \u201cfinal and binding upon both parties,\u201d and in case of attempted violation of such an award through a strike the \u201cDistrict Court has jurisdiction and power to issue necessary injunctive orders * * * notwithstanding the provisions of the Norris-La Guardia Act.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago R. &amp; I. R. Co., 353 U.S. 30, 77 S.Ct. 635, 1 L.Ed.2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">As the Court there noted, these so-called \u201cminor disputes\u201d \u201cmay be contrasted with \u2018major disputes\u2019 which result when there is disagreement in the bargaining process for a new contract.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Elgin, J. &amp; E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>U.S. 711, at pages 722 to 727, 65 S.Ct. 1282, at pages 1289-1292, 89 L.Ed. 1886, the Court defined and described the two kinds of disputes. Speaking of \u201cmajor disputes\u201d the Court said (p. 723, 65 S.Ct. p. 1290): \u201cThey arise where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one, and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy. They look to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court then proceeded to note the divergent procedures prescribed for dealing with the two kinds of disputes. It said (p. 725, 65 S.Ct. p. 1290): \u201c \u2018Major disputes\u2019 go first to mediation under the auspices of the National Mediation Board; if that fails, then to acceptance or rejection of arbitration, cf. \u00a7 7; [Brotherhood of Railroad] Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., 321 U.S. 50, 64 S.Ct. 413, 88 L. Ed. 534, 150 A.L.R. 810; and finally to possible presidential intervention to secure adjustment. \u00a7 10. For their settlement the statutory scheme retains throughout the traditional voluntary processes of negotiation, mediation, voluntary arbitration, and conciliation. Every facility for bringing about agreement is provided and pressures for mobilizing public opinion are applied. The parties are required to submit to the successive procedures designed to induce agreement. \u00a7 5 First (b). But compulsions go only to insure that those procedures are exhausted before resort can be had to self-help. No authority is empowered to decide the dispute and no such power is intended, unless the parties themselves agree to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">For a case in which this court dealt with the distinctions between these two kinds of disputes, see Butte, Anaconda &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of L. F. &amp; E., 9 Cir., 268 F.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">After the railroad and the Union had exchanged their two notices, quoted above, the railroad\u2019s notice of July 24 and the Union\u2019s notice of August 3, 1964, they had conferences in an attempt to resolve their differences, but without success. Not only were they unable to agree upon what allowance or lodgings \u201caway from home\u201d should be furnished, but they were in sharp disagreement as to the character or nature of their dispute, and as to the steps necessary to be taken in an effort to resolve it. It will be noted that in its August 3 notice the Union referred to an agreement to be reached \u201cin accord with Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act.\u201d This section (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156) deals with a \u201cmajor dispute\u201d. By letter of August 10, 1964, the railroad challenged this reference to \u00a7 6, asserting that this was a dispute \u201cinvolving the interpretation or application\u201d of Article VII of the agreement of June 25, 1964. About the same time the Union invoked mediation on the part of the Mediation Board. The Mediation Board took no action at that time, apparently because it was advised that the parties, as of September 15, 1964, agreed to maintain the status quo pending further negotiations. This agreement operated to bring about a cancellation of a strike which the Union was then threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">There followed a succession of efforts to reach agreements, all without success, and finally, about June 2, 1965, the Union notified the Mediation Board that because of the railroad\u2019s \u201crefusal to bargain realistically on our Section 6 notice of August 3, 1964,\u201d the Union had authority to strike. The Mediation Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>notified the railroad of this, and the Union notified the railroad it would strike on June 7, 1965. On June 3, 1965, the railroad submitted its version of the dispute to a Special Board of Adjustment which the parties had set up by agreement in October 1961. When the Union objected to the submission of the dispute to such Special Board the railroad submitted the stated dispute to the National Adjustment Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">It is the railroad\u2019s position that \u201cthis dispute was and is one involving only the interpretation of an existing agreement\u201d between the parties, as set forth in Article II, Section 1 of the June 25, 1964 White House Agreement; hence, it is a \u201cminor dispute\u201d which the Adjustment Board had jurisdiction to determine by an award which would be final and binding upon both parties. It follows, the railroad says, and the trial court held, that the strike was \u201cunlawful and enjoin-able.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">If the dispute here involved was a \u201cmajor\u201d one, the strike was not subject to injunction. As we noted in Butte, Anaconda &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of L. F. &amp; E., supra, at p. 58, \u201cMajor disputes go first to mediation before the National Mediation Board; if that fails, then to acceptance or rejection of arbitration ; and finally to possible presidential intervention. If all this fails, compulsory processes are at an end, and either party may resort to self-help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We are thus confronted with the single question, whether this case involves a \u201cmajor\u201d or a \u201cminor\u201d dispute. It may be assumed, but without deciding, that both parties might have agreed to submit to the Adjustment Board the simple question as to the meaning, or proper interpretation, of what would be \u201csuitable lodging or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof.\u201d But the Union had the right, if it chose, to seek an addition of new provisions to this part of the White House Agreement. The Railway Labor Act contemplates such changes in or additions to agreements. Section 6 of the Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156) is entitled: \u201cProcedure in changing rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.\u201d The only restrictions there stated are that there should be \u201cthirty days\u2019 written notice of an intended change,\u201d and that if conferences are being held, or if services of the Mediation Board have been requested, the proposed changes shall not go into effect until after a stated period following termination of conferences, or until mediation has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">In our view, there can be no question but that the Union\u2019s notice of August 3, 1964, was a notice of an intended change in the terms of the agreement. That it was so intended is made plain by its recital that it was proposed \u201cthat an agreement be reached in accord with Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act.\u201d This notice did not purport to be a proposed interpretation of the earlier Article II, Section 1; its proposals are obviously new arrangements. That Article II, Section 1 contemplated that there would be some new provisions made is apparent from its reference to certain terms being \u201cworked out on a local basis.\u201d This seems to us to suggest further negotiations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold this to have been a \u201cmajor\u201d dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The railroad suggests that even if this were a major dispute, yet the Union had no right to resort to self-help by way of strike until mediation through the Mediation Board had been under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>taken, followed by at least an attempt at arbitration under Section 7 (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 157). But the railroad is in no position to make such a contention. The Union made an effort to utilize the procedures of the Mediation Board. In response to the Union\u2019s notice of August 3, 1964, the railroad advised the Union that it considered that notice improper, indeed a \u201cspecific violation of the Agreement.\u201d In response to an inquiry by the Mediation Board as to its views of the Union\u2019s invocation of mediation, the railroad replied that it was continuing negotiations concerning the dispute. Later, in response to a similar inquiry by the Mediation Board, the railroad asserted that the Union\u2019s invocation of mediation pursuant to its \u201cpurported Section 6 notice\u201d was \u201cin clear violation of * * * the Agreement and, consequently, of the Railway Labor Act.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., 321 U.S. 50, 64 S.Ct. 413, 88 L.Ed. 534, is precisely in point here. It forecloses the railroad, which positively rejected mediation, from claiming an injunction against a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">When this opinion came to this point it was circulated. The dissenting opinion followed. The author assumes full responsibility for having through the opinion\u2019s inadequacy evidently led the author of the dissent to misunderstand completely the thrust of the court\u2019s opinion. A reference to the dissent\u2019s concluding paragraphs indicates that the dissent proceeds upon the theory that the primary basis for the court\u2019s opinion is the fact that the Union labeled its notice as one made in accord with \u00a7 6 of the Railway Labor Code. This circumstance is mentioned in the opinion but it concerns no more than the intent with which the Union served its notice; there is no suggestion that its reference to \u00a7 6 determined its character.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We state and reemphasize the following propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">1. The original agreement was no part of the compulsory arbitration arrangement referred to in the cases cited in the earlier portion of this opinion. It was referred to as the \u201cWhite House Agreement\u201d but it had no more impact or finality than any other collective bargaining agreement arrived at through negotiations between union and employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> 2. Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 156) provides for the very thing the Union was seeking here. To use the language of Elgin, J. &amp; E. R. Co. v. Burley, supra, the Union was attempting \u201cthe formation of collective agreements\u201d and making \u201cefforts to secure\u201d something it did not have. The issue was \u201cnot whether an existing agreement controls the controversy.\u201d The Union\u2019s efforts, its disputes, \u201clook to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.\u201d It is immaterial whether the previously existing collective bargaining agreement specifies a particular method of settling disputes such as that found in Article VII, which is quoted in the dissent; such a stipulation, like any other stipulation in a labor agreement, may be amended as positively provided in \u00a7 6, and no act or agreement of the parties may limit, qualify or take away the right of one party to propose or attempt \u201cthe acquisition of rights for the future\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">3. The provisions of \u00a7 1 Article II of the original agreement, quoted above, are so indefinite that it is doubtful if it is susceptible of a meaningful interpretation. The only description it gives of lodging or allowances are found in the words \u201csuitable lodging\u201d and \u201cequitable allowance.\u201d In the nature of the case, these phrases suggest further negotiations between the parties. An adjustment board is in no position to define what .is \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cequitable\u201d. And' the section itself says as much, when it says: \u201cSuitable lodging or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof shall be worked out on a local basis.\u201d \u201cWorked out\u201d surely means \u201cnegotiated for\u201d. And so the Union here, desiring to acquire specific \u201crights for the future\u201d, made this specific proposal in its August 3 notice. It is not suggested that such a change or addition to the agreement could be accomplished by unilateral action. What \u00a7 6 provides for is a means for proposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>a change or, as stated in the Elgin case, supra, a mode for making efforts that \u201clook to the acquisition of rights for the future.\u201d The Mediation Board may attempt to mediate any unresolved dispute over such a proposal (\u00a75; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 155) and attempt to induce the parties to arbitrate, failing which, in the absence of an Emergency Board (\u00a7 10; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 160) the parties are \u201crelegated to self-help\u201d and free to exercise it. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., supra, 372 U.S. at pp. 289-291, 83 S.Ct. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">4. Any other interpretation of the situation here would mean that the Union would be completely at the mercy of the Adjustment Board which would be at liberty under its compulsory arbitration powers to accept and enforce the contentions of the railroad regardless of what the Union may do or say. This is the interpretation insisted on in the dissent. The only reasonable interpretation of the facts and the law here is that the Union is not compelled to leave itself open to compulsory arbitration as to the meaning of indefinite terms like \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cequitable\u201d. Therefore, under \u00a7 6 of the Act the Union may seek a change in the terms of the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">5. That is precisely what the Union sought here. The Union made the proposal which it had the statutory right to do. The proposal was that there be added to the contract which merely called for something \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cequitable\u201d a new provision stating in specific and precise terms just what the Union members should be entitled to in respect to lodging. That what is proposed is not an interpretation but something new is plain from a reading of the terms stated by the Union. These provisions \u201clook to the acquisition of rights for the future\u201d. These new terms called for a \u201clarge single\u201d room; \u201cwell ventilated\u201d rooms; \u201cheated\u201d rooms; \u201cair conditioned\u201d rooms; \u201cwell finished wood or carpeted floors\u201d; \u201ccloset or large locker storage space\u201d; \u201cchairs and dresser\u201d; \u201cstandard bed\u201d; it specified a type of \u201cmattress and springs\u201d, \u201clinen to be changed\u201d, location \u201cnot more than one-quarter miles\u201d, \u201csuitable transportation\u201d, \u201ccall service\u201d, \u201callowance of $6.00\u201d. All these things are foreign to the paragraph of the original agreement which deals with the subject of lodging. In our view this is obviously something new. It is a change of the character contemplated by \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">It appears to be implicit in the dissenting opinion that because of Article VII of the original agreement, or for some other reason, the Union had no right to make or propose a change in the working conditions in the respects here involved. That cannot be.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">It follows from our holding that the dispute here involved was a \u201cmajor\u201d one that the grant of an injunction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. The action was brought by Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway Company, a Washington corporation, Oregon Trunk Railway, a Washington corporation, and Oregon Electric Railway Company,- an Oregon corporation. The last two companies were subsidiaries of the first one named. All three are referred to hereinafter as \u201cthe railroad\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\">. Or where disagreement relates to changes of pay, rules, or working conditions as embodied in existing agreements. See Title 45 U.S.C'. \u00a7 152 Seventh, which reads as follows: \u201cNo carrier, its officers, or agents shall change the rates of pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees, as a class, as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in section 156 of this title.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-5\">. The Court described \u201cminor disputes\u201d as follows: \u201cThe second class, however, contemplates the existence of a collective agreement already concluded or, at any rate, a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one. The dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted case. In the latter event the claim is founded upon some incident of the employment relation, or asserted one, independent of those covered by the collective agreement, e. g., claims on account of personal injuries. In either case the claim is to rights accrued, not merely to have new ones created for the future.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. Counsel for the railroad have furnished us with an opinion of the District Court for the District of Minnesota in a case entitled Great Northern Railway Company v. Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, et al., dated March 9, 1966, and so far unreported. In that case, not distinguishable from this one, the court granted an injunction for reasons similar to those stated by the court below. Our decision here discloses that we cannot agree with that decision either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\">. This is readily understood when we recall that the \u201cWhite House Agreement\u201d as framed was nation-wide covering many carriers. The possible desirability of modifications on separate railroad systems seems apparent. Indeed, the very loose and very general language of the earlier agreement does not readily lend itself to \u201cinterpretation\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b154-11\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">I dissent. In my opinion the dispute is a minor dispute falling under section 3, not a major dispute falling under section 6. I cannot quarrel with my brother Pope\u2019s opinion as an exercise in judicial logic. It says that the union\u2019s notice of August 3, which refers to section 6 of the Act, sought \u201can intended change in agreements affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions\u201d (section 6). Hence a dispute falling within section 6 was created. My difficulty is with his premise. It is a too simple solution of a complex problem. It seems to me to disregard what I consider basic, the language and the purpose of the 1964 White House Agreement, as well as the purpose of sections 3 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Two provisions of that agreement, which was a nationwide settlement following threat of a most serious nationwide strike, are particularly pertinent here. With specific reference to the away-from-home expenses of train crews, Article II, Section 1 of the Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">\u201cWhen the carrier ties up a road service crew (except short turnabout passenger crews), or individual members thereof, at a terminal (including tie-up points named by assignment bulletins, or presently listed in schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>agreements, or observed by practice, as regular points for tying up crews) other than the designated home terminal of the crew assignment for four (4) hours or more, each member of the crew so tied up shall be provided suitable lodging at the carrier\u2019s expense or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof. Suitable lodging or an equitable allowance in lieu thereof shall be worked out on a local basis. The equitable allowance shall be provided only if it is not reasonably possible to provide lodging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><em>\u201cIf </em>an allowance is being made in lieu of lodging as well as other considerations under provisions of existing agreements, the amount attributed only to lodging shall be removed if suitable lodging is supplied, or offset against an equivalent allowance. This shall be worked out on a local basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cThe provisions of this section shall be made effective at a date no later than 30 days following the effective date of this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This was as definite a settlement of this issue, on a national basis, as could be made. Local conditions vary widely; therefore this provision was to be \u201cworked out\u201d locally. But there is no indication that these matters were to be \u201cworked out\u201d outside the definitions and limitations laid down in the agreement itself : \u201csuitable lodging\u201d or an \u201cequitable allowance,\u201d and the latter \u201conly if it is not reasonably possible to provide lodging,\u201d plus a requirement that existing allowance in lieu of lodging is to be removed if \u201csuitable\u201d lodging is supplied. Under the agreement the carrier is required to provide lodging or an allowance. All that remains is to determine what lodging is \u201csuitable\u201d and \u201creasonably possible to provide,\u201d and what allowance is \u201cequitable.\u201d Surely this requires that when the parties undertake to work these matters out on a local basis, they do so within those definitions and limitations. To say that defining what lodging is \u201csuitable\u201d and what allowance is \u201cequitable\u201d under a given set of circumstances is not \u201cinterpretation\u201d within the meaning of section 3, is to' me a far too restrictive view of what \u201cinterpretation\u201d means, in the context in which it is used in section 3. And to say that working out these matters is not \u201capplication\u201d within the meaning of section 3, is also, to me, a far too restrictive view of what \u201capplication\u201d means in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">I think that the parties to the White House Agreement intended that this type of dispute be a section 3 dispute. Article VII of that agreement provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201cAny dispute involving the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be settled by the parties in accordance with the established procedures therefor, <em>including the creation of Special Boards of Adjustment and other procedures of Section 3 of the Railway Labor Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">What happened here is completely consistent with an attempt to interpret and apply Article II, Section 1 of the Agreement. Being unable to reach an agreement as to what lodging was \u201csuitable\u201d and what allowance was \u201cequitable,\u201d the carrier, by its July 24 notice, put into effect its version, which states what accommodations it will provide and what allowance in lieu thereof it will pay. The union\u2019s August 3 notice, while stated to be \u201cin accord with section 6\u201d, is in fact no more than a statement of its version of what shall constitute \u201cacceptable suitable lodging\u201d and what shall be \u201can equitable allowance.\u201d These are the terms used by the union. They are also the terms used in Article II, section 1. They are nothing but an attempt to interpret and apply the White House Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The reference in the union\u2019s notice to section 6, when the notice itself discloses that that section is not applicable, cannot, in my opinion, change what is in fact a section 3 dispute into a section 6 dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is because section 6 is ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>plicable only if there is to be a <em>\u201cchange in agreements </em>affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions\u201d (emphasis added). Here the union can perhaps be said to have sought a change in \u201crules\u201d or \u201cworking conditions,\u201d and even in \u201crates of pay\u201d as to the in lieu allowance. But it sought them <em>within </em>the White House Agreement: it sought interpretation and application of that agreement; it did not seek a \u201cchange in [that] agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">I think that it is a disservice to the cause of peaceful settlement of railway labor disputes, as carefully worked out in section 3, to hold that a union can so easily escape its obligations by merely labelling a section 3 dispute a section 6 dispute. I also think that in the White House Agreement both parties agreed and intended that this dispute be a section 3 dispute, as is witnessed by Article VII. I do not think that the union should now be permitted, by a mere verbal device, to repudiate and dispute so important an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. \u201cThe voice is Jacob\u2019s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\u201d (Genesis XXVII, 22).
