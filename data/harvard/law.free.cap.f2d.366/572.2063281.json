Walter Simmons, brought this diversity action to recover upon an \u201cAirline Pilot Occupational Disability Policy\u201d issued by defendant, Orion Insurance Company, Ltd. Defendant denied liability and pleaded fraudulent misrepresentation by Simmons in describing the state of his health, which voided the certificate of insurance. The case was fried without a jury, and upon finding that plaintiff was not and never had been disabled the court held for defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Simmons\u2019 application for this insurance was filed on August 31, 1960 and <em>inter alia </em>represented that he was then in good health and knew of no disease or infirmity that might give rise to future claims. Based upon this representation, the policy was issued without medical examination, effective October 1, I960.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">At the time of application Simmons had an airman\u2019s medical certificate, but before the effective date of the insurance he took a leave of absence from his employer and subsequently lost the medical certificate which he was never able to renew. Simmons\u2019 medical rejection by the Federal Aviation Agency was ultimately affirmed on the basis of a history of chronic alcoholism. This decision was reported to Simmons by letter of November 13, 1963, after this suit had been instituted and was the first mention of alcoholism as the reason for rejection of the medical certificate. Simmons made no allegation in his complaint of disability due to this cause. Prior to final rejection of the medical certificate and institution of this suit, Simmons had made two reports to defendant, one indicating a temporary back condition and the other a heart condition characterized by Simmons as a \u201cfallacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">Simmons and his physician were the only witnesses testifying at trial. Additionally received in evidence were interrogatories, medical reports and exhibits consisting of correspondence with FAA and between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">Although subsidiary issues are raised, the crux of this case is whether, during the period of valid existence of the contract, Simmons sustained an injury, sickness or disease resulting in permanent disability covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">On February 3, 1961, Simmons reported that his medical certificate was not renewed due to a chronic back strain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, Simmons testified that he had had no trouble with this back since March or April, 1961, and that he had been engaged in driving a taxicab as much as ten to twelve hours per day without experiencing any back difficulty. He testified that the back condition had cleared up and \u201c [it] has no bearing upon the case whatsoever.\u201d Simmons\u2019 physician described Simmons\u2019 back condition as \u201cmostly a matter of muscle strain\u201d and not permanent or disabling, which was corrected by June, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-21\">Simmons\u2019 second report to defendant on October 8, 1962 indicated a \u201ccoronary insufficiency,\u201d the onset of which oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>eurred September 7, 1960, before the effective date of the insurance. Simmons testified that he never had a coronary insufficiency; that the doctor\u2019s indication of such ailment was a fallacy; and he was \u201cnot disabled from flying an airplane because of coronary insufficiency.\u201d Simmons\u2019 physician corroborated this testimony as did a subseqent examination by FAA medical men.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Simmons categorically denied that he was or ever had been an alcoholic; that he never used alcohol to excess; and that no such condition disabled him from flying an airplane. He explained the FAA report as being based on false information furnished by neighbors jealous of his affluence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Additionally, Simmons denied being disabled for any physical or mental reason from flying an airplane:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cQ. Then you are not disabled from flying an airplane for any physical or mental reason, are you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cQ. And the only reason you say you cannot fly an airplane is because the FAA has refused to issue you a medical certificate based on grounds that are not true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Based on Simmons\u2019 testimony, the trial court found \u201cthe plaintiff at the trial stated he was not disabled and never has been. The court, accordingly, finds the plaintiff was not and never has been disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\"> Upon the record evidence, Simmons has completely failed to discharge his burden of proving his loss was due to an insurable cause. Indeed, his own testimony refutes it. The policy insured against occupational disability occasioned by accidental injury or sickness or disease occurring during its valid existence \u2014not against loss of license based on allegedly false findings by the FAA. The general rule is that an insured has the burden of proving that the loss occurred from causes within the terms of the policy. See and compare Wilson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 250 F.2d 649 (8th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">In any event, we as a reviewing court must affirm the trial court on this fact issue unless it is clearly \u201cwithout substantial evidentiary support or [was] induced by an erroneous view of the law.\u201d Cole v. Neaf, 334 F.2d 326, 329 (8th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">We find no merit in Simmons\u2019 contention that disability should be found in government reports rejecting his medical license. These reports are not detailed and contain only the ultimate conclusion of a history of chronic alcoholism. In addition to Simmons\u2019 denial of this condition, which the trial court had a right to credit, there is no indication that the disability did not antedate the effective date of the policy. There is a medical report in the record from the Trinity Lutheran Hospital of Kansas City revealing that Simmons was admitted there \u201cpartially\u201d drunk on March 15,1958- \u2014 -long before the application for insurance. This report further revealed that Simmons had been drinking excessively for the past several weeks; that he suffered hypertrophic gastritis due to excessive alcoholic ingestion, and on account thereof he could not eat normally and was worried about the possibility of having cirrhosis of the liver.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">The insurance policy provided for resort to medical referees but neither party utilized this provision. However, defendant\u2019s failure to invoke this clause does not excuse Simmons from proving disability under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\"> Finally, Simmons asserts that because defendant never attempted to prove the fraud defense, its position was inconsistent. Since Simmons did not discharge his burden of proof, it was not necessary for defendant to adduce evidence. It is entirely proper for a defendant to make diverse and separate defenses and rely on either or all. Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(e) (2). As stated in Citizens and Southern Nat. Bank v. American Surety Co. of New York, 347 F.2d 18, 23 (5th Cir. 1965), \u201c * * * the short answer to the defendant\u2019s argument is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require consistency of pleadings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">. The coverage clause of the policy provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cThe Company agrees that if, at any time during the valid period of this certificate, the insured shall sustain any accidental bodily injury or contract any sickness or disease, including natural deterioration (hereinafter referred to as disability) which shall result in the Insured being permanently prevented from carrying on his occupation, the Company will pay to the Insured the principal sum within seven days after proof of permanent disability to the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-22\">.
