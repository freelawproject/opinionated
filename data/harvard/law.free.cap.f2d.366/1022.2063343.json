First use August 10, 1947, is alleged. The goods are \u201cchildren\u2019s dresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">The reference on which the application was rejected is a registration under the 1905 Act of a mark for \u201ccotton piece goods, linen piece goods, and towelling,\u201d Reg. No. 177,366 of December 18, 1923. This registration, to The Carl Company, of Schenectady, N. Y., has been twice renewed and was republished under section 12(c) of the 1946 Act, and under the latter act an affidavit under section 8 has been accepted and an affidavit under section 15 filed. The registered mark is also a composite mark consisting of a rectangular picture showing a hand pouring cream from a pitcher into a dish of cut-up peaches partly submerged, beside which is a bowl of sugar and a half peach, the upper left portion of the rectangle being prominently occupied by the words \u201cPEACHES and CREAM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEmq\">The examiner refused registration under section 2(d) on the ground of likelihood of confusion and wrote an extensive Answer fully explaining her reasons. The board affirmed in an opinion which approved the examiner\u2019s reasons and answered appellant\u2019s principal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">Having fully considered appellant\u2019s arguments in this court, we find no fault with the board\u2019s decision and affirm it on the basis of the reasoning in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\"> The only observation we would add to it is that where <em>likelihood </em>of confusion, mistake, or deception, is as clear as it is in this case \u2014 albeit that is admittedly a subjective judgment \u2014 we cannot agree with appellant that \u201cthe public interest and the rights of the parties are better served\u201d by passing the application to publication in order to see whether the owner of the reference registration will oppose. Not only does the act impose on the Patent Office and on us the duty to make the subjective judgment but it is intended, we feel, to afford rights to registrants without constantly subjecting them to the financial and other burdens of opposition proceedings. Appellant has not made out the kind of a case in which we feel such a possible burden should be placed on the registrant. The earlier user and earlier registrant would be entitled to the benefit of any doubt on this score. But we have no doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">. The writer\u2019s views as expressed in his concurring opinion in In re National Distillers &amp; Chem. Corp., 297 F.2d 941, 49 CCPA 854 (1962) (the Merito ease), strongly urged upon us in appellant\u2019s brief, are from such a very different context as not to be pertinent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
