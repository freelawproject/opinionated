The witnesses testified further that they knew of no one else who was connected with their wagers, and that when they placed their bets by telephone, they identified themselves with their initials and appellant\u2019s name, e. g., \u201cE. B. for Sam [appellant].\u201d Cross examination established that appellant did not personally receive any of these telephone calls. There was further testimony to the effect that appellant was familiar with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">Appellant took the stand and admitted settling accounts with the above five witnesses, but denied that he was acting on his own behalf. He testified that he was performing the said functions for one Slackman and that he was not reimbursed for his troubles. He denied having \u201caccepted\u201d any wagers and further denied having any proprietary interest in the bookmaking business of Slackman. Judge Rayfiel termed appellant\u2019s testimony as unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">Appellant argues that, under the terminology adopted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Calamaro, 354 U.S. 351, 77 S.Ct. 1138, 1 L.Ed.2d 1394 (1957), he was a mere \u201cpick-up man\u201d and was consequently not subject to the special tax and did not come within the special registration provisions of the Code. This Court has recently held that direct evidence of a proprietary interest in a gambling scheme is not necessary to hold a defendant subject to the instant Code sections. United States v. Marquez, 332 F.2d 162 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 890, 85 S.Ct. 162, 13 L.Ed.2d 94 (1964). We believe that the evidence introduced by the Government was clearly sufficient to establish that appellant, was more than a mere \u201cpick-up man\u201d and. was thus guilty of non-compliance with Sections 4411 and 4412(a) of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
