McShane, appearing for himself and purporting to act in behalf of others, filed what is designated as a \u201cClass Action for Return of Children Kidnapped by Foreign Pirates and Damages.\u201d In the complaint filed in the District Court, the defendants are not adequately identified, although it appears that the alleged wrongful acts were committed by the Department of State and the Department of Justice of the United States, the Scottish Law Society, the English Law Society, and the London, England, office of the Rhodesian Immigration Authority. Additional defendants are named in the caption of the brief filed in our court, and these include the Polish Court of Warsaw, Poland, and the Canadian Immigration and Naturalization Authority. It is also sought in our court that there be joined as defendants the State of California, the State of Iowa, Edmund G. Brown, Governor of the State of California, Thomas G. Lynch, Attorney General of the State of California, and Elizabeth B. Palmer, Deputy Attorney General of the State of California. These latter named have filed a \u201cspecial appearance only\u201d for the purpose of opposing the motion for their joinder as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">There is some uncertainty as to the relief which is sought. The original complaint \u201casks the sum of one million dollars per day damages against the defendants as token damages in the percentages against the defendants as specified by the court, to be retroactive from * * * November 15, 1953 * * * \u201d In our court, it is asked that there be a judgment \u201cagainst the foreign nations who are still retaining America\u2019s children within their boundaries * * \u201cthat damages in the amounts of one million dollars per day should be apid [sic] to the appellants for the loss of their children,\u201d and that certain bonds be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-20\">The thrust of the grievances originally alleged is that various lawyers, foreign countries, and foreign courts have committed acts affecting the custody of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>number <em>of </em>American children, that such acts have been unlawful and criminal, and that various agencies of the United States, various officials of the United States, three American States and certain officials of one of those states have unlawfully failed and neglected to take steps to correct the wrongs alleged to have been inflicted by the foreign countries and the officials, judges, and attorneys of those countries. It is said that \u201cpiracy\u201d has been committed and that American children have been \u201ckidnapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Since the day of oral argument in our court, McShane has forwarded a number of documents which we have lodged with our Clerk and not filed. Some of the documents represent attempts to join, as additional appellants, certain persons who were not plaintiffs below. This may not be done, and it is unnecessary for us to describe wrongs alleged to have been done to all these particular individuals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Treating some of the documents as motions to join additional persons as appellants, the motions must be denied. One cannot be an appellant here unless he has been a party in the court below and has taken the prescribed steps for the perfection of his appeal. See Payne v. Niles, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 219, 221, 15 L.Ed. 895, 896 (1857); Cook &amp; Sons Equipment, Inc. v. Killen, 277 F.2d 607, 609 (9th Cir. 1960); Fed.R.Civ.P. 73 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">It appears that the appellant McShane has undertaken to act in behalf of persons, naming them in this court and in the court below, without the authorization or knowledge or consent of at least some of these persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McShane is not an attorney. While he may appear in propria persona in his own behalf (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654), that privilege is personal to him. He has no authority to appear as an attorney for others than himself. Russell v. United States, 308 F.2d 78, 79 (9th Cir. 1962); Collins v. O\u2019Brien, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 208 F.2d 44, 45 (1953), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 944, 74 S.Ct. 640, 98 L.Ed. 1092 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number> The District Court, on its own motion, dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. This was proper. Inasmuch as the suit was against the United States, it was incumbent upon the appellant to bring his claim within some statute authorizing the suit. \u201cAs the United States are not suabl\u00e9 of common right, the party who institutes such suit must bring his case within the authority of some act of Congress, or the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over it.\u201d United States v. Clarke, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 436, 443, 8 L.Ed. 1001 (1834). Appellant has not directed our attention to any such authority, and we can discover none.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">It is conceded that the suit cannot be prosecuted unless the United States is a party defendant. The appellant writes, \u201cthe USA is an <em>indispensable party </em>to this case through negligence, apathy, dereliction of sworn duty to plaintiffs and to young children, failing to uphold the passports, arrogance and derogation of duty and by failing to act with the plaintiffs * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Since the United States has not consented to be sued in a case such as this, and since it is an \u201cindispensable party\u201d, it is not necessary for us to examine the problems involving the attempt to sue individual states and their officers. See U.S.Const., Amend. XI; Comment, Private Suits Against States in the Federal Courts, 33 U.Chi.L.Rev. 331 (1966). Nor do we see the need to consider the attempt to sue foreign governments and their officers and citizens and to bring them within the jurisdiction of a court of the United States. See Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 589, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014 (1943); Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304 U.S. 126, 134, 58 S.Ct. 785, 82 L.Ed. 1224 (1938); Compania Espanola v. The Navemer, 303 U.S. 68, 74, 58 S.Ct. 432, 82 L.Ed. 667 (1938); Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, 271 U.S. 562, 577, 46 S.Ct. 611, 70 L.Ed. 1088 (1926); The Exchange, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116, 3 L.Ed. 287 (1812).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">When a father and mother become separated, one of them often becomes far removed from the children. The consequent despair of a worthy, estranged parent is readily understandable, but it cannot influence objective review or affect the court\u2019s obligation to perform its duty within the limitations of its authorized judicial power.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\">. As an example, we are asked by McShane to join a German-born twenty-year-old girl as an additional appellant \u201cTO SECURE THE LEGAL PARENT AND CHILD RELATIONSHIP DENIED BY CRIMINAL MALPRACTICE IN LAWS OF NATIONS AND OFFICIALS WHO TREAT THE APPELLANTS WITH SILENCE AND COVERUPS TO HIDE THEIR GROSS ERRORS AND PREMEDITATED INFLICTION OF HARM, AND OTHER AID AND ASSISTANCE BY ORDERS OF THE COURT IN THIS SERIOUS CLASS ACTION.\u201d McShane represents that the girl\u2019s mother is German and that her father is an American who was stationed in Germany in 1945. He charges further that the proposed appellant \u201cshould be a United States Citizen, since her father was a native-born, domiciled, taxpaying, fighting serviceman of the United States. * * and that \u201cShe is entitled to know him [her father], to know where he is, to see him, and he is entitled to know her. It is added that due to a \u2018law\u2019 created by politicains [sic] for no known sane reason, it was forbidden for USA servicemen to marry German women at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Our court is not the proper place first to determine the proposed appellant\u2019s asserted claim of citizenship. Under the facts as stated, she may already be a citizen of the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(7)', 1401a, 1452. The matter should be presented to the appropriate immigration authorities. As to specific relief which, through appellant McShane, she claims for herself and her father, we can discover no authorized power of our court \u201cto order all officialdom to assist her to find her father, * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\">.
