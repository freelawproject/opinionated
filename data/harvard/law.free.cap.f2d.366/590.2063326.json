In the preamble the ordinance recites the conclusion of the City Council that motion pictures \u201care one of the contributing causes to juvenile delinquency, sexually promiscuous behavior, and along with other factors, tend to incite criminal behavior on the part of young persons. * * * \u201d It is also noted that a great portion of the movies shown are available for screening more than thirty days prior to their initial exhibition and that the benefits of classification to the public will far exceed the burden placed on the motion picture industry. \u201cNot suitable for young persons\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201c(1) Describing or portraying brutality, criminal violence or depravity in such manner as to be, in the judgment of the Board, likely to incite or encourage crime or delinquency on the part of young persons; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcI\">\u201c(2) Describing or portraying nudity beyond the customary limits of candor in the community, or sexual promiscuity or extramarital or abnormal sexual relations in such a manner as to be, in the judgment of the Board, likely to incite or encourage delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons or to appeal to their prurient interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">\u201cA film shall be considered \u2018likely to incite or encourage\u2019 crime delinquency or sexual promiscuity on the part of young persons, if, in the judgment of the Board, there is a substantial probability that it will create the impression on young persons that such conduct is profitable, desirable, acceptable, respectable, praiseworthy or commonly accepted. A film shall be considered as appealing to \u2018prurient interest\u2019 of young persons, if in the judgment of the Board, its calculated or dominant effect on young persons is substantially to arouse sexual desire. In determining whether a film is \u2018not suitable for young persons,\u2019 the Board shall consider the film as a whole, rather than isolated portions, and shall determine whether its harmful effects outweigh artistic or educational values such film may have for young persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Exhibitors are required to submit a proposed classification and a summary of the film\u2019s plot to the nine-member Board. If the Board is not satisfied with the proposed classification, a showing of the film is arranged. The details of the classification procedure, time limits and provisions for appeal will be discussed later.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">It is a violation of the ordinance to exhibit any film which has not been classified. If a film has been found not suitable for young persons, it is unlawful to fail to state the classification in any advertisement; to fail to post the classification prominently in front of the theatre; knowingly to sell or give a ticket to any young person or to permit one to view the film and to exhibit such a film with one classified as suitable for young persons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A young person accompanied by his parent, guardian or spouse may view any film, whatever its classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">The ordinance provides for the issuance of a license to entitle the holder to exhibit films classified as not suitable for young persons and revocation of that license for up to one year for repeated violations of the ordinance or for failure to exercise ordinary diligence to determine those below the age of sixteen. Violation of any provision of the ordinance is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up to $200.00 for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">A group of Dallas exhibitors filed a complaint in federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>dinance in whole or part was unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent the City from enforcing the ordinance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Judge Hughes concluded that the City had the power to pass such an ordinance, that Article 527 of Vernon\u2019s Ann. Texas Penal Code prohibiting obscene pictures does not prevent this type of regulation by the City, that the classification was reasonable in order to prevent the incitement of juvenile crime and delinquency, and that a film may be obscene when viewed by young people although not obscene as to adults. She found the phrase \u201cNot suitable for young persons\u201d to be valid only to the extent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">\u201cthat such films are obscene when viewed by an audience of young persons. * * * A film that is obscene when viewed by an audience of young persons is one which, to the average young person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest, substantially goes beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters to the average young person, and is utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AID\">Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, N.D. Texas 1965, 249 F.Supp. 19, 24. The procedure for review of the Board\u2019s classifications was found to be sufficient to insure the exhibitors\u2019 right to a speedy determination of the issues and to guarantee due process of law. The District Court, however, held the clause providing for revocation of the exhibitor\u2019s license to show films classified as not suitable for young persons invalid since it would deny exhibitors the right to show films not obscene as to adults.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Both the exhibitors and the City have appealed. A number of national distributors of films have been allowed to join the exhibitors on appeal as amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Before examining the details of the Dallas ordinance, we must first decide the basic question of whether any movie classification ordinance may be found valid. Our study of the Supreme Court opinions indicates an affirmative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">When the Court first held that motion pictures were protected by the First Amendment in Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 1952, 343 U.S. 495, 502-503, 72 S.Ct. 777, 780-781, 96 L.Ed. 1098, 1106, it considered the argument that \u201cmotion pictures possess a greater capacity for evil, particularly among the youth of a community, than other modes of expression.\u201d Its conclusion was that \u201c[i]f there be capacity for evil it may be relevant in determining the permissible scope of community control, but it does not authorize substantially unbridled censorship * * The Court also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">\u201cTo hold that liberty of expression by means of motion pictures is guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, however, is not the end of our problem. It does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places. That much is evident from the series of decisions of this Court with respect to other media of communication of ideas. Nor does it follow that motion pictures are necessarily subject to the precise rules governing any other particular method of expression. Each method tends to present its own peculiar problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">In Butler v. State of Michigan, 1957, 352 U.S. 380, 77 S.Ct. 524, 1 L.Ed.2d 412, the Court found unconstitutional a Michigan statute which made the distribution to the general public of publications \u201ctending to the corruption of the morals of youth\u201d a misdemeanor. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>concluded that \u201cquarantining the general reading public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence * * * [sjurely * * * is to burn the house to roast the pig.\u201d It is significant that the statute was invalidated solely because it reduced adults to reading material fit for juveniles. The recognition by the Court that the state had failed to reasonably restrict its legislation \u201cto the evil with which it is said to deal\u201d suggests the probable validity of a statute which is properly drawn to protect children without restricting First Amendment rights of adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">A few months after the decision in <em>Butler, </em>the Court handed down the landmark case of Roth v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498, holding obscenity outside the protection of the First Amendment and establishing the standard for judging obscenity- \u2014 \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d In adopting this test, the Court specifically rejected the <em>Hicklin </em>test<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which judged obscenity by the effect of an isolated passage upon particularly susceptible persons. Id. at 489, 77 S.Ct. at 1311, 1 L.Ed.2d at 1509.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The <em>Roth </em>doctrine was reaffirmed and clarified in Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 1964, 378 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793. The Court noted that \u201ca work cannot be proscribed unless it is \u2018utterly\u2019 without social importance * * * \u201d and \u201c \u2018goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 191, 84 S.Ct. at 1680, 12 L.Ed.2d at 800. The \u201ccommunity\u201d in the <em>Roth </em>test was described as the \u201csociety at large\u201d rather than the inhabitants of a particular state or locale. The important portion of the opinion <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for our present consideration, however, is a paragraph by Justice Brennan which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHQ\">\u201cWe recognize the legitimate and indeed exigent interest of States and localities throughout the Nation in preventing the dissemination of material deemed harmful to children. But that interest does not justify a total suppression of such material, the effect of which would be to \u2018reduce the adult population * * * to reading only what is fit for children.\u2019 Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383, 77 S.Ct. 524, 526. <em>State and local authorities might well consider whether their objectives in this area would be better served by laws aimed specifically at preventing distribution of objectionable material to children, rather than at totally prohibiting its dissemination. </em>[footnote: See State v. Settle, 90 R.I. 195, 156 A.2d 921 (1959)] Since the present conviction is based upon exhibition of the film to the public at large and not upon its exhibition to children, the judgment must be reviewed under the strict standard applicable in determining the scope of the expression that is protected by the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>378 U.S. at 195, 84 S.Ct. at 1682, 12 L.Ed. 2d at 802. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The Rhode Island case, State v. Settle, supra, which the Court cites with approval, upheld a conviction under a statute making the sale of pornographic material to persons under the age of eighteen a crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Although only Justice Goldberg joined in Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion, three other Justices indicated that they would uphold a statute aimed at the protection of children without a resulting restriction on the adult population. Chief Justice Warren, in an opinion joined by Justice Clark, observed that a work may be \u201cinoffensive under most circumstances but, at the same time, \u2018obscene\u2019 in the extreme when sold or displayed to children.\u201d Id. at 201, 84 S.Ct. at 1685, 12 L.Ed.2d at 806. Justice Harlan made it clear that he favors allowing the state a wide scope in the field of regulating the distribution of obscene materials to children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. at 203-204, 84 S.Ct. at 1686-1687, 12 L.Ed. 2d at 807. Thus, it appears that at least five of the Justices involved in <em>Jacobellis </em>believe that the state may protect children from the distribution of material which could not be classified as obscene as to adults.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">This position indicates an acceptance of the concept of \u201cvariable obscenity\u201d as contrasted with \u201cconstant obscenity.\u201d Constant obscenity assumes that \u201cobscenity is an inherent quality of material that renders it unfit for everyone in all circumstances. * * * \u201d Lockhart &amp; McClure, Censorship of Obscenity: The Developing Constitutional Standards, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 5, 85 (1960); see Gerber, A Suggested Solution to the Riddle of Obscenity, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 834, 848-849 (1964); Note, \u201cFor Adults Only\u201d: The Constitutionality of Governmental Film Censorship by Age Classification, 69 Yale L.J. 141 (1959). On the other hand, variable obscenity rejects the idea of obscenity as inherent in the material and determines obscenity \u201cby its appeal to and effect upon the audience to which the material is primarily directed.\u201d Lock-hart &amp; McClure, supra, at 85. Under constant obscenity, a work not obscene as to society at large by definition could not be found to be obscene as to any particular group such as children. Variable obscenity, however, permits a finding that material is obscene when distributed to one group although it would not be held obscene if it were primarily distributed to another group. For example, hard-core pornography would not be constitutionally \u201cobscene\u201d if directed exclusively to scientists for research purposes, even though such materials would clearly be obscene if distributed to the general public. United States v. 31 Photographs, S.D.N.Y.1957, 156 F.Supp. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Any doubt as to the Court\u2019s position on variable obscenity was dispelled by the recent trilogy of obscenity cases: Ginzburg v. United States, 1966, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 16 L.Ed.2d 31; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Mishkin v. State of New York, 1966, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16 L.Ed.2d 56; and A Book, etc. v. Attorney General, 1966, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed. 2d 1. While assuming in <em>Ginzburg </em>that the publications were not obscene in other contexts, the Court upheld a conviction on evidence of \u201cexploitation of interests in titillation by pornography * * * with respect to material lending itself to such exploitation through pervasive treatment or description of sexual matters * * 383 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 950, 16 L.Ed.2d at 41. Thus the Court rejected the proposition that obscenity is a matter inherent in the publication under all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Mishkin v. State of New York, supra, involves a situation more closely analogous to our present consideration. Mishkin induced the publication and sale of a number of books \u201cdepicting various deviant sexual practices, such as flagellation, fetishism, and lesbianism * * * \u201d His defense to the resulting obscenity prosecution was that these books did not appeal to the prurient interest of the \u201caverage\u201d person and that the State had therefore failed to satisfy the requirements of the <em>Roth </em>test. In rejecting this contention, the Court made a significant adjustment of the Roth-prurient-appeal test in adopting a variable-obscenity approach to the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\"><em>\u201cWhere the material is designed for and primarily disseminated to a clearly defined deviant sexual group, rather than the public at large, the prwrientappeal requirement of the Roth test is satisfied if the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex of the members of that group. </em>The reference to the \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 person in <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 489-490, 77 S.Ct. at 1311, does not foreclose this holding, [citing Lockhart and McClure\u2019s article, supra]. In regard to the prurient-appeal requirement, the concept of the \u2018average\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 person was employed in <em>Roth </em>to serve the essentially negative purpose of expressing our rejection of that aspect of the <em>Hicklin </em>test * * * that made the impact on the most susceptible person determinative. We adjust the prurient-appeal requirement to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sexual interests of its intended and probable recipient group; and since our holding requires that the recipient group be defined with more specificity than in terms of sexually immature persons, it also avoids the inadequacy of the most-susceptible-person facet of the <em>Hicklin </em>test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">383 U.S. at 508, 86 S.Ct. at 963-964, 16 L.Ed.2d at 62. (Emphasis added.) The determination that the obscenity of material may be measured by its appeal to the prurient interest of its intended and probable recipient group is a repudiation of the basic concept of the constant obscenity theory and clearly marks the adoption of the variable obscenity doctrine by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> The acceptance of this variable obscenity approach indicates that the Supreme Court would uphold a properly drawn statute designed to regulate material obscene as to children so long as the legislation does not have the effect of reducing adults to a level of consumption fit for children. See Butler v. State of Michigan, supra. The motion picture classification statute presents a prime example of a means of protecting children without / appreciably restricting adults. Lockhart and McClure in their excellent article on the censorship of obscenity<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> discussed the effects of such classification statutes and noted that they may indirectly prevent adults from seeing \u201cAdults Only\u201d films since the economic loss resulting from the exclusion of children from the audience may deter the production and exhibition of such movies. The same economic deterrent, however, is present when the general public is excluded from the audience which may properly utilize certain pornographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>works suitable only for scientific research. Cf. United States v. 31 Photographs, supra; Ginzburg v. United States, supra, 383 U.S. at 471-475, 86 S.Ct. at 948-949, 16 L.Ed.2d at 38-40. For this reason we conclude, as did Lock-hart and McClure, that a properly drafted .classification statute is a constitutional method of protecting children from motion pictures obscene as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The determination that a constitutional classification statute may be drawn brings us to the consideration of the Dallas ordinance presented here. It seeks to classify motion pictures as not suitable for young persons when they describe or portray certain levels of brutality, criminal violence, depravity, nudity, sexual promiscuity and extra-marital or abnormal sexual relations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As noted earlier, Judge Hughes upheld the ordinance only to the extent \u201cthat such films are obscene when viewed by an audience of young persons.\u201d The classification standard, as restricted by Judge Hughes, clearly complies with the concepts of variable obscenity as adopted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> The more difficult question is whether the classification standard may go beyond restriction of obscenity to regulate the showing of movies depicting such things as excessive brutality and criminal violence as the Dallas ordinance seeks to do. Although numerous attempts to employ non-obscenity standards have been rejected by the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> those cases do not control this question for they involve total censorship statutes prohibiting the distribution of the offending material rather than limited classification ordinances affecting only those under sixteen years of age. See Note, 69 Yale L.J. 141, 150 (1959). Of course, the principal obstacle to classification based upon standards other than obscenity is the First Amendment, an obstacle not applicable to classification solely on grounds of obscenity. See Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, supra. The City, however, argues that the restriction of the First Amendment rights of minors may be justified by the overriding concern of society for the protection of its youth. This argument finds support in Prince v. Commonwealth of Mass., 1944, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645, which involved a state law prohibiting a parent or guardian from permitting a minor within his control from selling magazines on public streets. Both the child and his guardian who was prosecuted for violating this statute were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and the offense was the sale by the child of pamphlets published by that religious sect. The defense was based solely on freedom of religion under the First Amendment and the parental rights guaranteed by the due process clause. The Court recognized the child\u2019s right to exercise his religion and the parent\u2019s right to train and encourage the child\u2019s religious belief, but concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">\u201c * * * the family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim of religious liberty. * * * And neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth\u2019s well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent\u2019s control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child\u2019s labor, and in many other ways. Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child\u2019s course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">\u201c * * * The catalogue need not be lengthened. <em>It is sufficient to show </em>what indeed appellant hardly disputes, <em>that the state has a wide range of pow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>er for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child\u2019s welfare; and that this includes, to some extent, matters of conscience and religious conviction.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Id. at 166-167, 64 S.Ct. at 442, 88 L.Ed. at 652. (Emphasis added.) The Court conceded that the legislation would have been invalid if applied to the sale of such items by adults but stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2jT\">\u201cthe mere fact a state could not wholly prohibit this form of adult activity * * * does not mean it cannot do so for children. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cThe state\u2019s authority over children\u2019s activities is broader than over like actions of adults. * * * A democratic society rests, for its continuance, upon the healthy, well-rounded growth of young people into full maturity as citizens, with all that implies. It may secure this against impeding restraints and dangers, within a broad range of selection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Id. at 168, 64 S.Ct. at 443, 88 L.Ed. at 653. The restriction of the child\u2019s First Amendment freedom of religion allowed in <em>Prince </em>is analogous to the attempted classification of movies under the Dallas ordinance so as to regulate the child\u2019s First Amendment freedom of speech. Additional support for the City\u2019s position is found in the paragraph quoted from Jacobellis<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which suggests legislation to prevent \u201cthe dissemination of material deemed harmful to childr\u00e9n.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The use of \u201charmful to children\u201d rather than \u201cobscene as to children\u201d may indicate that Justice Brennan envisioned the type of broad legislation found in the Dallas ordinance rather than a restricted obscenity standard. Justice Brennan also stated that, since the statute in <em>Jacobellis </em>was not restricted in its effect to the protection of children, the Court must apply a \u201cstrict standard\u201d in determining the constitutionality of the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">As forceful as these arguments may be for the expansion of the scope of the classification standards, the long history of the misuse of the censorship power convinces us that the standard for classification must be restricted to the control of obscenity. In considering the classification approach, we cannot ignore the activities of the censors in the context of total censorship statutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor can we assume that their level of performance will materially differ in applying broad standards under classification statutes. Because of the very real threat to the adult\u2019s freedom of speech and expression, the Supreme Court has apparently limited censorship affecting adults to a narrowly defined area of obscenity. Although a classification ordinance measuring \u201cobscenity\u201d by its appeal to children rather than by its effect on society in general necessarily affords the censor a broader area of regulation, it does not set him \u201cadrift upon a boundless sea amid a myriad of conflicting currents * * * with no charts\u201d or vest in him \u201cunlimited restraining control over motion pictures * * * \u201d as statutes containing broader standards might do. See Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 1952, 343 U.S. 495, 504-505, 72 S.Ct. 777, 782, 96 L.Ed. 1098, 1107-1108. While we recognize the interest of society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>in protecting children, we find even the child\u2019s freedom of speech too precious to be subjected to the whim of the censor.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Both the exhibitors and the distributors contend that the classification standards of the Dallas ordinance are unconstitutionally vague. Since we have concluded that the District Court was correct in limiting the application of the \u201cnot suitable for young persons\u201d classification to films that are \u201cobscene when viewed by an audience of young persons,\u201d we need not consider the alleged vagueness of provisions of the ordinance which purport to classify on a basis other than obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The Supreme Court considered the \u201cvagueness\u201d argument in <em>Roth </em>in its review of the federal obscenity statute (\u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, or filth * * or other publication of an indecent character\u201d) and a California statute (\u201cobscene or indecent\u201d). It was urged that the statutes did not provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt and therefore violated the constitutional requirements of due process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cMany decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise. This Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \u2018 * * * [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\u2019; all that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices ******* These words, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity, already discussed, give adequate warning of the conduct proscribed and mark \u2018 * * * boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries fairly to administer the law * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">354 U.S. at 491-492, 77 S.Ct. at 1312-1313, 1 L.Ed. at 1510-1511. The classification standard of the Dallas Ordinance as restricted by the District Court<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> conveys the \u201csufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct\u201d required by the Supreme Court in <em>Roth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">The minimum procedural safeguards necessary for a motion picture censorship system to avoid constitutional infirmity were discussed at length by the Supreme Court in Freedman v. State of Maryland, 1965, 380 U.S. 51, 56-61, 85 S.Ct. 734, 738-740, 13 L.Ed.2d 649, 653-656. The Court first noted that \u201c[a]ny system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>sumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d The Court enunciated the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">(1) The censor must have the burden of proving that the film is unprotected expression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">(2) Although advance submission of all films may be required, the procedure must require a judicial determination to impose a valid final restraint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">(3) The exhibitor must be assured that the censor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court to restrain the showing of the film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">(4) Any restraint imposed prior to final judicial determination on the merits must be limited to preservation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">(5) Prompt final judicial decision must be assured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The Court observed that \u201cit is common knowledge that films are scheduled well before actual exhibition. * * * One possible scheme would be to allow the exhibitor or distributor to submit his film early enough to ensure an orderly final disposition of the ease before the scheduled exhibition date \u2014 far enough in advance so that the exhibitor could safely advertise the opening on a normal basis.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Briefly summarized, the Dallas ordinance provides for the following procedures: The exhibitor files a proposed classification prior to exhibition. If the Board fails to act within five days, the proposed classification is considered approved. If the Board is not satisfied, it must view the film at the \u201cearliest time practicable,\u201d give the exhibitor opportunity to support his proposal, and make its decision within two days thereafter. If any exhibitor files notice of non-acceptance of the Board\u2019s classification within two days after its filing, it then becomes the Board\u2019s duty to seek a temporary and permanent injunction from the Dallas district court within three days and to apply for hearing on the temporary injunction within five days. If the exhibitor requests that the matter be considered on the merits of the permanent injunction at the hearing the Board must waive its application for temporary injunction and join the exhibitor\u2019s request. If the injunction is granted and the exhibitor appeals to the Court of Civil Appeals, the Board must waive all statutory notices, file its reply to the exhibitor\u2019s brief within five days, and join the exhibitor in any motion to advance the cause on the docket. Similar provisions apply to appeal by the exhibitor to the Texas Supreme Court and to appeal by the Board from adverse decisions of the district court or the Court of Civil Appeals. If no injunction has been granted within ten days of notice of an exhibitor\u2019s non-acceptance, the Board's order is suspended.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">It seems obvious that this procedure complies with the standards established in <em>Freedman, </em>with the only possible objection being the length of time necessary to get a final adjudication on the merits. The ordinance provides for the Board\u2019s joinder in any motion to advance the case on the court docket and for numerous other devices to expedite the proceedings ; but, of course, the City of Dallas cannot compel the state courts to afford the speedy relief requested.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Judge Hughes found, however, that the Texas courts make it a practice to advance cases involving the public welfare and that final judgment could be obtained from the Texas Supreme Court in less than thirty-five days.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The exhibitors here offered evidence that before the classifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>cation cases the City of Dallas had not been able to get the Court of Civil Appeals to hear an appeal in less than sixty-one days. However, in recent classification cases arising under the Dallas ordinance, that Court has advanced the cases on its docket and, in one case, heard an appeal six days after the filing of the motion to advance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> So long as the courts are willing to cooperate in this manner, <em>Freedman\u2019s </em>requirement for speedy judicial action on the merits and on review are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The intervening distributors complain that the ordinance does not contain provisions to insure them adequate procedural safeguards. <em>Freedman, </em>however, does not require consideration of the distributor in censorship proceedings. It also would appear that the interests of the exhibitor and the distributor in a particular locale are sufficiently similar and that the working relationship between them is sufficiently close to give adequate protection to the distributors.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The exhibitors argue that Article 527 of the Texas Penal Code preempts the field of regulating motion pictures. Although Article 527 does apply to obscene motion pictures, it specifically excludes the type of commercial films which the classification ordinance seeks to regulate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> A similar argument was rejected by the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Janus Films, Inc. v. City of Fort Worth, Tex.Civ.App.1962, 354 S.W.2d 597, 599. Writ of error was refused (no reversible error) by the Texas Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion which noted that appellate review of the trial court\u2019s granting or denying of a temporary injunction is limited to the question of abuse of discretion and that the Court of Civil Appeals should not have gone into the merits of the case. 163 Tex. 616, 358 S.W.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">In Chemline, Inc. v. City of Grand Prairie, 5th Cir. 1966, 364 F.2d 721, this Court recently concluded that the Court of Civil Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Janus Films, </em>although \u201cnot very convincing\u201d in light of the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, controlled the determination of the question under the <em>Erie </em>[Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188] doctrine. Because of the nature of the precedent established by <em>Janus Films, </em>this Court issued the mandate but granted the defendant permission to file a delayed application for rehearing if a Texas appellate decision were subsequently rendered authoritatively contrary to the Court of Civil Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Janus Films.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\"><em>Janus Films, </em>however, is no longer the only Texas authority dealing with Article 527. The Texas Supreme Court has recently refused writ of error (no reversible error) in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, Tex.Civ.App.1966, 402 S.W.2d 770, 776, where the Court of Civil Appeals summarily dismissed the exhibitors\u2019 argument that Article 527 preempted the field of movie regulation. In view of this additional development in Texas law, we conclude that no provision for delayed application for rehearing need be granted as this Court did in Chemline, Inc. v. City of Grand Prairie, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">We have considered the remaining contentions of the parties and find them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>without merit.

The Board shall examine such proposed classification, and if it approves same, shall mark it \u2018approved\u2019 and file it as its own classification order. If the Board fails to act, that is, either file a classification order or hold a hearing within five (5) days after such proposed classification is filed, the proposed classification shall be considered approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">(b) If upon examination of the proposed classification a majority of the Board, is not satisfied that it is proper, the Chairman shall direct the exhibitor to project the film before any five (5) or more members of the Board, at a suitably equipped place and at a specified time, which shall be the earliest time practicable with due regard to the availability of the film. The exhibitor, or his designated representative, may at such time make such statement to the Board in support of his proposed classification and present such testimony as he may desire. Within two (2) days, the Board shall make and file its classification of the film in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">(e) Any initial or subsequent exhibitor may file an application for a change in the classification of any film previously classified. No exhibitor shall be allowed to file more than one (1) application for change of classification of the same film. Such application shall contain a sworn statement of the grounds upon which the application is based. Upon filing of such application, the City Secretary shall bring it immediately to the attention of the Chairman of the Board, who upon application by the exhibitor shall set a time and place for a hearing and shall notify the applicants and all interested parties, including all exhibitors who may be exhibiting or preparing to exhibit the film. The Board shall view the film and at such hearing, hear the statements of all interested parties, and any proper testimony that may be offered, and shall within two (2) days thereafter make and file its order aproving or changing such classification. If the classification of a film is changed as a result of such hearing to the classification \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019, the exhibitors showing the film shall have seven (7) days in which to alter their advertising and audience policy to comply with such classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">(d) Upon filing by the Board of any classification order, the City Secretary shall immediately issue and mail a notice of classification to the exhibitor involved and to any other exhibitor who shall request such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">(e) A classification shall be binding on any subsequent exhibitor unless and until he obtains a change of classification in the manner above provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Section 46A-4. <em>Offenses:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">(a) It shall be unlawful for any exhibitor or his employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">(1) To exhibit any film which has not been classified as provided in this ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-14\">(2) To exhibit any film classified \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019 if any current advertisement of such film by such exhibitor fails to state clearly the classification of such film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-15\">(3) To exhibit any film classified \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019 without keeping such classification posted prominently in front of the theatre in which such film is being exhibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(4) Knowingly to sell or give to any young person a ticket to any film classified \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">(5) Knowingly to permit any young person to view the exhibition of any film classified \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">(6) To exhibit any film classified \u2018not suitable for young persons\u2019 or any scene or scenes from such a film, or from an unclassified film, whether moving or still, in the same theatre and on the same program with a film classified \u2018suitable for young persons\u2019;

The City Council shall have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>authority to issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to appear and testify at such hearing, and any party to such hearing shall be entitled to such process.

Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1676, says: \u201cMotion pictures are within the ambit of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098. But in Roth v. U. S. and Alberts v. California, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498, we held that obscenity is not subject to those guarantees.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>It has not been intimated in any authoritative decision that such vested First Amendment rights may be dissipated by anything short of obscenity in such material as that term is defined by several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is not sufficient that a motion picture be objectionable or even odious and obnoxious in part, but the picture must be utterly without redeeming social value. The standard must be that of an average person, not on a community or state basis, but on a national basis in measuring First Amendment rights under the Constitution of the United States. <em>Jacobellis, </em>supra, says: \u201c[T]hat the constitutional status of an allegedly obscene work must be determined on the basis of a national standard. It is, after all, a national Constitution we are expounding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">But this Dallas ordinance says nothing about obscenity, and the trial judge gave it a helpful nudge in that direction to provide the basis for the cross appeal here. But the Court could not by its proviso give, or ascribe to the ordinance something not said or to be found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">There is, indeed, sound basis in dicta found in many respected cases to the effect that states may take a critical look at pictures designed for viewing by young people under sixteen years of age, in the instant case; and that they may supervise such showings to see that these young minds are not polluted by any filth which is utterly without any redeeming social value or importance as determined by an average person on a national basis. That is the basic teaching of the landmark decision of Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304. That decision has been amplified and explained and broadened, but never retrograded. The <em>Roth </em>standards were so applied to an indictment under the Federal Obscenity Statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461) in Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, and in Mishkin v. State of New York, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S.Ct. 958, involving the New York Obscenity Statute appearing as \u00a7 1141 New York Penal Code, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 40. Finally, the Supreme Court of the United States epitomized its <em>Roth </em>decision in A Book Named John Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure v. Attorney General of Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">This ordinance is assailed on the ground that it does not contain necessary standards and indispensable guides to vouchsafe the adequate protection of these First Amendment rights of these exhibitors; that it is vulnerable to the vagueness doctrine and does not have built into the ordinance itself any safeguard against devastating delays and chilling expense of litigation. The trial court again detected and valiantly tried to remedy this last mentioned infirmity by judicial fiat, but to no avail. There is nothing in this ordinance or the record to support the Court\u2019s optimism in finding that any litigation under this ordinance could be concluded in thirty-five days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">These prior restraints upon free speech surely come before the Court bearing a heavy presumption against their Constitutional validity. It is noteworthy that not one of this nine member board need be a lawyer versed in detecting and deciding upon any of the niceties of the protected vested right of free speech. The dangers of a censor system of any kind and its vices are recountered in Freedman v. State of Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">\u201cTo this end, the exhibitor must be assured, by statute or authoritative judicial construction, that the censor will, within a specified brief period, either issue a license or go to court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to restrain showing the film. Any restraint imposed in advance of a final judicial determination on the merits must similarly be limited to preservation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution. Moreover, we are well aware that, even after expiration of a temporary restraint, an administrative refusal to license, signifying the censor\u2019s view that the film is unprotected, may have a discouraging effect on the exhibitor. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra. Therefore, the procedure must also assure a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous denial of a license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">It may not be doubted that this ordinance is in reality one of limited censorship, though it is called a classification ordinance. Any such kind of censorship apparatus is said to be always fraught with danger and viewed with suspicion of its constitutional invalidity. Standards for testing and safeguards against expensive and extended litigation must be built into the ordinance to safeguard against the ultimate and effectual destruction of First Amendment rights. In Freedman v. State of Maryland, supra, the Court stated, \u201cAny system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d The operation of this ordinance must envision the existence of a strong presumption that the film contains protected free speech material and that the burden rests upon the board to overcome it. That is the rule applicable to the noncriminal' aspect of this ordinance but it also has a criminal aspect. The <em>Freedman </em>case suggests some provisions for a statute to avoid chilling these protected rights of an exhibitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The municipality in this case undertook to unilaterally control the course of subsequent litigation, but the municipality is subject to the state statutes and rules of Court for disposition of cases and a time-table of litigation is not committed to the control of Dallas. The ordinance is thus lacking in its protection of a valuable right of due process. Two of the present Supreme Court Justices would not even approve such an ordinance if it complied with the <em>Freedman </em>rule, but would insist upon literal respect for these First Amendment rights and deny all paralyzing power to the censor. The attempts of the municipality to comply with this requirement are largely precatory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">An analysis of \u00a7 46A-1 (f) of this ordinance must be made for an understanding of the classification \u201cnot suitable for young persons.\u201d That is the heart of this ordinance. It was this provision which the trial court propped up by relating it to obscenity. There is thus submitted to an administrative board for its impressions and reactions, the examination of a film for their determination as to whether or not it is fit for exhibition to young persons under sixteen years of age. This ordinance says nothing about obscenity, but irrefragably invades that field under a different cloak \u2014not as a censor, but as a classifier with the same power and effect. The Supreme Court says that obscene material finds no protection under the First Amendment and has indicated a modified standard for determination of obscenity where young persons are involved. In A Book Named John Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure v. Attorney General of Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, \u201cWe defined obscenity in Roth in the following terms: Whether to the average persons, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u2019 354 U.S., at 489, 77 S.Ct., at 1311. Under this definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce : It must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>scription or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Section 46A-1 (Definitions) makes no provision for application of any given standards of morality or guides to be used and employed by the board in making its impressions and determinations as to the fitness of the particular film for exhibition. Thus, without any instructions on the subject of First Amendment rights, this board is set adrift among myriad shoals for the laudible purpose of protecting its young people from shows that they should not see and hear for their best interest. Yet, there are no procedural safeguards in this Dallas ordinance to safeguard and protect and vouchsafe to the exhibitor their First Amendment rights. We are told that Dallas is even now enforcing this ordinance as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Finally, \u00a7 2 of this ordinance provides: \u201cThat any person who shall violate any provisions (sic) of this ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\u201d and upon conviction shall be fined two hundred dollars for each offense. It may be safely doubted that the average person could understand exactly that which is proscribed by this ordinance to avoid criminal punishment. While \u00a7 46A-4 is captioned \u201cOffenses,\u201d this section is not all comprehensive of that which seems to be prohibited by this criminal provision. It may be well doubted that this ordinance thus conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed criminal conduct to define a valid criminal offense. It seems to follow as a matter of course that this ordinance is surely vulnerable to the Vagueness Doctrine as presently applied. It impinges upon the protected rights of motion picture exhibitors under the First Amendment as implemented by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">With reluctance, I respectfully dissent for the reasons indicated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> William Harold Cox, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-12\">. The Court while considering a motion picture film for its fitness to be displayed in the <em>Jacobellis </em>case, supra, declined to abnegate its duty to protect First Amendment rights, saying: \u201cSince it is only \u2018obscenity\u2019 that is excluded from the constitutional protection, the question whether a particular work is obscene necessarily implicates an issue of constitutional law,\u201d citing <em>Roth.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">.

City of Dallas on November 9, 1965 247 F.Supp. 906, 911, the Court said: \u201c[T]here being no provision in the Texas statutes for prompt judicial review in the trial and appellate courts, and experience being that risk of delay is built into the Texas procedure, the Ordinance in question lacks sufficient procedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of a censorship system.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
