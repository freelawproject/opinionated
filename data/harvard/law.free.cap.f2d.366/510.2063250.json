The YAKA, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963), found in effect that the bareboat charter made the stevedore employer the owner of the boat for the duration of the bareboat charter. It held the stevedore employee could maintain a libel <em>in rem </em>against the vessel for injuries resulting from the unseaworthiness of the vessel, and that the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, did not provide an exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">We find the facts of this case undistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The District Court made the following Finding of Fact No. 20:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">\u201cThat the sum of $4,822.05 was paid to libelant in compensation. That $1,490.10 in reasonable medical costs were paid to furnish necessary care and treatment of libelant\u2019s injuries. That respondent and claimant are entitled to offset the sum of $4,822.05 paid in compensation. That if libelant had incurred said medical costs directly, he would be entitled to an award in that amount. That respondent and claimant are not entitled to an offset of said medical costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">We concur, and affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"ADi\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
