The validity of these warrants is not questioned. Rather, appellant contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>at the moment of arrest the officers lacked probable cause to believe the person they arrested was appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the FBI agent who made the arrest testified as follows. On the night of February 26, 1964, he and three other agents were sent by their superior officer to the corner of Frankford and Levick streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They had been told that appellant might be in that vicinity. They had read a full description of appellant, and had examined his photograph. They had been told that appellant had been identified while purchasing a hair piece and would probably be wearing it, and that he would probably be wearing dark-rimmed glasses. They had known of the outstanding warrants. They had known that appellant was also charged with shooting and killing a policeman with a .45-caliber weapon, that he was armed with such a weapon, and that he was considered extremely dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Arriving at the designated corner, the agents observed a man in an outdoor phone booth, and approached to identify him. Because there was no light in the phone booth, the man \u2014 appellant\u2014\u201cwas taken hold of by the arm and pulled outside. Nothing \u2014 it was general [sic]. Not a violent gesture.\u201d As appellant emerged from the dark phone booth into the lighted street, the arresting agents saw that he wore a hair piece and dark-rimmed glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Appellant was asked to identify himself. He took his wallet from his rear pocket and showed the agents a driver\u2019s license, bearing a false name. The arresting agent took hold of appellant\u2019s left arm. Feeling something hard, he un2iipped appellant\u2019s jacket, and from a \u201cquick-draw\u201d holster removed a loaded .45-caliber automatic with a shell in the chamber, ready to fire. A tattoo mark appellant was known to have was found on his left forearm. Appellant then admitted his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">The district court concluded there was probable cause to arrest appellant when the arresting agent saw appellant\u2019s hair piece and dark-rimmed glasses. Appellant does not seriously contest this conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, he contends that the arrest occurred earlier \u2014 either when the FBI agents blocked his exit from the phone booth, or when they physically removed him from it \u2014 and that at neither instant did the agents have probable cause to believe that he was the man named in the warrants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">We think the actions of the agents, prior to the moment they acquired probable cause to arrest, were reasonable, and did not violate appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">If the agents had simply accosted appellant and asked him to identify himself, no one could question the propriety of their conduct. Cf. Keiningham v. United States, 307 F.2d 632, 633 (D.C. Cir. 1962); Green v. United States, 259 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>180, 181 (D.C. Cir. 1958); La Fave, Arrest 345 (1965). They did more than that. They laid hands upon appellant, and constrained his physical movements. The question is whether this physical restraint, supported by less than probable cause to believe the person affected was the one named in the warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Relying primarily upon Rios v. United States, 364 U.S. 253, 262, 80 S.Ct. 1431, 4 L.Ed.2d 1688 (1960), we have recently held that \u201cthere is nothing ipso facto unconstitutional in the brief detention of citizens under circumstances not justifying an arrest, for purposes of limited inquiry in the course of routine police investigations\u201d; and that the test of the validity of such a brief detention is whether \u201cfrom the totality of the circumstances\u201d it appears that the detention was based upon \u201creasonable grounds\u201d and \u201cwas not arbitrary or harassing.\u201d Wilson v. Porter, 361 F.2d 412 (9th Cir. 1966). Supporting authority from this court includes Davis v. People of State of California, 341 F.2d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 1965) <em>; </em>Lipton v. United States, 348 F.2d 591, 593 (9th Cir. 1965); Busby v. United States, 296 F.2d 328, 331 (9th Cir. 1961) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Substantial considerations favor the recognition of a carefully limited right of brief police detention on less than probable cause to believe the person detained has committed a felony. If even slight interference with freedom of personal movement is invariably conditioned upon a showing of prior probable cause, then either the standard of probable cause will be lowered, and with it the protection against formal arrests and substantial interferences with liberty; or police activity which appears perfectly proper when measured against a standard of reasonableness will nonetheless be forbidden. American Law Institute, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Tent. Draft No. 1, Commentary 95-97 (1966); Bator &amp; Vorenberg, 66 Colum.L.Rev. 62, 64-67 (1966); La Fave, Arrest 346 (1965); Note, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 473, 474-75 (1964); Barrett, 1960 Sup.

A.L.I. Model Code, supra, at 94-95; Bator &amp; Vorenberg, supra, 66 Colum.L. Rev. at 65-66; Leagre, supra, 54 J.Crim. L. 396, 419-20. See also Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 767-768, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">The agents\u2019 conduct in the present case met the standard of reasonableness. Their duty, imposed by the warrant, was to find appellant and arrest him. They had substantial reason to believe he might be in the immediate vicinity. It was proper to identify anyone in the area who met appellant\u2019s general description. Appellant could not be seen clearly in the darkened phone booth. To give him notice, no matter how short, by asking him to step into the light might have imperiled life, for appellant had demonstrated his willingness to kill to avoid arrest, and he was known to be armed. His removal from the phone booth was accomplished with minimum force. The period of involuntary detention before probable cause was acquired was short \u2014 seconds at most. It was neither longer nor more oppressive than necessary to the discharge of the agents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>duty to identify appellant and arrest him, and it was put to no other purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Appellant sought to exclude the testimony of various witnesses identifying him as a participant in the robbery of the respective banks, on the ground that these courtroom identifications were based in whole or in part upon (1) a prior examination by each witness of a photograph of appellant which was unlawfully seized during an illegal search of appellant\u2019s apartment; and (2) a prior viewing of appellant at an unlawful police lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">A. <em>Seizure of the Photograph</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACO\">The circumstances leading to the seizure of the photograph were as follows. At approximately 11:00 a. m. on January 3, 1964, two armed men robbed the Mutual Savings and Loan Association of Alhambra, California.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A police officer was shot and killed. One of the robbers was wounded, but both escaped. Shortly thereafter the automobile which the robbers had driven from the bank was found abandoned about eight blocks away. The wounded robber was found in a second automobile nearby, and was taken to a hospital. A witness reported that two men had driven away from the scene in a third automobile. These facts were related to an FBI agent who arrived upon the scene about noon. He radioed the information to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Another FBI agent was dispatched to the hospital to interview the wounded robber. The interview continued intermittently over several hours. The wounded man, Edgar Weaver, died at 9:00 p. m. that evening. Early in the interview, Weaver admitted his participation in the robbery, and said that a man named \u201cGilbert\u201d was his accomplice. The agent telephoned this information to his office. Weaver then \u201ccame up with the name \u2018Skinny Gilbert.\u2019 \u201d The agent called his office with this additional information, and, in response, his office gave him appellant\u2019s name, \u201cJesse James Gilbert,\u201d and asked the agent to find out from Weaver if he was the one. Weaver confirmed this identification. He also reported, accurately, that appellant was then a prison escapee. Weaver also told the agent that he and appellant spent the previous night in apartment 28 of an apartment house with an \u201cHawaiian-sounding\u201d name located two blocks from the corner of Los Feliz Boulevard and Riverside Drive in Glendale, California. The agent immediately informed his office. It was then about 12:30 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">The FBI office, by radio, dispatched another man, Agent Keil, to the indicated area with instructions to locate the apartment; and instructed two other agents, Agents Schlatter and Onsgard, to join with local police officers, secure arms, and proceed to the area. Agent Keil located the \u201cLanai Apartments\u201d at 3717 Los Feliz Boulevard, near Riverside Drive, and advised his office. He then spoke to the manager, who told him that \u201cRobert Flood,\u201d in whose name apartment 28 was rented, had just left through an exit to a rear driveway, stating that he was going to San Francisco for several days. Agent Keil immediately checked the driveway but saw no one. A stairway led from the driveway to the second floor where apartment 28 was located. Agent Keil secured the key to apartment 28, and turned it over to Agents Schlatter and Onsgard, who had just arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">Agents Schlatter and Onsgard had picked up local police reinforcements and arms, as instructed, and proceeded to the address of the apartment house relayed to them by radio, arriving three or four minutes after Agent Keil. They had been advised by radio of other pertinent information, outlined above, as it was ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>tained. Agent Schlatter was also aware, from his own knowledge, that there was an outstanding warrant for the arrest of appellant as a prison escapee.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The FBI agents and police officers surrounded the building. Agent Schlatter with others, armed with shotguns and pistols, approached apartment 28. Agent Schlatter unlocked the door, and he and the others entered. Looking for anyone who might be within, they searched through the rooms, under beds, and in closets. The apartment was empty. About the apartment, in plain view, were a notebook opened to a sketch, marked \u201cAlhambra\u201d and depicting the area of the robbed bank, a quantity of currency, a clip from a .45-caliber pistol, and an envelope of the type used to deliver photographs. Nothing but the pictures was disturbed. These were taken immediately to the robbed bank to determine whether any of the witnesses could identify the person in the photographs as one of the robbers. The other items were seized subsequently under a warrant secured several hours later \u2014 this. seizure is not now questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">At trial the government did not rely upon the seized photographs as evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant, in cross-examining witnesses who identified him as a participant in the robberies involved here, brought out the fact that prior to the trial most of the witnesses had identified appellant from photographs, including one of those taken from appellant\u2019s apartment. Appellant argues that the courtroom identification should have been suppressed as fruits of an unlawful seizure. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention was rejected by the California Supreme Court in an appeal from his conviction of the murder of the police officer. People v. Gilbert, 63 Cal.2d 690, 47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 919-920, 408 P.2d 365, 374-375 (1965). We arrive at the same conclusion, holding, for reasons set out below, that (1) the entry and (2) the search, and (3) the seizure, were all lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">1. <em>The Entry. </em>Appellant argues that the FBI agents and police officers lacked probable cause to enter the apartment to make an arrest because (1) Weaver, the wounded man, was not known to them to be a reliable informer; and (2) the information which they had indicated that apartment 28 was unoccupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">The second contention is quickly answered. As the agents and police approached the door to apartment 28, they knew that three men might have participated in the robbery; that only one\u2014 Weaver \u2014 was accounted for; and that the other two had fled in the same automobile. While one man had apparently left apartment 28, he might have returned by way of the rear stairs. Agent Schlatter testified that the agents and police entered the apartment for the purpose of making an arrest, believing one or more of the robbers might be within. The precautions which they took in surrounding the building, in approaching the apartment heavily armed, and in opening the door and entering without announcement reflected this purpose and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cprobable cause\u201d contention is also unfounded. \u201cIn testing the sufficiency of probable cause for an officer\u2019s action even without a warrant, we have held that he may rely upon information received through an informant, rather than upon his direct observations, so long as the informant\u2019s statement is reasonably corroborated by other matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>within the officer\u2019s knowledge\u201d (Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 735, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960)), and \u201cis sufficiently accurate to lead the officers directly to the suspect.\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 480, 83 S.Ct. 407, 413, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); see also Broeder, 42 Neb.L.Rev. 483, 501-02, 508-12 (1963). Weaver\u2019s information obviously met the requirement of particularity. We think it also satisfied the requirement of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">It is true that the agents \u201chad no basis in experience for confidence in the reliability of [Weaver\u2019s] information\u201d (Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 480, 83 S.Ct. at 413), but \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay\u201d (Jones v. United States, supra, 362 U.S. at 272, 80 S.Ct. at 736) may be found in other circumstances, particularly in the officer\u2019s verification of details of the informant\u2019s statement before the officer acts. United States v. Nori, 352 F.2d 910, 911 (7th Cir. 1965); Katz v. Peyton, 334 F.2d 77, 78 (4th Cir. 1964); Jones v. United States, 326 F.2d 124, 128-129 (9th Cir. 1963); Costello v. United States, 324 F.2d 260, 262 (9th Cir. 1963); Naples v. United States, 113 U.S.App. D.C. 281, 307 F.2d 618 (1962); United States v. Irby, 304 F.2d 280, 283 (4th Cir. 1962); Rodgers v. United States, 267 F.2d 79, 85, 88 (9th Cir. 1959); Comment, 53 Calif.L.Rev. 840, 842 (1965); Note, 25 Ohio St.L.J. 502, 519 (1964).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The independent determination by the FBI office of appellant\u2019s full name from the nickname furnished by Weaver, and Weaver\u2019s confirmation of this identification; the verification of Weaver\u2019s information that appellant was an escapee; and the location of the Lanai Apartments, and of apartment 28, on the basis of Weaver\u2019s description, were facts known to Agent Schlatter which lent credence to Weaver\u2019s story. Moreover, a man of reasonable caution could find reason for reliance in the fact that Weaver was a fully confessed participant in the crime, mortally wounded, and beyond expectation of personal benefit by incriminating the innocent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude that reliance upon Weaver\u2019s information was reasonable; and, of course, his accusation established probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">As we have noted, the FBI agents and local police broke into appellant\u2019s apartment without first announcing their authority and purpose as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3109. Appellant contends that the entry was for this reason unlawful. Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 482-484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441; Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958); Ng Pui Yu v. United States, 352 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir. 1965); Blakey, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 499, 516-26 (1964); Kaplan, 49 Calif.L.Rev. 474, 500-03 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Agent Schlatter testified that because of the possible presence of an armed murderer in the apartment he believed an announcement before entry might increase, \u201cextremely,\u201d the personal peril to the officers. The Supreme Court of California has held that the entry into apartment 28 fell within an exception to the state\u2019s announcement requirement (Calif. Penal Code \u00a7 844) because compliance \u201cmight have alerted the suspect and increased the officers\u2019 peril.\u201d People v. Gilbert, supra, 63 Cal.2d 690, 47 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>at 919, 408 P.2d at 375. See also Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 37-41, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\"> Although the question appears to be one of first impression, expressly reserved in Miller v. United States, supra, 357 U.S. at 309, 78 S.Ct. at 1190,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think a similar exception is to be read into the unqualified language of 18 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 3109. This appears to be the common-law rule. People v. Maddox, 46 Cal.2d 301, 294 P.2d 6, 9 (Sup.Ct.Calif. 1956), quoted with approval in Ker v. State of California, supra, 374 U.S. at 39-40, 83 S.Ct. 1623; Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 206 comment d; Wilgus, 22 Mich.L.Rev. 798, 802 (1924); Blakey, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 499, 505-06 (1964). See also Accarino v. United States, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 394, 179 F.2d 456, 463 (D.C.Cir. 1949). Even the Justices who disagreed with the result in Ker v. State of California agreed that some exceptions to the rule of prior announcement are to be recognized. 374 U.S. at 54-65, 83 S.Ct. 1623. This much admitted, it would be difficult to justify refusal to excuse prior announcement where to require it would create palpable peril to the life or limb of the arresting officers. See Blakey, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 499, 542-43 (1964); Kaplan, 49 Calif.L.Rev. 474, 502 (1961). The entry of the agents was therefore lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">2. <em>The Search. </em>Once lawfully on the premises the agents could properly observe what was in plain sight. Ker v. State of California, supra, 374 U.S. at 36-37, 83 S.Ct. 1623. Viewed realistically, this included the photographs. Although the photographs were in an envelope, the envelope was on top of a dresser and its exterior revealed its contents \u2014 it was the type of envelope commonly used in transmitting photographs, and was clearly marked with the name and address of the studio. See Chapman v. United States, 346 F.2d 383, 385-387 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">But even if discovery of the photographs involved a search, the search did not offend the Fourth Amendment. The officers had probable cause sufficient to support issuance of a search warrant; in addition to the information available before entry, the knowledge which the officers lawfully acquired of the sketch, the money, and the gun clip made the complicity of the former occupant or occupants in the bank robbery virtually certain. The officers had no search warrant, and since there was no arrest to which a warrantless seizure might be incident, the seizure was lawful only if necessitated by exigent circumstances (Cipres v. United States, 343 F.2d 95, 98 n. 9 (9th Cir. 1965)); but such circumstances were plainly present, for time was of the essence if the photographs were to assist in the identification and pursuit of the fleeing robbers (Caldwell v. United States, 338 F.2d 385, 387 (8th Cir. 1964). See also, Schmerber v. State of California, supra, 384 U.S. at 770-771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908; Ker v. State of California, supra, 374 U.S. at 41-42, 83 S.Ct. 1623; Cipres v. United States, supra, 343 F.2d at 98, last paragraph of n. 9). Discovery of the photographs was therefore lawful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">3. <em>The Seizure. </em>But this does not necessarily justify their seizure. As the Supreme Court said in Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 234, 80 S.Ct. 683, 695, 4 L.Ed.2d 668 (1960), \u201cnot every item may be seized which is properly inspectible by the Government in the course of a legal search; for example, private papers desired by the Government merely for use as evidence may not be seized, no matter how lawful the search which discovers them, Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298, 310, 41 S.Ct. 261, 265, 65 L.Ed. 647 * * Appellant contends that his photographs fell within this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">The much criticized rule forbidding the seizure of \u201cmere evidence\u201d in an otherwise valid search has been recently re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>jeeted in notable decisions of the highest courts of California and New Jersey. People v. Thayer, 63 Cal.2d 635, 47 Cal. Rptr. 780, 408 P.2d 108 (1965); State v. Bisaccia, 45 N.J. 504, 213 A.2d 185 (1965). As an inferior appellate court, that course is not open to us. We may, however, in light of the substantial objections which have been raised to the rule,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> confine its application to situations where it will clearly serve the purposes upon which it is said to be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">(1) <em>Self-incrimination. </em>Photographs of an accused, used only as a means of identification, are no more within the privilege against self-incrimination than his physical appearance (Smith v.

The only use made of the seized photographs was that of showing them to witnesses to the robberies for the purpose of identification.

The agents testified that they confined their initial search to locating occupants of the room or indications of their identity and possible location, and there is nothing to question the agents\u2019 good faith. Only the pictures were taken. \u201cThe search in the present case was * * * properly limited to and incident to the purpose of the officers\u2019 entry.\u201d People v. Gilbert, supra, 63 Cal.2d 690, 47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d at 375. See also Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 153, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1947); United States v.

Although this rationale for the rule figures prominently in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), and Gouled v. United States, 255 U.S. 298 (1921), even these early opinions recognize that the owner\u2019s right to undisturbed possession of his property must sometimes give way to an overriding social interest. The pressing public interest in the speedy identification and pursuit of the escaping murderers far outweighed the slight inconvenience appellant might have sustained from the temporary invasion of his possessory in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>terest in his property.

We are unable, however, to concur in his views as to the other questions presented on this appeal. As to those questions, our opinion is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">B. <em>The Lineup.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Gilbert claims that the court should have suppressed the testimony of eleven witnesses who identified him as a participant in the four robberies. He asserts that each identified him at a police lineup and that his being required to participate violated rights guaranteed to him by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. However, no mention of the Fourteenth was made at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Here is what the record shows. The government presented the testimony of fourteen persons, each an eyewitness to one of the offenses with which Gilbert was charged. Each one identified Gilbert, in the courtroom, as one of the robbers. Each then described the particular robbery that the witness had seen, in some detail, including Gilbert\u2019s participation in it. No objection was made, no motion to suppress the testimony of the witness was made either before trial, or before or at the time the witness testified. No request was made that the witness be first examined on voir dire, or out of the presence of the jury, to lay a foundation for the contention that Gilbert now makes.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-16\">On cross examination, twelve of the witnesses were asked if they had identified Gilbert at a police lineup. One did not. The other eleven did. Gilbert and his counsel then obtained from some of these witnesses a description of what happened at the lineup. In some instances, the government, on re-direct, brought out further evidence on the subject, primarily to emphasize that the men in the lineup were identified only by number, not by name. None of the evidence thus elicited was made the basis of an objection, a motion to suppress, a request for a hearing out of the presence of the jury, or anything else before the witness was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">After all of these eleven witnesses had testified and been excused, Gilbert made the motion set out in the margin.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>We think that Gilbert\u2019s motion was insufficient, that it came too late, and that we are therefore not required to consider the contentions that he now makes. Judge Browning, however, would not only consider them but also make them a basis for a reversal of the judgment. We disagree, and state our views as to their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">It was stipulated that Gilbert did not have counsel present at the lineup. Neither did the government. We assume, for the purpose of considering the matter, that, as Gilbert asserts, he informed the marshals that he did not want to attend and demanded counsel, and he was taken to the lineup anyway. The lineup occurred on March 26, 1964, after Gilbert had been indicted and had obtained counsel. It was held in an auditorium used for that purpose by the Los Angeles police. Some ten to thirteen prisoners were placed on a lighted stage. The witnesses were assembled in a darkened portion of the room, facing the stage and separated from it by a screen. They could see the prisoners but could not be seen by them. State and federal officers were also present and one of them acted as \u201cmoderator\u201d of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Each man in the lineup was identified by number, but not by name. Each man was required to step forward into a marked circle, to turn, presenting both profiles as well as a face and back view, to walk, to put on or take off certain articles of clothing. When a man\u2019s number was called and he was directed to step into the circle, he was asked certain questions: where he was picked up, whether he owned a car, whether, when arrested, he was armed, where he lived. Each was also asked to repeat certain phrases, both in a loud and in a soft voice, phrases that witnesses to the crimes had heard the robbers use: \u201cFreeze, this is a stickup; this is a holdup; empty your cash drawer ; this is a heist; don\u2019t anybody move.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Either while the men were on the stage, or after they were taken from it, it is not clear which, the assembled witnesses were asked if there were any that they would like to see again, and told that if they had doubts, now was the time to resolve them. Several gave the numbers of men they wanted to see, including Gilbert\u2019s. While the other prisoners were no longer present, Gilbert and 2 or 3 others were again put through a similar procedure. Some of the witnesses asked that a particular prisoner say a particular phrase, or walk a particular way. After the lineup, the witnesses talked to each other; it is not clear that they did so during the lineup. They did, however, in each other\u2019s presence, call out the numbers of men they could identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">\n<em>FIFTH AMENDMENT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-18\"><em>\u201c </em>* -x- * nor shan any person * * * be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself * * United States Const., Amendment 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Gilbert does not assert that he was asked any incriminating questions, much less that he gave any incriminating answers, during the lineup. His contention is that his being required to participate in the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination because it compelled him to furnish evidence against himself. The evidence so furnished was himself, his voice, and his movements. We hold that his fifth amendment privilege was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">It has long been the view of the courts and of leading commentators that the privilege is limited to incriminating communications. Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in Holt v. United States, 1910, 218 U.S. 245, 252-253, 31 S.Ct. 2, 6, 54 L.Ed. 1021, stated the principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-5\">\u201cAnother objection is based upon an extravagant extension of the 5th Amendment. A question arose as to whether a blouse belonged to the prisoner. A witness testified that the prisoner put it on and it fitted him. It is objected that he did this under the same duress that made his statements inadmissible, and that it should be excluded for the same reasons. But the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material. The objection in principle would forbid a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Wigmore agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">\u201c * * * the privilege is limited to testimonial disclosures. It was directed at the employment of legal process to <em>extract from the person\u2019s own lips </em>an admission of guilt, which would thus take the place of other evidence.\u201d 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2263 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961.) <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">The most recent pronouncement by the Supreme Court, in Schmerber v. State of California, 1966, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 is to the same effect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And every federal court that has passed upon the question so far as we can discover, has taken the same position. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, 2 Cir., 1966, 355 F.2d 731, 734-738; Rigney v. Hendrick, 3 Cir., 1965, 355 F.2d 710, 713-714; Kennedy v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 462, 466; Copeland v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1964, 343 F.2d 287, 290; Caldwell v. United States, 8 Cir., 1964, 338 F.2d 385; Smith v. United States, 1963, 117 U.S. App.D.C. 1, 324 F.2d 879, 882; United States v. Iacullo, 7 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 788, 793; Smith v. United States, D.C. Cir., 1950, 187 F.2d 192, 193-99; Swingle v. United States, 10 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 512, 513; McFarland v. United States, 1945, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 196, 150 F.2d 593, 594. There is much state authority to the same effect, e. g., State v. Fisher, Ore., 1966, 410 P.2d 216, 217; People v. Graves, Cal., 1966, 49 Cal.Rptr. 386, 411 P.2d 114, 115-116; People v. Gilbert, Cal., 1965, 63 Cal.2d 690, 47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365, 376-377 cert. granted, 1966, 384 U.S. 985, 86 S.Ct. 1902, 16 L.Ed.2d 1003; People v. Lopez, Cal., 1963, 32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16, 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">The foregoing cases involve such matters as police lineups, Rigney v. Hendrick, supra, Williams v. United States, supra, Copeland v. United States, supra, Caldwell v. United States, supra, People v. Gilbert, supra, People v. Lopez, supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>including requiring the suspect to speak, not to elicit information but for voice identification, Rigney v. Hendrick, supra, People v. Lopez, supra, confrontation of the suspect by the victim at the time of arrest for purposes of identification, Kennedy v. United States, supra, similar confrontation at the police station, Smith v. United States, 187 F.2d, supra, or at a hospital to which the victim had been taken, United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, or in court, Swingle v. United States, supra, fingerprints and palm prints, Smith v. United States, D.C.Cir., 324 F.2d, supra. United States v. Iacullo, supra, exemplars of handwriting, State v. Fisher, supra, People v. Graves, supra, examination of one\u2019s body to find blood on it, McFarland v. United States, supra, and the taking of a blood sample, Sehmerber v. State of California, supra. They also make it clear that it is permissible to require that the suspect put on or take off clothing, move, assume certain poses, or speak, as Gilbert was required to do. Because one\u2019s voice is as much a physical characteristic as the col- or of his eyes, we reject the notion, advanced by some authorities,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that requiring the suspect to speak, where doing so does not involve communicating what he knows, violates his privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">\n<em>SIXTH AMENDMENT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.\u201d United States Const., Amendment 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Gilbert would have us extrapolate from certain decisions of the Supreme Court a rule that he had a right to consult counsel before being required to participate in the lineup, and to have the assistance of counsel during the lineup. He deduces from this rule a further result, that when these claimed rights are denied, no witness who was present at the lineup may give identifying testimony against him at his trial. We reject both the purported rule and the claimed result. The cases from which the purported rule is extracted fall into two categories. One group of cases calls the Sixth Amendment to the aid of the Fifth when the police seek information from the suspect who is in custody or on bail. Massiah v. United States, 1964, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246; Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977; Miranda v. State of Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. The foregoing statement relates to the factual situations in these cases. The legal theories that they apply vary somewhat.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">In <em>Massiah, </em>an indicted federal defendant who had a lawyer was arraigned, pled not guilty, and was released on bail. A codefendant, posing as a friend but actually cooperating with the government, obtained incriminating statements from him. These were admitted at his trial. The Supreme Court reversed. Before the Supreme Court, Massiah relied upon the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The Court said that it did not reach the Fourth Amendment claim. It did not say that it was relying only on the Sixth. It speaks of the right to counsel and says that a defendant is \u201cas much entitled to such aid [of counsel] during that period\u201d (from arraignment until the beginning of trial) \u201cas at the trial itself.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (P. 205, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1202) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Its holding is twice stated, first at p. 206, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1203:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">\u201cWe hold that the petitioner was denied the basic protections of that [Sixth Amendment] guarantee when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The second statement is at p. 207, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1203:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-6\">\u201cAll that we hold is that the defendant\u2019s own incriminating statements, obtained by federal agents under the circumstances here disclosed, could not constitutionally be used by the prosecution as evidence against <em>him </em>at his trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">We note that, in both statements, there is emphasis upon \u201chis own incriminating statements.\u201d These phrases certainly point to the Fifth Amendment. The Court limited its holding to the obtaining of such evidence. It also said (p. 207, 84 S.Ct. at p. 1203):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-8\">\u201cWe do not question that in this case, as in many cases, it was entirely proper to continue an investigation of the suspected criminal activities of the defendant and his alleged confederates, even though the defendant had already been indicted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">However one reads the <em>Massiah </em>case, it certainly is not a ruling upon the type of case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\"><em>Escobedo, </em>likewise, does not deal with such a case as this one. There, the police had a suspect in custody and questioned him until he confessed. In doing so, they disregarded his request to see his lawyer, and the lawyer\u2019s request to see him. Relying upon <em>Massiah, </em>the Court held that the confession should have been excluded. It based its decision on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. (See particularly, 378 U.S. at 484-488, 84 S.Ct. 1758.) But it also tied that right, in the context of the case, to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-14\">\u201cThe fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a \u2018stage when legal aid and advice\u2019 are surely needed. Massiah v. United States, supra, at 204, 84 S.Ct. at 1202; Hamilton v. [State of] Alabama, supra; <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> White v. [State of] Maryland, supra.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The right to counsel would indeed be hollow if it began at a period when few confessions were obtained. There is necessarily a direct relationship between the importance of a stage to the police in their quest for a confession and the criticalness of that stage to the accused in his need for legal advice. Our Constitution, unlike some others, strikes the balance in favor of .the right of the accused to be advised by his lawyer of his privilege against self-incrimination. See Note, 73 Yale L.J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-15\">\u201cWe have learned the lesson of history, ancient and modern, that a system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the \u2018confession\u2019 will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system which depends on extrinsic evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.\u201d (Id. at 488-489, 84 S.Ct. at 1764.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">And it summarizes its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-17\">\u201cWe hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. [335], at 342 83 S.Ct. [792,] at 795 [9 L.Ed.2d 799] and that no statement elicited, by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d (Id. at 490-491, 84 S.Ct. at 1765.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARi\">Again, there is emphasis upon \u201celiciting incriminating statements.\u201d We note, too, that the Court distinguished Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-5\">\u201cIn that case the Court merely rejected the absolute rule sought by petitioner, that \u2018every state denial of a request to contact counsel [is] an infringement of the constitutional right <em>without regard to the circumstances of the case.\u2019 </em>Id., 357 U.S., at 440, 78 S.Ct. at 1292. (Emphasis in original.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">We also note that the Court limited its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">\u201cNothing we have said today affects the powers of the police to investigate \u2018an unsolved crime,\u2019 Spano v. People of State of New York, 360 U.S. 315, 327, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1209, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (Stewart, J., concurring), by gathering information from witnesses and by other \u2018proper investigative efforts.\u2019 Haynes v. [State of] Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 519, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1346, 10 L.Ed.2d 513. We hold only that when the process shifts from investigatory to accusatory \u2014 when its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession \u2014 our adversary system begins to operate, and, under the circumstances here, the accused must be permitted to consult with his lawyer.\u201d (Id. at 492, 84 S.Ct. at 1766.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-8\"><em>Miranda, </em>a group of four cases, is basically an explanation and extension of the <em>Escobedo </em>holding. (See 384 U.S. at 441-442, 86 S.Ct. 1602.) In <em>Miranda, </em>the Court said of <em>Escobedo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-9\">\u201cThat case was but an explication of basic rights that are enshrined in our Constitution \u2014 that \u2018No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u2019 and that \u2018the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 \u2014 rights which were put in jeopardy in that case through official overbearing.\u201d (Id. at 442, 86 S.Ct. at 1611.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">There then follows a brief discussion of the history and purpose of the privilege against self-incrimination, and a summary statement of the holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-13\">\u201cOur holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow but briefly stated it is this: the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d (Id. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">The entire opinion deals explicitly with statements obtained from the accused. It does not relate in any way to the type of case now before us. The only reference to police lineups appears at p. 453, 86 S.Ct. 1602, and deals with the misuse of a lineup to trick the accused into confessions, not with the use of a lineup for purposes of identification. And the discussion of the law, in part II of the opinion, deals primarily with the Fifth Amendment. Speaking of <em>Escobedo, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-15\">\u201cA different phase of the <em>Escobedo </em>decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning. There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation. In <em>Escobedo, </em>however, the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms. Rather, they denied his request for the assistance of counsel, 378 U.S. at 481, 488, 491, 84 S.Ct. at 1760, 1763, 1765. This heightened his dilemma, and made his later statements the product of this compulsion. Cf. Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 514, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1343, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963). The denial of the defendant\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege \u2014 to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation, blatant or subtle. The presence of counsel, in all the cases before us today, would be the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege. His presence would insure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.\u201d (Id. at 465-466, 86 S.Ct. at 1623.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Moreover, part III of the opinion makes it clear that the right to consult counsel, and the right to have counsel present, are to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-5\">\u201cThe circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators. Therefore, the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate today.\u201d (P. 469, 86 S.Ct. p. 1625.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-7\">\u201cEven preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process. Cf. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 485, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1762. Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.\u201d (P. 470, 86 S.Ct. p. 1625.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVMP\">\u201cThe financial ability of the individual has no relationship to the scope of the rights involved here. The privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all individuals. The need for counsel in order to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent. In fact, were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can retain an attorney, our decisions today would be of little significance.\u201d (P. 472, 86 S.Ct. p. 1626.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Once again, the Court limited its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbRg\">\u201cOur decision is not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime. See Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 492, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1765, 12 L.Ed. 2d 977. When an individual is in custody on probable cause, the police may, of course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him.\u201d (P. 477, 86 S.Ct. p. 1629.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-12\">\u201cAs we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions.\u201d (P. 481, 86 S.Ct. p. 1631.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">We think it clear that the foregoing cases do not require a holding that Gilbert had a right to consult counsel before being placed in a lineup, or to the presence of counsel at a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">The other cases relied upon are White v. State of Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 and Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 1961, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114. These cases, we think, are not remotely in point. In <em>Hamilton, </em>the Court held that a defendant had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at an Alabama preliminary hearing, because such a hearing is, in that state, \u201ca critical stage in a criminal proceeding.\u201d (P. 53, 82 S.Ct. p. 158.) In Alabama, the defense of insanity must then be pleaded, pleas in abatement must then be made, and motions to quash based upon defects in the drawing of a grand jury must then be made; otherwise, these rights are lost. The Court held that, at such a hearing, the defendant has a right to counsel. <em>White </em>is similar. It holds that White had a right to counsel at his Maryland preliminary hearing. There White, not represented by counsel, pleaded guilty at such a hearing. Later, upon arraignment, he pled not guilty. As his trial, the guilty plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>was used against him. The Court held that White\u2019s preliminary hearing was a \u201ccritical stage.\u201d Both of these cases dealt with proceedings of a formal nature, before a judge or magistrate, at which an ignorant defendant could (and in <em>White, </em>did) lose, through ignorance, rights that a lawyer could protect. Of course the defendant should have had counsel in those cases. But their relation to this case is, to say the least, difficult to discern. It is quite true that, unlike the first group of cases, they do not expressly involve the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is equally true that they do not lay down a rule that would require counsel at a police lineup. They merely require that a defendant have (or waive) counsel at a proceeding at which he loses rights that counsel could have protected. No doubt that is why they were cited in <em>Massiah </em>and in <em>Escobedo, </em>which applied their- rationale to the pre-trial loss of Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">More pertinent than any of the foregoing cases, we think, is Schmerber v. State of California, 1966, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. There a defendant, arrested for drunken driving, was compelled despite his refusal to do so on advice of counsel to give a sample of his blood to be tested for alcoholic content. After rejecting his Fifth Amendment claim, the Court turned to his Sixth Amendment right to counsel claim, and disposed of it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-6\">\u201cSince petitioner was not entitled to assert the privilege, he has no great\u00e9r right because counsel erroneously advised him that he could assert it. His claim is strictly limited to the failure of the police to respect his wish, reinforced by counsel\u2019s advice, to be left inviolate. No issue of counsel\u2019s ability to assist petitioner in respect of any rights he did possess is presented. The limited claim thus made must be rejected.\u201d (P. 766, 86 S.Ct. p. 1833)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">But it is asserted that here counsel could have assisted Gilbert by advising Gilbert not to participate, or seeing to it that the lineup was fairly conducted. This, however, begs the question left open by <em>Schmerber, </em>which is, could counsel have assisted him \u201cin respect of any rights he did possess?\u201d To answer this question in the affirmative would be to say that Gilbert and his counsel, not the police, had the right to decide whether a lineup or some other identification procedure should be held at all, and if it be held, how and under what circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">With one exception, the authorities to date are clear that these are not \u201crights [Gilbert] did possess.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">\u201cThere is no law or decision which says that a man, free or incarcerated, has a constitutional right not to be observed and possibly identified as the perpetrator of a crime even though no formal charges have been made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT2\">Rigney v. Hendrick, 3 Cir., 1965, 355 F.2d 710, 712.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">\u201cThe absence of counsel at the time of the confrontation at the scene of the crime did not deprive Appellant of a right to silence, a right to withhold evidence or any other right which could have been effectively asserted had counsel been present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">Kennedy v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 462, 466.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">\u201cIf Stovall had had counsel, what could counsel have done to thwart the identification? He could not have demanded Stovall\u2019s immediate release so that no one might see him. He could not have arranged to have Stovall continuously wear a hood or mask over his face to avoid identification, nor could he have ordered the police forthwith to halt their identification activities. Counsel would not have said \u2018Cease further efforts at identification: Stovall has admitted his guilt\u2019 because Stovall had not done so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">\u201cAgain adverting to the opinion in Kennedy, supra, counsel could not have prevented the hospital room identification because \u2018An accused has no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>to be viewed in a line-up rather than singly/ Here, as in Kennedy, counsel could not \u2018have altered the course of events\u2019 as to identification, and since no confession or \u2018any other evidence respecting which counsel could have rightfully advised Appellant to refuse to yield\u2019 was obtained, there was no deprivation of Sixth Amendment rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, 2 Cir., 1966, 355 F.2d 731, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The exception is Wade v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 358 F.2d 557. <em>Wade </em>is a two to one decision. Judge Tuttle wrote the majority opinion; Judge Jones dissented. The casting vote was by Judge Waterman of the Second Circuit, who was one of the three dissenters in United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra. The decision simply follows the dissent in that case. We decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The same arguments as to assistance that counsel might render could also be made as to the taking and analysis of blood samples (Schmerber v. State of California, supra), the taking and comparison of fingerprints (Smith v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 879), the obtaining and comparison of handwriting exemplars (State v. Fisher, Ore., 1966, 410 P.2d 216; People v. Graves, Cal., 1966, 49 Cal.Rptr. 386, 411 P.2d 114), and to many other investigative procedures. As to each of these activities, and others like them, it can be argued that matters of judgment and proper procedure can vitally affect the result. Why, then, should not defense counsel, accompanied if necessary by experts, participate in all of them, from beginning to end, to see that acceptable, fair procedures are used, scientific standards are maintained, and only the very best evidence is thus developed? One answer, we would think, lies in the need for expedition. Another is the disruptive effect upon investigators who would have opposing counsel breathing down their necks. We are inclined to doubt that once it began to appear that the evidence was likely to point to the guilt of the accused, his counsel\u2019s participation would be constructive. Another is that a criminal trial is not supposed to be a sporting contest. We conduct it as an adversary proceeding. But that does not mean that everything done by the state, preparatory to trial, for the purpose of proving or disproving guilt, is suspect as sloppy or biased or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Society has a legitimate interest in convicting the guilty, just as it has in seeing that the innocent are not tried or convicted, and in seeing that a person who is tried is tried fairly. See Williams v. United States, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 244, 345 F.2d 733, 736, separate opinion of Burger, J. Scientific crime detection plays a part in serving all of these interests. So does the police lineup. The defendant\u2019s protection against errors or mistakes lies in full exposure of the facts at trial, through cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence, and in the impartiality and good sense of the judge and jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">No doubt it will be said that all that we are concerned with is a lineup; that a lineup differs from the other investigatory activities that we have mentioned in that they are \u201cscientific\u201d while a lineup is not, that the lineup involves the active participation of the accused, and that we should await another day to talk about matters not now before us. But the difference is one of degree. And there is at least one reason applicable to the lineup, but not to the other activities mentioned, that further justifies holding that the state, not the defendant or his counsel, should continue to control it. The purpose of a lineup is to permit witnesses to the crime, often the victims, to identify the criminal. It is still unfortunately true, in this country at least, that in many cases witnesses need protection from intimidation and worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">It is said that English practice demonstrates that the presence of counsel at a lineup is helpful, and that in one American city, Philadelphia, when the police hold a lineup they notify the suspect\u2019s attorney and permit him to be present. (See Rigney v. Hendricks, 3 Cir., 1965, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>355 F.2d 710, 712.) These practices are illuminating,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but that does not require that they be elevated into constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Opinions may well differ as to whether a better procedure could have been followed at Gilbert\u2019s lineup. Thus it is claimed that the assembling of the witnesses in the same auditorium, and permitting them to communicate with each other, was calculated to produce a' consensus at the expense of individual judgment. The assumption seems to be that this is unfair. Not necessarily. Our own experience indicates the contrary; very often, in trying to recall some past event or fact, we find it helpful to discuss the matter with others who were present. Recollection by concensus may be more accurate than that by individual judgment. Whether that was so here would, we think, be for the jury to decide, not for defense counsel to have a right to decide before or during the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The testimony of witnesses who identify the defendant at a lineup can be as devastating to a defendant at trial as that of witnesses who testify to the results of fingerprints or handwriting comparison, or the chemical analysis of body fluids. In that sense, it can be said that such testimony may \u201cmake the trial no more than an appeal\u201d from the investigative activities of the police. (The quotation is from <em>Escobedo, </em>378 U.S. at 487, 84 S.Ct. at 1763). It can equally be said that the use of such testimony may critically affect the outcome of the trial. (Cf. <em>Hamilton </em>and <em>White, </em>supra.) But thus to use <em>Escobedo </em>or <em>Hamilton </em>or <em>White, </em>as Gilbert would have us do, and as the court did in <em>Wade, </em>supra, is to put those decisions to a use never contemplated. We refer again to the limiting language of the Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Massiah, Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda, </em>quoted above. And see the comments of Judge Burger in Kennedy v. United States, D.C. Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 462, 464-466 and Williams v. United States, 1965, 120 U.S. App.D.C. 244, 345 F.2d 733, 734-736 (separate opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">We cannot find support in any of the opinions of the Supreme Court for so broad a rule as is now pressed upon us, that the Sixth Amendment requires that the right to counsel be extended to all confrontations between the state and the accused during the course of a prosecution which may critically affect the outcome. Such a notion is flatly rejected in Schmerber v. State of California, supra. We have difficulty in imagining a \u201cconfrontation\u201d that could more \u201ccritically affect the outcome\u201d than the one that occurred in <em>Schmerber. </em>Moreover, the basic \u201cconfrontation\u201d at a lineup was not between the state and the accused; it was between the accused and eyewitnesses to the crime, including his victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">We are aware, as is Judge Friendly, of \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s new concept that the right to the assistance of counsel embraces activities outside the courtroom.\u201d (United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, dissenting opinion at p. 743, n. 3.) Such an awareness, however, does not answer the question here posed, namely, what activities outside the courtroom does the right embrace ? We doubt that Judge Friendly means <em>all </em>such activities; <em>Schmerber </em>shows the error of such a view. Other courts have rejected Sixth Amendment claims similar to those made by Gilbert. United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, 355 F.2d at 739 (en banc, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>6-3 decision); Kennedy v. United States, supra, D.C., 353 F.2d at 464-466; Williams v. United States, supra; State v. Fisher, supra, 410 P.2d at 216, 217; People v. Graves, supra, 411 P.2d at 115-116; People v. Gilbert, supra, 408 P.2d at 376, cert. granted, 384 U.S. 985, 86 S.Ct. 1902, 16 L.Ed.2d 1003 (involving the same lineup as is here involved); People v. Lopez, supra, 384 P.2d at 26-27. We also reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"> Let it now be assumed, however, that we are wrong, and that Gilbert did have a right to counsel at the lineup. What effect should the failure to honor the right have upon the availability of the testimony of the witnesses at trial ? Gilbert would have us hold that they should not be permitted to testify at all. The <em>Wade </em>case seems to agree. We cannot accept such a view. The concept of a tainted <em>witness, </em>as distinguished from tainted <em>evidence, </em>is to us a novel one. So far as we can discover, no court except the <em>Wade </em>court has yet embraced it. The courts have excluded that part of the testimony of a witness that describes what he saw or heard on an occasion when his seeing or hearing was in violation of a constitutional right of the accused. See Wong Sun v. United States, 1963, 371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. And under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine (Nardone v. United States, 1939, 308 U.S. 338, 339, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307) other evidence obtained by means of the unconstitutional activity has also been excluded. But, as is pointed out in <em>Nardone, </em>\u201cIf knowledge of them [the facts] is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (P. 341, 60 S.Ct. p. 268.) Here, every witness who was at the lineup had knowledge gained from an independent source. Each had actually seen one of the robberies and had seen Gilbert participating in it. Each identified him in the courtroom. Each such identification necessarily harked back to what the witness saw at the scene of the crime. The accuracy of the recollection of the witness may or may not have been bolstered or shaken during the lineup proceeding. But surely the knowledge gained from the independent source, at the scene of the crime, remained. We reject the idea that the witnesses should not have been permitted to testify at all because they participated in the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">What actually happened in Gilbert\u2019s case was that the government did not rely at all upon the identification that the witnesses made at the lineup. They simply described the crime and identified Gilbert in the courtroom. It was Gilbert who brought out the facts regarding the lineup during the cross-examination of the witnesses. On the basis of the evidence so elicited, he moved to suppress all of their testimony. The trial court denied the motion solely on the ground that the government did not rely upon or offer testimony as to the lineup identification. In this, we think that the court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">It is urged that, if the courtroom identification rests wholly or substantially upon the unlawful lineup identification, it should be excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree, and the court should have held a hearing to determine whether that is so. But, in the first place, the courtroom identification can never rest \u201cwholly\u201d upon the lineup. By definition, the witness is one who saw the criminal at another time in connection with the crime. In identifying the accused at the lineup, he is necessarily relying upon knowledge independently and legally acquired, knowledge that he had before he went to the lineup, and, when he testifies in court, he is necessarily also using such independently acquired knowledge. The most that the lineup can be said to do is to afford an opportunity to focus the witness\u2019 attention upon the suspect, and to enable the witness to relate his knowledge about the criminal to the man who stands before him. It may be that his inner conviction as to the accuracy of that knowledge will, in some cases, be strengthened by his par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ticipation in the lineup. If there is any way in which the degree to which that is so can be measured and decided at the hearing suggested, we do not know what it is. The human mind is not a series of separate compartments of knowledge. Pretending that it is may enable a court to think that it is effectively carrying out a constitutional duty. But we can hardly conceive of a more futile or unrealistic exercise in judicial fact finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said, in Smith v. United States, 1963, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 324 F. 2d 879, 881-882:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-6\">\u201cBut a witness is not an inanimate object which like contraband narcotics, a pistol or stolen goods, \u2018speak for themselves.\u2019 The proffer of a living witness is not to be mechanically equated with the proffer of inanimate evidentiary objects illegally seized. The fact that the name of a potential witness is disclosed to police is of no evidentiary significance, per se, since the living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and volition interact to determine what testimony he will give. The uniqueness of this human process distinguishes the evidentiary character of a witness from the relative immutability of inanimate evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">There the police had learned the name of an eye witness to the crime from a suspect during a period of illegal detention. At trial, defendant sought to exclude his testimony as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d The Court of Appeals held that the trial judge was right in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">More closely in point is Payne v. United States, 1961, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 94, 294 F.2d 723. There, the victim of a crime identified Payne as its perpetrator. This was done during a lineup which was claimed to have been held in violation of the rule in Mallory v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-10\">\u201cAs to the identification, the trial judge allowed Warren to identify Payne as he sat in the courtroom, but did not permit any reference to the identification made at police headquarters. Whether this last restriction was necessary under Mallory we need not say. However, it narrows the issue before us.\u201d (294 F.2d at 726.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">The court rejected the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine as applied to such a case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-12\">\u201cThe consequence of accepting appellant\u2019s contention in the present situation would be that Warren would be forever precluded from testifying against Payne in court, merely because he had complied with the request of the police that he come to police headquarters and had there identified Payne as the robber. Such a result is unthinkable. The suppression of the testimony of the complaining witness is not the right way to control the conduct of the police, or to advance the administration of justice. The rights of \"the accused in a case like the present are adequately protected when the complaining witness takes the stand in open court, for examination and cross-examination. Cf. Frisbie v. Collins, 1952, 342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541.\u201d (Id. at 727.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">What Judge Washington there said is, we think, both eminently sensible and fully applicable here. See also to the same effect, Jacobson v. United States, 8 Cir., 1966, 356 F.2d 685; Williams v. United States, 1965, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 244, 345 F.2d 733; Edwards v. United States, 1964, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 330 F.2d 849.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>In Gilbert\u2019s ease, the government did exactly what Judge Friendly said it should do in United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, 2 Cir., 355 F.2d at 745:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An5G\">\u201cThe self-created dilemma of the concurring opinion, that exclusion of the hospital identification would prevent identification at the trial, is illusory; exclusion of the former would simply have required the prosecutor to rest on Mrs. Behrendt\u2019s memory of the night of the dreadful crime and on her courtroom identification. If, in this posture, defense counsel had brought out the hospital identification, as no experienced counsel would, he would have had only himself to blame.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Gilbert had the right to, and did, bring out on cross-examination the facts as to the lineup. From this he could argue that the lineup was unfair, that but for the lineup the witnesses would have been unable to identify him at trial, and that therefore they should not be believed. This is the most that he was entitled to, even assuming that the lineup procedure violated his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\n<em>FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-7\">\u201cNo State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d United States Const., Amendment 14, Section 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">Gilbert asserts that he was denied equal protection of the laws because he was in jail and could thus be placed in a lineup, while if he had been able to make bail, he could not be. This theory was considered at length, and rejected, by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Rigney v. Hendrick, 1965, 355 F.2d 710, 714-715. We agree with the views there expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">Gilbert urges that certain admissions that he made to an F.B.I. agent should have been excluded because they were involuntary.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A motion to suppress was made, and oral testimony was taken. There were two interviews, on March 17 and March 20, 1964. The government, however, offered only statements made by Gilbert on March 20. The court denied the motion. Gilbert does not contend that the evidence does not support the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He makes a narrower point. At the March 17 interview Gilbert asked whether he could make a \u201cdeal\u201d whereby, if he were to confess, the members of his family \u2014 his mother, brother, and wife \u2014 would not be bothered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>It was only after Gilbert offered the deal that there was discussion about his family. They were under investigation for possible violation of the \u201charboring\u201d and \u201creceiving\u201d statute. He urges that this proposal, which he initiated \u2014 and which the agent flatly declined \u2014 so infected or influenced what happened at the next interview, on March 20, as to render what was said involuntary or inadmissible on some other theory, not clearly defined, and that the trial judge refused to consider whether what happened on March 20 was so influenced by what happened on March 17 that the March 20 confession should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The record (the pertinent portions are set out in the margin),<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> simply does not bear out these contentions. The court ruled that the March 20 statements were voluntary. We think that to isolate statements made by the trial judge, to the effect that he would not rule on the voluntariness of the statements of March 17, and to conclude on that basis that he also refused to consider the bearing, if any, of the March 17 interview upon the March 20 statements, is unfair to the trial judge and is an improper attempt to create error where none exists. The government had stated that it did not intend to bring the earlier statements in, and there was no need for an express holding on their admissibility. But the record, read as a whole, does clearly show that what happened at the March 17 interview was considered when the court ruled on the March 20 statements. More than that we cannot, should not, and do not demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Gilbert says that evidence as to his having committed another offense, with which he was not charged and for which he had not been convicted, was improperly introduced against him.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Consideration of this contention requires some exposition of the record. One of the banks that Gilbert was accused of robbing was a branch of the Security First National Bank at 174th and Crenshaw, Los Angeles (Torrance), on or about Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>ber 6, 1963. Gilbert called as a witness one Goslaw, who testified that he had a savings account in that bank in 1963, opened by him in July or August and closed about a month later. Gilbert, he said, accompanied him when he opened the account. He also was accompanied by Gilbert when he went to the bank at various later times. He made the visits appear quite innocent. On cross-examination, Goslaw admitted that he had been convicted of five felonies, including a March 2, 1964 conviction of armed robbery of a bank. He testified that on the occasions when he and Gilbert visited the bank, Gilbert did not display a gun, did not point it at a teller, and did not jump the counter and take money from the cash drawers.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Gilbert took the stand on his own behalf. He stated that he knew what \u201ccasing a robbery\u201d meant, and that he had been in the Torrance Security First National Bank before December 6,1963, and saw where the vault was, where the tellers\u2019 windows were, and that there were no armed guards. He went there a number of times. The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-5\">\u201cQ. And in fact, the gentleman that went with you to the bank, Mr. Goslaw, was a crime partner of yours, was he not, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-6\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">\u201cQ. In fact, the two of you had robbed another Security First National Bank in Culver City, had you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-8\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-9\">MR. WEEDMAN: Objection, your Honor, I think it is highly improper for counsel to inject something like that, unless he is now in a position to prove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">MR. O\u2019CONNELL: Your Honor, I am in a position to show that Mr. Gilbert admitted that he had robbed the Security First National Bank in Culver City with Mr. Goslaw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-11\">MR. WEEDMAN: Well, I am going to certainly object to that, your Honor. If counsel is going to offer this as part of his case in chief, then he had an opportunity to do so * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-14\">\u201cHe is now attempting to sandbag, if you will, the defendant with this kind of very loose allegation with respect to what Mr. Gilbert supposedly said at some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-15\">\u201cWe have no evidence of such a conference, such a conversation. We have no evidence as to what led to it. It is very improper and I will certainly object to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Goslaw testified, of course, since the direct examination. You shouldn\u2019t, as counsel for the Goverment knows, be getting into matters which you are not in a position to show by asking questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-17\">\u201cMr. O\u2019CONNELL: Your Honor, I am in a position, I will represent that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC-\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-19\">\u201cMR. O\u2019CONNELL: I was not going to bring it out, except Mr. Gilbert put Mr. Goslaw on and therefore I can show, the connection and the interest between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, I think you are entitled to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-21\">\u201cMR. WEEDMAN: Is counsel making an offer of proof that Mr. Goslaw participated in the robbery of this particular bank ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-22\">\u201cMR. O\u2019CONNELL: No, this Security First National here I am not. I am stating that Mr. Gilbert stated to Mr. LaJeunesse that he and Mr. Goslaw participated in the robbery of the Security First National Bank at Culver City, and that was the bank that Mr. Goslaw has already testified he pleaded guilty to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Objection overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-24\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-25\">\u201cQ. Did you rob the Security First National Bank of Culver City in company with Mr. Goslaw ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-26\">\u201cA. No, sir, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-27\">On rebuttal, the government called F.B.I. Agent LaJeunesse. He testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>following occurred at the March 20 interview of Gilbert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-5\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. LaJeunesse, I don\u2019t want to repeat what you have testified to earlier in the trial, but Mr. Gilbert testified that he could not remember any statements about .45 caliber automatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-6\">Let me refer to the robbery \u2014 was the robbery of the Security First National Bank in Torrance, California, on December 6, 1963, discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-8\">\u201cQ. What did Mr. Gilbert say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A06\">\u201cA. He told me he had participated in the robbery and that he had carried a .45 caliber automatic while he was committing the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-9\">\u201cQ. Now, was the robbery of the Huntington Park First Savings and Loan Association in South Gate, California, on Tweedy Boulevard, on December 20,1953, discussed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-10\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-11\">\u201cQ. And what was the conversation concerning that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-12\">\u201cA. Again admitting robbing that bank and again admitted having carried a .45 caliber automatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-13\">\u201cQ. Was the robbery of the United California Bank in Long Beach, California, on December 23, 1963, discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-15\">\u201cQ. And what was that discussion ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-16\">\u201cA. Again admitted that robbery and again admitted he carried a .45 caliber automatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-17\">\u201cQ. Was the robbery of the Home Savings and Loan Association in Highland Park on December 31st, 1963, discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-19\">\u201cQ. What was that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-20\">\u201cA. He admitted that robbery and again he carried a .45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-21\">\u201cQ. In addition, was there any discussion about the robbery of the Security First National Bank in Culver City, California, on October 28,1963, Mr. LaJeunesse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-23\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-24\">\u201cQ. Would you relate that, please, Mr. LaJeunesse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-25\">\u201cA. He admitted he had participated in that robbery and with him was Ralph Goslaw, and they had utilized a tan or beige-colored Oldsmobile, which they had stolen for the purpose of a getaway car. After the robbery they abandoned the car and drove off from the switch spot in a truck, which he, Gilbert, had previously rented from a lot in Long Beach under the name of George Swenson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-26\">Following the robbery he returned the truck to that lot and I asked him again about a weapon and again he used a .45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-27\">\u201cQ. Was there any discussion about the amount of money that had been taken in that robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-28\">\u201cA. I believe there was, yes. I didn\u2019t have the exact amount with me at that time and I don\u2019t \u2014 -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-29\">\u201cMR. O\u2019CONNELL: I have no further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-30\">The first four institutions are those named in the indictment. The last is the one mentioned in the cross-examination of Goslaw. On cross-examination, Gilbert\u2019s attorney asked LaJeunesse the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-31\">\u201cQ. Did the defendant tell you he had taken $4600.00 from a bank in Culver City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-32\">\u201cA. May I refresh my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-33\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-34\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-35\">\u201cQ. How much was taken from that bank \u2014 withdraw that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-36\">As a matter of fact, it was only approximately $2200.00 that was taken at that bank, isn\u2019t that so ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-37\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t tell you right now how much was taken, I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>\u201cQ. Have you any record there that might help you in that regard ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">\u201cA. Perhaps Mr. O\u2019Connell \u2014 I don\u2019t believe I have any here, no, on the Culver City robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">* \u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">\u201cQ. You were asked by the Assistant U.S. Attorney a moment ago if you believed Mr. Gilbert\u2019s statements to you concerning these various robberies and I believe your answer was yes, you did believe him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">As part of his conversations with you he said that he had with another robbed a bank in Culver City, that is correct, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-8\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-9\">\u201cQ. Your investigation concluded that Mr. Gilbert had nothing to do whatever with the Culver City bank robbery isn\u2019t that true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-10\">\u201cA. No, that is not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-11\">\u201cQ. Has he been indicted for that Culver City robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-12\">\u201cA. Not to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">\u201cQ. Do you have any witnesses who say Mr. Gilbert was a party to that bank robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-14\">\u201cA. Was that witness or witnesses ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay8\">\u201cQ. Witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-15\">\u201cA. There is one I know of that has identified him and perhaps more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: We are not going to get into the problem of the Culver City bank robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-17\">\u201cMR. WEEDMAN: Yes. Very well, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-18\">The foregoing is the entire record relating to this subject matter. Gilbert\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection was hardly an adequate one; throughout, it is tied to the government\u2019s ability to prove the charge. When government counsel stated what he was prepared to prove, Gilbert\u2019s counsel said no more. The balance of the testimony came in without objection. We doubt that Gilbert is now in a position to complain, even though the government does not rely upon the inadequacy of the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">The government argues that the cross-examination of Goslaw was proper, to show the true nature of the relation between him and Gilbert. Goslaw\u2019s testimony had made Gilbert\u2019s visit to the Torrance branch appear quite innocent. The government sought to give it a different cast by the questions asked Goslaw about those visits. This was followed up in the questioning of Gilbert and by the testimony of LaJeunesse. We think that if Goslaw had participated in the Torrance branch robbery, with which Gilbert was charged, the government could have brought out that fact, by questioning either of them (Gilbert having taken the stand) in order to weaken the effect of Goslaw\u2019s testimony. We also think that it was proper to do the same thing, and for the same purpose, in relation to the robbery of the Culver City branch, where as here, it was a similar and closely contemporaneous robbery. The fact that Goslaw and Gilbert were in \u201cbusiness\u201d together was material, Gilbert having, in effect, vouched for Goslaw by offering him as a witness. The fact that the \u201cbusiness\u201d was bank robbery does not make the testimony inadmissible. While the procedure followed by the government was unusual, we do not think that, under the peculiar facts, it was erroneous. Cf. Greatreaks v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">If we assume that, in this case, the evidence should have been excluded, we do not think that the error was serious enough to require a reversal. We do not deal here with evidence unconstitutionally obtained, as to which the Supreme Court has laid down a rather strict rule. (See Fahy v. State of Connecticut, 1963, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed. 2d 171.) Here, we deal with Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure: \u201cAny error * * * which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d There was no objection to the testimony of LaJeunesse; Gilbert\u2019s counsel carried the inquiry even further. The government did not mention the matter in argument. Gilbert did. No limiting instruction was asked; no objection to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>instructions was made. The court told the jury \u201cThe defendant is not on trial for any act or conduct not alleged in the indictment.\u201d And the evidence of guilt in this case was overwhelming. See Bushaw v. United States, 9 Cir., 1965, 353 F.2d 477, 481; Baker v. United States, 9 Cir., 1963, 310 F.2d 924, 929-930; Cellino v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 941.</p>\n<p id=\"ART\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. On cross-examination the arresting officer testified that he did not \u201cknow\u201d the arrested man to be appellant, even after he had seen the hair piece and glasses. But he also testified that he did not \u201cknow\u201d it to be appellant until he had checked his fingerprints, even though appellant had in the meantime exposed an identifying tattoo and twice expressly acknowledged his identity. It is clear that the agent was referring to positive identification and not probable basis for belief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-9\">. Appellant also contends that Beck v. State of Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 97, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964), imposed a duty upon the government to produce the testimony of the superior officer of the arresting agent from whom the latter obtained the information relied upon to constitute probable cause. In this case, unlike Beck v. State of Ohio, the arresting officer identified his informant (the superior officer) and detailed the information he supplied. We think this was enough in the absence of some suggestion, either from appellant or on the face of the record, sufficient to alert the trial court to a need for further inquiry into the reliability of the information. See Travis v. United States, 362 F.2d 477, 481 (9th Cir. 1966); Williams v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 308 F.2d 326, 327 (1962). Cf. United States v. Bianco, 189 F.2d 716, 719 (3d Cir. 1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b976-6\">. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has gone farther, permitting detention of substantial duration without probable cause. See United States v. Middleton, 344 F.2d 78, 80-81 (2d Cir. 1965) (dictum); United States v. Vita, 294 F.2d 524, 529-530 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\">. Detention for identification alone is to be distinguished from detention for interrogation, which may collide with the premises of the accusatorial system (Leagre, supra, 54 J.Crim.L., at 417-18), or from detention as a subterfuge to justify a warrantless search. Cf. State of Montana v. Tomich, 332 F.2d 987, 989 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b977-17\">. This robbery is not one of the four involved in this appeal, which involved other banks and occurred a month earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. One of the pictures was received in evidence at the government\u2019s suggestion. However, the government made no affirmative use of the photograph at trial, either in examining the witnesses or in closing argument, and suggested its admission only after appellant had it marked for identification and used it extensively in cross-examination. In substance, if not in form, the photo itself was introduced by appellant, and not by the government, and appellant has not argued to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b978-14\">. We pass the fact that appellant does not appear to have expressly raised this issue by an appropriate objection in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. Since Weaver was a confessed participant in the events which he reported, the adequacy of <em>Ms </em>basis for the information he provided could not be questioned. Cf. Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b979-8\">. Weaver was unlike the usual informer, most of whom are encountered in narcotics eases. Comment, 53 Calif.L.Rev. 840, 850 n. 47 (1965). They are usually witnessing to secret transactions to which only they and the accused were privy. They are often informing for hire. Commonly addicted themselves, they are often motivated by hope or promise of personal immunity from prosecution or leniency in punishment. See Note, 25 Ohio St.L.J. 502, 535 (1964); see also Jones v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 266 F.2d 924, 928 (1959) (Miller, X, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">In consequence, they are \u201cfrequently \u2018monstrous liars.\u2019 See Perry v.

He was taken there without benefit of counsel and at the time he was taken he informed the marshals he did not want to attend and demanded counsel, and he was taken anyway. It is in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, your Honor, and the defendant asks all witnesses who attended this March 26 line-up and identified him, that their testimony be suppressed. It violates the self-incriminating clause of the Fifth, and the assistance of counsel of the Sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, that issue hasn\u2019t been \u2014 we are not involved in that issue at this time.

This was dictum because, under Adams v. People of State of New York, 1904, 192 U.S. 585, 598, 24 S.Ct. 372, 48 L.Ed. 575, the evidence would then have been admissible anyway.

Peyton, 4 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 199, is not based upon fifth amendment grounds, but upon the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. The court strongly disapproved of the method used. We might agree, but we doubt if the matter was of constitutional dimension. We would have thought that, like the claim that a witness lied, the question would be one for the jury to resolve.

Our own review of the testimony convinces us that a contrary ruling would have been clearly erroneous. If a record can ever demonstrate the voluntariness of a confession, this one does. If ever a defendant knew his rights, and was fully prepared to make the most of them, Gilbert was that defendant. At the March 17 interview he was given the full warning now required by Miranda v. State of Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. He expressed admiration both for the Alhambra, California and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania police because they had treated him so correctly. He had hoped that they would beat him, as he thought that such a beating would help him. At the March 17 interview, Gilbert made only one admission, that he had been seen by a witness in a car after one of the robberies. This was not offered at the trial. Otherwise, when asked about the bank robberies, he said he wanted to talk to his attorney and that after that he might \u201cclean all those jobs up.\u201d He asked to see the F.B.I. agent on March 20, and, when he met with the agent, told him that he had talked to his attorney, who had told him \u201cto go ahead and discuss these bank robberies.\u201d He then admitted the robberies. No deal was discussed, much less offered. Gilbert, at the hearing, testified to the contrary, but the court expressly believed the agent and disbelieved Gilbert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b995-10\">. \u201cTHE COURT: No. I have listened to this testimony very carefully and I have to conclude that the statements of the 20th were voluntary, because there was ample time \u2014 Mr. Gilbert talked to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t talk to him about this, but he told Mr. LaJaunesse that he had talked to him and the attorney told him it was appropriate to admit to these robberies that were involved in here, not the one in Alhambra.

Appellant sought to suppress their courtroom identification on the ground that the lineup violated appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">The circumstances surrounding the lineup, so far as they appear in this record, are as follows. The lineup was held on March 26,1964, subsequent to the return of both indictments, and after appellant had retained counsel. Appellant objected to participating and demanded the aid of his counsel. Appellant\u2019s protests were ignored and he was required to participate in his counsel\u2019s absence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">Approximately thirteen men, including appellant, appeared on stage. The prisoners were identified by number. They were required to approach the center of the stage individually, turn, try on various articles of clothing, and answer questions, including whether they owned an automobile, where they were arrested, and whether when arrested they were armed. They were required to say certain phrases used during the robberies- \u2014 \u25a0 \u201cFreeze, this is a stick up\u201d; \u201cThis is a holdup\u201d; \u201cThis is a heist\u201d; \u201cDon\u2019t anyone move\u201d; \u201cEmpty your cash drawer\u201d\u2014 to shout these phrases and repeat them in a quiet voice, while standing still and while walking, both normally and at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">Witnesses from all four robberies were assembled in the audience. After each prisoner went through the general routine, the FBI agent in charge asked if the witnesses wished to see any of the prisoners again. The witnesses were instructed to call out the numbers of any prisoner they recognized, and told that if they had doubts, this was the time to see the prisoners a second time, and to ask them to repeat phrases used in their respective robberies. The witnesses called out the numbers of two or three of the prisoners, including appellant, many of them calling out appellant\u2019s number. The prisoners thus selected were asked by various witnesses to repeat given phrases, walk in a particular way, or try on particular articles of clothing. Appellant was asked to speak loudly, to walk rapidly and slowly while repeating certain phrases, to speak more loudly (which one witness testified appellant refused to do), and to put on a hat (which two of the witnesses testified he at first refused to do). The witnesses talked among themselves as the lineup progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\"><em>Fifth Amendment. </em>Requiring a prisoner to expose himself to view in a lineup does not, per se, violate the privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Chief Judge Tuttle recently pointed out in Wade v. United States, 358 F.2d 557 (5th Cir. 1966), when Justice Holmes formulated the distinction between compelled communication (which is prohibited) and compelled exposure of the body (which is not), he expressly reserved the question of \u201chow far a court would go in compelling a man to exhibit himself,\u201d in view of the Fifth Amendment stricture against self-incrimination, Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 253, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Eminent authority suggests that compelling the accused to produce a voice exemplar may in itself constitute prohibited self-incrimination. Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 31 (1959); Weintraub, 10 Vand.L.Rev. 485, 504-05 (1957) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And it has been recently held that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes a state from relying upon a pretrial voice identification \u201csecured by a process in which the search for truth is made secondary to the quest for a conviction.\u201d Palmer v. Peyton, 359 F.2d 199 (4th Cir. 1966). See also United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, 355 F.2d 731, 738 (2d Cir. 1966). But the question of possible Fifth Amendment violation need not be pursued, for in any event, in the writer\u2019s view, appellant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\"><em>Sixth Amendment. </em>Since appellant was indicted prior to the lineup, the prosecution against him was unquestionably underway. The rationale of Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), White v. State of Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), required that appellant receive the aid of counsel in all confrontations with the prosecutor which might critically affect the prosecution\u2019s outcome, including confrontations which occurred outside the courtroom. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, supra; Massiah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">What takes place during the lineup might lay the foundation for conviction as surely as responses to extra-judicial interrogation. It might, just as clearly, reduce to mere form the right to have guilt or innocence determined at a public trial before a judge in an orderly courtroom, protected by the procedural safeguards of the law, and effectively assisted by counsel. See Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 204, 84 S.Ct. 1199 (1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The results of the lineup, like those of an interrogation, might well \u201cmake the trial no more than an appeal\u201d from the prior uncounseled confrontation between appellant and the prosecution. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. at 487, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977. Since the lineup might critically affect the outcome of the trial, appellant was entitled to counsel\u2019s aid. Wade v. United States, 358 F.2d 557 (5th Cir. 1966).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">But it is said that counsel could be of no assistance to an accused at a lineup; and that to require the presence of counsel would be an empty formality. I cannot agree, either generally or with respect to this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">An accused needs counsel\u2019s advice in deciding whether to participate\u2019 in the lineup at all, and, if he does participate, whether to condition his participation upon the prosecutor\u2019s agreement to arrangements which would assure a fairer proceeding and a more reliable result\u2014 for example, by affording defense counsel a prior opportunity to question the identification witnesses, by selecting participants in the lineup who are not grossly dissimilar from the accused in physical appearance, and by fairly conducting the lineup itself. An illuminating discussion of some of the factors which counsel would be required to weigh in advising the accused in this connection appears in a recent paper by David Napley, Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, where the right of the accused to assistance of counsel at \u201cidentification parades\u201d is recognized.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>If the accused decides to participate, counsel\u2019s mere presence during the lineup proceeding will afford protection against abuses which a secret lineup could only encourage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, counsel could advise the accused whether to accede to particular demands for verbal responses and physical movements. He could appeal to the prosecutor to eliminate unfair procedures at the moment of their appearance, and, if need be, could seek the aid of a protective court order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In short, the presence of counsel at the lineup would serve to preserve the benefits which we attribute to our accusatorial, adversary system of justice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Turning to the present lineup, it is obvious even on this sparse record that counsel might have done much to guide appellant\u2019s conduct, and to assure a fairer proceeding. Appellant\u2019s need for assistance in deciding whether to condition his participation or refuse to participate at all was especially acute in view of the prior exposure to appellant\u2019s photographs of all the witnesses \u2014 several had examined pictures of appellant repeatedly over a period of months.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, the questions asked (particularly whether appellant was armed when arrested), and the nature of the demonstrations which appellant was required to perform raised problems as to which counsel could have been helpful. Finally, the practice of assembling all of the witnesses in the same auditorium, enabling them to communicate with each other freely and to inform each other of their impressions both directly and by calling out the number of the prisoner they recognized, was calculated to produce a consensus at the expense of individual judgment, and might well have been avoided, either at the request of counsel or in response to a protective order. Wade v. United States, 358 F.2d 557 (5th Cir. 1966). See United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, 355 F.2d at 744 (Friendly, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The Supreme Court of California has held that appellant was not entitled to counsel at the lineup, essentially on the grounds that his privilege against self-incrimination was not impaired, that he was required to do no more at a lineup than he might have been required to do at trial, and that counsel could have determined whether the lineup was fairly conducted by the use of pretrial discovery of prosecution witnesses and cross-examination at trial. People v. Gilbert, 47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365, 376-377 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">But the right to counsel is not limited to situations in which the privilege against self-incrimination is at stake. Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 465 n. 35, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966). Assistance of counsel is required for purposes other than that of advising the accused of his right to remain silent. Escobedo had been advised of that right (378 U.S. at 499, 84 S.Ct. 1758 (White, J., dissenting)), and the matters held to require the advice of counsel in Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 53-54, 82 S.Ct. 157 (1961), did not relate to the privilege against self-incrimination. See United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, 355 F.2d at 743 (Friendly, J., dissenting). But see id. at 740 n. 1 (Lumbard, C. J., concurring.) As noted, the rationale of the Supreme Court decisions in this area is that preservation of the substance of the right to public trial with the assistance of eoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>sel requires that the right to counsel be extended to all confrontations between the state and the accused during the course of the prosecution which may critically affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Nor is it enough to say that an accused is required to do no more at lineup than he could be compelled to do at trial. At trial he has a lawyer. At counsel\u2019s request a judge might order the segregation of identification witnesses, and take other appropriate steps to enhance the fairness and reliability of the identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Finally, even if California\u2019s pretrial criminal discovery system were available in federal courts, it could not be realistically contended that subsequent interrogation of the witnesses to a secret lineup would serve as a reasonable substitute for counsel\u2019s presence and participation in the proceeding itself. Even if what actually occurred could be accurately determined by these means, nothing could then be done to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Since the lineup identifications of appellant were the product of illegal activity, they were not admissible in evidence, for \u201ctestimony as to matters observed during an unlawful invasion has been excluded in order to enforce the basic constitutional policies.\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). However, the government did not offer proof of the lineup identifications. Testimony of the witnesses on direct examination was limited to identification of appellant as he sat in the courtroom.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Solely for the reason that the lineup identifications were not part of the government\u2019s case in chief, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">However, the fact that the government did not rely directly upon the lineup identifications was not a sufficient ground for denying appellant\u2019s motion. In order to make the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule fully effective, it is extended \u201cas well to the indirect as the direct products\u201d of unconstitutional police activity. Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 484, 83 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Although deterring violation of constitutional rights is a vital objective, it is also important that evidence relevant to' the issue of guilt or innocence be freely received. In an effort to accommodate these conflicting interests the Supreme Court has limited the exclusionary rule. Evidence traceable to an unconstitutional search may nonetheless be received if the government shows it was or would have been obtained from an \u201cindependent source\u201d (Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920) (dictum)), or if the connection between the search and the evidence is \u201cso attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 268, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939) (dictum); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485-487, 83 S.Ct. 407 (1963). See Maguire, 55 J.Crim.L. 307 (1964); Comment, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 938, 1024 (1966). Thus the question in the present case is whether the courtroom identifications were \u201c \u2018come at by exploitation\u2019 of the unlawful lineup \u2018or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d Wong Sun v. United States, supra, 371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417 (quoting from Maguire, Evidence of Guilt 221).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">There has been some suggestion that a courtroom identification can never be freed of the taint of prior illegal observation of the accused. Wade v. Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ed States, 358 F.2d 557 (5th Cir. 1966); United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, 355 F.2d 731, 742 (2d Cir. 1966) (Lumbard, C. J., concurring); Broeder, 42 Neb.L.Rev. 483, 534-35 (1963).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the other hand, it has sometimes been assumed, from dictum in Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939), that the connection between the two is always to be treated as so attenuated as to render the courtroom identification admissible. United States ex rel. Stovall v. Denno, supra, 355 F.2d at 745 (Friendly, J., dissenting); Williams v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 244, 345 F.2d 733, 736 (1965) (Burger, J., concurring). Cf. Edwards v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 330 F.2d 849, 851 (1964); Payne v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 94, 294 F.2d 723, 727 (D.C.Cir. 1961); Monroe v. United States, 98 U.S. App.D.C. 228, 234 F.2d 49, 56 (1956). See also Bernstein, 37 Ill.L.Rev. 99, 105 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Neither extreme accommodates the interests involved. If courtroom identifications are invariably admitted no matter how clearly it may appear that they rest wholly or substantially upon violation of constitutional right, the interest in deterrence is wholly ignored. On the other hand, if courtroom identifications by witnesses to illegal lineups are invariably excluded no matter how clearly it may appear that they rested upon the witnesses\u2019- observations at the scene of the crime and were not influenced by viewing the accused at the lineup, the interest in receiving relevant evidence is sacrificed with too little cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">As in other situations in which evidence is challenged as tainted by an illegal activity, a reasonable accommodation between the conflicting interests requires the trial judge to determine whether in light of all the circumstances a substantial relationship exists between the illegal activity and the challenged testimony. See generally Maguire, 55 J.Crim.L. 307 (1964). If a substantial relationship is found, then the government may have benefited from its wrongful conduct, and the interest in deterrence requires exclusion of the courtroom identification. If the relationship is remote or tenuous, the interest in furthering the search for truth must prevail. Thus in Jacobson v. United States, 356 F.2d 685 (8th Cir. 1966), when objection was made to testimony of the witness Peterson, identifying the accused, on the ground that the courtroom identification was based upon observation of the accused by Peterson during a period of illegal detention, \u201cA hearing was held in the absence of the jury, at which Peterson testified positively that he was able to identify appellant as the same person he saw in Williams on December 18, 1963 without regard to having seen appellant in the jail on November 10, 1964. The court then overruled the motion to suppress, but excluded the officer\u2019s testimony by excluding any reference to the so-called \u2018jailhouse identification.\u2019\u201d 356 F.2d at 687.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>The burden rested upon the appellant to establish that the lineup was illegal and that there was a reasonable possibility that attendance of the witnesses at the lineup tainted their courtroom identifications. The burden would then pass to the government to convince the trial court that the evidence was free of taint. Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1940). Cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n, 378 U.S. 52, 79, n. 18, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964); Collins v. Beto, 348 F.2d 823, 827 (5th Cir. 1965); United States v. Tane, 329 F.2d 848, 853 (2d Cir. 1964); United States v. Paroutian, 299 F.2d 486, 489 (2d Cir. 1962); United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629, 636 (2d Cir. 1950), cert. denied 342 U.S. 920, 72 S.Ct. 362, 96 L.Ed. 688 (1952); Goldstein v. United States, 120 F.2d 485, 488 (2d Cir. 1941), aff\u2019d on other ground, 316 U.S. 114, 62 S.Ct. 1000, 86 L.Ed. 1312 (1942); Maguire, 55 J.Crim.L. 307, 309 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Appellant discharged his burden of demonstrating the illegality of the lineup. And the details of the lineup procedure which were disclosed, plus testimony of several of the witnesses that they did not identify appellant until the procedure was well advanced, may have been enough to establish the reasonable possibility that the courtroom identifications were in part the product of the lineup. On the other hand, the testimony of some of the witnesses indicated that their courtroom identifications reflected what they saw at the time of the particular robbery, unaffected by the intervening illegal lineup. But the trial judge did not decide the issue. Instead, he denied appellant\u2019s request for a hearing at which the facts necessary to a decision of the issue could have been developed. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Appellant contends that admissions which he made to an FBI agent should not have been received in evidence because they were improperly induced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">After appellant had been indicted and while he was in custody, he was questioned on two occasions by an FBI agent. The admissions in question were made at the second interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">The FBI agent opened the first interview, held on March 17, 1964, by advising appellant of his right to consult with counsel, and to refuse to give a statement. In reply, appellant informed the FBI agent that he had retained an attorney and that before making a statement he wished to have his attorney\u2019s advice. The FBI agent persevered, and the interview continued for nearly three hours. In the course of the interview the agent inquired about appellant\u2019s family, telling appellant that he was doing so for the purpose of determining whether they had harbored appellant while he was a fugitive from arrest [in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071], or had received money which appellant had stolen from a bank [in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(c)]. The agent recalled that appellant replied, \u201cI want to leave my family out of this. I have caused them enough trouble already.\u201d The agent responded, \u201cApparently you have.\u201d Appellant inquired, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d and the agent said, \u201cWell, you know we talked to your mother.\u201d The agent then went on to tell appellant that his mother was ill, probably with cancer; that his brother\u2019s children were being abused by their schoolmates as a result of.publicity concerning appellant; and that appellant\u2019s mother, brother, and sister-in-law were under investigation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>\u25a0determine whether they had violated the statutes referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">There was a discussion between appellant and the FBI agent regarding the possibility of a \u201cdeal\u201d by which appellant would confess to the bank robberies in return for assurances that no further action would be taken against his family. The FBI agent stopped the questioning, left the room, telephoned an assistant United States Attorney, told him of the discussion, and asked whether the interview should continue in the absence of appellant\u2019s counsel. The FBI agent received no direct answer to this question, but was told to advise appellant that as of that time no process was outstanding against appellant\u2019s mother, brother, or sister-in-law. The FBI agent returned to the interview room and so advised appellant. Appellant told the FBI agent that he would talk with his attorney and contact the FBI agent later.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Near the close of this interview appellant made an admission with respect to one of the robberies, but this admission was not offered as evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">Appellant testified that he spoke to his attorney on March 18th or 19th, but the attorney declined to advise him on the ground that he represented appellant only as to a pending state charge, and not as to the federal charges. Having heard nothing further from his family, appellant decided to call the FBI agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">On March 20th appellant telephoned the FBI agent and arranged to see him. The FBI agent again advised appellant of his rights. Appellant informed the FBI agent that appellant\u2019s attorney had told him to go ahead. The FBI agent read the list of robberies with which appellant was charged, and appellant admitted the four robberies involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">Appellant testified that the FBI agent stated, on both the 17th and the 20th, that although the agent could give no guarantee, he thought that if the robberies were cleared up there would be no reason to continue the investigation of appellant\u2019s family. Although readily admitting the discussion of appellant\u2019s family and of the possibility of a \u201cdeal\u201d on the 17th, the FBI agent denied that either subject was mentioned on the 20th, or that a \u201cdeal\u201d was in fact ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">The government offered the oral confession of the 20th in evidence. Appellant objected that it was not voluntarily made, but was induced by implied threats and promises with respect to the investigation and prosecution of his family. The trial court refused to determine whether the admission made on the 17th was voluntary. It held that any improper influence present on the 17th had been dissipated by the 20th because of the lapse of time, and the fact that appellant had consulted with counsel. The court credited the FBI agent\u2019s testimony that there was no discussion of a \u201cdeal\u201d or of appellant\u2019s family on the latter date, and held that the oral confession made on that date was therefore voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">The trial court erred in refusing to consider whether the interrogation of the 17th was so tainted by implied threats or inducements as to render inadmissible any confessions made on that date.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Had the trial court addressed itself to the problem, it could have concluded that what occurred, on the 17th rendered ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>pellant\u2019s decision to incriminate himself something less than the voluntary choice of a free and unrestrained will. Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U.S. 341, 347-348, 83 S.Ct. 448, 9 L.Ed.2d 357 (1962). A threat or promise concerning one close to the accused in affection is often an element in a determination of inadmissibility [see, e. g., Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963); Crawford v. United States, 219 F.2d 207, 210 n. 5 and text (5th Cir. 1955); cf. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed. 2d 760 (1961)] \u2014 although this factor standing alone may not invariably compel that conclusion. See, e. g., Stein v. People of State of New York, 346 U.S. 156, 186, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953); United States v. Gordon, 303 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1962); see also Cortez v. United States, 337 F.2d 699-701-702 (9th Cir. 1964), and cases cited therein. Cases are collected in People of State of California v. Trout, 54 Cal.2d 576, 6 Cal.Rptr. 759, 354 P.2d 231, 80 A.L.R.2d 1418.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Had the trial court examined the events of the 17th, and had it concluded that the interrogation was sufficiently tainted by implied threats or inducements to render appellant\u2019s self-incriminating statements inadmissible, a presumption would have arisen that those influences continued to the interview which followed on the 20th. The prosecution would then have been required to demonstrate that their force was dissipated prior to the second interview. If the government failed to discharge this burden, the oral confessions of the 20th would have been inadmissible. As Judge Tuttle said in Williams v. United States, 328 F.2d 669, 671 (5th Cir. 1964), \u201cwhere a confession has been obtained by means of inducement, the burden is on the prosecution to show that the operating force of the inducement has been brought to an end before any subsequent confession may be received.\u201d See also United States v. Gorman, 355 F.2d 151, 157 (2d Cir. 1965); Collins v. Beto, 348 F.2d 823, 828 (5th Cir. 1965); Killough v. United States, 1140 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241, 244, 245 (D.C.Cir. 1962), id. at 249 (Wright, J., concurring),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> cf. Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 496-497, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The showing made here was insufficient. The short lapse of three days would have little if any tendency to neutralize a threat of prosecution, or promise of immunity, if either occurred. And the fact that during this interval appellant consulted his counsel would have no greater effect. This was not a case in which the claim of involuntariness rested upon the accused\u2019s isolation or lack of knowledge of his rights, or upon lengthy uninterrupted interrogation, or fear of immediate physical violence, or the like. Access to counsel might well dissipate improper influences of this sort. However, it would have slight or no bearing upon whether the compulsion of a threat to prosecute appellant\u2019s family, or the inducement of a promise of their immunity, if present on the 17th, would have persisted as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>motivating factor in producing appellant\u2019s confession on the 20th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">It follows that the admissibility of the confession on the 20th could not be reliably determined without first determining whether improper influence was brought to bear upon the appellant on the 17th. Appellant was entitled to a reliable determination, by the court, of both the underlying factual issues and the voluntariness of his confession, and, in my opinion, the refusal of the trial court to consider the interview of the 17th, and its relationship to the interview of the 20th, was therefore error. Cf. Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 380, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Appellant testified on his own behalf. The prosecutor asked him on cross-examination whether one of appellant\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Goslaw, was his \u201ccrime partner,\u201d and whether appellant and Mr. Goslaw had together robbed a named bank, not one of the four banks involved in the indictments. Appellant was required to answer over his objection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He denied that he had participated in the robbery of the fifth bank and denied that he had previously admitted doing so. In rebuttal the government offered the testimony of an FBI agent that appellant had admitted committing the robbery with Mr. Goslaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">It would have been improper and highly prejudicial for the government to attempt to impeach appellant by asking him to admit participation in a criminal act for which he had not been convicted (Thurman v. United States, 316 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1963); Ramirez v. United States, 294 F.2d 277, 284 (9th Cir. 1961); Enriquez v. United States, 293 F.2d 788, 794 (9th Cir. 1961); Mitrovich v. United States, 15 F.2d 163, 164 (9th Cir. 1926); see also Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959); Abdul v. United States, 254 F.2d 292, 295 (9th Cir. 1958); Bloch v. United States, 221 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir. 1955); Allen v. United States, 115 F. 3, 11-12 (9th Cir. 1902)); yet that is the effect of what was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">Even if appellant had been convicted of the offense it would have been improper to question him as to the details of the crime (United States v. Smith, 353 F.2d 166, 168-169 (4th Cir. 1965); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 43, pp. 92-93; 1 Underhill, Criminal Evidence \u00a7 164, p. 312 n. 21); yet appellant was asked if he had used a .45-automatic weapon in the robbery and escaped in a stolen tan Oldsmobile; and the FBI agent testified that appellant admitted these and other details of the robbery, such as the amount of money stolen, and that the Oldsmobile was abandoned and the escape completed in a waiting truck which appellant had rented under a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">The government argues that its purpose was to impeach Mr. Goslaw, not appellant. The government had already used Mr. Goslaw\u2019s participation in the robbery for this purpose by obtaining Mr. Goslaw\u2019s admission on cross-examination that he had been convicted of this very offense. But the government argues that it was also entitled to show, as a further impeaching factor arising out of the same incident, that Mr. Gos-law might be biased in appellant\u2019s favor, since he and appellant had participated in the affair together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">On this theory, relevance of any part of the line of inquiry was remote at best, and testimony as to the details of the offense was wholly unjustified. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>was irrelevant to Mr. Goslaw\u2019s credibility that appellant carried a .45-caliber weapon during the robbery, escaped in a stolen car and switched to a truck rented under a false name, and took several thousand dollars. Testimony as to these details could only serve to enhance the risk that the jury would be diverted by a completely extraneous issue, and convict appellant because of an offense with which he was not charged. Boyd v. United States, 142 U.S. 450, 457-458, 12 S.Ct. 292, 35 L.Ed. 1077 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">Moreover, as evidence of Mr. Goslaw\u2019s credibility, the entire line of inquiry was cumulative. Mr. Goslaw was a minor witness; his testimony was brief and relatively inconsequential. It would be unreasonable and unjust to admit otherwise improper testimony having such a direct and devastating impact upon appellant, simply because it might have a distant bearing upon Goslaw\u2019s credibility. Lucero v. Donovan, 354 F.2d 16, 22 (9th Cir. 1965). See also Powell v. United States, 347 F.2d 156, 158 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">On appeal the government argues that the evidence was relevant to the issue of appellant\u2019s purpose and intent. But the sole issue at the trial was whether appellant had participated in the robberies charged at all. Appellant\u2019s defense was alibi. Purpose and intent, as such, were not an issue (see United States v. Klass, 166 F.2d 373, 378 (3d Cir. 1948)), as they were in the cases upon which the government relies. Wood v. United States, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 342, 359-361, 10 L.Ed. 987 (1842) (intent to defraud), and Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718, 745 (9th Cir. 1963) (intent to extort). See also Chow Bing Kew v. United States, 248 F.2d 466, 470 (9th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">It was prejudicial error to permit the government to ask appellant whether he had robbed the fifth bank, and to offer extrinsic evidence rebutting his denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">For the reasons stated in parts II B, III and IV of this opinion, I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-11\">.

Identification parades, it may be thought, are an unsatisfactory means for pursuing the ends of justice. In the vast preponderance of cases the witness will have brought the suspect under suspicion as a result of inspecting photographs of convicted persons maintained at the Criminal Record Office or by a provincial police force. In the parade, the witness tends to identify the subject of the photograph rather than the person he saw when the crime was committed. Secondly, while many identification parades are conducted by the police with a scrupulous regard for fairness, it is not unknown for the identifying witness to be placed in a position where he can see the suspect before the parade forms; there is little opportunity for the attending Solicitor to know whether this has occurred or not. Final<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ly, since even the innocent suspect is aware that he alone is on risk, he is likely to become agitated and apprehensive that he might be identified, and thus tends to stand out from his companions like a sore thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cOn balance, therefore, it often seems wise to advise against participation in the parade. On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that often no satisfactory alternative offers itself, that the police have a duty to catch criminals and secure their conviction and that, if he remains unidentified on the parade, the suspect is relieved from the anxiety of suspicion. Too often, however, such parades are little more than fishing expeditions; then the danger becomes the more intense and, as a result, the writer, to the surprise of presiding police officers and the dismay of the Solicitors Department at Scotland Yard, requires that he be informed as to the description previously given by the identifying witness, and if necessary to question him upon it. If the description appears fairly to bring the suspect under suspicion and he, after due warning as to the risks, continues to assert his innocence, he is advised to consent to the parade. If, however, the description is so inadequate as to negative reasonable suspicion, or if his guilt is not beyond question, he must be advised against participation in the parade. The primary duty of the Solicitor must be to his client and not the public, however much his sympathies may extend towards the latter.\u201d Napley, Problems of Effecting the Presentations of the Case for the Defendant, 66 Colum.L.Rev. 94, 98-99 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">.

In the identification situation, the interrogator may take a break in his questioning to place the subject among a group of men in a lineup. \u2018The witness or complainant (previously coached, if necessary) studies the line-up and confidently points out the subject as the guilty party.\u2019 Then the questioning resumes \u2018as though there were now no doubt about the guilt of the subject.\u2019 A variation on this technique is called the \u2018reverse line-up\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">\u2018The accused is placed in a line-up, but this time he is identified by several fictitious witnesses or victims who associated him with different offenses. It is expected that the subject will become desperate and confess to the offense under investigation in order to escape from the false accusations.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">. As Judge Friendly recently said in response to \u201cthe rhetorical question as to what counsel could have done\u201d in connection with a police-arranged confrontation between the victim of a crime and the accused (355 F.2d at 744) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-16\">\u201cHe might have persuaded the prosecutor, in the state\u2019s own interest, if not to forego the hospital identification, at least to assure conditions better designed to avoid suggestion. He might have persuaded the judge to direct that Stovall be immediately sent to and then kept in jail pending trial, or be put before Mrs. Behrendt only under fair conditions such as a line-up, or be accompanied by counsel who might question her * * *. Or, as a last resort, he might have advised Stovall to refuse to go, or to remain silent if taken by force.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1002-18\">.
