The sole issue is whether section 2032 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires, as appellants contend, that, in the case of election to apply the statute\u2019s alternative valuation date provision and distribution to legatees within one year after the decedent\u2019s death, the date of actual, physical distribution must be taken as the only authorized and permissible valuation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">The taxpayer insists that the regulations which specify times when property may be considered as \u201cdistributed\u201d are invalid, inasmuch as they provide for two possible dates of distribution other than the date of actual distribution. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 20.2032-1. Judge Kilkenny, in an opinion reported at 244 F.Supp. 347 (D.Or.1965), concluded otherwise, holding that the property here involved was properly treated as having been distributed on the date of the Oregon probate court\u2019s entry of its order or decree of distribution even though actual distribution occurred at a later time. We agree with the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABp\">\u201c(a) General.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">The value of the gross estate may be determined, if the executor so elects, by valuing all the property included in the gross estate as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">(1) In the ease of property distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, within 1 year after the decedent\u2019s death such property shall be valued as of the date of distribution, sale, exchange, or other disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-18\">(2) In the case of property not distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, within 1 year after the decedent\u2019s death such property shall be valued as of the date 1 year after the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d 26 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 2032.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
