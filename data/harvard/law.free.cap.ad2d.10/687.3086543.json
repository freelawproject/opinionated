On this record it is undisputed that the subcontractor had completed its wpcfc at least four days before the accident and that its work had been accepted by the general contractor, Any obligation to guard the protruding rods then fell upon the general contractor since at the time the subcontractor left the work the cement had not yet hardened sufficiently and any bending of the rods at such time was not feasible. It was also undisputed that, between the general contractor and the subcontractor the cement company\u2019s work required that it leave the rods protruding and upright. It was also undisputed that between them the time interval which would follow before further structure would be placed upon the concrete pad was entirely within the discretion and knowledge of the general contractor. Consequently, there wag no evidence to shpw that the subcontractor was guilty of any fault. Concur Botein, P- J\u201e Breitel, Rabin and Stevens, JJ,; McNally, J., dissents in part and concurs, in part in opinion. Settle order. [See 10 A D 2d 47.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
