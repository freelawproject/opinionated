He alleged that Correctional Officer Julio Salazar assaulted him, that Officer Alan Cantu was standing by and did nothing to stop it, and that Salazar then filed a false disciplinary report in retaliation for Rivera\u2019s having reported the assault. He alleged that other defendants did nothing about Rivera\u2019s grievance regarding these matters and that they conspired to \u201caid and abet\u201d the false disciplinary proceedings against him. On January 27, 2005, the district court issued a \u201cFinal Judgment Dismissing Certain Claims,\u201d dismissing Rivera\u2019s claims against all of the defendants other than Salazar and Cantu but retaining on the court\u2019s docket the claims against those two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Wilkens v. Johnson, </em>238 F.3d 328, 330 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment did not dispose of all of the claims and was therefore not a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Briargrove Shopping Ctr. Joint Venture v. Pilgrim Enter., Inc., </em>170 F.3d 536, 538-39 (5th Cir.1999). In addition, the court did not certify the finality of the dismissed claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Although the district court labeled the judgment \u201cfinal,\u201d the document does not reflect an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>\u201cunmistakable intent\u201d to enter an appeal-able partial judgment under Rule 54(b). <em>See id. </em>at 539-40. However, the district court has subsequently entered final judgment as to the claims against Salazar and Cantu. Accordingly, we may exercise appellate jurisdiction over the January 27, 2005, judgment. <em>See Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., </em>402 F.3d 536, 539 n. 1 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Barrett v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>95 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">By failing to brief any challenge to the district court\u2019s conclusion, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), that he failed to state a claim as to defendants Major Domingo Carrillo, Captains Aurelio Ambriz and Michael Parker, Lieutenant Andres Gallegos, and Sergeants Martha Navejas-Gallegos and Jarod Bleibdrey, Rivera has effectively abandoned his claims against those defendants. <em>See Salazar-Regino v. Trominski, </em>415 F.3d 436, 451 (5th Cir.2005); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Rivera argues that Assistant Warden Alfonso Castillo and Senior Warden William Stephens were liable as supervisors. He maintains that Castillo was aware of many inmate complaints about Officer Salazar and of Salazar\u2019s \u201cproclivity to bring false charges against inmates in retaliation for reporting his various abuses.\u201d He asserts that Castillo \u201cemployed a wholly inadequate and impotent disciplinary system that permitted officer[]s like Officer Salazar to continue to employ their bullish methods without sanction.\u201d Rivera has not, however, described the history of complaints against Salazar or explained how Castillo\u2019s disciplinary system was \u201cinadequate and impotent.\u201d Although he asserts that Castillo created a \u201cpolicy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred,\u201d he describes neither the policy or custom nor the \u201cunconstitutional practices.\u201d These conclusory allegations are insufficient to establish supervisory liability. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 305 (5th Cir.1987). The district court did not err in concluding that Rivera had failed to state a cognizable constitutional claim against either Castillo or Stephens. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The January 27, 2005, judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined, that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
