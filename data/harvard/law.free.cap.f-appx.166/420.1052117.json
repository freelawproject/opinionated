Wilson asserts the district court erred in concluding his 1985 Georgia state conviction for trafficking in cocaine was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>306 F.3d 1087, 1089 (11th Cir.2002). Section 2K2.1(a)(2) provides for a base offense level of 24 \u201cif the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The phrase \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d has the meaning given that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b) and application note 1 of the commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), comment (n.l). Section 4B1.2(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Georgia Code \u00a7 16-13-31(a)(l) provides: \u201cAny person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, or brings into this state or who is knowingly in possession of 28 grams or more of cocaine ... commits the felony offense of trafficking in cocaine.... \u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">In <em>United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1229-30 (11th Cir.2003), we considered whether the defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction, under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31(e), for possession of 87 grams of methamphetamine, constituted a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, we examined Georgia\u2019s three-tiered statutory scheme for punishing drug crimes and determined that, under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31, Georgia considers possession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine \u201ctrafficking,\u201d and \u201cdrug trafficking ... is a more serious offense than either simple possession or possession with intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231-32. We found, \u201c[i]n making possession of 28 grams of methamphetamine a \u2018trafficking\u2019 offense, Georgia\u2019s trafficking statute necessarily infers an intent to distribute once a defendant possesses a certain amount of drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232. We also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d requires the statutory element of intent to distribute be actually present in the language of the statute of conviction, finding the Sentencing Commission decided not to define a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d by its elements. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Although we considered whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d rather than a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in <em>Madera-Madera, </em>the Guidelines definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is virtually identical to its definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n. l(B)(iv)); 4B1.2(b). Because we are bound by our prior holding in <em>Maderas-Madera </em>that a federal court may infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>a conviction under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-13-31 includes an intent to distribute, the district court did not err in finding that Wilson\u2019s 1985 state conviction for trafficking in cocaine was a controlled substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\">. The phrase \"drug trafficking offense\u201d means \"an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n. l(B)(iv)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
