By moving for IFP, Young is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">The district court \u201cpierc[ed] the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations\u201d and held that Young sought 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 relief based on the meritless legal theory of respondeat superior liability. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-04 (5th Cir.1987). Our review of Young\u2019s complaint convinces us that its dismissal as frivolous was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">\u201c[NJothing prevents the appellate court from sua sponte dismissing the case on the merits pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 when it is apparent that an appeal would be meritless.\u201d <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Young has failed to show that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>appeal involves nonfrivolous legal issues, and therefore his appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Young is CAUTIONED that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">MOTION FOR IFP STATUS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
