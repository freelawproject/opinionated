Initially we affirmed Freeman\u2019s convictions and sentence. Before the mandate issued, however, Freeman filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc again challenging her convictions, and for the first time challenging her sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and in anticipation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because <em>Booker </em>constitutes an intervening change in the law bearing on the outcome of this appeal, we grant rehearing, vacate Freeman\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing. We continue to affirm Freeman\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In light of <em>Booker, United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005), we find that the district court plainly erred in imposing Freeman\u2019s sentence under the then mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We therefore vacate Freeman\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em>Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \u201c[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\" of Freeman\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
