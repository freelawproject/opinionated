See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In these consolidated petitions for review, Nadege Yolande Nganso, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order adopting and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, and its order denying her motion to reopen immigration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In her petition for review, Nganso challenges the determination that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Nganso fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Nganso\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Nganso fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">Finally, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Nganso\u2019s motion to reopen immigration proceedings. We agree with the Board\u2019s determination that Nganso failed to present clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that her marriage is bona fide as required by <em>Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 (B.I.A.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-11\">. We have also considered Nganso\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s refusal to allow her witness to testify and discern no prejudice from the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320-21 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that a petitioner must show prejudice in order to prevail on a claim that he or she was denied a full and fair hearing in violation of due process).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-18\">. Nganso does not challenge the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture in her brief. She has therefore waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
