He argues that the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>The district court committed <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error by sentencing Rodriguez-Alvarran pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.Sd 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Although Rodriguez-Alvarran contends that such error is structural, this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The Government concedes that Rodriguez-Alvarran preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim. As such, this court reviews the claim for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 464. There is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Rodriguez-Alvarran also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and. \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rodirguez-Alvarran\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although RodriguezAlvarran contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez-Alvarran properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, RodriguezAlvarran\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
