Ashcroft appeals his sentence as an unreasonable one. In response, the government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review Ashcroft\u2019s challenge to his sentence because such a review is not authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Ashcroft also appeals on the basis that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(G) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s commerce power.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">We have previously rejected the government\u2019s position with regard to jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Mickelson, </em>433 F.3d 1050 (8th Cir.2006) (rejecting the government\u2019s position that appellate courts lack jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under \u00a7 3742(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">Because we have jurisdiction to entertain appellate review, we now turn to the reasonability of Ashcroft\u2019s sentence. Ashcroft argues that the 71-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable and higher than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing. He contends that a sentence below 71 months would have been sufficient to \u201cpromote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide the defendant with needed ... treatment.\u201d Ashcroft argues that there were numerous mitigating circumstances warranting a sentence at the low end of the guidelines that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>court refused to consider, even though it said it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Following <em>Booker, </em>we review the final sentence imposed on a defendant for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Winingear, 422 </em>F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). The factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) guide this review. <em>Id. </em>at 1246. Those factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although a within-guidelines sentence is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787-88 (11th Cir.2005). This expectation is measured against the record, and Ashcroft bears the burden of showing his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We conclude that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence under <em>Booker. </em>The court supported its sentence by taking into account Ashcroft\u2019s extensive criminal history, which the court discussed at length at the sentencing hearing, noting that his prior felony offenses were \u201calmost too numerous to count.\u201d The court also considered the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public from Ashcroft. Although the court did not detail the weight that it had accorded to each sentencing factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that district court need not recite a laundry list of sentencing factors to have adequately considered them under <em>Booker). </em>Ashcroft has failed to show record evidence sufficient to overcome our expectation that his sentence within the guideline range is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Finally, Ashcroft argues for the first time on appeal that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), the statute under which he was convicted, is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Power. According to Ashcroft, our decision in <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>386 F.3d 1042 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 321, 163 L.Ed.2d 29, and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 85, 163 L.Ed.2d 104 (2005), undermines our previous determinations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)\u2019s constitutionality by holding that the aggregate approach to determining effects on interstate commerce cannot be applied to non-economic criminal activity. As a result, Ashcroft contends, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional because it relies on the aggregate approach to regulate a non-economic criminal activity. As <em>Maxwell </em>held that only regulation of non-economic criminal activities substantially affecting interstate commerce are constitutional, he argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional on those grounds as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Although we generally review constitutional issues <em>de novo, </em>it is within our discretion to address a constitutional issue when it has been raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). When an issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Our since-vacated decision in <em>Maxwell, </em>386 F.3d at 1059-60, held that, according to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), non-eeonomic intrastate criminal conduct may not be regulated by Congress through its commerce powers. Specifically, <em>Maxwell </em>invalidated a child pornography statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), on the basis that \u201cwholly intrastate activities that have an only minimal or insubstantial effect on interstate commerce are not proper subjects for federal regulation, at least not through the power bestowed by the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Ashcroft\u2019s reliance on our since-vacated decision in <em>Maxwell </em>dooms his argument that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional. Since <em>Maxwell </em>was vacated, this Court has held that \u00a7 922(g) is constitutional. <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280. Our decision in <em>Wright </em>is consistent with numerous Eleventh Circuit cases affirming the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1297 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270 (11th <em>Cir.2001), cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1166, 122 S.Ct. 1182, 152 L.Ed.2d 124 (2002); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir.2001). Because \u201conly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can judicially overrule a prior panel decision,\u201d we must reject Ashcroft\u2019s argument. <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
