CarrascoCastro argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory Guideline scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government concedes that error occurred, but it notes that the error was nonconstitutional in nature and argues that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">Because Carrasco-Castro preserved his \u201cFanfan\u201d challenge in the district court by raising an objection based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would not have sentenced CarrascoCastro differently under an advisory guideline sentencing regime. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-24\">The instant record fails to provide clear commentary from the district court regarding whether it would have imposed the same sentence in a <em>post-Booker </em>environment. <em>See id. </em>The Government thus has not carried its burden of showing harmless error. <em>See id. </em>We therefore remand Carrasco-Castro\u2019s case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-25\">Carrasco-Castro challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Al</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>mendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Carrasco-Castro contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carrasco-Castro properly \u2022 concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
