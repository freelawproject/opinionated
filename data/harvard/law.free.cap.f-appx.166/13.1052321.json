Foster appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his unwarned statements, alleging that their admission violates his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Foster and Williams both appeal their sentences on the ground that they are unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Foster\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that Foster was not under interrogation or its functional equivalent at the time that he made these statements. Finding Sixth Amendment error, we vacate Foster\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">On January 25, 2003, Sergeant John Ambrose and Lieutenant Leslie Banks of the Baltimore Police Department observed defendants Foster and Williams conduct an apparent drug sale. A woman approached the two men and handed Foster what appeared to be money; in exchange, Williams retrieved a small object from the rear passenger side of a car parked nearby and handed it to the woman. As soon as the woman, who was walking, left the immediate vicinity of the transaction, police officers stopped her and found in her possession a yellow ziplock bag containing roughly .2 grams of cocaine base. Shortly thereafter, officers stopped Foster and Williams who had left in the car. With the two men detained on the sidewalk, Lieutenant Banks retrieved a plastic bag containing roughly one gram of cocaine base from behind the fuel cap of the car (on the rear passenger side) as well as $457 in small bills from the front console. Foster and Williams were then arrested and handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">Before the suspects were advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights, Sergeant Ambrose said aloud, \u201cI can\u2019t believe with all the money and drugs we found we didn\u2019t find a handgun.\u201d J.A. 27. According to Sergeant Ambrose, Foster replied, \u201cIf you want a gun I will get you a handgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ambrose then said that \u201cit would take four handguns with whatever you have here,\u201d meaning the seized evidence. <em>Id. </em>Foster replied, \u201cI can get you one right now. I need to go in my car and go right around the corner and get you a nine millimeter.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>J.A. 163. This exchange occurred against the backdrop of a well-known Baltimore Police Department policy that may allow suspects to escape low-level drug charges if they turn guns over to the police. In any event, Ambrose searched the trunk of the car and found a nine millimeter buried in the wheel well. The car is jointly owned by Foster and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>On October 9, 2003, Foster and Williams were indicted on several drug and firearms counts: conspiring to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count One); distributing cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (Count Two); possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (Count Three); possessing a firearm after a prior felony conviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (Count Six); and possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (Count Seven). Foster was also indicted on two additional counts, distributing cocaine base (Count Four) and possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute (Count Five), relating to a later alleged drug sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Foster filed a pretrial motion to suppress his two statements to Sergeant Ambrose. In the pretrial evidentiary hearing, Sergeant Ambrose at first denied discussing cooperation with Foster, but later conceded the possibility when defense counsel confronted him with a piece of paper bearing his name and phone number in his own handwriting, which he had handed Foster at the scene of the stop. Sergeant Ambrose testified that he only handed this paper to Foster <em>after </em>Foster had already volunteered the statements and <em>after </em>he had already found the gun in Foster\u2019s trunk. Crediting Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s testimony, the district court determined that Sergeant Ambrose had handed Foster the paper only after \u201c[h]e obviously had a defendant who wanted to talk to him---He actually by that time had the gun itself. So he had a potential real live informant, somebody who already expressed the interest [in cooperating] on lesser evidence.\u201d J.A. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The district court ultimately denied Foster\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground that Ambrose\u2019s statements did not constitute interrogation or its functional equivalent under <em>Miranda. </em>\u201c[T]he whole conversation, as the evidence shows it happened, ... wasn\u2019t a discussion [about cooperation], oh, by the way, if you have a gun let me know, I will take that to the State\u2019s Attorney and we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d J.A. 142. Ambrose\u2019s statements were only \u201csmart-alec,\u201d \u201csarcastic,\u201d and \u201cfacetious,\u201d not genuine offers of cooperation. J.A. 142. As such, they did not constitute interrogation of an unwarned suspect in custody. Furthermore, the court concluded that the note with the sergeant\u2019s name and number was not evidence that Sergeant Ambrose elicited Foster\u2019s incriminating statements by promising to help him, since Sergeant Ambrose handed Foster the paper only <em>after </em>finding the gun and as \u201che [was] leaving to take [Foster] to the paddy wagon.\u201d J.A. 142. The district court thus denied Foster\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Foster and Williams were tried from March 15 to March 18, 2004. The district court dismissed Count One of the indictment, conspiracy to distribute cocaine base, after the jury submitted a question on that count. On March 18, 2004, the jury convicted Foster on all remaining counts in the indictment except Count Seven, possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking. The jury convicted Williams on Counts Two and Three and acquitted him on Counts Six and Seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The district court sentenced Foster to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment and Williams to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, applying the then-mandatory sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <em>et seq. </em>In calculating Foster\u2019s base offense level, the district court imposed a two-point enhancement based on a fact found by the court alone, not by the jury: that the gun that Foster possessed had previously been stolen. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). Foster objected to this enhancement on the ground that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>factual predicate, the gun being stolen, was based on unreliable information. The court similarly enhanced Williams\u2019s offense level based on a fact not found by the jury: that the quantity of cocaine base attributable to Williams was at least one gram but less than two grams. Williams, however, did not object to the resulting enhanced offense level, stating that it was \u201cthe appropriate level in this case.\u201d J.A. 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Foster appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his unwarned statements. Foster and Williams both appeal their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Foster argues that the district court erred by admitting his unwarned statements after determining that he was not under interrogation (or its functional equivalent) at the time that he made them. Under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>\u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). These safeguards include the now-familiar <em>Miranda </em>warnings or their equivalent. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 297, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Because, Foster argues, he was under custodial interrogation at the time but had received no <em>Miranda </em>warnings, his statements to Sergeant Ambrose should be suppressed. When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and we accept the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d 666, 671 (4th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">The parties agree that Foster was in custody when he made his statements to Sergeant Ambrose, since he was under formal arrest at the time. <em>See Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (defining custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes). They also agree that Foster had not been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. What the parties dispute is whether Foster was under interrogation at the time. According to <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>a suspect is interrogated by the law enforcement officers when \u201csubjected to .either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d 446 U.S. at 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682. This \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d language is meant to capture \u201cinterrogation environments\u201d in which the suspect\u2019s will is subjugated to that of his examiner, undermining the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682. A suspect is subjected to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of interrogation when the police use \u201cwords or actions ... (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect,\u201d meaning any response that the prosecution may seek to introduce at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 301 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that the police \u201csurely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The focus of this inquiry is primarily on the suspect\u2019s perceptions and not on the police officers\u2019 intentions. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">In <em>Innis </em>police officers arrested the defendant for robbery with a sawed-off shotgun but found him unarmed. While in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>transit to the police station, the officers had a \u201cbrief conversation\u201d with each other about the missing shotgun, which everyone in the car (including the defendant) heard. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 294, 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Referring to a nearby school for handicapped children, one officer said to another, \u201c[I]t would be too bad if [a] little [handicapped] ... girl ... pick[s] up the gun, maybe kill[s] herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The defendant at this point interrupted the conversation and offered to show the officers where the gun was located. <em>Id. </em>The Court ruled that the officers\u2019 conversation among themselves did not constitute interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes because the entire conversation consisted of \u201cno more than a few offhand remarks\u201d and was not \u201ca lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The officers\u2019 comments, moreover, were not \u201cparticularly \u2018evocative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, there was no evidence that the officers were \u201caware that the [defendant] was particularly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the safety of handicapped children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. 1682. For these reasons, the Court concluded that the officers should not have known that their conversation was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the defendant, and therefore did not subject the defendant to the functional equivalent of interrogation under <em>Miranda. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The issue in this case is whether Sergeant Ambrose should have known that his two comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Foster. Because this inquiry is necessarily contextual, focusing primarily on the suspect\u2019s perceptions, we owe trial courts \u201csubstantial deference on the question of what constitutes interrogation,\u201d since trial courts \u201ccan best evaluate the circumstances in which such statements are made and detect their coercive aspects.\u201d <em>United States v. Payne, </em>954 F.2d 199, 203 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We examine Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s statements separately: the first said aloud in Foster\u2019s presence (\u201cI can\u2019t believe with all the money and drugs we found we didn\u2019t find a handgun\u201d); and the second said directly to Foster (\u201cIt would take four handguns with whatever you have here,\u201d meaning the seized evidence). J.A. 27. While the second statement presents a closer question than the first, we ultimately conclude that neither statement constitutes interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The first statement is easily analyzed under <em>Innis. </em>Because it was only an isolated, offhand remark and not a \u201clengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect,\u201d <em>Innis </em>suggests that this statement does not constitute interrogation or its functional equivalent. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682. The only complicating factor is whether Foster was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible\u201d to statements of this kind, as discussed briefly in <em>Innis. Id. </em>at 302, 100 S.Ct. 1682. There is at least some evidence in the record that the Baltimore Police Department has a well-known policy of allowing suspects to escape low-level drug charges if they turn over guns to the police. Even assuming that Foster was aware of this policy, however, it alone does not transform Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s off-the-cuff comment into the functional equivalent of direct questioning. The statement was only a glib characterization of the seized evidence; Sergeant Ambrose was expressing his surprise that he found no gun alongside the drugs and money. As we explained in <em>Payne, </em>\u201c[T]he <em>Innis </em>definition of interrogation is not so broad as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>capture within Miranda\u2019s reach all declaratory statements by police officers concerning the nature of the charges against the suspect and the evidence relating to those charges\u201d \u2014 or by extension the <em>lack </em>of evidence against the suspect (for example, the absence of guns). <em>Payne, </em>954 F.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In <em>Payne </em>we held that an officer\u2019s statement to the defendant, \u201cThey [the FBI] found a gun at your house,\u201d did not constitute interrogation or its functional equivalent because the statement \u201cwas not one that sought or required a response.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>954 F.2d at 201, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because it was merely a declaratory statement of the charges or evidence against the defendant, the officer should not have known that it was \u201c \u2018reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S at 302, 100 S.Ct. 1682).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">As in <em>Payne, </em>Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s first statement is a mere description of the evidence (or lack thereof) against Foster. It did not indicate to Foster that cooperation would benefit him in any way. <em>Cf. United States v. Montana, </em>958 F.2d 516, 518-19 (2d Cir.1992) (finding that agent\u2019s unsolicited statement to suspect that any cooperation would be brought to federal prosecutor\u2019s attention constituted interrogation); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>812 F.2d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that police offers to help defendants may constitute interrogation, for example suggesting, \u201c[We] will be good if [you] the accused will be good\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you be good and tell us about it?\u201d). Even when viewed against the backdrop of the Baltimore Police Department policy, Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s offhand remark cannot fairly be seen as expressing or even insinuating that he would help Foster bargain down his drug charges if only Foster cooperated.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that Sergeant Ambrose should not have known that his first statement was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Foster. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Foster\u2019s motion to suppress his first response, \u201cIf you want a gun I will get you a handgun.\u201d J.A. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s second statement requires more extensive analysis. This statement comes closer to interrogation than the first because it suggests more openly that Foster could benefit by cooperating, in particular by turning over several guns. Police statements that expressly state or even insinuate that cooperation would benefit the defendant may constitute interrogation under <em>Miranda. See Montana, </em>958 F.2d at 518-19; <em>Johnson, </em>812 F.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">In this analysis, we are bound by the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, as noted above. <em>See Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d at 671. The district court made the following factual findings that are highly relevant to our examination here: \u25a0 that Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s second remark was \u201cfacetious,\u201d \u201csmart-alec,\u201d and \u201csarcastic\u201d only (that is, \u201cit will take <em>a lot more </em>than one gun\u201d), not a genuine offer of cooperation; and that Sergeant Ambrose gave Foster the piece of paper bearing his name and number only <em>after </em>Foster had already volunteered the incriminating statements, at which point Sergeant Ambrose \u201c[knew] that he may have a potential cooperator ... and [so he gave Foster] his name as he [was] leaving to take [Foster] away in the paddy wagon.\u201d J.A. 142. In sum, the district court concluded that \u201cthe whole conversation, as the evidence shows it happened, ... wasn\u2019t a discussion, oh, by the way, if you have a gun let me know, I will take that to the State\u2019s Attorney and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon reviewing the record, we do not regard these findings as clearly erroneous and therefore accept them as true. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 55-58 (evidence supporting court\u2019s findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In light of these factual findings, Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s second statement was not objectively likely to elicit Foster\u2019s incriminating response. Sergeant Ambrose was merely expressing sarcasm and incredulity because of the degree of trouble Foster was already in on account of the drugs; Ambrose had no apparent intention of helping Foster avoid or reduce the impending drug charges. Focusing primarily on the suspect\u2019s perceptions, as <em>Innis </em>instructs us to do, Foster could not reasonably have interpreted Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s second statement as a genuine offer to bargain down the charges in exchange for guns, even assuming that Foster knew about the police department policy of sometimes dropping charges for guns. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. As the district court found, Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s tone was too sarcastic and incredulous to interpret it as a genuine offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We therefore conclude that Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s second statement objectively invited no cooperation from Foster. Indeed, it invited no reply at all. It was a gibe only, an evidently \u201csmart-alec\u201d and \u201cfacetious\u201d statement. J.A. 142. As such, it \u201cwas not [a statement] that sought or required a response.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>954 F.2d at 203 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing in this record allows us to disregard the district court\u2019s factual findings about Sergeant Ambrose\u2019s tone and thereby reverse its legal conclusion, especially given the \u201csubstantial deference\u201d we owe trial courts on what constitutes interrogation. <em>Payne, </em>954 F.2d at 203. Accordingly, we conclude that Sergeant Ambrose should not have known that his second statement was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. On this ground, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Foster\u2019s motion to suppress his second response, \u201cI can get you one right now. I need to go in my car and go right around the corner and get you a nine millimeter.\u201d J.A. 27,163.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">We turn now to the defendants\u2019 challenges to their sentences. Foster and Williams both argue that their sentences are unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because neither defendant raised this issue below, we review their sentences for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Under <em>Booker </em>sentence enhancements imposed under a mandatory sentencing regime violate the Sixth Amendment if they are based on facts found by the court alone, not by the jury or by the defendant\u2019s admission. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. If a defendant\u2019s actual sentence exceeds the maximum authorized by the facts admitted by the defendant or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, it constitutes plain and prejudicial Sixth Amendment error. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-49, 555-56. As such, it warrants remand and resentencing according to <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 555-56; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-68. Applying this framework, we conclude that Foster\u2019s sentence constitutes plain <em>Booker </em>error but that Williams\u2019s sentence does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In sentencing Foster, the district court relied on a fact found by the court alone, not by the jury: that the gun Foster possessed had previously been stolen. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). This fact enhanced Foster\u2019s base offense level by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>points, from 20 to 22. The resulting guidelines range, given Foster\u2019s criminal history-category of V, was 77 to 96 months; the range authorized by the jury verdict alone was 63 to 78 months. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. Foster was ultimately sentenced to 87 months. Because Foster\u2019s sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury verdict alone, it constitutes plain and prejudicial Sixth Amendment error and warrants resentencing. <em>See </em>Hughes, 401 F.3d at 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On remand the district court should first calculate the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines and then consider this range, along with other factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when imposing a sentence. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. If the sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for departure as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In sentencing Williams, the district court relied on a fact contained in his presentence report that was not contained in the indictment: that Williams\u2019s offense involved at least one gram but less than two grams of cocaine base. The indictment did not charge any specific drug weight, and the jury made no findings regarding drug weight. The court-found drug weight enhanced Williams\u2019s base offense level by six points, from 12 to 18. A base offense level of 18, when combined with Williams\u2019s criminal history category of V, yields a range of 51 to 63 months; a base offense level of 12 (for an unspecified quantity of cocaine base, that is, less than .25 grams) yields a range of 27 to 33 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(11), (14); U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. Williams was ultimately sentenced to 51 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">At sentencing, Williams admitted to the drug weight that the court used to enhance his base offense level by stating that \u201c18 is the appropriate offense level in this case.\u201d J.A. 727. He had no objection to \u201cthe way Probation added [Williams\u2019s] offense level.\u201d J.A. 727. Williams thereby converted a court-found fact into one that he admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In light of this admission, Williams\u2019s sentence was not enhanced based on a fact found by the court alone; it did not exceed the maximum authorized by facts admitted by the defendant or established by the jury verdict. Accordingly, we conclude that Williams\u2019s sentence was not Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>see also United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300-01 (4th Cir.2005). We thus affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Foster\u2019s motion to suppress his unwarned statements. We vacate Foster\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, but affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
