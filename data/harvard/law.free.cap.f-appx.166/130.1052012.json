Jimenez-Velasco, </em>87 Fed. Appx. 993 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>Jimenez-Velasco v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1116, 125 S.Ct. 1110, 160 L.Ed.2d 989 (2005), the Supreme Court granted Jiminez-Velasco\u2019s petition for a rehearing of the denial of his writ of certiorari, vacated its previous order denying his petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated our opinion affirming Jimenez-Velasco\u2019s conviction and sentence, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-21\">Jimenez-Velasco argues that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>Booker, </em>because his sentence was based upon drug amounts not found by a jury or admitted by him. He did not raise this issue in district court. Therefore, we review only for plain error, and JimenezVelasco fails to demonstrate that the district court would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>see also United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676-77 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, this court has rejected his argument that a <em>Booker </em>error is a structural error or that such error is presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-22\">Because nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case, we reinstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>our judgment affirming Jimenez-Velasco\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
