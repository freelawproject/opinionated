Reversible error exists in part under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">Defendant argues that the district court erred in not applying an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Defendant points to his expression of guilt, his feelings of embarrassment and remorse, his request for mental health counseling after his arrest, and the probation officer\u2019s initial recommendation that he receive a two-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">We review a district court\u2019s fact determinations about a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005). The Sentencing Guidelines allow an offense level reduction where a defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates accep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. We are aware that Defendant entered a guilty plea before trial, which is evidence that he accepted responsibility for his acts. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.3). But while in jail awaiting the resolution of his case, Defendant requested that an associate send him written stories describing the sexual victimization of children. Defendant offered to pay $40 per story and directed the associate to send the stories under the guise of legal mail. The district court did not commit clear error in considering this conduct as inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility for possession of child pornography. <em>See id. </em>(noting that defendant\u2019s guilty plea and truthful admission of offense conduct may be outweighed by conduct inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Defendant also argues that his sentence must be vacated under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Booker </em>because his sentence was enhanced based on facts that he did not admit and that were not alleged in the indictment. He also asserts that, after <em>Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Defendant raised a timely objection to his sentence based on <em>Blakely. </em>Thus, we review his <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim <em>de novo, </em>but we will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Two kinds of sentencing errors exist based on <em>Booker: </em>(1) the constitutional error of imposing a sentence enhancement based on judicial fact finding that goes beyond facts admitted by a defendant or determined by a jury, and (2) the statutory error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The district court did not commit a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. Defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced for (1) trafficking in child pornography, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2G2.4, 2G2.2, (2) images involving prepubescent minors, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), (3) trading of child pornography, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(B), (4) sadistic, masochistic, or violent images, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3), (5) a pattern of activity involving sexual abuse of a minor based on Defendant\u2019s earlier sexual abuse conviction and probation violation, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), (6) use of a computer, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5), and (7) over 600 images, \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6)(D). At his second plea colloquy, Defendant admitted (1) that he used a computer to send pornographic images, some of which were sadomasochistic images, (2) that the images involved prepubescent minors, and (3) that he had hundreds of images. Thus, Defendant admitted the facts used to enhance his sentence. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330 (no Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>violation where defendant admits to facts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>enhanced his sentence). And the use of a prior conviction to enhance Defendant\u2019s sentence does not implicate <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1329. Therefore, the district court did not commit constitutional <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">But the district court did commit statutory <em>Booker </em>error when it sentenced Defendant under a mandatory guideline system. And the government concedes that this error occurred. The government then bears the burden of showing that the statutory error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless only if the government shows that the error did not affect the sentence, or had only a very slight effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The government has not carried its burden. <em>See id. </em>(stating that \u201c[t]he non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet\u201d). The government admits that the effect of the statutory <em>Booker </em>error on Defendant\u2019s sentence is unclear. The district court did not comment on whether it felt that Defendant\u2019s sentence was too harsh or too lenient. And the district court made no statement that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of whether the guidelines were advisory or mandatory. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (concluding that statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless where district court announced it would have imposed same sentence if guidelines were unconstitutional as applied mandatorily).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We are aware that Defendant\u2019s ultimate guideline sentence range of 360 months to life imprisonment was greater than the 20-year statutory maximum sentence. So, Defendant\u2019s guideline sentencing range became 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). And the government points to the facts of Defendant\u2019s offense as inconsistent with Defendant receiving a lower sentence. But the sentence and the facts of the offense tell us nothing about whether the district could would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. We conclude that the government has not shown that the statutory <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In sum, although the district court did not err in refusing to apply an acceptaneeof-responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1, Defendant must be resentenced under an advisory guidelines system in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. Defendant couches his argument as a challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of a \"downward departure,\u201d rather than an offense level reduction. Our review of the record shows that, because the district court determined that Defendant\u2019s ultimate guideline sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment was greater than the 20-year statutory maximum sentence, Defendant\u2019s guideline sentencing range became 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). The district court rejected Defendant\u2019s argument for a downward departure from the statutory maximum so that he would get credit for acceptance of responsibility. The district court stated it was aware of its authority to depart downward on this basis, but refused to do so. To the extent that Defendant challenges this denial of a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
