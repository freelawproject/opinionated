He first argues on appeal that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. Hernandez-Lazaro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez-Lazaro contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez-Lazaro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Hernandez-Lazaro\u2019s argument that the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses bar the application of Justice Breyer\u2019s remedy opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when resentencing defendants in light of <em>Booker </em>is foreclosed by our prior caselaw. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Hernandez-Lazaro contends that his sentence should be vacated and remanded because the district court sentenced him under the mandatory guidelines scheme held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the district court sentenced Hernandez-Lazaro under a mandatory guidelines regime, it committed <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). When a <em>Fanfan </em>error \u201cis preserved in the district court by an objection, we will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The Government concedes that this claim was preserved and that it cannot show that the <em>Fanfan </em>error that occurred in the instant case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">We agree that the Government cannot meet its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the error. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore vacate Hernandezr-Lazaro\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
