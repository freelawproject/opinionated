Davila-Rodriguez appeals his 180-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribute one kilogram of heroin, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and 846. Davila-Rodriguez argues on appeal that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based on its determination that a prior conviction(s) involved conduct that presented a serious risk of physical injury to another. He also contends for the first time on appeal that the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>consideration of prior convictions in sentencing him violated his constitutional rights, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment, charging Davila-Rodriguez with the above-referenced offense. In pleading guilty, Davila-Rodriguez agreed that (1) the government could prove that the conspiracy involved one kilogram or more of heroin, (2) his minimum statutory sentence was ten years\u2019 imprisonment, (3) his maximum statutory sentence was life imprisonment, and (4) he might qualify as a career offender under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cfederal guidelines\u201d). He, however, did not admit, and his indictment did not charge, either that he had prior convictions, or the nature of these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set his base offense level at 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(4), for a drug offense involving at least one kilogram, but less than three kilograms, of heroin. The probation officer also recommended that Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s offense level be enhanced to level 37, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(A), because he was a career criminal and he had a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s offense level was adjusted downward three levels for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was 34, his criminal history category was VI, and his resulting guideline range was 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Prior to sentencing, Davila-Rodriguez filed objections to his PSI, objecting to, among other things, the PSI\u2019s classification of him as a \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender. The probation officer responded that this career-offender classification was applicable because (1) Davila-Rodriguez was 29 years\u2019 old at the time he committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense was a felony controlled-substance offense; and (3) he had prior felony convictions for (i) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, and (ii) carrying a loaded concealed weapon without authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">On February 17, 2005, at sentencing, the court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s providing substantial assistance by agreeing to testify against a codefendant. Next addressing the recommended \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement, Davila-Rodriguez admitted that he had been convicted of multiple firearm offenses in Puerto Rico, but contended that none of the firearm offenses listed in his PSI qualified as \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). He also contended that his prior firearms offenses from Puerto Rico were inadmissible due to lack of notice, translation, fingerprints to establish identity, and factual details. Without objection, the court continued sentencing to allow the government additional time to have these documents transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">When sentencing reconvened, the government introduced certified, transcribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>records from Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Davila-Rodriguez argued that, although this Court has concluded that carrying a concealed weapon, as opposed to merely possessing a weapon, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a), his Article 7 conviction only was for carrying and bearing a revolver. The government responded that (1) the court only should look at the relevant statute in determining whether the offense at issue was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d (2) the relevant statute included an intent element and the requirement that the firearm be loaded, and (3) the court\u2019s inquiry should be whether it was an offense that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury. The court again continued sentencing to give the parties time to prepare sentencing memoranda addressing these \u00a7 4B1.1 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">When sentencing reconvened for the fourth time,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court, both orally and in a written sentencing order, overruled Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s objection to being classified as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. In doing so, the court found that, despite the charging instruments that the government had introduced, showing a charge of violating Article 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapon\u2019s Law, Davila-Rodriguez actually had been convicted in Case No. KLA95G0199, for a violation of Article 7 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, 25 P.R. Laws Ann \u00a7 417, for a felony of bearing or carrying a firearm without a license after having been convicted of certain violations. The court also found that Davila-Rodriguez had been convicted in Case No. KLA95G0263, for a violation of Article 11 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, 25 P.R. Laws Ann \u00a7 421, for bearing and carrying a firearm with a defaced serial number.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The court then explained that both of these prior convictions qualified as \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), because they had involved conduct that had presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Relying specifically on our decisions in <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), and <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398 (11th Cir.1996), the district court acknowledged that those cases involved concealment of a firearm, but reasoned that the Article 7 offense of carrying and transporting a firearm by a convicted felon, instead of merely possessing a firearm, was an active crime similar to concealment of a firearm, whereby the firearm was accessible for use on another person. The court also discussed that the Article 11 offense of carrying a firearm that had been altered to hide serial numbers (1) was distinguishable from situations in which there might be a legitimate reason for possessing a firearm, and (2) targeted a specific firearm \u201cdeemed to be particularly dangerous and a substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tial risk to the physical safety of human beings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">After the court verified that DavilaRodriguez had no other objections to the PSI, it granted him a two-level \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the three-level \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure for substantial assistance, and a one-level departure from his criminal history category for over-representation of criminal history, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(3). Davila-Rodriguez had a total offense level of 31, a criminal history category of Y, and a resulting guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then sentenced Davila-Rodriguez to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, 5 years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment fee. In imposing this sentence, the court stated that it had (1) considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s advisory guideline range; and (2) determined that a harsher sentence was warranted in the instant case because DavilaRodriguez already had been sentenced for a drug offense in New York. Moreover, in its written sentencing order, the court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">[Tjhe sentence of 180 months would have been an appropriate sentence for this Defendant regardless of whether he had been qualified as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, it is ultimately not critical whether both, one, or neither of the Puerto Rico convictions discussed above qualify as crimes of violence. The sentence would have been the same anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Davila-Rodriguez is arguing on appeal that the court erred in classifying him as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 because neither of his prior convictions under the Weapons Law of Puerto Rico constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). He generally asserts that, (1) although the federal guidelines under which he was sentenced were only advisory, the court still had to calculate correctly his sentencing range; and (2) under the rule of lenity, the court must resolve any ambiguities in the application of the federal guidelines in his favor. He specifically contends that, applying the categorical approach to his unambiguous Article 7 conviction, it did not involve necessarily either criminal intent, or \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also asserts that, pursuant to the amended commentary for \u00a7 4B1.2, his mere possession of a defaced firearm was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the firearm was not a sawed-off shotgun or rifle, a silencer, a bomb, or a machine gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Post <em>-Booker, </em>district courts, while not bound by the federal guidelines, must continue to consult the provisions of the federal guidelines and consider them in sentencing. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). As DavilaRodriguez contends, \u201c[tjhis consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the [federal guidelines].\u201d <em>See id. </em>(emphasis in original). \u201cA misinterpretation of the [federal guidelines] by a district court effectively means that the district court has not properly consulted the [federal guidelines].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179 (quotation marks, citations, and punctuation omitted). We review questions of law arising under the federal guidelines <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>A defendant qualifies as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the federal guidelines if \u201c(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). In the instant case, the only \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) element at issue is whether, in addition to a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense, Davila-Rodriguez had a prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The federal guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that \u2014 (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). As the first application note to \u00a7 4B1.2 explains, \u201c \u2018[cjrimes of violence\u2019 includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That application note further explains that: \u201c[o]ther offenses are included as \u2018crimes of violence\u2019 if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e. expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted ..., by its nature, presented a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZo\">[Ujnder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, there are two approaches for classifying an offense as a crime of violence. The first approach is to determine whether the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another is an element of [the offense] ... Alternatively, under the second approach, we must determine whether [the offense] involves conduct that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\"><em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1196 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In the instant case, the government did not assert that the attempted use or threatened use of physical force is an element of either of Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s relevant Puerto Rico convictions. Instead, it contended that, similar to the crime of carrying a concealed weapon, the offenses involve \u201cconduct that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Article 7 of the Puerto Rican Weapons Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">Any person who bears, carries, or transports any pistol, revolver or other firearm without having a license therefor issued as hereinafter provided, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, if previously convicted of any violation of this chapter or of any of the offenses specified in \u00a7 427 of this title, or uses the weapons in the commission of any such offenses, shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Article 7 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Act, 25 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 417. Furthermore, under Article 11 of this Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Any person shall be guilty of a felony who: (a) Willfully removes, defaces, covers, alters, or destroys the serial number of any firearm or the name of the owner thereof; or who (b) knowingly buys, sells, receives, alienates, transfers, carries, or has in his possession any firearm from which the serial number or name of the owner thereof has been removed, defaced, altered, or destroyed ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Article 11 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Act, 25 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We have not addressed whether either of these Puerto Rico offenses are \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). In an analogous case, however, we concluded that carrying a concealed firearm under Florida law is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2). <em>See Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372; <em>see also Hall, </em>77 F.3d at 401-02 (concluding that carrying a concealed weapon is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because it \u201cextends beyond mere possession \u2014 the person has taken the extra step of having the weapon immediately accessible for use on another\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On the other hand, we recently determined that mere possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156(a)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>399 F.3d 1297, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2005). In doing so, we discussed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">Although possession of a firearm by a felon, like drunk driving, may in some cases involve <em>conduct </em>that creates a heightened risk of injury or violence, it cannot be said that the <em>offense </em>of simple possession of a firearm \u2018naturally involve[s] a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.\u2019 [] It is not an active crime, like burglary, which necessarily creates a substantial risk of violence. Thus, felon in possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1) is simply not the sort of violent, active crime that may be properly characterized, categorically, as a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\"><em>See id. </em>at 1302 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Moreover, as Davila-Rodriguez contends, following Amendment 674, a 2004 amendment, application note 1 of \u00a7 4B1.2 now reads as follows: \u201c \u2018Crime of violence\u2019 does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, unless the possession was of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), comment, (n.l) (2004).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tion 5845(a) states that a \u201cfirearm\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(1) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels if less than 18 inches in length; (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; (3) a rifle having a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length; (4) a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length; (5) any other weapon, as defined in subsection (e); (6) a machinegun; (7) any silencer []; and (8) a destructive device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Here, Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s prior convictions involved \u201ccarrying and bearing,\u201d instead of merely possessing a firearm. On the other hand, none of the exceptions listed in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) include either the shotgun or pistol at issue in DavilaRodriguez\u2019s firearm convictions, or the fact that one of the firearms was \u201cdefaced.\u201d <em>See generally </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regardless, we need not determine whether either carrying and bearing a firearm by a convicted felon under Article 7, or carrying and bearing a defaced weapon until Article 11, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because, even if the court erred in deciding this issue, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Sentencing errors are reviewed for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1183-84 (11th Cir. 2005). In the <em>Booker </em>context, we have explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">[A] \u201cnon-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcL\"><em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and marks omitted). Moreover, the government has the burden of showing that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">In <em>Mathenia, </em>we noted that, although the district court violated <em>Booker </em>by treating the federal guidelines as mandatory, the sentencing judge stated that \u201cI would nonetheless consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence I would impose would be the same.\u201d <em>See id. </em>We determined that, because the judge stated that the defendant\u2019s sentence would be the same, we knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1292. We concluded, therefore, that the government had met its burden under harmless-error review. <em>See id. </em>at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Similarly, in <em>Magluta, </em>we determined that we need not decide whether the district court erred in calculating Magluta\u2019s offense level using an amount of money that was greater than the figure that the jury found in its special forfeiture verdict because the district court stated that, if we determined that the district court\u2019s reasoning in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline range was in error, the district court would have employed an upward departure to reach the same result. <em>See Magluta, </em>418 F.3d at 1183-84. We concluded that, because district courts are better situated to determine if a case is outside the heartland of cases, and because an upward departure would have reviewed only for an abuse of discretion, any two-point error in the defendant\u2019s offense level was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 1184-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Similar to the facts in <em>Mathenia </em>and <em>Magluta, </em>it is clear from the record in the instant case that any error did not affect Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence. The district court explicitly stated in its written sentencing order that the 180-month sentence that it imposed \u201cwould have been the appropriate sentence for this Defendant regardless of whether he had been qualified as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he sentence would have been the same anyway.\u201d Moreover, the court explained at sentencing that it had (1) considered the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and (2) determined that a harsher sentence was warranted because Davila-Rodriguez previously had committed a drug offense. Indeed, <em>post-Booker, </em>although the guidelines \u201cremain an essential consideration in the imposition of federal sentences, albeit along with the factors in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d after a court has calculated a defendant\u2019s guideline range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence,\u201d which we review only for reasonableness. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79. Thus, we conclude that we need not decide whether the district court erred in sentencing Davila-Rodriguez as a career offender because the government met its burden of showing that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">As discussed above, Davila-Rodriguez also is arguing, for the first time on appeal, that the court\u2019s consideration of his prior convictions in sentencing him as a career offender was in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>Davila-Rodriguez concedes that we have determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that is, that the government is not required to charge prior convictions in an indictment, remains the law unless and until the Supreme Court overrules it. He contends, however, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been called into doubt by subsequent opinions by members of the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and its progeny, and that this is an appropriate case to reconsider the continued viability of <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Because Davila-Rodriguez failed to raise his constitutional challenges in the district court, we review them only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>1291, 1298 (11th Cir.) (applying plain-error review to a newly-raised <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Under plain-error review, an appellate court may not correct an error that the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u201c \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We have concluded that the Supreme Court, in <em>Booker, </em>rejected the argument that, even when the federal guidelines are applied in an advisory fashion, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits the sentencing court from making factual determinations that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admissions.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005). Here, because Davila-Rodriguez was sentenced <em>post-Booker, </em>with the court treating the federal guidelines as advisory, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Regardless, even if Davila-Rodriguez had not been sentenced under an advisory guideline scheme, he failed to show constitutional error under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. </em>\u201cIn <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>we held that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains good law. <em>See Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1257-58 n. 14. Moreover, prior to sentencing in the instant case, the Supreme Court, in <em>Booker, </em>reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. at 756. Again, after <em>Booker, </em>we held that the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was \u201cleft undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker,\u201d </em>and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Also prior to sentencing, a plurality of the Supreme Court in <em>Shepard </em>explained that, while a dispute over whether a burglary was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) enhancement could be \u201cdescribed as a fact about a prior conviction, it [was] too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to <em>[Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) ] and <em>Apprendi, </em>to say that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 1262. However, after the Supreme Court decided <em>Shepard, </em>we held, under plain-error review, that a district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) did not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1315-16. In a footnote, we noted that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>must be followed because, while <em>Shepard </em>\u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019s </em>holding regarding prior convictions, the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. \u201d Id. </em>at 1316 n. 3. Most recently, we reiterated in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142 (11th Cir.2005), that the holding in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains undisturbed. <em>Id., </em>at 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Accordingly, insofar as the district court\u2019s enhancement of Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 involved determinations that he had prior convictions, these determinations did not implicate the <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>line of cases. Moreover, to the extent that Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s argument can be construed as asserting that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not applicable because the government had to show that his prior convictions, in addition to existing, were \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d we also have rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, \u201cwhether a previous conviction is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 is a question of law, not of fact, as it must be determined by interpreting [\u00a7 4B1.2]\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the defendant\u2019s argument that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, must determine whether his prior conviction is within the category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii) was without merit). Thus, no constitutional error, plain or otherwise, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in sentencing Davila-Rodriguez as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. Moreover, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in considering Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s prior convictions in sentencing him under an advisory-guideline scheme. We, therefore, affirm Davila-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-8\">. The PSI identified the predicate prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense on which it was relying in classifying Davila-Rodriguez as a career criminal as (1) a 1995 conviction in San Juan Superior Court, Puerto Rico, for carrying and bearing a loaded firearm without authorization; and (2) a 1996 conviction in the State of New York, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\">. These records from Puerto Rico specifically included (1) a complaint in Case No. KLA95G0199, charging him with a violation of Article 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, 25 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 418 (repealed 2000), \"which made it a felony to bear or carry a loaded firearm without a license\u201d; (2) a complaint in Case No. KLA95G0263, charging him with a violation of Article 11 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, 25 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 421, \"which made it a felony to carry or possess any firearm from which the serial number has been defaced\u201d; and (3) a sentencing document in the above-referenced cases, reflecting that he actually plead guilty to violations of Articles 7 and 11, 25 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 417 and 421, and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for each charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b427-11\">. Prior to this final sentencing hearing, the parties each submitted a sentencing memorandum, arguing why or why not the court should sentence Davila-Rodriguez as a career offender. Moreover, the court continued sentencing for a third time, again to allow the parties additional time to prepare for arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">. Davila-Rodriguez alternatively contends that, to the extent his Article 7 offense was ambiguous, the court could not look at the underlying facts of the conviction in the complaint because the complaint charged him with committing an Article 8 offense \u2014 an offense to which he did not plead guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. We treat the commentary in the federal guidelines as authoritative, unless it is plainly erroneous, is inconsistent with the regulation it interprets, or is contrary to the United States Constitution or federal law. <em>See United States v. Torrealba, </em>339 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1919, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">. We have concluded that the definition in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) of a \"crime of violence\u201d is \"virtually identical\u201d to \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s definition of \"violent felony.\u201d <em>See United States v.

Section 3156(a)(4), which contains similar language as \u00a7 4B 1.2(a), defines \"crime of violence\u201d in the context of, among other things, whether a defendant must be detained after conviction, but before sentencing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3143(a)(2), 3156(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b430-14\">. Prior to Amendment 674, application note 1 merely instructed that a \" '[cjrime of violence\u2019 does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), comment, (n.l) (2003). Thus, pursuant to Amendment 674, felons that possess those firearms described in \u00a7 5845(a) now do not fall within the rule that excludes felons in possession offenses from the definition of \"crime of violence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In amending this commentary, the Sentencing Commission explained that \"Congress has determined that those firearms described in [\u00a7 5845(a)] are inherently dangerous and when possessed unlawfully, serve only violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>purposes.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, Amend. 674 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. Although we may depart from the categorical approach and look behind a state conviction in federal sentencing to a limited extent in the situation where the judgment of conviction and the statute are ambiguous, <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1258, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the government has not explained either why the relevant statutes are ambiguous, or how such a review would produce a different result. Indeed, as Davila-Rodriguez contends, his charging documents for his Article 7 conviction are not relevant because he originally was charged with committing an Article 8 violation. <em>See United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 940 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convicted). Furthermore, because the statutes are not ambiguous, the rule of lenity is not applicable. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005) (holding that the rule of lenity applies only if the provision being construed is still ambiguous after the application of normal rules of construction).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">.
