He asserts two bases for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">First, Carmona-Calderon asserts that the district court\u2019s belief at the time of sentencing that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, rather than advisory, requires reversal by this court under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Carmona-Calderon preserved the Fanfan error in the district court, we apply a harmless error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The Government has not met its burden of proving that the district judge would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-65 (5th Cir.2005). Carmona-Calderon\u2019s sentence is thus vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Carmona-Calderon also maintains that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. This issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Carmona-Calderon contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carmona-Calderon properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
