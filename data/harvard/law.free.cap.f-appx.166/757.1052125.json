Guerrero, Jr., federal prisoner # 43281-080, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for modification of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, or, in the alternative, a writ of coram nobis. He argues that the district court erred in denying relief on his claims that (1) he is entitled to release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A), based on his heart condition, and (2) his sentence is illegal because it was based on facts not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 755-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-23\">Guerrero does not argue that he has an illness from which he will die within one year or that his medical condition has rendered him unable to provide self-care. Thus, he has not shown that the Bureau of Prisons abused its discretion in applying its interpretive rule restricting the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(l)(A)(i) to inmates who have been diagnosed with medical conditions that are terminal within one year or who suffer from severely debilitating and irreversible conditions that render them unable to provide self-care. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Because Guerrero\u2019s <em>Blakely/Booker </em>argument seeks to challenge alleged sentencing errors, a \u00a7 2255 motion was the appropriate vehicle in which to raise the claims absent a showing that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Guerrero\u2019s claims do not fall within this exception, otherwise known as \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d because <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Thus, his sentencing challenge is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id. </em>The district court did not err in denying Guerrero\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Guerrero\u2019s motion to \u201cInclude Information\u201d is treated as a motion to file a supplemental brief and is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
