We have reviewed the district court orders and the record and affirm the dismissal of the complaint against Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Fairfax Connector for the reasons cited by the district court. <em>See Richardson v. Powel, </em>No. CA-04-874-1 (E.D. Va. filed Nov. 22, 2004; entered Nov. 23, 2004). We further affirm the dismissal of the complaint against Defendants Powel and Lyle for the reasons cited by the district court. <em>See Richardson v. Powel, </em>No. CA-04-874-1 (E.D. Va. filed Sept. 16, 2005; entered Sept. 19, 2005). With respect to the court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint against Freedom Bail Bonding Corporation (\u201cFreedom\u201d), we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">A review of the record discloses Freedom moved for a judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment and submitted an affidavit by the company\u2019s president refuting Richardson\u2019s allegations. The district court relied on the affidavit in granting Freedom\u2019s motion. As a general rule, if materials \u201coutside the pleading[s] are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment ..., and all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); <em>see Gay v. Wall, </em>761 F.2d 175, 177-78 (4th Cir.1985). Citing, inter alia, Richardson\u2019s failure to present evidence, the district court granted Freedom\u2019s motion. The district court did not provide Richardson with the notice required by <em>Roseboro v. Garrison, </em>528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir.1975). <em>Roseboro </em>prohibits the entry of summary judgment based on a pro se party\u2019s failure to submit affidavits supporting her allegations unless such party is given a reasonable opportunity to file counter-affidavits or other appropriate materials and is informed that failure to file such a response may result in dismissal of the action. <em>Id. </em>Although Richardson responded to Freedom\u2019s motion, she did not submit any affidavits in support of her claims. The district court granted Freedom\u2019s motion, in part, based on Richardson\u2019s failure to produce such supporting evidence. On this record, we cannot find that the district court\u2019s failure to provide <em>Roseboro </em>notice was harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). We therefore vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Freedom and remand this case to the district court with instructions to provide Richardson with the notice and opportunity to respond to which she is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint against Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Fairfax Connector, Kimberly Powel and J.C. Lyle. We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal in favor of Freedom and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\"> The reason for remand is entirely procedural and is unrelated to the merits of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
