He argues that the undisputed evidence before the district court was that the rifles were purchased by Enriquez\u2019s sons\u2019 mother for hunting and that Enriquez used the rifles to hunt snakes and other pests on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>property that he shared with his sons. He argues that, therefore, the evidence showed that the rifles were used to shoot varmints and that varmint hunting is a lawful sporting use.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The district court was able to rely upon the presentence report\u2019s statements that Enriquez had initially denied owning any rifles as evidence that Enriquez\u2019s assertions that the rifles were used for \u201cvarmint hunting\u201d were not credible. <em>See United States v. Brown, 54 </em>F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did not clearly err in finding that the reduction for \u201csporting use\u201d was not warranted. <em>See United States v. Shell, </em>972 F.2d 548, 550 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Enriquez also argues that the district court did not consider and tailor its sentence in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, because the court issued a sentence within the Guidelines, the district court was not required to consider explicitly those factors on the record, and Enriquez\u2019s argument fails. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">For the first time on appeal, Enriquez argues that the district court abused its discretion in subjecting him to the collection of DNA as a term of his supervised release under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135A(d). He argues that the version of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a(d) that was in effect at the time of the offense does not list his offense of conviction as one of the offenses for which DNA collection was authorized. He argues that the amendment of that statute on October 30, 2004, to authorize DNA collection upon conviction of \u201cany felony\u201d cannot be applied to him because collection of DNA is a punishment and would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. He further argues that even if application of the statute is not a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause it is still forbidden by general principles of nonretroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Enriquez\u2019s claim regarding collection of DNA on supervised release is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005). Enriquez\u2019s claim is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Finally, Enriquez argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is facially unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce and, alternatively, there is an insufficient factual basis for the application of that statute based on the firearm\u2019s movement from one state to another at some indeterminate time in the past. As he concedes, the \u201cconstitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question\u201d in this circuit. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The judgment and sentence of the district court are DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
