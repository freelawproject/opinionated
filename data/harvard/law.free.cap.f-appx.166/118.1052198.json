On August 3, 2005, Nguyen was indicted on one count of aiding and abetting money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 1956(a)(1)(A). On August 4, 2005, a detention hearing was held before the magistrate judge. The Government argued, and the magistrate agreed, that Nguyen poses a serious flight risk and that there are no release conditions to sufficiently address the risk of his nonappearance for trial. The question of Nguyen\u2019s detention was reopened on August 29, 2005 to allow Nguyen to present additional evidence regarding his risk of flight. Again, the magistrate judge denied bail and ordered pretrial detention. Nguyen appealed to the district court, which summarily affirmed the magistrate\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u2018When a district court acts on a motion to revoke or amend a magistrate\u2019s pretrial detention order, the district court acts <em>de novo </em>and must make an independent determination of the proper pretrial detention or conditions for release.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 585 (5th Cir.1992). Absent an error of law, this Court must apply a deferential standard of review and uphold a district court order \u201cif it is supported by the proceedings below.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 586, citing <em>United States v. Hare, </em>873 F.2d 796, 798 (5th Cir.1989). \u201cOn appeal, the question becomes whether the evidence as a whole supports the conclusions of the proceedings below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">Pursuant to the Bail Reform Act, a defendant should be released pre-trial on personal recognizance or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond \u201cunless the judicial officer determines that such release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of any other person or the community.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(b). This is to be determined by a detention hearing. \u00a7 3142(e). Detention can be ordered only in a case that involves one of the six circumstances listed in \u00a7 3142(f). <em>See United States v. Byrd, </em>969 F.2d 106, 109 (5th Cir.1992). \u201cA serious risk that the person will flee\u201d is one of those six circumstances that warrants detention if there are no release conditions that will reasonable assure appearance of the defendant when required. \u00a7 3142(f)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">In this case, the evidence as a whole supports the magistrate\u2019s finding that Nguyen posed a serious risk of flight. The magistrate\u2019s use of the term \u201cunacceptable risk of flight\u201d does not indicate that the magistrate applied the wrong legal standard. Furthermore, the Government carried its burden of showing that there are no release conditions which would sufficiently address the risk of Nguyen\u2019s nonappearance. As such, the district court did not err in denying Nguyen\u2019s motion to revoke the magistrate judge\u2019s detention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>order. <em>See United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The appellant\u2019s request for bail pending trial is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
