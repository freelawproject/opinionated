The district court imposed as conditions of supervised release that Contreras not commit another federal, state, or local crime and that he not illegally reenter the United States. The district court revoked Contreras\u2019s supervised release in 2004 and imposed a further term of imprisonment because Contreras was again found in the United State illegally during his supervised release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-24\">Contreras appeals from the revocation, arguing that the district court abused its discretion because he did not receive the statutory written notice of the conditions of supervised release required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(f) and 3603(1). He argues further that the error does not qualify as harmless error because he lacked actual notice of the conditions. The Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>argues that we should apply plain error review because Contreras did not properly raise his argument at the revocation hearing in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The record shows that the district court correctly informed Contreras of the conditions of his supervised release, and Contreras indicated that he understood. Therefore, Contreras had actual notice. The district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, by revoking Contreras\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Arbizu, </em>431 F.3d 469, 470 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b131-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
