Because our review of the record discloses no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">Aviles-Flores first claims insufficient evidence supported the district court\u2019s factual finding that he possessed a dangerous weapon during the scope of his criminal conduct. Although the parties dispute whether Aviles-Flores partially waived this claim, our review of the record, including the testimony at the sentencing hearing, discloses that sufficient evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding. Moreover, because Aviles-Flores possessed a firearm, the district court did not err in declining to award Aviles-Flores the benefit of the safety valve provision. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 501.2(a)(2) (2002). Accordingly, we deny relief on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">Aviles-Flores also asserts the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence violates his Sixth Amendment right to trial by a jury. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Aviles-Flores did not raise this issue in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.2005). To establish plain error, Aviles-Flores must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.2005). To establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred in his sentencing, AvilesFlores must show that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts that he admitted. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction), which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Aviles-Flores pled guilty to Count 36 of the indictment, aiding and abetting the distribution of 895.7 grams of methamphetamine. This drug quantity supports a base offense level of thirty-two. <em>See USSG </em>\u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(4) (for \u201cat least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Methamphetamine\u201d). When combined with AvilesFlores\u2019 criminal history category, this base offense level corresponds to a sentencing range of 121 to 151 months. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, table. Because AvilesFlores\u2019 sentence of 135 months does not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts he admitted, no Sixth Amendment error occurred. Accordingly, we affirm Aviles-Flores\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
