He challenges his sentence on three bases. First, he argues that his prior burglary-of-a-habitation conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d supporting the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). This argument is foreclosed. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). Second, he argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. This argument is also foreclosed. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-24\">Finally, Anaya argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence pursuant to the then-mandatory guidelines was not harmless error. This argument has merit. The Government has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in imposing a sentence pursuant to the then-mandatory guidelines was harmless. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Anaya\u2019s sentence is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-25\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
