Kasoka contends that she established eligibility for asylum. As the IJ and Board concluded that the asylum application was untimely, we find that consideration of Kasoka\u2019s asylum claim is barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-23\">Kasoka also challenges the finding that she failed to qualify for withholding of removal and for protection under CAT. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>evidence supports the finding that Kasoka failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
