Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it sentenced him based on facts that were neither admitted by him or found by a jury. The Government argues that Whavers\u2019s appeal is barred by the waiver of appeal that is contained in his plea agreement and has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">In Whavers\u2019s plea agreement he expressly waived, inter aha, the right to appeal his conviction and sentence, or the manner in which the sentence was imposed, on the grounds set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, or on any ground whatsoever. However, at his rearraignment, the district court advised Whavers that he had waived his right to appeal \u201cas long as it\u2019s a legal sentence.\u201d The district court thus mischaracterized the appeal waiver by stating that Whavers would lose his right to appeal as long as the court imposed a \u201clegal sentence,\u201d because the district court\u2019s statement implies that Whavers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>could appeal an \u201cillegal sentence,\u201d a right that was not included in the appeal waiver. The district court\u2019s advice thus included an inaccurate characterization of the appeal waiver and therefore does not comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N)\u2019s requirement that the court advise the defendant of \u201cthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal.\u201d Thus, the appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999). The appeal waiver therefore does not bar this appeal. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Whavers is correct that the district court committed Sixth Amendment error under <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, when the district court calculated Whavers\u2019s sentence based upon factual determinations of drug quantity and offense role that were neither admitted by Whavers nor determined by a jury. Additionally, as the Government concedes, Whavers\u2019s objection apprised the district court that he was raising a Sixth Amendment challenge to the sentencing enhancements and therefore he preserved this issue. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376 (5th Cir.2005). Where, as here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [this court] can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government concedes that it cannot show harmlessness in Whavers\u2019s case. Thus, the Government has not met its \u201carduous\u201d burden of demonstrating \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Sixth Amendment Booker error did not affect the sentence that [Whavers] received.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285, 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Accordingly, Whavers\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED; MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
