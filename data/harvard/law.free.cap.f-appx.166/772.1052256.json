Zuniga challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), (2) (imposition of criminal penalties for illegal reentery by aliens who have been removed for conviction of: three or more misdemeanors involving drugs or crimes against the person; a felony; or an aggravated felony) and the district court\u2019s application of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Neither issue is precluded from being raised on appeal by the waiver contained in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-24\">As Zuniga concedes, his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Although Zuniga contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Zuniga raises this issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Zuniga also contends the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory Guidelines regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-65, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Zuniga objected in district court, \u201cthe only question is whether the government has met its burden to show harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt in the imposition of [Zuniga\u2019s] sentence\u201d. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime, and, therefore, the Government has not borne its burden. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
