Some claims and some defendants were dismissed prior to trial, one defendant was dismissed during trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the remaining defendants. Skinner appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. He also claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Skinner asserts that his Rule 59(e) motion should have been granted to reverse a ruling dismissing defendant Payton. Skinner has not shown an abuse of discretion in the motion\u2019s being denied. <em>See S. Constructors Group, Inc. v. Dynalectric Co., </em>2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir.1993). The evidence at trial showed that Payton did <em>not </em>act with deliberate indifference to Skinner\u2019s serious medical needs; rather, it showed only that Skinner disagreed with the care he was given, which is insufficient to raise a viable claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cDisagreement with medical treatment does not state a claim for Eighth Amendment indifference to medical needs.\u201d); <em>see also Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (noting the \u201cextremely high standard\u201d required to prove deliberate indifference). This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Skinner also contends that his appointed counsel rendered ineffective assistance during and after trial. As Skinner concedes, this claim is unavailing; the right to effective assistance of counsel does <em>not </em>apply in a civil action. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>785 F.2d 1236, 1237 (5th Cir.1986). To the extent that Skinner requests we overrule this jurisprudence, this request is denied. <em>See United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 834, 114 S.Ct. 108, 126 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
