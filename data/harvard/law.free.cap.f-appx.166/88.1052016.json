Under United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1, Bell\u2019s base offense level for the violation was twenty, increased by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A) because the offense involved three-to-seven firearms. With a total offense level of twenty-two, and a criminal history category of III, Bell\u2019s recommended guideline range was fifty-one to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court treated the guidelines as mandatory and imposed a sentence of fifty-six months imprisonment along with a three-year term of supervised release. However, following our guidance in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>381 F.3d 316, 353 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), judgment vacated, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005), the district court stated that the sentence would be the same if the guidelines were merely advisory. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Bell\u2019s first claim is that his prior North Carolina conviction of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, imposed pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17, cannot form the predicate for his \u00a7 922(g) conviction because the former was not for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. For the same reason, Bell argues that the district court erred in relying upon this conviction to increase his base offense level from fourteen to twenty under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A). Bell\u2019s arguments in this regard are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999), is still viable after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reaffirming that \u201ca prior North Carolina conviction was for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if <em>any </em>defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence of more than one year\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Bell next claims that the district court abused its discretion when it excluded testimony offered to impeach the character and conduct of two witnesses called by the prosecution. The district court ruled that the evidence was not admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608 and disallowed the testimony. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs on this issue, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the evidence was not admissible under Rule 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Bell next contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court erroneously imposed a two-level enhancement for an offense involving three-to-seven firearms pursuant to USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A), in its guideline calculation. At the time of his arrest, Bell was traveling as a passenger in a car driven by-Harold Oxendine. A rifle was found in the trunk of the vehicle, which Bell and Oxen-dine had earlier retrieved from a garage at his parents\u2019 home. Bell admitted that the rifle belonged to him, and advised federal agents that there were three additional firearms stored in the same garage. On appeal, Bell argues that this evidence of mere ownership was insufficient to demonstrate that he had actual or constructive possession of guns stored in a garage owned by someone else. We hold that the district court\u2019s imposition of the two-level enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>124 F.3d 607, 610 (4th Cir.1997) (Constructive possession exists when \u201cthe defendant exercised, or had the power to exercise, dominion and control over the item.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In addition to the above claims, Bell has sought leave to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, raising a <em>Booker </em>claim, as well as a claim that the court erred in not imposing an offense level of six pursuant to the provisions of USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2). We find no error in the district court\u2019s guidelines calculation under \u00a7 2K2.1 and, because the district court imposed an identical sentence pursuant to our guidance in <em>Hammond, </em>the asserted <em>Booker </em>error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Accordingly, we grant Bell\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief. We affirm Bell\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
