INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that Siahaan has failed to meet this standard. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b117-18\"> On motion of the Attorney General, this court, by order of November 7, 2005, limited the scope of the appeal to preclude a challenge to the Board\u2019s ruling that the asylum application was untimely. In addition, as Siahaan does not challenge the Board's denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture, any claim concerning that issue is waived. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
