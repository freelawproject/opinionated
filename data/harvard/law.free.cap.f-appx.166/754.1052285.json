The district court determined that Cano was an armed career criminal and sentenced him to the statutory minimum, 180 months of imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-26\">Cano argues that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give his requested jury instruction on the justification defense. Cano failed to establish that there was a present, imminent, and impending threat or that he had no opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>nity to pursue legal alternatives during the entire time that he was in possession of the ammunition. Accordingly, he has not shown that he was entitled to assert the defense of justification. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 873 (5th Cir.1998). Because he has not shown that he was entitled to assert the justification defense, he likewise has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Cano also argues that the district court erred in determining that his Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation were qualifying violent felony convictions under \u00a7 924(e). Cano contends that this court\u2019s holding to the contrary in <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992), was undercut by <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>Shepard </em>did not undercut <em>Silva; Shepard </em>extended the holding of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to cases in the guilty-plea context and clarified which documents could be considered when determining whether a prior conviction was for a generic burglary and could be used to enhance a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1259, 1263. Alternatively, Cano concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Silva, </em>but he nevertheless raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Cano additionally argues that \u00a7 924(e) is facially unconstitutional or, in the alternative, that his sentence was improperly enhanced under \u00a7 924(e) because the indictment did not contain any information regarding his prior convictions. He concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Affleck, </em>861 F.2d 97, 99 (5th Cir.1988). He further concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Cano is raising the arguments to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Cano finally argues that the statute of conviction, \u00a7 922(g)(1), is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce and is, thus, an improper exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. Cano contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), require that the ammunition possession has a \u201csubstantial\u201d effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly emphasized that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question.\u201d <em>United States v. De Leon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999). This court also has determined that \u201c[n]either <em>Jones </em>nor <em>Morrison </em>affects or undermines the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g).\u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Alternatively, Cano argues that the facts established at trial, that the ammunition which he possessed had, at some unspecified time, moved in interstate commerce, were insufficient to prove a substantial effect on interstate commerce. This court repeatedly has affirmed \u00a7 922(g)(1) convictions on evidence similar to that presented in the instant case. <em>See id. </em>at 518 &amp; n. 12 (concluding that \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s interstate commerce element is satisfied by the defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm that was manufactured in a different state or country). Cano concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>wishes to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b780-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
