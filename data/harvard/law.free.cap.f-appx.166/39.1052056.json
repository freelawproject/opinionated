True North Commc\u2019ns., </em>206 F.3d 725, 727 (7th Cir.2000). Unfortunately, that truism does not apply in the present case. Appellant, Arrowhead Global Solutions, Inc. (\u201cAGS\u201d), and their former subcontractor, Appellee, Datapath, Inc. (\u201cDatapath\u201d), present this court with a combination of three separate appeals (and assorted motions) all stemming from an acrimonious business arbitration between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">Datapath alleged that AGS breached a contract between the parties and demanded arbitration, which was commenced pursuant to the contract. The resulting arbitration and subsequent litigation led to three separate appeals. First, the arbitrators made an award of immediate equitable relief (hereinafter the \u201cPhase I Award\u201d) in favor of Datapath, enjoining AGS from performing certain work. The district court confirmed the Phase I Award. That confirmation is referred to as the \u201cConfirmation Order.\u201d AGS appeals the Confirmation Order as No. 04-2000, arguing that the Phase I Award should not have been confirmed both because it was interlocutory and because it was wrongly decided on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">While AGS was appealing the Confirmation Order, Datapath moved in the district court to hold AGS in contempt of the Confirmation Order. The district court, instead of ruling on this motion, decided to remand the issue to the arbitrators to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cclarify\u201d their Phase I Award. The parties refer to this decision as the \u201cRemand Order,\u201d and AGS appeals it as No. 04-2298. Datapath moves to dismiss No. 04-2298 for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Subsequently, the arbitrators ruled in Datapath\u2019s favor regarding damages in the case (hereinafter the \u201cPhase II Award\u201d). The district court confirmed the Phase II Award, and AGS appeals that confirmation as No. 05-1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold as follows: 1) in No. 04-2000, that the district court did have authority under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) to confirm the Phase I Award and that the district court did not err in confirming that Phase I Award on its merits; 2) in No. 04-2298, that the panel does not have appellate jurisdiction over the appeal because the Remand Order is not a final order properly on appeal; and 3) in No. 05-1169, that the district court did not err in confirming the Phase II Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">AGS designs, builds, and operates satellite and telecommunications networks. AGS has a \u201cPrime Contract\u201d with the Defense Information Systems Agency (\u201cDISA\u201d), which allows AGS to bid for specific \u201ctasks\u201d from the DISA. When AGS is awarded a task, it executes a more specific contract with DISA called a \u201cTask Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">AGS used Datapath as a subcontractor on a successful bid to DISA that eventually became Task Order 27. Task Order 27 required AGS to provide DISA with fourteen teleports \u2014 a complicated satellite receiving device. The subcontract (hereinafter \u201cSubcontract\u201d) between AGS and Datapath stated that Datapath would supply, install, and test the teleports and AGS would manage the work. The Subcontract contained nondisclosure agreements that limited AGS\u2019s use of Data-path\u2019s protected, proprietary information. The Subcontract also contained an arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">While Task Order 27 was being completed, DISA solicited a proposal from AGS for additional teleports. AGS\u2019s proposal was accepted, and this additional work was called \u201cAnnex E.\u201d AGS did not, however, award a subcontract for the Annex E work to Datapath. Instead, AGS gave the work to Psi Systems, an entity partly owned by AGS. Based on AGS\u2019s actions, Datapath moved for arbitration pursuant to the mandatory arbitration clause of the Subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">At arbitration, Datapath alleged that AGS was acting in breach of the Subcontract by sharing Datapath\u2019s information with a third party \u2014 Psi Systems. Data-path sought immediate equitable relief in the nature of a preliminary injunction, ordering AGS to cease its work with Psi Systems. The arbitrators bifurcated the arbitration into Phase I (the immediate equitable relief) and Phase II (liability and damages).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">The arbitrators ruled in Datapath\u2019s favor in the Phase I proceedings and issued an award enjoining AGS from working with Psi Systems.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Datapath then moved to have the district court confirm this Phase I Award to give it the force and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>effect of a court order. After some initial hesitation, the district court confirmed the Phase I Award; the parties refer to that order as the Confirmation Order. AGS appealed the Confirmation Order to this court as No. 04-2000, arguing both that the district court did not have the authority to confirm the Award because it was interlocutory, and that the arbitrators erred in deciding the merits of the Phase I Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">While the No. 04-2000 appeal was ongoing, Datapath alleged that AGS was continuing to work with Psi Systems and moved in the district court to find AGS in contempt of the Confirmation Order. Instead of deciding whether AGS was in contempt of the Confirmation Order, the district court remanded the issue to the arbitrators to \u201cclarify\u201d the Confirmation Order \u2014 the so called \u201cRemand Order.\u201d AGS appeals the Remand Order as No. 04-2298. Datapath moves to dismiss this appeal for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Finally, the arbitrators decided the Phase II section of the arbitration in Data-path\u2019s favor and awarded damages of $2,125,799.90, which included $917,499 of lost profits on the Annex E work. The district court confirmed the Phase II Award, and AGS appeals it as No. 05-1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We review the district court decisions to confirm the arbitration award de novo. <em>Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., </em>991 F.2d 141, 145 (4th Cir.1993). Both we and the district court are confined by the federal law favoring arbitration agreements. Courts are allowed to vacate arbitration awards only if they meet the narrow statutory factors set forth in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a) or if the award demonstrates a \u201c \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 of applicable law.\u201d <em>Gallus Investments, L.P. v. Pudgie\u2019s Famous Chicken, </em>134 F.3d 231, 233-34 (4th Cir.1998). More specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad4\">[A] court\u2019s belief that an arbitrator misapplied the law will not justify vacation of an arbitral award. Rather, appellant is required to show that the arbitrators were aware of the law, understood it correctly, found it applicable to the case before them, and yet chose to ignore it in propounding their decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-10\"><em>Remmey v. PaineWebber, Inc., </em>32 F.3d 143, 149 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">We first review No. 04-2000, the appeal of the Confirmation Order. This appeal raises two issues. The first is whether the district court had authority to confirm the Phase I Award under section 9 of the FAA. The second is whether, if the district court did have authority to confirm the Phase I Award, it erred in confirming that Award on its merits. With respect to the first issue, we conclude that the district court did have authority to confirm the Award. While AGS correctly notes that piecemeal litigation is generally disfavored, the law in this area indicates that district courts do have the authority to confirm discrete time-sensitive issues such as the Phase I Award. With respect to the second issue, we hold that the district court did not err in confirming the Award on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">Section 9 of the FAA, in relevant part, states that \u201cat any time within one year after the [arbitration] award is made any party to the arbitration may apply to the court so specified for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. Notably, nothing in section 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>compelling the district court to confirm an arbitration award mandates that the award must be final. Section 10 of the FAA, however, notes that the district court \u201cmay make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration ... where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, <em>final, </em>and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">AGS contends that the district court erred in not vacating the Phase I Award because it did not meet this requirement of finality. Specifically, AGS argues that the district court should not have confirmed the Phase I Award while Phase II of the arbitration had yet to occur. We reject this claim, persuaded by the well-reasoned opinions of the other circuits that have considered similar situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As the Seventh Circuit has recently recognized, \u201c[a] ruling on a discrete, time-sensitive issue may be final and ripe for confirmation even though other claims remain to be addressed by the arbitrators.\u201d <em>Publicis, </em>206 F.3d at 729. Other circuits agree that \u201can \u2018interim\u2019 award that finally and definitively disposes of a separate independent claim may be confirmed notwithstanding the absence of an award that finally disposes of all the claims that were submitted to arbitration.\u201d <em>Island Creek Coal Sales Co. v. Gainesville, </em>729 F.2d 1046, 1049 (6th Cir.1984) (internal quotation omitted). This approach makes sense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auh\">Temporary equitable relief in arbitration may be essential to preserve assets or enforce performance which, if not preserved or enforced, may render a final award meaningless. However, if temporary equitable relief is to have any meaning, the relief must be enforceable at the time it is granted, not after an arbitrator\u2019s final decision on the merits. Arbitrators have no power to enforce their decisions. Only courts have that power. Consequently, courts in other circuits that have been faced with arbitrators\u2019 temporary equitable awards have not characterized them as non-final awards on the merits which can only be reviewed in extreme cases. Rather, they have characterized them as confirmable, final awards on an issue distinct from the controversy on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\"><em>Pacific Reinsurance Management Corp. v. Ohio Reinsurance Corp., </em>935 F.2d 1019, 1022-23 (9th Cir.1991) (internal citations omitted). In short, as the other circuits to have addressed this issue recognize, arbitration panels must have the power to issue temporary equitable relief in the nature of a preliminary injunction, and district courts must have the power to confirm and enforce that equitable relief as \u201cfinal\u201d in order for the equitable relief to have teeth. Accordingly, the question of whether the district court had the power under section 9 to confirm the Stage One Award collapses into the question <em>of </em>whether that Award was \u201c[a] ruling on a discrete, time-sensitive issue.\u201d We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The Phase I Award represented equitable relief against AGS, preventing it from misusing Datapath\u2019s trade secrets. Had Datapath been forced to wait until the resolution of the entire arbitration in order to obtain this relief, it would have been powerless to prevent AGS from misusing its proprietary information through AGS\u2019s subcontract with Psi Systems. This circumstance underscores the need for the \u201cdiscrete, time-sensitive\u201d rule. Accordingly, we hold that the district court correctly classified the Phase I Award \u201cas a discrete, separate, and definitive ruling apart from any decision on the damages,\u201d J.A. at 450, and reject AGS\u2019s contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Award should not have been confirmed as not final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Having concluded that the district court had the authority to confirm the Phase I Award under section 9 of the FAA, we next consider whether the district court erred in confirming that Award on its merits. AGS argues that the Phase I Award exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s authority and was in violation of public policy. Considering the great deference that courts must give to arbitration awards, we affirm the district court\u2019s Confirmation Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">AGS first argues that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by improperly adjudicating the rights and responsibilities of Psi Systems and DISA, neither of whom are signatories to the arbitration agreement. Specifically, AGS contends that, by enjoining AGS from performing the Annex E work with Psi Systems for DISA, the Phase I Award improperly impacted Psi Systems\u2019s and DISA\u2019s rights. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">AGS correctly notes that, as a matter of hornbook contract law, arbitration panels cannot determine the legal rights and obligations of non-parties to the arbitration agreement. <em>E.g., </em>4 Am Jur 2d <em>Alternative Dispute Resolution </em>\u00a7 83 (2004). Indeed, neither Datapath, nor the arbitrators, nor the district court dispute this fact. The arbitrators in this case, however, did not impact the legal rights or obligations of DISA or Psi-Systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">AGS concedes that the arbitrators have the power to dictate the actions of AGS that relate to the subcontract. This power may, as a practical matter, have an incidental effect on other parties. That effect, however, does not prevent the arbitrators from exercising the power that they do have to prohibit AGS from profiting from information proprietary to Datapath. To hold otherwise would leave both courts and arbitrators powerless to issue relief in circumstances such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Phase I Award did not affect the legal rights and obligations of non-parties to the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">AGS also contends that the district court erred in confirming the Phase I Award because the Award violated pubic policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">AGS first argues that the Phase I Award violates the public policy of Virginia because the confidential information was eventually posted on the internet by a third party, which means that the information is no longer a \u201ctrade secret\u201d under Virginia law. <em>See Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Lerma, </em>908 F.Supp. 1362, 1368 (E.D.Va.1995) (noting that \u201c[o]nce a trade secret is posted on the Internet, it is effectively part of the public domain, impossible to retrieve\u201d). AGS contends that the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>mation was, therefore, no longer a secret subject to a non-disclosure injunction. To the extent AGS may be correct, this alleged misapplication of Virginia trade secret law by the arbitrators is simply an error of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Errors of law are not one of the grounds on which a court can overturn an arbitration award. <em>Apex Plumbing Supply v. U.S. Supply Co., </em>142 F.3d 188, 193-94 (4th Cir.1998). (\u201cReview of an arbitrator\u2019s award is severely circumscribed ... because to allow full scrutiny of such awards would frustrate the purpose of having arbitration at all \u2014 the quick resolution of disputes and the avoidance of the expense and delay associated with litigation. ... [A]s a matter of law neither misinterpretation of a contract nor an error of law constitutes a ground on which an award can be vacated.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted))</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">AGS next contends that Datapath did not post an appeals bond, which would be required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 if one views the Phase I Award as a preliminary injunction. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(c). AGS notes that failure to require Datapath to post this bond frustrates the public policy behind preliminary injunctions. This contention fails because, even assuming arguendo that Datapath\u2019s failure to post an appeals bond represents error, the mis-interpretation of Rule 65 would be a non-reversible error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Finally, AGS argues that there is a general violation of public policy in confirming an award that will make it difficult for DISA to perform vital military operations. However, AGS makes no such showing, and we are unable to infer it on the record before us. We are unwilling to adopt, on these facts, a per se rule that would preclude courts and arbitrators from ever issuing equitable relief when a contract with the United States military is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject AGS\u2019s arguments concerning the merits of the Phase I Award and affirm the district court Confirmation Order in No. 04-2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Datapath moved in the district court to hold AGS in contempt of the Confirmation Order, and the district court remanded that Order to the arbitrators for \u201cclarification.\u201d AGS appeals that \u201cRemand Order\u201d as improper. Datapath, while responding to the appeal of the Remand Order on its merits, also moves to dismiss the appeal for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are three possible statutory bases for our appellate jurisdiction in this case: 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(4); 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(E); and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Because the Remand Order is not an appealable final order under any of those statutes, we grant Datapath\u2019s motion and dismiss No. 04-2298 for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Under the FAA, \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken from ... a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(4). The Supreme Court has analyzed this statute and noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">the term \u201cfinal decision\u201d has a well-developed and longstanding meaning. It is a decision that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d Because the FAA does not define \u201ca final decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d or otherwise suggest that the ordinary meaning of \u201cfinal decision\u201d should not apply, we accord the term its well-established meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>Green Tree Fin. Corp. -Alabama v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 86, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) (citations omitted). Accordingly, we must decide whether the Remand Order \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d In this case, it does not. Indeed, the Remand Order does not really <em>do </em>anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">As AGS expressly concedes, \u201cthe District Court has held no evidentiary hearings and made no fact findings or legal rulings on the ... contempt motions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Second Supplemental Brief at 14. Far from ending the litigation on its merits, the Remand Order does <em>nothing. </em>The district court simply asks the arbitrators for clarification, it takes no further judicial action. The district court, in effect, announced that it would ask the arbitrators for help in deciding whether to grant the contempt motion, but it has not yet issued a final order denying it. Section 16(a)(4) does not provide this court with jurisdiction over the mere request for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">AGS also argues that the panel has jurisdiction to appeal the Remand Order because it is an order \u201cmodifying, correcting, or vacating an award.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(E). Specifically, AGS argues that the Remand Order is a de facto vacation of the Confirmation Order. This argument is equally unavailing. <em>If </em>the arbitrators issue a ruling that does modify, correct, or vacate the Confirmation Order, <em>and if </em>the district court adopts that ruling, <em>then </em>\u00a7 16(a)(1)(E) applies. Right now, however, neither action has occurred. Only the district court or this court can modify, correct, or vacate an award, and neither has done so. Section 16(a)(1)(E) is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">AGS finally contends that the Remand Order is appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) as an order modifying an injunction. This contention fails for the same reason that \u00a7 16(a)(1)(E) is inapplicable \u2014 the Remand Order does not modify anything. It simply asks the arbitrators to take action that might or might not eventually lead to the modification of the Confirmation Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">In summary, we do not have the statutory authority to hear the appeal in No. 04-2298 and we therefore grant Datapath\u2019s motion to Dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">The third and final piece of this appeal concerns the Phase II Award, confirmed by the district court and appealed by AGS as No. 05-1169. AGS argues that the arbitrators did not have the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>award Datapath damages on the Annex E work because Annex E was not part of the original subcontract agreeing to arbitration. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Datapath and AGS did not contract to do the Annex E work. Accordingly, there is no separate agreement to arbitrate the Annex E work. Any power that the arbitrators have over Annex E must therefore derive from the original Task Order 27 Subcontract. The original Subcontract states that \u201c[i]n the event that a dispute shall arise during the performance of this Subcontract, the Parties agree [to arbitrate the dispute.]\u201d J.A. at 225. The question then becomes \u2014 did the Annex E dispute arise \u201cduring the performance of\u2019 the Task Order 27 Subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">While this contractual language is somewhat ambiguous, the Supreme Court has long noted that \u201cas a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">In this case, the Annex E work was not totally separate from the Task Order 27 Subcontract, as AGS implies. Rather, it was an extension of Task Order 27 \u2014 involving an agreement with respect to more of the same product that the parties were already providing to DISA. In addition, AGS allegedly used the confidential information that it obtained from Datapath during performance of the Task Order 27 Subcontract in deciding to award the Annex E subcontract to Psi Systems. In short, Annex E, while technically a separate contract from the Task Order 27 Subcontract, was intimately connected to the Task Order 27 Subcontract. Accordingly, we follow the federal policy of resolving disputes in favor of arbitrability and agree with the district court that the Annex E dispute occurred \u201cduring the performance of\u2019 the Task Order 27 Subcontract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the district court decision to confirm the Phase II Award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The district court in this case has noted that the piecemeal approach taken in this litigation, when viewed with 20-20 hindsight, was unfortunate. <em>See </em>J.A. at 536 (\u201cThis doing it piecemeal I guess in some cases will work, but I must say in this one, it sure hasn\u2019t.\u201d). Unfortunate case management, however, does not amount to reversible legal error. The final orders issued by the district court in this case were correct. We lack jurisdiction to determine whether the non-final order is correct. Therefore, we affirm the final orders at issue in No. 04-2000 and No. 05-1169 and dismiss No. 04-2298 for a lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\">. Paragraph one of the Phase I Award states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">Effective upon receipt of this Award, Arrowhead is hereby enjoined from the continued performance of its subcontract with Psi Systems, Inc., or from otherwise performing the Scope of Work identified by Datapath in its Technical and Pricing Proposal for Annex E, by any other party or by Arrowhead, without the consent of Data-path.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">J.A. at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\">. Though we review the legal status of the arbitration award de novo and do not defer to the arbitration panel\u2019s classification of its own action, it is worth noting that the arbitration panel believed that the Phase I Award was a final order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">The [Phase I] hearing was understood by the parties, and intended to be a final resolution of all ... equitable claims. At the completion of the hearing the time for submission of evidence was concluded and the record was closed as to all requests for equitable relief____ While the [Phase I] Award was \"interim\u201d in nature, i.e., made <em>prior to </em>a[sic] award on the damages portion of the arbitration, it is, and was intended to be <em>final </em>and enforceable by the court, and not interlocutory, as it relates to all equitable relief sought in this arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-21\">J.A. at 429 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\">. Though we need not reach the <em>issue, </em>we note that Datapath challenges both the legal and factual bases underlying this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. \u201cMotions to dismiss based on the ground that the appeal is not within the jurisdiction of the Court ... may be filed at any time.\u201d Local Rule 27(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. AGS also attempts to bypass the jurisdictional statutes entirely, arguing that \u201cData-path fails to acknowledge ... that this matter is already subject to the jurisdiction of this court\u201d by virtue of the pending appeal in No. 04-2000. AGS's Opposition to Datapath\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction at 1. AGS, however, misapprehends our role as an appellate court. The question for this court is not whether we have jurisdiction over \u201cthis matter,\u201d but whether we have jurisdiction over the order being appealed. While the piecemeal path that this litigation has taken may, in hindsight, have been unfortunate, we cannot extend our jurisdiction without a valid statutory basis. AGS fails to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>vide that basis with respect to the Remand Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. AGS also makes various arguments that the award of lost profits was in \"manifest disregard\u201d of Virginia law. Specifically, it contends that the parties had contracted not to allow lost profits, that Datapath did not mitigate its damages as required by Virginia law, and that the alleged trade secrets at issue were available on the internet, and therefore not trade secrets under Virginia law. These arguments all fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In order to demonstrate \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d of Virginia law, AGS must demonstrate that \"the arbitrators were aware of the law, understood it correctly, found it applicable to the case before them, and yet chose to ignore it in propounding their decision.\u201d <em>Remmey, </em>32 F.3d at 149. AGS does not meet this exacting standard. Accordingly, even if the arbitrators did misapply the law as alleged by AGS, the district court still correctly followed the FAA in confirming the Phase II Award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">. AGS also argues that the Annex E damages were a thinly veiled attempt to obtain contempt sanctions from the arbitrators for AGS\u2019s alleged violation of the Confirmation Order. AGS correctly notes that only a court has the power to issue contempt sanctions. However, the argument that the Annex E damages were an attempt-4o obtain contempt sanctions in disguise fails on its face. Data-path requested the Annex E damages <em>before </em>AGS\u2019s alleged violation of the Confirmation Order. Appellee\u2019s Response To Appellant\u2019s Second Supplemental Brief at 13. As a matter of temporal logic, the Annex E damages cannot be sanctions for activity that had yet to occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b74-13\">. AGS also argues that the district court erred in confirming the Phase II Award before ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion that AGS filed challenging the Phase I Award. Once again, the parties improperly attempt to conflate the separate issues in this appeal into one meta-appeal. At some point, the district court will consider and rule on AGS\u2019s Rule 60 motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>At that point, either AGS or Datapath will have a final order from the district court to appeal to this court. Until that point, the fact that AGS has filed post-judgment motions in No. 04-2000 does not prevent this court from hearing an appeal of the final order in No. 05-1169.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
