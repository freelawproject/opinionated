His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lopez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lopez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-28\">Lopez contends that the district court erred by sentencing him under the then-mandatory guideline sentencing scheme that was rendered advisory in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing unless the Government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. The Government agrees that the harmless-error standard applies, and it waives any argument that the error at Lopez\u2019s sentencing was harmless. The Government \u201cdoes not oppose a remand for resentencing.\u201d Because the Government waives any harmless-error argument, Lopez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-29\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
