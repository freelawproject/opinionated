See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b724-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Sammy Ray O\u2019Quinn appeals from the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). We previously granted a certificate of appealability as to O\u2019Quinn\u2019s sole issue on appeal: whether his attorney provided ineffective assistance with respect to the government\u2019s plea offer. After receiving additional briefing on this issue, we now vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, O\u2019Quinn claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to inform him of a corrected plea agreement. He asserted that, had he seen the corrected version, he would have pled guilty. O\u2019Quinn submitted an affidavit to this effect. Counsel filed an affidavit stating that he reviewed the corrected plea agreement with O\u2019Quinn, but that O\u2019Quinn wanted to go to trial with the hope of obtaining an acquittal on one of the charges and thereby possibly receiving a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">The district court may expand the record in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding to include letters, documents and affidavits. <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529-30 (4th Cir.1970). Unless it is clear from the record, as expanded, that the prisoner is not entitled to relief, \u00a7 2255 makes an evidentiary hearing mandatory. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 529. \u201c[WJhere the ultimate resolution rests on a credibility determination, an evidentiary hearing is especially warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>366 F.3d 291, 302 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">In denying \u00a7 2255 relief on this issue, the district court determined that, even if counsel\u2019s performance was deficient with respect to the plea offer, O\u2019Quinn suffered no prejudice because he failed to show that, had he seen the revised plea offer, he would have pled guilty. In making this determination, the lower court relied on O\u2019Quinn\u2019s silence during the change of plea hearing when the court discussed scheduling O\u2019Quinn\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">We find that O\u2019Quinn\u2019s silence in that setting is too ambiguous to allow an inference of acquiescence to overcome his affirmative act of attesting to statements to the contrary. Rather, the conflicting statements in the affidavits submitted by O\u2019Quinn and counsel create a factual dispute requiring an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
