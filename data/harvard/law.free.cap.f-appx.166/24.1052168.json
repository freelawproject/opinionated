(\u201cTransworld\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Theresa Ann Ward and Pat Bondurant (collectively \u201cthe Employees\u201d), former employees of Transworld. The resolution of this dispute turns on whether the district court properly considered the Employees to be insured under a policy issued to Transworld by Federal (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) and thus immune from suit under Virginia\u2019s anti-subrogation rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Federal argues that the district court erred in interpreting the Policy under Virginia\u2019s \u201ccourse of employment\u201d test and in awarding summary judgment to the Employees on that basis. Federal further contends that had the court applied the correct tests of coverage, the award of summary judgment in favor of the Employees would not have been appropriate. Because we agree that the district court applied the wrong test and that the Employees\u2019 alleged act of negligence is not covered by the Policy, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Employees, hold that they are not immune from suit, and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">On September 9, 2003, Transworld\u2019s facility located at 260 Fastener Drive in Lynchburg, Virginia, caught fire. J.A. 129. At the time, Transworld had property and liability coverage through the Policy issued by Federal. <em>Id. </em>The Policy insured Transworld\u2019s employees when performing two classes of covered acts: \u201cacts within the scope of their employment by [Trans-world]\u201d or \u201cduties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. Under the Policy, for which Transworld paid $14,269 annually, <em>id. </em>at 337, Federal reimbursed Transworld for $352,832.34 and $240,000 in property and personal property losses, respectively. <em>Id. </em>at 129. Because the Policy, in limited instances, also covered Transworld\u2019s employees\u2019 personal property, a portion of Federal\u2019s payments to Transworld was for damage to the personal effects of Transworld\u2019s employees. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 335-37. Ward, for example, received $230 as compensation for her personal property losses. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Federal maintains that the fire resulted from the Employees\u2019 negligent disposal of smoking materials. At approximately 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the fire, after everyone except for the Employees and two waiting children had left the building, Ward shut down her computer and lit a cigarette as she prepared to leave work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 200, 570-74. After Bondurant completed her work and shut down her computer, she entered Ward\u2019s office, observed Ward smoking, and lit her own cigarette. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93, 204, 570-74. Just before leaving Ward\u2019s office, Ward and Bondurant flicked ashes from the ends of their cigarettes into a trash can filled with paper. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 206-10, 574. Bondurant claims that she then peered into the trash can and observed that nothing was smoldering or smoking before allowing Ward to place the trash can back under the desk. <em>Id. </em>at 193. Thereafter, Ward and Bondurant left Ward\u2019s office, Ward set the burglar alarm, and she, Bondurant, and the children exited the building. <em>Id. </em>at 196-97, 570-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Transworld did not have any written rules regarding smoking prior to the fire, but there was an informal policy that employees were not to smoke in the building during business hours as a courtesy to non-smokers. J.A. 223-24, 229. The president and owner of Transworld, Joe Tubbs, was aware that employees smoked inside the facility after hours, and allowed the practice so long as no one objected. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Tubbs has made contradictory statements as to whether the Employees were acting for the benefit of the company while smoking on the night of the fire. He testified that he considered Ward to be \u201con company time,\u201d \u201cdoing her job\u201d until she left the building because she was expected to set the building alarm. J.A. 321-22. In a letter mailed to Federal upon learning that Federal was pursuing legal action against the Employees, Tubbs stated that both Ward and Bondurant were acting within \u201cthe scope of their employment\u201d on the night of the fire as they were \u201cworking overtime on company business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. At the same time, however, Tubbs acknowledged that the Employees did not need to smoke to perform their job-related duties, <em>id. </em>at 228, and that smoking was not listed in their job descriptions, <em>id. </em>at 229. During his deposition, he also admitted that on the night of the fire, he left the building before the Employees and could not state from personal knowledge \u201cwheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>er or not Ms. Ward and Ms. Bondurant were finished working before they began smoking____\u201d Mat252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">On December 9, 2003, Federal filed suit against the Employees, seeking indemnification for the costs of the fire damage. J.A. 7-11. The Employees responded by filing individual motions for summary judgment based on their assertion that they were insured under the Policy and hence immune from suit under Virginia\u2019s anti-subrogation rule. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 34-35. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and hearing oral argument, the district court entered summary judgment in the Employees\u2019 favor. <em>Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The district court held that Virginia\u2019s anti-subrogation rule barred Federal from bringing suit against the Employees. J.A. 134. According to the court, the Employees were covered under the liability section of the Policy, which provided that \u201cemployees ... are insured, but only [1] for acts within the scope of their employment by [Transworld] or [2] while performing duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502. The district court found that the Policy\u2019s phrase \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business\u201d was synonymous with the definition of \u201ccourse of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133. Accordingly, the court referenced Virginia\u2019s definition of \u201ccourse of employment,\u201d as elucidated in the workers\u2019 compensation context,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in determining whether the Employees were insured under the Policy. <em>Id. </em>The district court concluded that the Employees were acting within the \u201ccourse of their employment\u201d at the time they discarded their ashes, and accordingly, held that the Employees were insured under the Policy, immune from suit under Virginia\u2019s anti-subrogation rule, and thus entitled to summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Federal timely appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 499, 508 (4th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is only appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Once the party moving for summary judgment has shown that there are no genuine issues of material fact, the nonmoving party has a burden to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). If a nonmoving party, in opposing summary judgment, does not provide evidence on which a jury can rely to rule in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor, summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Barwick v. Celotex Corp., </em>736 F.2d 946, 958-59 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">This case involves a question of contract interpretation, which is also subject to de novo review. <em>Seabulk Offshore Ltd. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). We are not constrained by the district court\u2019s interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tion of the Policy, because \u201c[t]he interpretation of a written contract is a question of law that turns upon a reading of the document itself, and a district court is in no better position than an appellate court to decide such an issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Where, as here, our subject-matter jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship, we must apply the substantive law of the forum state. <em>See Hitachi Credit America Corp. v. Signet Bank, </em>166 F.3d 614, 623-624 (4th Cir.1999). Under the law of the forum state, here Virginia, \u201cthe law of the place where an insurance contract was written and delivered governs questions of insurance coverage.\u201d <em>See Buchanan v. Doe, </em>246 Va. 67, 431 S.E.2d 289, 291 (1993) (citing <em>Lackey v. Virginia Sur. Co., </em>209 Va. 713, 167 S.E.2d 131, 133 (1969)). Because the insurance contract at issue was delivered in Virginia, <em>see </em>J.A. 454, the parties correctly agree that their dispute should be resolved in accordance with Virginia law. With these principles in mind, we proceed to determine whether the Employees were insured under the Policy and thus immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Federal argues that the district court erred in applying the concept of \u201ccourse of employment,\u201d as elucidated in the workers\u2019 compensation context, to the facts of this case. In particular, Federal asserts that the court erred at the outset in equating the phrase \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of [Trans-world\u2019s] business,\u201d with the phrase \u201ccourse of employment.\u201d We agree. In reading the contract as a whole, as we must, <em>see Transit Casualty Co. v. Hartman\u2019s, Inc., </em>218 Va. 703, 239 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1978), it is apparent that \u201ccourse of employment\u201d and \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business\u201d are not synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The Policy expressly distinguishes these two phrases. In setting forth exclusions from coverage, the Policy provides that no employee is insured for bodily injuries occurring \u201cwhile in the course of his or her employment <em>or </em>while performing duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business.\u201d J.A. 502 (emphasis added). As the two phrases are set off by the word \u201cor,\u201d we are persuaded that they are intended to express distinct concepts. Moreover, the Policy\u2019s incorporation of the phrase \u201ccourse of employment\u201d indicates that the Policy\u2019s drafters employed that term where they sought to invoke that concept. Consequently, the suggestion that they would employ a wordier phrase to express the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d concept elsewhere in the Policy defies logic. Accordingly, the district court erred in equating \u201ccourse of employment\u201d with \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business,\u201d and in applying the definition of \u201ccourse of employment\u201d elucidated in the workers\u2019 compensation context to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">We thus examine whether the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was appropriate when the correct tests of coverage are considered. Because we find, as explained below, that the Employees\u2019 alleged act of negligence does not fall under either of the two classes of acts covered in the Policy, we hold that they were not insured under the liability section of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">We begin by examining whether the act of flicking ashes into a wastebasket qualifies as an \u201cact[] within the scope of [the Employees\u2019] employment by [Trans-world].\u201d J.A. 502. Because we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that such an act is necessarily outside the scope of the Employees\u2019 employment, we are compelled to hold that they were not performing an act covered under this test when they flicked ashes into a paper-filled trash can.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Under the \u201cscope of employment\u201d test set forth in Virginia, we think it plain that the act of flicking ashes into a wastebasket cannot be said to be within the scope of the Employees\u2019 employment. According to the Virginia Supreme Court, an act is within the scope of employment if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">(1) it was expressly or impliedly directed by the employer, or is naturally incident to the business, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">(2) it was performed, although mistakenly or ill-advisedly, with the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest, or from some impulse or emotion that was the natural consequence of an attempt to do the employer\u2019s business, \u201cand did not arise wholly from some external, independent, and personal motive on the part of the [employee] to do the act upon his account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\"><em>Kensington </em>Assocs. <em>v. West, </em>234 Va. 430, 362 S.E.2d 900, 901 (1987) (citations omitted). In discarding the ashes as they did, Ward and Bondurant both engaged in an act independent of any other job-related function that may have preceded, super-ceded, or even occurred simultaneously with the act of disposing of the ashes. That distinct act, which must be the focus of our inquiry, was not within the scope of employment. Although Transworld permitted smoking in its buildings, the negligent disposal of smoking materials was <em>not </em>directed by Transworld or naturally incident to Transworld\u2019s manufacturing business. In fact, at the exterior of its premises, Transworld provided its employees with urns specifically designed for the disposal of smoking materials. J.A. 224-25. Nor was the Employees\u2019 act of flicking ashes into a trash can performed with the intent to further the employer\u2019s interest or from an impulse to carry out the employer\u2019s business. The negligent conduct did not promote any business-related interest. Rather, it compromised the employer\u2019s interest in maintaining a safe working environment. The Employees\u2019 conduct \u201car[o]se wholly from some external, independent, and personal motive.... \u201d <em>Kensington Assocs., </em>362 S.E.2d at 901. We are thus compelled to conclude as a matter of law that the Employees were not engaged in an act in the scope of their employment when they flicked ashes into a paper-filled trash can on the night of the fire. Accordingly, they were not insured under the first test of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">We now turn to the second test of coverage under the liability section of the Policy, i.e., whether the Employees were \u201cperforming duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business\u201d when they discarded their ashes. J.A. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Under the plain language of the contract, the question before us is simply whether in discarding ashes into a paper-filled container, the Employees were \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>forming duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business.\u201d J.A. 502. On the night of the fire, Ward and Bondurant admittedly performed some duties related to the conduct of Transworld\u2019s business of manufacturing custom cable molded assemblies. <em>Id. </em>at 214. For instance, that evening, Ward, a purchasing manager, carried out her normal purchasing duties and set the burglar alarm. <em>Id. </em>at 31. Bondurant, a quality control manager and inside sales representative, was also engaged in a job-related duty, namely the completion of a report for a client. <em>Id. </em>at 326. However, neither Ward, nor Bondurant can properly characterize the act of concern \u2014 discarding ashes in a wastebasket containing paper \u2014 as done in the performance of a work-related duty. Indeed, because the act of smoking was not within the Employees\u2019 job description or needed to perform a job-related duty, <em>see </em>J.A. 228-29, the subsidiary act of flicking ashes also cannot be characterized as the exercise of a duty. Thus, the even more circumscribed act of disposing ashes into a paper-filled wastebasket is certainly not the performance of a duty. Accordingly, we conclude that by this test, Ward and Bondurant were not performing a covered act when they discarded ashes into the wastebasket.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We would reach the same conclusion even if we read the phrase \u201cwhile performing duties related to the conduct of [Trans-world\u2019s] business\u201d to suggest that any act an employee can accomplish as she performs job-related duties is necessarily covered. We think this is a strained reading of the contract given the illogical results it would engender. Under this temporal interpretation, a virtually limitless number of activities would be covered merely because they coincide with a job-related duty. By this rule, neither Federal, nor Transworld could ever anticipate the breadth of acts subject to coverage. Nonetheless, even under this strained interpretation, the Employees are still not insured, because they do not insinuate that they were engaged in any simultaneous job-related duty at the precise moment when they flicked ashes in the trash can. All alleged job-related activities took place either before or after they flicked ashes into the can.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">In sum, we hold as a matter of law that under the language of the liability section of the Policy, the Employees were not insured when they flicked ashes into a trash can containing paper. That act was neither within the scope of their employment, nor in performance of a job-related duty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">At this time, we consider the Employees\u2019 alternative arguments in favor of affirmance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because we find these argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ments unavailing, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and hold that the Employees are not insured under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The Employees argue that they are insured under the Policy because their personal property on Transworld\u2019s premises is covered under particular circumstances. We are not persuaded, however, because the Employees\u2019 argument is contrary to the plain language of the Policy and not supported by authority in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The personal property section of the Policy provides that \u201c[Federal] will pay for direct physical loss or damage to personal property of employees caused by or resulting from a peril not otherwise excluded.\u201d J.A. 352. Indeed, Federal indirectly compensated Ward for personal property losses totaling $230 by paying that amount to Transworld, who in turn made payment to Ward. The Employees derive their argument, in large part, from the Louisiana Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Sentry Indemnity Co., </em>316 So.2d 185 (La.Ct.App.1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Employees\u2019s argument, however misses the point, because as a federal court sitting in diversity, we are obliged to discern and apply the law of Virginia, not Louisiana. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>see also United States v. Little, </em>52 F.3d 495, 498 (4th Cir.1995). Yet, the Employees fail to cite any Virginia case stating categorically that if an employee\u2019s possessions are covered under certain provisions of a policy, they are rendered an insured under the entirety of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">The Employees ask this Court to apply a strained reading of the Policy, which we may not do. <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Crosswhite, </em>206 Va. 558, 145 S.E.2d 143, 146 (1965) (\u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the language of the contract as written, and the court cannot make a new contract for the parties different from that plainly intended and thus create a liability not assumed by the insurer.\u201d). The Policy lists only one named insured, Transworld. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 337, 464. Premiums were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>paid by that named insured, and Federal issued payments to that named insured. The plain language of the provision imparting protection to the personal property of employees specifically distinguishes employees from the insured. <em>See </em>J.A. 347, 352 (using the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to refer to the named insured and \u201cemployees\u201d to refer to a separate, uninsured class). Also, nothing in the record establishes that the parties in entering the insurance contract intended to convey upon all employees the status of additional or co-insureds. The Employees do not indicate that they were the intended beneficiaries of the contract. <em>See Walker v. Vanderpool, </em>225 Va. 266, 302 S.E.2d 669 (1983) (In interpreting contracts, courts should enforce the intention of the parties). When asked whether he considered employees to be insured under the company\u2019s policy, Tubbs did not so indicate. <em>See </em>J.A. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Moreover, the fact that Transworld\u2019s employees\u2019 possessions <em>were only protected if under the \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d </em>of Transworld suggests that Transworld sought insurance for the personal effects of employees only to protect itself from liability to its employees. J.A. 443 (emphasis added) (defining personal property of employees as \u201cpersonal property owned or leased by your employee and in your care, custody or control\u201d). Because Trans-world effectively \u201cassumed responsibility\u201d for the personal property of employees that remained on the Transworld premises, Transworld had an independent interest in protecting that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We find further support for our conclusion in <em>Virginia Heart Institute, Ltd. v. Northside Electric Co., </em>No A-908, 1982 WL 215281 (Va. Cir. Ct. Oct.29, 1982) (unpublished), a Virginia Circuit Court opinion, which specifically rejects the categorical approach that the Employees advocate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, the court addressed whether a provision in an insurance policy that extended some coverage to a subcontractor hired to make improvements on an existing building rendered that subcontractor a coinsured under the entire policy. <em>Va. Heart Inst., </em>1982 WL 215281, *10-15. A building owner brought suit against a subcontractor when a fire, worsened by the subcontractor\u2019s negligence, destroyed his building. <em>Id. </em>at *1. The relevant portion of the insurance policy provided that \u201cthe Owner shall purchase and maintain property insurance upon the entire Work at the site to the full insurable value thereof. This insurance shall include the interest of the Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors, and Sub-subcontractors.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3. Under the contract, \u201cWork\u201d was defined to include \u201call labor necessary to produce the construction required by the Contract Documents, and all materials and equipment incorporated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>such construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *12. The court found that the subcontractor\u2019s insurable interest in the property only extended to the improvements made by the subcontractor and not to the preexisting structure. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded that even if the subcontractor was an insured party, its interest was limited to its insurable interest and hence \u201cit [was] liable for damages beyond the amount of its insured interest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In sum, we find that the Employees were not insured, because the Policy identifies Transworld as the only insured, extends protection to Transworld\u2019s employees\u2019 personal property only in an effort to protect Transworld, the Employees have cited no authority in Virginia for the categorical approach they would have us embrace, and because we are persuaded by the reasoning of <em>Virginia Heart Institute. </em>We thus conclude that even if the Employees do have an insurable interest in the Policy, that interest, by the terms of the Policy, extends only to their personal property, which plainly does not include Trans-world\u2019s building. J.A. 443 (buddings are excluded from the definition of \u201cpersonal property of employees\u201d). Accordingly, any limited coverage that was afforded to the Employees does not serve to shield them from suit for destruction of the entire Transworld budding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Finally, the Employees argue that they are insured because a corporation can only act through its employees. Hence, according to the Employees, to cover the corporation but exclude all employees from coverage would in effect not cover the corporation. The Employees effectively suggest that whenever an employer purchases insurance, ad acts of the employees are necessardy covered. However, the policy at issue here, specifically limits coverage to employees when they are engaged in acts within the scope of employment or are \u201cperforming duties related to the conduct of [Transworld\u2019s] business.\u201d Because the rale the Employees advocate would require us to ignore the plain language of the Policy, and would do injury to the ability of parties to control the manner in which they contract for insurance, we find their argument to be without merit. <em>See Quesenberry v.

Federal argues that smoking is necessarily for an employee\u2019s ''external, independent, and personal motive,\u201d and thus outside the scope of employment. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18. Because the inquiry relevant here is not whether <em>smoking </em>is within the scope of the Employees\u2019 employment, but rather whether <em>flicking ashes into a paper-filled can </em>is within the scope of employment, we refrain from deciding whether smoking itself would meet this standard. Thus, we decline to opine as to whether smoking is necessarily outside the scope of an employee's employment in Virginia, an issue that Virginia has yet to decide.

We may conclude as a matter of law that the Employees are not insured under the two tests set forth in the liability section of the Policy, because there are no genuine issues of material fact left for resolution by the district court.

Federal argues that this Court should not entertain the Employees' remaining arguments because they were not raised by Federal on appeal or addressed by the district court. According to Federal, to preserve their arguments, the Employees should have cross appealed under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(h). Federal, however, misunderstands this Court's ability to review arguments not addressed by a district court or briefed by an appellant. Although a court of appeals may not consider an argument not raised by an appellant as grounds for reversal, it may consider any evidence in the record as grounds for affirmance. <em>See, e.g., El Paso Natural Gas Co. v.

For the same reasons, we are not persuaded by the Employees\u2019 contention that Federal has waived its ability to claim that Ward is not an insured by virtue of its payment to Ward on account of Ward\u2019s property damage. The Employees maintain this argument applies with equal force to Bondurant because Federal concedes that had Bondurant also lost personal property during the fire, she too would have been compensated under the Policy.
