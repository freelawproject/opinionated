In No. 05-7584, he seeks to appeal the court\u2019s order dismissing a later-filed \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that it was a \u201csecond or successive\u201d \u00a7 2255 motion requiring a certificate of appealability from this court, which Hardy did not obtain. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-26\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>al claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Hardy has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny certificates of appealability and dismiss Hardy\u2019s appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
