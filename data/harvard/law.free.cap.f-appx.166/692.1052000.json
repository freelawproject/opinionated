It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). Credibility findings, relevant to the subjective component, are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We accord broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999 (internal quotation marks omitted)). We find the evidence was not so compelling as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">With respect to Morcos\u2019 motion to remand, we find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\"> Morcos does not challenge the denial of withholding from removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
