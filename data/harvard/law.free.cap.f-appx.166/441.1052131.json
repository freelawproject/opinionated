He also alleges that his prior counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">A jury convicted Duboc of conspiracy to tamper with a witness, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (count 1(b)); conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (count 2); and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2)(B) (counts 3-7). Duboc committed these offenses while awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in 1994 to conspiracy to import drugs and conspiracy to launder the proceeds from the sale of drugs (the 1994 case is referred to herein as <em>Duboc I). </em>Duboc received a 236 month sentence in the instant case, <em>(Duboc II), </em>which included concurrent sentences of 60 months on count 1(b) and 236 months on the remaining counts. Duboc appealed and we reversed his convictions for conspiracy to commit money laundering and various counts of money laundering because of a lack of sufficient evidence to support the convictions. We also reversed a district court order granting forfeiture but affirmed Duboc\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to tamper with a witness. On remand, the district court sentenced Duboc to 60 months imprisonment to run consecutively to the life sentence he was serving as a result of <em>Duboc I, </em>three years of supervised release, and imposed a $ 250,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Duboc asserts that the district court sentenced him under the wrong criminal statute when it sentenced him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, instead of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1). He asserts that the statutory maximum for his offense was 10 years and his 60 month sentence is almost half of what the law demands. He notes that his offense level should have been calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2, which cross-references \u00a7 2X3.1, and his base offense level should have been 30. He asserts that the guidelines in effect at the time of his re-sentencing should have been applied, and, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), the instant offense was conduct relevant to the offenses he committed in <em>Duboc I </em>because he committed the instant offense in an effort to avoid responsibility for those offenses. He asserts that the probation officer\u2019s determination of the base offense level and sentence was correct, but the district court erred by not following the PSI\u2019s recommendation and reasoning. He argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) required the district court to determine his sentence in the instant offense based on the conduct in <em>Duboc I </em>that resulted in the greatest sentence, and because the conduct in <em>Duboc I </em>is used in the instant case, that conduct is \u201cfully considered\u201d in this case, which means the sentences from both cases should run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">In reviewing a sentence, we review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and review the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cMultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). The court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining whether to order the sentences to run concurrently or consecutively. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: 1) the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and circumstances of the offense; 2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; 3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; 4) the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and 5) the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u201cSection 5G1.3 is the relevant Guidelines provision in determining whether to impose a consecutive sentence on a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Bradford, </em>277 F.3d at 1317. At the time of his original sentencing, \u00a7 5G1.3 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">(a) If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment ... or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Bordon, </em>421 F.3d 1202, 1206-1207 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that pursuant to the Feeney Amendment, guidelines applicable on date of original sentencing are applied on re-sentencing). Under subsection (b) of \u00a7 5G1.3, to determine what conduct must be \u201cfully taken into account,\u201d we must decide what criminal activity U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 treats as \u201crelevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Blanc, </em>146 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cActivity that meets the definition of \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 under section 1B1.3 must be \u2018fully taken into account\u2019 when determining whether section 5G1.3(b) applies, regardless of whether the district court actually considered the activity when it calculated the base level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Section lB1.3(a)(l) provides that a defendant\u2019s base offense level shall be determined based on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">(A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ..., all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Section 371 of Title 18 prohibits a conspiracy by two or more people to commit an offense against the United States or to defraud the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The maximum sentence under \u00a7 371 is five years imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Section 1512(b) of Title 18 prohibits tampering with a witness, and carries a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) (Eff.1996-2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not rely on the wrong statute in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Duboc\u2019s sentence. Because Duboc was convicted of conspiracy to tamper with a witness, as opposed to the substantive offense of tampering with a witness, the applicable statute for his offense was \u00a7 371, which provides for a maximum sentence of 60 months imprisonment. The court also did not improperly calculate the guideline range. Although Duboc asserts that the district court improperly calculated his base offense level and contends that his base offense level should have been 30, the presentence investigation report reveals that his base offense level was 30 and was determined in the same manner Duboc asserts it should have been calculated. Finally, the district court did not err in imposing a consecutive sentence. First, \u00a7 5G1.3(a) does not apply in this case because Duboc committed the instant offense prior to being sentenced in <em>Duboc I. </em>Additionally, \u00a7 5G1.3(b) does not apply because the offenses involved in <em>Duboc I </em>were not \u201cfully taken into account\u201d in determining Duboc\u2019s offense level in the instant offense. As a result, \u00a7 5G1.3(c) governed the district court\u2019s decision and allowed the court to impose a sentence in a manner it deemed would \u201cachieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making its decision, the court considered the guidelines and other factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a), as required by \u00a7 3584, and determined that a consecutive sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Next, Duboc asserts that the district court failed to make specific findings when it imposed a fine above the guideline range and failed to give him prior notice of its contemplation of a fine above the guideline range. He contends that his fine is excessive because it is disproportionate to his offense, and the offense conduct was already considered in <em>Duboc I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Because Duboc did not object to the court\u2019s imposition of a fine above the guideline range, we will review his claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Maurice, </em>69 F.3d 1553, 1556 (11th Cir.1995). Similarly, because Duboc did not object to the court\u2019s failure to give him prior notice as required under <em>Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2186-2187, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991), we review the <em>Bums </em>violation for plain error. <em>United States v. Hunerlach, </em>258 F.3d 1282, 1287-1288 (11th Cir.2001). Plain error occurs when there is (1) an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\"><em>\u201cBums </em>requires the district court to give \u2018reasonable notice\u2019 that it is contemplating an upward departure in the sentencing range established by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Hunerlach, </em>258 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThis notice must specifically identify the ground on which the district court is contemplating an upward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The maximum fine for the instant offense was $ 250,000. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b)(3). At the time of Duboc\u2019s original sentencing, \u00a7 5E1.2 established the guideline fine range as $ 17,500 to $ 175,000 for the instant offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3) (1998). Section 5E1.2(d) further provided that in determining the amount of the fine, the court should consider, among other things, the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and afford adequate deterrence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). Additionally, the guidelines instructed that the amount of the fine should \u201censure that the fine, taken together with other sanctions imposed, is punitive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In its brief, the government concedes that the district court violated <em>Bums </em>by failing to give Duboc prior notice. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s failure to give prior notice was not plainly erroneous because it is unclear whether <em>Bums, </em>which addressed an upward departure under a mandatory guideline scheme, still applies after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Additionally, Duboc failed to establish that his substantial rights were affected since he offered no indication as to how he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to give him notice and does not indicate that he would have been able to present any evidence or arguments in opposition to the fine had he been given prior notice. Furthermore, the district court did not plainly err by failing to make specific findings concerning each of the \u00a7 5E1.2(d) factors because the record in this case provides sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the factors were considered in imposing the fine. Finally, the court did not plainly err in setting Duboc\u2019s fine at $ 250,000. Considering the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and \u00a7 5E1.2(d), the court concluded that a fine above the guideline range was justified based on the nature and circumstances of the instant offense and related conduct. As a result of the large sums of money involved in the instant case, the court did not plainly err in concluding that a fine of $ 250,000 was appropriate. Furthermore, in light of Duboc\u2019s history of hiding assets from the government, the court did not plainly err in determining that Duboc had the ability to pay the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Last, Duboc argues that his attorney was ineffective because he failed to object or argue the issues Duboc is presenting on appeal. He asserts that the record is adequate for review of this issue on direct appeal, and maintains that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We generally do not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal when the district court did not entertain the claim or develop a factual record. <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). We may, however, consider an ineffective assistance claim when the record is sufficiently developed. <em>Id.; see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 508, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (recognizing that ineffective assistance claims do not have to be reserved for collateral review). \u2018Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Bender, </em>290 F.3d at 1284. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, which is defined as representation that fell below an objective reasonableness standard; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense by showing that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1337-1338 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1095, 163 L.Ed.2d 864 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Here, the record is not sufficiently developed to consider Duboc\u2019s ineffective assistance claim related to counsel\u2019s failure to object to the district court\u2019s <em>Bums </em>violation and upward departure from the guideline fine range. We will, however, consider Duboc\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim related to his counsel\u2019s failure to object or argue that the court sentenced him under the wrong criminal statute, calculated his sentence incorrectly, and should have imposed a concurrent sentence because the record is sufficiently developed with regard to these issues. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>indicated above, the district court sentenced Duboc under the correct statute, correctly calculated his sentence, and was not required to impose a concurrent sentence. As a result, Duboc cannot show that the alleged deficient performance of his counsel prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Duboc\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
