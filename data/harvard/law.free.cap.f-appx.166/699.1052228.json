We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Arshad bore the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2005); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). We will reverse the Board \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999 (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">With respect to Arshad\u2019s claim that he was persecuted by Sunni Muslims, we find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings that he failed to show the Pakistani government was unwilling and unable to control the extremist groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
