See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b696-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Francis Lee appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his petition for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Ron Hunt and Francis Lee were owners of adult entertainment establishments otherwise known as \u201cgentlemen\u2019s clubs.\u201d From February to May 2002, Hunt met periodically with Lee to discuss his interest in purchasing Lee\u2019s club, the Ritz Cabaret. When these discussions began, Lee owned the club. While negotiations were ongoing, however, Lee pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (2000) and the Ritz Cabaret was forfeited to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Nevertheless, discussions continued between Hunt and Joerg Eichelberger, a man Hunt believed was Lee\u2019s real estate agent. The discussions culminated in an offer from Hunt that matched Eichelberger\u2019s demands ($1.6 million and six percent buyer\u2019s premium). In the course of their correspondence, Eichelberger referenced the forfeiture, but only as an explanation why he could not provide documentation relevant to the proposed sale. Significantly, Eichelberger\u2019s repeated written statements suggested that both Lee and Eichelberger retained some control over the property, or at the very least, over the solicitation of offers to purchase the Ritz Cabaret.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In fact, it appears that Lee and Eichelberger did indeed solicit such offers. Leonard Briskman, an employee of the United States Marshal\u2019s Service (the \u201cMarshal\u2019s Service\u201d), attested that he was assigned the task of managing the disposition of the Ritz Cabaret. Briskman explained that the property was to be sold through an online auction service. Brisk-man stated that Lee and Eichelberger were never authorized to sell the Ritz Cabaret on behalf of the Government; however, Briskman acknowledged that Lee did solicit several written offers that were passed on to the Marshal\u2019s Service via Briskman. The property was eventually sold to the highest online bidder for $1,075,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">While Lee was incarcerated, he also signed a contract of sale, ostensibly conveying the Ritz Cabaret to Philip Bast Gagne and Dennis Alviani for $1.3 million. Lee entered into the contract despite Hunt\u2019s then-standing offer of $1.5 million and repeated attempts to negotiate with Eichelberger. Hunt alleges the purchasers of the club were Caucasian; Hunt is African-American. A former employee of Lee\u2019s also claimed that Lee made disparaging remarks about Hunt, including a comment that he preferred the club be sold to a \u201cwhite man.\u201d On this basis, Hunt filed a complaint in the district court, claiming defamation and racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">Lee moved to dismiss Hunt\u2019s complaint, asserting that he lacked contractual capacity to sell the property due to the forfeiture. Because no discovery had been taken, the court was unable to resolve the agency issue. Thus, the court denied the motion to dismiss, ordered the parties to conduct discovery on the issue of Lee\u2019s capacity to contract, and further ordered that the parties file dispositive motions by October 2003. At the conclusion of discovery, the court granted Lee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court nonetheless denied Lee\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>On appeal, Lee claims that the district court erred in refusing to award attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000). Under \u00a7 1988(b), a district court may award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in a civil rights action. A district court\u2019s denial of fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. City of Aiken, </em>278 F.3d 333, 336 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Supreme Court has held that a prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988(b) only if the lawsuit was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or if the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so. <em>See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 422, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). Thus, when awarding attorney\u2019s fees under a civil rights statute, \u201cprevailing defendants are to be treated differently from prevailing plaintiffs, even though the statutory language is neutral.\u201d <em>Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, Md., </em>124 F.3d 597, 606 (4th Cir.1997). In so ruling, the district court carefully analyzes plaintiffs\u2019 legal claim, the evidence adduced in support of that claim, and when plaintiffs should have realized that the claim was groundless. <em>Hutchinson v. Staton, </em>994 F.2d 1076, 1079 (4th Cir.1993). We cannot conclude that Hunt\u2019s claim of racial animus was without legal basis or factual foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Arguably, the district court referred to Hunt\u2019s complaint as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d As this court stated in <em>Arnold v. Burger King Corp., </em>719 F.2d 63, 68 n. 7 (4th Cir.1983), there are \u201cvarying degrees of frivolousness.\u201d The district court noted that the complaint was not demonstrably frivolous on the question of racial animus, although the claim that Lee had the authority to convey the property <em>ultimately </em>lacked a factual underpinning. The totality of the district court\u2019s findings indicate that the court did not intend, by its use of the term, to connote that Hunt\u2019s claim was so utterly baseless as to warrant sanctions. Where, as here, a case is not absolutely groundless, an award of attorney\u2019s fees is not compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Moreover, a finding of bad faith is a necessary precondition to imposition of fees on an attorney under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 (2000). <em>See Brubaker v. City of Richmond, </em>943 F.2d 1363, 1382 n. 25 (4th Cir.1991). Section 1927 provides: \u201cAny attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Although the litigation in this case was contentious, we do not find Hunt or his counsel engaged in the duplicative or unnecessary filings that would trigger sanctions under \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\u201cDiscretion allows district courts latitude in determining fee awards \u2014 even those that an appellate court might initially have set in a different amount.\u201d <em>See Carroll v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, </em>53 F.3d 626, 631 (4th Cir.1995). Clearly, Hunt\u2019s counsel could have conducted more comprehensive pre-filing discovery. Nevertheless, Hunt\u2019s claim of racial animus was not frivolous on its face. Moreover, the threshold legal issue \u2014 not only Lee\u2019s <em>capacity </em>to contract but his <em>agency </em>to contract \u2014 was not clearly determined at the outset of the litigation. Given these facts, coupled with the district court\u2019s discretion, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
