Rodriguez-Cardenas was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of sixty-five months to be followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">Rodriguez-Cardenas argues that the district court plainly erred in enhancing his offense level by sixteen levels based on his prior state court conviction for burglary of a habitation. He argues that his burglary conviction is not an enumerated crime of violence under U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and that his offense did not require proof of the element of use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. This court rejected Rodriguez-Cardenas\u2019s argument in <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), which held that \u201c \u2018burglary of a habitation\u2019 is equivalent to the enumerated [crime of violence] offense of \u2018burglary of a dwelling.\u2019 \u201d The judgment of the district court is affirmed with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">Rodriguez-Cardenas argues that the Government failed to carry its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that his sentence imposed under the mandatory sentencing guidelines system was harmless error. The Government contends that it did not have to show harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because Rodriguez-Cardenas is alleging a non-constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">The court has determined that the Government must prove harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). The Government has failed to carry its burden of proof. Although it does not appear that the district court would have been inclined to impose a lesser sentence, based on its limited remarks, it cannot be determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the same if the mandatory guidelines had not been applicable. Therefore, Rodriguez-Cardenas\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing in accord with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Rodriguez-Cardenas argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional and that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) was incorrectly decided in light of the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Rodriguez-Cardenas\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Although Rodriguez-Cardenas contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez-Cardenas properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. The judgment of the district court is affirmed with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
