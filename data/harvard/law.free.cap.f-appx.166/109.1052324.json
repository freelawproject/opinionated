Smith has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal following the district court\u2019s denial of IFP status.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A movant for leave to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is a pauper and the appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., the appeal presents nonfrivolous issues. <em>Carson v. Policy, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). Smith asserts that the AAA is not immune from civil liability because the arbitrator engaged in \u201cnon judicial action\u201d regarding his motion for contempt. Smith cites to <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">As the district court determined, Smith\u2019s reliance on <em>M\u00edreles </em>is misplaced. <em>M\u00edreles </em>supports the district court\u2019s determination that the arbitrator\u2019s actions in the instant case, relating to the disposition of Smith\u2019s motion for contempt, was an action taking in the arbitrator\u2019s quasi-judicial capacity in the administration of the arbitration proceedings. <em>See Mireles, </em>502 U.S. at 12, 112 S.Ct. 286. As such, the claim against the AAA is barred by arbitral immunity. <em>See Hawkins v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 330, 332 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. <em>See Carimi v. Royal Carribean Cruise Line, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1344, 1345 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Smith has failed to show that he will raise any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Smith is WARNED that he may be subject to sanctions if he makes any further frivolous filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
