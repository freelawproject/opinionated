Johnson pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base (crack) and was sentenced as a career offender to 151 months imprisonment. We affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>No. 03-4105, 2004 WL 2368106 (4th Cir. Oct.19, 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court subsequently granted Johnson\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded his case for further proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">Johnson\u2019s sentence was imposed prior to the decisions in <em>Booker </em>and its predecessor, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and he did not raise objections to his sentence based on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines or the district court\u2019s application of sentencing enhancements based on facts not admitted by him or found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-60 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">In a supplemental brief filed at this court\u2019s direction after the Supreme Court remanded his case, Johnson contends that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment and that the district court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing disclose that it would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. The government maintains that Johnson\u2019s career offender sentence did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>violate the Sixth Amendment, but concedes that the record indicates the district court might have imposed a lower sentence had it had discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Johnson contends that, under <em>Booker, </em>the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by making impermissible factual findings to classify him as a career offender. We are satisfied that his claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that application of career offender enhancement falls within exception for prior convictions where facts are undisputed, making it unnecessary for district court to engage in further fact finding about prior convictions); <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that a court\u2019s inquiry as to disputed facts in connection with a prior conviction is limited to the terms of the charging document, a plea agreement, a transcript of the plea colloquy, or a comparable judicial record).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Johnson did not dispute that he satisfied the requirements for career offender status. Moreover, the district court could determine from the judicial record of Johnson\u2019s prior drug convictions that he had the necessary two prior felony convictions for a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Therefore, we conclude that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As Johnson argues and the government concedes, the district court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing reveal that it was dissatisfied with the constraints of the mandatory guideline system and unhappy with the length of the guideline sentence. The record thus provides a non-speculative basis for concluding that the mandatory nature of the guidelines prevented the district court from imposing a sentence below the guideline range. Accordingly, we conclude that Johnson has made the necessary showing under <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223-24 (4th Cir.2005), and resentencing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">For the reasons discussed, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district court judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of Johnson\u2019s sentencing.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
