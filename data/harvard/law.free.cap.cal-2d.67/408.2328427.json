Separate judgments on the pleadings in favor of defendant State of California were entered below and all plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The record discloses that although the judgments were entered upon an order granting separate motions for judgment on the pleadings, defendant filed no answer in either case. Its motion therefore had the purpose and effect of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>general demurrer (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, p. 1706) and on review is to be tested by the same rules. <em>(Dragna </em>v. <em>White </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 469, 470 [289 P.2d 428] ; <em>Chas. L. Harney, Inc. </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 etc. Board </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 561, 565 [247 P.2d 913].)  Since the motion was used to perform the function.of a general demurrer, it \u2018'reaches only to the contents of the pleading and such matters as may be considered under the doctrine of judicial notice\u201d <em>(Weil </em>v. <em>Barthel </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 835, 837 [291 P.2d 30]) and \u201cadmits all material and issuable facts pleaded.\u201d <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 492, 497 [15 Cal.Rptr. 87, 364 P.2d 263].) We proceed to set forth the facts in the light of these principles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel is a navigable tidal waterway extending from the mouth of the San Joaquin River to the Port of Stockton. From the turning basin adjoining the port, the channel continues easterly for about 5,000 feet and comes to a dead end within the confines of the city. This portion of the waterway is known as the Upper Stockton Channel. Plaintiffs Colberg<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Stephens Marine, Inc. (Stephens), own real property in the City of Stockton riparian to the Upper Stockton Channel upon which for more than sixty years they have conducted shipyards for the construction and repair of yachts and ocean-going vessels. Both yards are improved with marineways, buildings, docks and allied facilities. Colberg\u2019s property consists of approximately eight acres; Stephens\u2019 of approximately six. Ships and other craft now using the Upper Stockton Channel can proceed to the turning basin and the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel and thereupon navigate to the open sea by way of the Carquinez Straits and San Francisco Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The state proposes to construct twin stationary freeway bridges across the Upper Stockton Channel between plaintiffs\u2019 properties and the turning basin. The vertical clearance of these bridges is to be, generally speaking, 45 feet above the water line. Pursuant to federal law the state applied to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Engineers for a permit to build such bridges. (See 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 525, subd. (b).) After a public hearing, consideration of the views of various interested persons including these plaintiffs, and an extensive economic survey, approval of the location and plans of the bridges was granted by federal authorities in February 1964, subject to conditions not here necessary to be detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Colberg alleges that 81 percent of its current business involves ships standing more than 45 feet above the water line. Plaintiff Stephens alleges that 35 percent of its current business involves such ships. The present minimum clearance between plaintiffs\u2019 yards and the Pacific Ocean is 135 feet, established by the Antioch Bridge. Plaintiffs allege in substance that after the construction of the proposed bridges, no vessel with fixed structure in excess of 45 feet above the water line will be able to enter their respective shipyards; that there is no other access by water to the yards from the San Joaquin River, San Francisco Bay and the oceans of the world; and that plaintiffs, their properties and their businesses will suffer loss and damages because of the impairment of access resulting from the construction of the bridges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs in both actions allege that an actual controversy exists (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1060) between each of them and the state as to whether the alleged impairment of access to \u201cthe main channel of the San Joaquin River \u2019' is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Counsel for the state pointed out to us at oral argument that a bridge of vertical clearance sufficient to accommmodate plaintiffs\u2019 shipyard traffic would involve greatly increased construction costs because it would entail extended approaches;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the added height of such approaches would have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>adverse effect upon intangible community values; and that a draw or swing bridge would be unsuitable for freeway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings in both cases and entered judgments accordingly. In its memorandum opinion it held that diminution of the scope of plaintiffs\u2019 access from their respective properties to the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel as a result of the state\u2019s proposed action relative to its navigable waters would not constitute a taking or damaging of private property for which just compensation would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">It is not disputed that an actual controversy exists between the parties on this question; that if plaintiffs were required to await construction of the bridge before commencing an action at law, they would suffer irreparable damage because of interference with their businesses during construction; that a declaratory judgment resolving the question of compensability in their favor prior to completion of the bridge project will permit relocation of their respective operations with a minimum of inconvenience; and that plaintiffs will be unable to plan their businesses or enter into necessary long-term business contracts, until such question is settled. We are satisfied that under the above circumstances plaintiffs were entitled to invoke declaratory relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The sole question in this ease is whether the alleged impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ment of plaintiffs\u2019 access to the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel constitutes a taking or damaging of private property within the meaning of article I, section 14 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In order to answer this question we are led to an examination of the interest of the state in its navigable waters; in the course of this examination we explain the relationship between the state\u2019s power to deal with its navigable waters and the extent of its constitutional duty to make compensation for damage caused by the exercise of that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In order to put the controversy into proper focus, we must first make some preliminary observations concerning plaintiffs\u2019 position and the nature and extent of their claim.  First, it is clear that plaintiffs must assert the taking or damaging of a <em>private </em>right in order to bring themselves Avithin the protective embrace of article I, section 14. Thus, they cannot ground tlieir claim in the right of navigation, for this is a public right from the abridgment of which plaintiffs Avill suffer no damage different in character from that to be suffered by the general public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Jarvis </em>v. <em>Santa Clara Valley R.R. Co. </em>(1877) 52 Cal. 438, 440 ; <em>San Francisco Sav. Union </em>v. <em>R.G.R. Petroleum etc. Co. </em>(1904) 344 Cal. 134,139 [77 P. 823, 303 Am.St.Rep. 72, 1 Ann.Cas. 382, 66 L.R.A. 242] ; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mayor of New York </em>(1883) 109 U.S. 385, 394-395 [27 L.Ed. 971, 974-975, 3 S.Ct. 228] ; <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Washington County RR. Co. </em>(1901) 96 Me. 76, 85-86 [51 A. 806] ; <em>Marine Air Ways </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(1951) 201 Misc. 349. 350 [104 N.Y.S 2d 964] and cases tliere cited, affd. 280 App.Div. 1023 [13 6 N.Y.S.2d 778] ; 56 Am.Jur., Waters, \u00a7 216, pp. 677-678.) Instead, they must have recourse to the private right of an owner riparian to a navigable waterway to have access to the channel. (See <em>San Francisco Sav. Union </em>v. <em>R.G.R. Petroleum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>etc. Co., supra, </em>144 Cal. 134, 139 ; <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1885) 67 Cal. 543 [8 P. 82] ; 56 Am.Jur., Waters, \u00a7 216, p. 677.) However, it appears that the access from plaintiffs\u2019 property to the navigable portion of the waterway to which they are riparian, to wit, the Upper Stockton Channel, will not be impaired by the proposed project, so that their private right of access, if limited to its traditional scope, will not be \u201ctaken or damaged\u201d and no claim for compensation can arise. It is therefore plaintiffs\u2019 position that the private right of access must be expanded. They assert that the construction of the bridge in question will render their private right of access useless insofar as it pertains to vessels with a fixed structure more than 45 feet above the waterline; that after such construction they \u201ccan launch ships, but they can go nowhere.\u201d Action which renders a right valueless, they urge, effectively \u201ctakes or damages \u2019 \u2019 that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We deem it unnecessary to decide this question, for we have determined that, whatever the scope of plaintiffs\u2019 right of riparian access <em>as agadnst other private persons, </em>that right must yield without compensation to a proper exercise of the power <em>of the state </em>over its navigable waters. It is to a discussion of this latter power that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The State of California holds all of its navigable waterways and the lands lying beneath them \u2018 as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gold Run Ditch &amp; Min.

Its power to control, regulate and utilize such waters within the terms of the trust is absolute except as limited by the paramount supervisory power of the federal government over navigable waters. <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Reclamation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>Dist. No. 1500 </em>(1917) 174 Cal. 622, 637 [163 P. 1024] ; see <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, supra, </em>152 U.S. 1, 26-31 [38 L.Ed. 331, 341-343] ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mission Rock Co. </em>(1903) 189 U.S. 391, 404 [47 L.Ed. 865, 869, 23 S.Ct. 606].)  The nature and extent of the trust under which the state holds its navigable waterways has never been defined with precision, but it has been stated generally that acts of the state with regard to its navigable waters are within trust purposes when they are done \u201cfor purposes of commerce, navigation, and fisheries for the benefit of all the people of the state. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Mallon </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 199, 205 [282 P.2d 481] ; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>California Fish Co., supra, </em>166 Cal. 576, 584585 ; <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Lisenby, supra, </em>175 Cal. 575, 579 (\u201cfor purposes of navigation and commerce\u201d) ; <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 609, 614 [82 P.2d 362] (\u201cfor navigation, commerce and fishing\u201d) ; <em>City of Newport Beach </em>v. <em>Fager </em>(1940) 39 Cal.App.2d 23, 28 [102 P.2d 438] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hecker </em>(1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 823, 840 [4 Cal.Rptr. 334].)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The courts have construed the purposes of the trust with liberality to the end of benefiting all the people of the state. In the early case of <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Board of State Harbor Comrs. </em>v. <em>Potrero &amp; Ray View R.R. Co. </em>(1885) 67 Cal. 166 [7 P. 445], defendant, under authority of a franchise granted by the Legislature, constructed a railroad bridge across Islais Creek, a navigable waterway. The bridge was an obstruction to navigation, and the Board of State Harbor Commissioners sought to have it abated as a nuisance. It was contended that the legislative act granting the right to build the bridge was in conflict with the act of Congress admitting California into the Union, which act provided that \u201c all the navigable waters within the State shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of said State as to the citizens of the United States, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor. \u2019 \u201d This court rejected this contention, holding <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cwhile the power of the State with respect to the construction, regulation, and control of bridges ... is subordinate to that of Congress, still until Congress acts on the subject, the power of the State is plenary.\u201d (67 Cal. at p. 168.) Though we there made no explicit reference to the extent of the trust relating to navigable waters, we impliedly held that the spanning of navigable waters by a railroad bridge was an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>within the trust purposes of \u201ccommerce, navigation, and fisheries ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">In <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Kingsbury </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 148 [273 P. 797], the state surveyor-general had refused to issue to plaintiffs permits to prospect for oil and gas upon tidal lands covered by navigable sea waters upon the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the granting of such permits would constitute an act without the scope of the trust because such prospecting would not be \u201cin aid and furtherance of commerce and navigation.\u201d We rejected that contention, holding that the relationship of gasoline to commerce was manifest. \u201cGasoline is the power that largely moves the commerce of nations over lands and sea; . . . Gasoline is so closely allied with state and national welfare as to make its production a matter of state and national concern. If it can be said of any industry that its output is ' in aid and furtherance of commerce and navigation, \u2019 and its production \u2018a public benefit,\u2019 the production of gasoline, by reason of the motive elements that inhere in it and its universal use and adaptability to varied uses and the convenient and portable form in which it may be confined, would entitle it to a high classification in the scale of useful, natural products. It is a mover of commerce and fills the office of \u2018a public benefit.\u2019 \u201d (206 Cal. at p. 181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Finally, in the ease of <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Reclamation Dist. No. 1500, supra, </em>174 Cal. 622, plaintiffs sought to enjoin the operations of defendant district, which was engaged in efforts to reclaim land and prevent flooding, with incidental benefits to navigation, near the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers. We there rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the state had no power to deal with its navigable waters unless its dominant purpose was to improve navigation. \u201cThe supreme control of the state over its navigable waters was early declared in <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Cowell, </em>4 Cal. 80, approved in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mission Rock Co., </em>389 U.S. 391 [47 L.Ed. 865, 23 S.Ct. 606]. This right of control embraces within it not alone the power to destroy the navigability of certain waters for the benefit of others, but extends in the case of streams to the power to regulate and control the navigable or non-navigable tributaries, as in the debris cases, <em>to the erection of structures along or across the stream, </em>to deepening or changing the channel, to diverting or arresting tributaries; <em>in short, to do anything subserving the great purpose, </em>...\u201d (Italics added.) (174 Cal. at p. 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We deem it too clear to warrant the citation of further authority that the state, as trustee for the benefit of the people, has power to deal with its navigable waters in any manner consistent with the improvement of commercial intercourse, whether navigational or otherwise. It is equally clear, however, that the question of governmental <em>power </em>is quite different from that of <em>compensation </em>for damage caused by the exercise of such power. It is to the latter question that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We have referred above to the paramount supervisory power of the federal government over navigable waters. This power, though superior to that of the state, is not grounded in ownership of the navigable waterways upon which it operates, but rather derives from the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and it has been stated that it may properly be exercised <em>only </em>in order to aid navigation. <em>(Port of Seattle </em>v. <em>Oregon &amp; W. R.R. Co. </em>(1921) 255 U.S. 56, 63 [65 L.Ed. 500, 506, 41 S.Ct. 237] ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kansas City life Ins.

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is of course applicable to the exercise of the federal navigational power within its proper scope, just as article I, section 14 of the state Constitution is applicable to the exercise of state power over navigable waters, but in many cases compensation for \u201cdamage\u201d caused by exercise of the federal power is denied because the rights and values affected are deemed to be burdened with the so-called federal \u201cnavigation servitude.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Among the rights so burdened is that of the access from riparian land to the affected navigable waterway. <em>(Gibson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1897) 166 U.S. 269 [41 L.Ed. 996, 17 S.Ct. 578] ; see <em>Northern Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1878) 99 U.S. 635 [25 L.Ed. 336].) The limits of the servitude are reached, however, and just compensation must be paid in spite of the fact that the power has been exercised within its scope, when permanent physical encroachment upon or invasion of land riparian to the navigable waterway but above the ordinary high-water mark results. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chicago, M., St.P. &amp; P.R.R. Co. </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 592 [85 L.Ed. 1064, 61 S.Ct. 772] ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Commodore Park, supra, </em>324 U.S. 386, 391 [89 L.Ed. 1017, 1021] ; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kansas City Life Ins.

The state, as owner of its navigable waterways subject to a trust for the benefit of the people, may act relative to those waterways in any manner consistent with the improvement of commercial traffic and intercourse.  We are of the further view that the law of California burdens property riparian or littoral to navigable waters with a servitude commensurate with the power of the state over such navigable waters, and that \u201cwhen the act [of the state] is done, if it does not embrace the actual taking of property, but results merely in some injurious effect upon the property, the property owner must, for the sake of the general welfare, yield uncompensated obedience.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Reclamation Dist. No. 1500, supra, </em>174 Cal. 622, 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We have arrived at this conclusion after an examination of cases from other jurisdictions. It appears that in some states the servitude operates only when the state acts upon its navigable waters for the purpose of improving navigation, and that private rights \u201cdamaged\u2019\u2019 by acts not in aid of navigation are therefore compensable. <em>(Beidler </em>v. <em>Sanitary Dist. </em>(1904) 211 Ill. 628, 637 [71 N.E. 1118, 67 L.R.A. 820] ; <em>Natcher </em>v. <em>City of Bowling Green </em>(1936,) 264 Ky. 584, 592-593 [95 S.W.2d 255] ; <em>State </em>ex <em>rel.

We are of the opinion that this view is supported not only by the present law of California, but also by considerations of sound public policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The limitation of the servitude to cases involving a strict navigational purpose stems from a time when the sole use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>navigable waterways for purposes of commerce was that of surface water transport. (See Morreale, <em>op. cit., </em>at p. 26.) That time is no longer with us. The demands of modern commerce, the concentration of population in urban centers fronting on navigable waterways, the achievements of science in devising new methods of commercial intercourse\u2014all of these factors require that the state, in determining the means by which the general welfare is best to be served through the utilization of navigable waters held in trust for the public, should not be burdened with an outmoded classification favoring one mode of utilization over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">It is clear that the conclusions above expressed dispose of plaintiffs\u2019 contention that their right of access to the navigable waters fronting on their respective properties must, in order to be of utility, include the right to navigate freely to the sea.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whatever the scope and character of their right to have access to those navigable waters,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we hold that such right is burdened with a servitude in favor of the state which comes into operation when the state properly exercises its power to control, regulate, and utilize such waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>City of Newport Beach </em>v. <em>Fager, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 23, defendants\u2019 access to navigable waters over their littoral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>land was <em>wholly </em>cut off when the city, a political subdivision of the state, filled and reclaimed the tidelands in front of their land. When the city sought to quiet title to the lands thus filled, defendants contended that they had at least a right of access over such lands to navigable water. The court rejected this contention. \u201cWe are satisfied that the correct rule is that the littoral owner of uplands upon a navigable bay has no right of access to the waters of the bay over intervening tide lands, whether filled or unfilled, which have been granted by the state to a city in trust for the purpose of improving such navigable bay in furtherance of commerce and navigation. [Citations.] Although it is true that as against a stranger a littoral owner of upland bordering upon navigable waters may not be deprived of his right of access to such waters[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] no such right exists in favor of such littoral owner as against the state or its grantee in the exercise of a lawful use or purpose. \u201d (39 Cal.App.2d at p. 28 ; see also <em>Henry Dalton &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Oakland, supra, </em>168 Cal. 463, 467 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hecker, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 823, 840.) We are neither advised of, nor can conceive of, any reason why rules relating to one kind of navigable waters, to wit, tidewaters, should not be applied with equal reason to similar situations involving other kinds of navigable waters.  In any event, we take judicial notice of the fact that tidal influence extends some distance up the San Joaquin River past the Port of Stockton. (See Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7\u00a7 174-176, pp. 160-163.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that our highway access cases (see <em>Bacich </em>v. <em>Board of Control </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 343 [144 P.2d 818] ; <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 659 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719]) require that compensation be paid for any substantial impairment of plaintiffs\u2019 right of access. We are not persuaded that the analogy between highway access and navigational access will bear close scrutiny. The right of access to a land highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>derives from the \u201cland service road\u201d concept, whereby roads are conceived of as arteries constructed through condemnation of private land for the purpose of serving other land abutting on them, rather than for the purpose of serving public traffic passing over them. (See Note (1965) 38 So.Cal.L.Rev. 689, 690, and authorities cited in fn. 9 thereof.) Principles applicable to such a right cannot reasonably be extended to the case of navigable waterways, which constitute a natural resource retained within the public domain for the purpose of serving public traffic in accordance with the greatest common benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Finally, we emphasize that the state servitude upon lands riparian or littoral to navigable waters, like the federal servitude burdening such lands, does not extend to cases wherein the proper exercise of state power results in actual physical invasion of or encroachment upon fast lands. In the case of <em>Miramar Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>23 Cal. 2d 170, plaintiff was the owner of lands littoral to a navigable bay and defendant, a political subdivision of the state, constructed a permanent breakwater in the bay about three miles to the west of plaintiff\u2019s property. The effect of this breakwater upon natural drifts and currents operated in the course of time to denude plaintiff\u2019s property of sandy beach, rendering the property valueless as a beach resort. It was alleged that defendant, before it built its breakwater, knew that the effect complained of would occur. Plaintiff sued in inverse condemnation, and the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal after sustaining defendants \u2019 demurrer without leave to amend. Upon affirmance of the judgment by this court it was said: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s littoral right to sandy water [which provided the accretion necessary to offset tidal washing], like its littoral right to access to the ocean, was derived entirely from the proximity of plaintiff\u2019s land to the ocean. It gave to plaintiff\u2019s land the advantage of sandy accretions. Nevertheless, the enjoyment of that advantage did not constitute a right to its perpetuation, for plaintiff\u2019s littoral rights were always subordinate to the state\u2019s right to improve navigation.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] The duration of the sandy accretions depended entirely upon the continuation of the littoral right, which from the beginning was subject to termination by the state. The withdrawal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of the sandy accretions, constituting the damage to plaintiff\u2019s land, was an incidental consequence of the state\u2019s use of the public domain for a public interest that was at all times superior to private littoral rights. There has therefore been no taking or damaging of private property for public use within the meaning of article I, section 14, of the California Constitution.\u201d (23 Cal.2d at p. 176.) In a separate concurring opinion, it was said that direct physical encroachment or invasion upon plaintiff\u2019s lands was required in order that there be \u201ca taking within the meaning of the constitutional provision.\u201d (23 Cal.2d at p. 178.) After reference to certain eases of the United States Supreme Court to which we have adverted above (e.g., <em>Pumpelly </em>v. <em>Green Bay Co., supra, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 166) the concurring opinion concluded that \u201cThe doctrine of taking under the Fifth Amendment has never been extended beyond the rule stated, and certainly there is no necessity for doing so under a constitutional provision which provides compensation for both taking and damaging.\u201d (23 Cal.2d at pp. 178-179.) Three justices of the court dissented upon the basis that under the facts a physical taking of the plaintiff\u2019s land <em>was </em>involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">It therefore appears that this court in the <em>Miramar </em>case, though divided as to the proper result under the facts there at issue, reached fundamental agreement on the extent to which the state, through the proper exercise of its trust power to deal with navigable waters, may impair without compensation rights appurtenant to property riparian or littoral to such waters.  The servitude with which such property is burdened precludes compensation for impairment or curtailment of all rights not damaged by permanent physical invasion of or encroachment upon fast lands; when the exercise of the power does cause such physical invasion or encroachment, the servitude is inapplicable and rights damaged as a result are compensable in accordance with article I, section 14, of the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We hold that plaintiffs\u2019 right of access from their respective riparian properties to the waters of the channel, whatever its scope as against private parties, is burdened with a servitude in favor of the state and that, since there is here no direct physical invasion of, or encroachment upon, said properties by the state, plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation for the abridgment or .diminution, if any, of such right</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of access as a result of the lawful exercise of the state\u2019s power to regulate, control and deal with its navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The judgments are, and each of them is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Traynor, C.

Perhaps the most satisfactory explanation is that derived from the common law concept of <em>jus publicum, </em>that interest of the Crown in its navigable waterways whereby the subjects were assured that such waterways would be utilized for public benefit, and that private interference with such utilization would be prevented.

Thus, the \u201cright of access\u2019\u2019 claimed by plaintiffs would seem to include a right to navigate to the sea in vessels of any size. (See fn. 8, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> As noted above (see fn. 11 and accompanying text) the State of New York appears to limit the scope of the state\u2019s servitude to those cases where the state\u2019s act is in furtherance of navigation, and requires compensation for damage to private rights occasioned by acts not in furtherance of navigation. However, in a case whose facts are similar to those at bench, the New York court construed those facts and characterized the right at issue as that of navigation, rather than access. Since, as we have indicated above, the right to navigate is a public rather than a private right, the court held that its abridgment was noneompensable even though the governmental act complained of was not undertaken in aid of navigation. <em>(Marine Air Ways </em>v. <em>State of New York, supra, </em>201 Misc. 349 ; cf. <em>Crance </em>v. <em>State of New York, supra, </em>205 Misc. 590.) Other jurisdictions have adopted a similar approach. <em>(State ex. rel. Andersons </em>v. <em>Masheter, supra, </em>1 Ohio St.2d 11 ; see also <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Washington County R.R.

We do not adopt this rationale in the instant case. The rationale we do adopt leaves open the question whether, <em>as against private persons, </em>a riparian owner\u2019s right of access connotes a right of some scope to move freely upon the surface of navigable water once the channel has been attained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> It is this right as against private persons which is the basis of cases involving condemnation of land fronting on navigable waterways. (See <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Aitken </em>(1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 460 [52 P.2d 585] ; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chandler-Dunbar etc. Co. </em>(1913) 229 U.S. 53 [57 L.Ed. 1063, 33 S.Ct. 067]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>River Rouge Improv.

However, as we have explained <em>supra, </em>the state\u2019s power to regulate and control its navigable waters is not limited to purposes of navigation, and the servitude in its favor is of commensurate scope.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b454-6\">PETERS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5z\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">I cannot agree that because the state wants to build two low-level highway bridges across the mouth of an inlet where plaintiffs\u2019 shipyards are located, plaintiffs must suffer the complete loss caused by the impairment of their right of one-way water access to deep water. Principles of fairness, logic and public policy suggest that this loss is a part of the cost of the freeway that should not be borne by plaintiffs but should be borne by the public. Compensation should therefore be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The access impaired here is one-way access to the oceans of the world. Such access is indispensable to the operation of plaintiffs\u2019 businesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So, the impairment is not technical. It is substantial and different in nature and degree from the impairment suffered by the general public. There is not involved the mere hypothetical damage to vacant land, nor are we dealing with speculators, nor with newly created businesses. Both plaintiffs have been operating bona fide shipyards in the inlet for over 60 years. Thus, we are not involved with a mere incidental impairment of the right of access but are dealing with a very substantial impairment. The impairment is not caused by a construction strictly in aid of navigation but the bridges are part of a state freeway. If the freeway impaired land access to the same degree such impairment would be compensable. These facts are indisputable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">The majority hold that, under these facts, case law and public policy dictate the conclusion that compensation should not be allowed. So far as case law is concerned the majority have done a commendable job in collecting the cases discussing the nature of the rights involved. But all that this exhaustive analysis proves is that there are no definitive cases in California, and that the decisions of other states reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>conflicting results. A decision either way is permissible under the cases. Thus, the decision in this case is really a public policy one, and the majority, recognizing this, claim that public policy supports their conclusion. How can there be a public policy to cut off plaintiffs\u2019 only access to deep water and so put well established businesses out of operation without compensation <em>1 </em>The answer is obvious. There can be and is no such public policy. The question is not an open one. It has been decided that, as a matter of public policy, impairment of land access under such circumstances requires compensation. The majority fly in the face of that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Today government is big and complex and constantly growing bigger. The legitimate need of government for property is constantly expanding. Thus, more and more frequently, the rights of individuals and the government come into conflict. When this occurs then this court must referee the conflict and try to protect the rights of the state and the rights of the individual. In doing so we must keep in mind the admonition of our Constitution that property \u201cshall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Nowhere is this conflict between the state and the individual made more apparent than by the state\u2019s need to build new highways and freeways which frequently include, as here, the building of bridges. The problem became very apparent in the construction of the freeways and the approaches leading to the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Rights of access were obviously impaired. In the case of <em>Bacich </em>v. <em>Board of Control, </em>23 Cal.2d 343 [144 P.2d 818], where the construction of the approaches to the Bay Bridge placed plaintiff\u2019s land and property in a cul-de-sac, the problem was directly presented. Plaintiff had still one-way access to the general system of streets but his access in the other direction was substantially cut off. There was no controlling case in California. Cases elsewhere were in conflict. The court recognized that it was a problem of first impression, and that it was required to determine the public policy of this state. It then showed no hesitancy, as it does now, to declare such policy. It held that when the right of access was impaired, as distinguished from a physical taking or damaging, there must be a weighing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the conflicting rights. Thus, where the impairment is substantial and peculiar to the plaintiff, and can be compensated for without prohibitive cost, it is compensable. But where the impairment is incidental and where the cost of compensation is prohibitive it is not compensable. Thus, impairment of access to one in a cul-de-sac was held compensable, but property owners beyond the next intersecting street were not to be compensated. Nor were property owners to be compensated where their access street was made into a one-way street or into a divided highway, or left turns were prohibited. (See <em>Bacich </em>v. <em>Board of Control, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d 343, particularly the concurring opinion of Edmonds, J., p. 356, 358 et seq. ; <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>61 Cal.2d 659 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719] ; <em>Valenta </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>61 Cal.2d 669 [39 Cal.Rptr. 909, 394 P.2d 725].) The court showed no reluctance in <em>Bacich </em>and the other cases in declaring that a material impairment of the right of access should be compensable as a matter of public policy. But the majority in the instant case repudiate that public policy and purport to hold that public policy now compels a contrary result. The two lines of authority are inconsistent and incompatible. If we were right in the land access cases the majority are wrong in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The major error in the majority opinion is its holding that all the state\u2019s uses of its navigable waters must be treated in the same identical fashion. It may be that when the state acts strictly in aid of navigation that the right of the state is absolute and the property owner is entitled to no compensation <em>(Miramar Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, </em>23 Cal.2d 170 [143 P.2d 1]) for impairment of his rights. But where the use by the state is not strictly for navigation purposes, but, as here, is for freeway purposes, principles of equity, justice, fairness, and certainly of public policy, dictate that the same public policy declared in the land access cases should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">When this case was before the Court of Appeal of the Third Appellate District, Justice Friedman prepared a scholarly and exhaustive opinion for the court that discusses these positions in depth. The following portions of that opinion are adopted as part of this dissent. <em>(Colberg, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(Cal.App.) 55 Cal.Rptr. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u201cThe amendment of state constitutions, including California\u2019s, to provide compensation when private. property is \u2018damaged\u2019 as well as \u2018taken\u2019 for - public use, indicates an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>intent to expand the area of compensability, requiring the courts to fix its limits by placing the economic interests of the public in balance against the sacrifices imposed on the landowner. (Ba<em>cich </em>v. <em>Board of Control, </em>23 Cal.2d 343, 350-351 [144 P.2d 818] ; concurring opinion of Edmonds, J. <em>ibid., </em>pp. 358-360, 144 P.2d pp. 826-832 ; see <em>Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>62 Cal.2d 250, 262-263 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129].) The case-by-ease balancing of these competing interests results in judicial expansion or contraction of a group of intangible rights recognized as compensable \u2018private property.\u2019 Compensable property, it is now recognized, includes not only the physical land and improvements but certain intangible rights of access between the land and the outside world. Thus, although the owner uses the streets in common with the rest of the public, he owns a private easement of access which consists of the right to get into the street abutting his property and thence to the general system of public streets and highways. <em>(Valenta </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>61 Cal.2d 669, 671 [39 Cal.Rptr. 909, 394 P.2d 725] ; <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>61 Cal.2d 659, 663 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719], citing preceding California decisions; cf. <em>Sneed </em>v. <em>County of Riverside, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 205 [32 Cal.Rptr. 318], re airspace invasion.) Not every impairment of access to the general system of public streets is compensable in eminent domain. Compensability, rather, requires an individualized finding of substantial impairment, a finding of fact delegated to the trial court and not the jury. <em>(Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at pp. 663-665 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ricciardi, </em>23 Cal.2d 390, 402-403 [144 P.2d 799].)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u201cThe central problem is to locate a line between compensable damage to private property and disadvantages of the kind called \u2018consequential.\u2019 Of the latter sort are such elements as loss of business and diminution of traffic caused by diversion of traffic and circuity of travel. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Department of Public Works </em>v. <em>Symons, </em>54 Cal.2d 855, 860 [9 Cal.Rptr. 363, 357 P.2d 451].) Applying the economic balancing test, the Supreme Court points out that awards of the latter sort would severely burden the public treasury and produce \u2018 \u201can embargo upon the creation of new and desirable roads.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>p. 862, 9 Cal.Rptr. p. 367, 357 P.2d p. 455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u201cThe street access doctrine represents an expanded notion of the constitutional concept of private property-whose inva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>sion or damage is compensable in eminent domain. It means that \u2018property\u2019 in an eminent domain sense includes not only a piece of the earth\u2019s surface but an intangible right of movement between it and the outside world; that, although the channels of movement are shared with the public, they are \u2018private\u2019 and compensable when a public improvement devalues a particular piece of land by substantially impairing these channels. Navigable waterways are channels of movement no less than streets and highways. (See <em>Chicago, etc. Ry. </em>v. <em>City of Minneapolis, </em>232 U.S. 430, 442, [58 L.Ed. 671, 675, 34 S.Ct. 400] ; <em>Wattson </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>207 Cal. 314, 320 [278 P. 236] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gold Run Ditch &amp; Min. Co., </em>66 Cal. 138, 147 [4 P. 1152, 56 Am.Rep. 80].) There is no difference in principle or policy between land and sea access which affirms an easement of access by land and denies it by water. If a public project obstructs the owner\u2019s access to the outside world, he is equally hurt whether the barrier blocks him by land or by sea. A littoral property owner\u2019s easement of access includes both media of movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u201cClaims for loss of street access often arise because the public improvement places private property on a cul-de-sac, restricting accessability to one direction only, e.g., <em>Valenta </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra; Bacich </em>v. <em>Board of Control, supra. </em>The Colberg and Stephens shipyards are situated on a natural cul-de-sac. Without the intervention of the public improvement, they have marine access to the outside world in one direction only. According to the complaints, construction of the public project will obstruct much of the single marine route between their properly and the outside world. Their private right of access to the navigable water in front of their property has little value if that is as far as they can go.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Location on a partially blocked, marine cul-de-sac is one element in the group of circumstances indicating the occurrence or absence of a substantial impairment of the easement of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cDoubtless these shipyards have street access on the landward side. Shoreline properties have obvious economic attributes resulting from their accessibility by water. Residual access by land may supply scant economic solace when marine access beyond the immediate waterfront is obstructed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>destroyed. The substantial impairment rule supplies a criterion for determining whether the retention of land access and the destruction or obstruction of marine access result in compensable damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cThe state contends that the street access doctrine is only an analogy. It suggests tb,at the public policy of the street access cases, where economic balancing is possible, does not apply to loss of marine access; that the public can supply economical alternative routes to compensate for closed streets but not for closed waterways; further, that a bridge of limited clearance across a busy waterway may elicit damage claims so heavy and widespread as to prevent the project. These factors evoke no policy considerations excluding access by water from the general easement of access recognized in eminent domain. The balancing approach is much broader than the street access cases. It is employed to measure the reach of the policy underlying the eminent domain provision of the state Constitution, laying down a line which separates compensable injuries from noncompensable disadvantages. In <em>Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>it is used in the context of a landslide damage claim; in <em>Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board, </em>35 Cal.2d 628, 642 [220 P.2d 897], to determine compensability of flood damage. In the course of the latter decision the court states: \u2018The decisive consideration is whether the owner of the damaged property if uncompensated would contribute more than his proper share to the public undertaking. \u2019 <em>(Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 642 [220 P.2d at p. 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cViewed in the light of the economic balancing criterion, the present injuries are sharply focused on two properties. They arouse no concern for the public purse beyond that involved in any eminent domain proceeding. While shared with the general public, marine passage along Upper Stockton Channel without a height restriction is a unique economic attribute to two commercial shipyards located on a marine culde-sac.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prospect of damage claims from the two owners is not so monumental as to discourage the freeway project of which the bridges are a part. The taxpayers can absorb the cost with far less hardship than the owners. <em>(Albers </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 263 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u201cThe selection between a low level bridge and reasonable alternatives is essentially a budgetary and planning choice by the administrator. Potential damage to the littoral owners may approach the cost of raising the bridge level. At that point the administrator starts thinking of an' acceptable alternative, for example, a higher bridge. Intangible community values imperiled by the extended ramps of a high bridge may impel his return to the low level design. Whatever motivates the administrator to choose a low level bridge, dollars or intangible community values, the individual property owner \u2018if uncompensated would contribute more than his proper share to the public undertaking. \u2019 <em>(Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 642 [220 P.2d at p. 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201cThe specter of widespread damage claims caused by a bridge athwart a busy artery of marine commerce arouses no policy tremors. Potential economic injuries from obstructions to navigation are limited by federal statutes investing the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of the Army with discretionary permit powers in the interest of protecting navigation. (See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 403 ; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R.R. Co., </em>59 F.2d 137, 142.) Unless the federal officials abdicate their responsibilities, a low level, drawless bridge across the Carquinez Straits or the mouth of the Mississippi is a theoretical but not practical possibility. It is reasonable to suggest that the present bridge project merited a federal permit only because the 45-foot limitation on navigation had narrow economic impact on two shipyards located on a marine cul-de-sac; that at some point potential injury to additional maritime interests would provoke denial of a federal permit. Injury claims remaining after the federal screening must then pass a second screening, that imposed by the economic balancing test, which measures the limit of compensability under the California Constitution. Finally, the claim must pass the substantial impairment test. These successive filters prevent compensable injuries to navigation so widely diffused that they are more public than private.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u201cWe resist the invitation to follow the nuisance and equity decisions which deny upstream owners relief against downstream bridges which obstruct navigation., (See cases cited fn. 4, <em>supra.) </em>[Fn. 4. <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>70 U.S. (3 Wall.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>713 [18 L.Ed. 96] ; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>109 U.S. 385 [27 L.Ed. 971, 3 S.Ct. 228] ; <em>Cardwell </em>v. <em>American River Bridge Co., </em>113 U.S. 205 [28 L.Ed. 959, 5 S.Ct. 423] ; <em>Pacific Inter-Club Yacht Assn. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>197 F.Supp. 218 ; <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Santa Clara Valley R.R. Co., </em>52 Cal. 438 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Potrero &amp; Ray View R.R. Co., </em>67 Cal. 166 [7 P. 445] ; cf. <em>Hickok </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>23 Ohio St. 523 [13 Am.Rep. 255] ; see also <em>Sound Marine &amp; Machine Corp. </em>v. <em>Westchester County, </em>100 F.2d 360.] Such decisions turn largely on the \u2018public\u2019 character of the right of navigation and the private plaintiff\u2019s lack of standing to seek relief against a public nuisance not peculiar to himself. In the search for an eminent domain concept of \u2018private property,\u2019 equity and nuisance decisions are not a trustworthy guide (see <em>Clement </em>v. <em>State Reclamation Board, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d at p. 641 [220 P.2d 897]). Preferable to analogies drawn from other branches of the law is the self-contained \u2018easement of access\u2019 doctrine developed as part of the California law of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u201cEminent domain decisions in other states on compensability of obstructions to navigation vary. The variation is often prompted by the language of the particular state\u2019s constitutional provision. In Pennsylvania, where the Constitution was amended to provide compensation for property \u2018injured\u2019 as well as taken, a wharf owner was awarded damages when a city bridge prevented vessels from passing upstream to his wharf. <em>(In re Construction of Walnut Street Bridge, </em>191 Pa. 153 [43 A. 88], reported <em>sub nom. Cumbes </em>v. <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>191 Pa. 153 [43 A. 88].) In <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Andersons </em>v. <em>Masheter, supra, </em>where the Ohio Constitution limited compensation to a \u2018 taking. \u2019 the court denied recovery under similar facts. One of the Ohio judges dissented, believing that the riparian terminal operator had developed a private right of navigation which was separate from that of the public and was \u2018taken\u2019 from him by the bridge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In New York a similar claim was denied on the theory (imported from the equity and nuisance decisions) that the right of navigation is \u2018 exclusively a public right.' <em>(Marine Air Ways </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>201 Misc. 349, 104 N.Y.S.2d at p. 967, affd. 280 App.Div. 1021, 116 N.Y.S.2d 778.) The Florida courts have adopted the same rationale. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>State Road Dept., supra </em>(Fla.App.) 171 So.2d 25 ; <em>Carmazi </em>v. <em>Board of County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Comrs., supra </em>(Fla.App.) 108 So.2d 318.) None of these decisions considered the easement of access doctrine evolved as part of the California law of eminent domain. None of them considered the balancing of policies implicit in the easement of access doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Both sides seek support in <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Aitken, </em>10 Cal.App.2d 460 [52 P.2d 585], The action was one to condemn littoral rights on a navigable lake whose level would be lowered by the condemning agency\u2019s diversion of tributary streams. The defendant owned shoreline resort property. According to the opinion, the marginal owner\u2019s privilege of boating was not itself compensable, but constituted an element in the valuation of his shoreline property. The case supplies no precedent here, since it involves a destruction of the littoral owner\u2019s private right of access to navigable water directly fronting on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u25a0\u201cThe second major question is posed by the doctrine denying compensation when a littoral owner\u2019s interests in navigable water are damaged through the exercise of the \u2018navigation servitude,\u2019 that is, through the public\u2019s paramount power to control navigable waters in the interest of navigation and commerce. (See generally <em>Miramar Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d 170 [143 P.2d 1] ; 2 Nichols [on Eminent Domain (3d ed.)] <em>op. cit., </em>pp. 247-258.) The state relies upon cases which seemingly extend the doctrine to public improvements which aid commerce as well as those aiding navigation. <em>(Henry Dalton &lt;&amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Oakland, supra, </em>168 Cal. 463, 467 [143 P. 721] <em>\u2022 City of Newport Beach </em>v. <em>Fager, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d at p. 28 [102 P.2d 438].) It points out that the proposed bridges are part of an interstate freeway project which will improve access to Stockton harbor and benefit land and water transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u201cBroad dicta in some of the decisions permit identification of the navigation servitude with the promotion of \u2018commerce\u2019 without express restriction to waterborne commerce. Such statements should not be taken out of context. Decisional law rejects the notion that any project facilitating commerce is <em>ipso facto </em>within the sovereign power over waterways. Nor do the parallel powers of the federal and state governments over navigation include every public project affecting the navigable capacity of water. Although most generalizations entail some peril, the general tenor of the decisions is that the navigation servitude is limited to public works designed to aid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>control navigation, excluding projects for other purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A leading case refers to the navigation servitude as one embracing \u2018such use of the submerged lands and of the waters flowing over them as may be consistent with or demanded by the public right of navigation.\u2019 <em>(Scranton </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>179 U.S. 141,163 [45 L.Ed. 126,137, 21 S.Ct. 48].) Freeways and streets along the waterfront are outside the scope of the navigation servitude <em>(In re City of New York, </em>168 N.Y. 134 [61 N.E. 158, 56 L.R.A. 500] ; <em>In re Jamaica Bay, </em>256 N.Y. 382 [176 N.E. 539] ; <em>Crance </em>v. <em>Slate, supra, </em>205 Misc. 590 [128 N.Y.S.2d 479]) although there is contrary authority <em>(Crary </em>v. <em>State Highway Com., </em>219 Miss. 284 [68 So.2d 468]). Deepening the channel of a stream to prevent overflows harmful to roads and bridges is not an exercise of the navigation power. <em>(Conger </em>v. <em>Pierce County, </em>116 Wash. 27 [198 P. 377,18 A.L.R. 393].) The proposed freeway bridges across the Upper Stockton Channel will not aid its development as a medium of <em>commerce. </em>Rather they will obstruct its navigability, albeit the obstruction will be sanctioned by federal law. (See <em>Southlands Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, </em>211 Cal. 646 [297 P. 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u201cThe state seeks to extend the navigation servitude on the strength of decisions permitting improvements on publicly owned tidelands without compensation for the upland owner\u2019s loss of access, e.g., <em>Miramar Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d 170 [143 P.2d 1] ; <em>Henry Dalton &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Oakland, supra, </em>168 Cal. 463 [143 P. 721] ; <em>City of Newport Beach </em>v. <em>Pager, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d 23 [102 P.2d 438], In those eases the public\u2019s immunity is said to extend not only to tideland projects promoting navigation but to any \u2018lawful use or purpose.' <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hecker, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 823, 840 [4 Cal.Rptr. 334] ; <em>City of Newport Beach </em>v. <em>Fager, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.2d at p. 28 [102 P.2d 438].) The tideland cases turn upon the principle that the littoral rights of an owner whose land adjoins publicly owned tidelands may be terminated by whatever disposition of the tidelands the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>chooses to make. <em>(Miramar Co. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>23 Cal.2d at p. 174 [143 P.2d 1].) Although public tidelands are held in trust for commerce, navigation and fishery, projects on tidelands may have nothing to do with navigation. Subject to the restrictions in statutory grants, public tidelands may be devoted to any use which does not prejudice the public fights of navigation and fishing. <em>(Mallon </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, </em>44 Cal.2d 199, 206 [282 P.2d 481] ; <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>206 Cal. 148, 183, 189 [273 P. 797].) Thus the public\u2019s power to improve its tidelands without compensating littoral owners is not a measure of the navigation servitude when tideland use is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u201cFinally, the state urges that the federal permit to construct the low level bridge project across Upper Stockton C'h\u00e1nnel is \u2018conclusive.\u2019 Perhaps it is, in the limited sense that ,a court may not restrain an obstruction to navigation permitted'by federal law. (See cases cited fn. 4, <em>supra.) </em>The permit is only a declaration of federal assent, not a delegation of power.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Federal assent to the project does not shield the state from the eminent domain provision of its own constitution. \u2018It must be remembered . . . that damage may be inflicted within the meaning of such a constitutional provision by the mere exercise of unquestioned public rights. \u2019 (2 Nichols, op.cit., p. 265.) . \"</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u201cWe conclude that the bridge project is not an exercise of the state\u2019s navigation servitude; that the project will cause compensable damage to plaintiffs\u2019 private properties if, in an appropriate proceeding, a court finds substantial impairment of their respective easements of access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">For these reasons I believe the judgments should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied November 1, 1967.
