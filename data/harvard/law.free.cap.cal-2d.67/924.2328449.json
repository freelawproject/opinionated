They request that the court declare chapter 2 constitutional and instruct the Secretary of State to inform all election officials to follow chapter 2 in preparing for and carrying out the 1968 primary and general elections. We have reviewed chapter 2 in the light of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court governing us herein <em>(Silver </em>v. <em>Reagan </em>(1967) <em>ante, </em>p, 452 [62 Cal.Rptr. 424, 432 P.2d 26]), and we have considered the objections submitted by several citizens. We conclude that chapter 2 is constitutional and that the relief requested should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">The Secretary of State is instructed to inform all election officials to follow chapter 2 in preparing for and carrying out the 1968 primary and general elections. The alternative writs of mandate heretofore issued are discharged and the proceedings are dismissed. \u2022 .....</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
