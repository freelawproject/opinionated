Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkYo\">This is an action under MCLA 213.21, <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 8.11, <em>et seq., </em>for the condemnation of private property for public use. The public improvement proposed here is the construction of the so-called Carrier Creek Interceptor Extension in Delta Township, Eaton County. A resolution declaring the necessity for taking an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>easement across the land of the defendants was adopted by the trustees of the plaintiff on February <em>2, </em>1970. Pursuant to this resolution, an action was commenced in the Circuit Court for Eaton County on the 11th of February, 1970. The resolution described the property to be taken in the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">\"A 50 ft. wide easement, and sufficient area for construction, whose centerline is located approximately as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\"Beginning on the N-S quarter line approximately 407 feet South of the center of Section 22; thence S 63\u00b0-07'-06\" E 423 feet; thence S 19\u00b0-45'-36\" E 170 feet; thence S 22\u00b0-28'-45\" W, 584 feet, thence S 31\u00b0-46'-36\" E approximately 330 feet to a point located 375 feet East of the N-S quarter line; thence South on a line 375 feet East of and parallel to the N-S quarter line an approximate distance of 1053 feet to the South line of Section 22 (Centerline of Mt. Hope Highway) together with manholes and appurtenances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\"This easement is part of the Carrier Creek Interceptor Extension and is in property described as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\"The W 1/2 of the SE 1/4, except the W 300 feet of the South 900 feet and except the East 142 feet of the S 244 feet and except the South 700 feet of the West 300 feet of the East 2066.7 feet, Section 22, and except a highway right of way on the NE corner of Section 22, T4N., R3W., Delta Twp., Eaton County, Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\"Title to the above described property rests in fee in Pearl M. Myers Horst of 4440 North St., Holt, Michigan, survivor of Clarence E. Myers and Pearl M. Myers, husband and Patrick R. Eyde, a married man, whose wife\u2019s name is Mary Ann Eyde, and Michael G. Eyde, a single man, have a land contract vendees interest in the above described property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">The petition said substantially the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The plaintiff proposes to construct a 30-inch pipe sewer through the described easement to provide sewer disposal facilities for the State of Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Secondary Office Complex located in Windsor Township of Eaton County, and it proposes further to use the Carrier Creek Interceptor as a principal sewage disposal system for future development of Delta Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Pursuant to the petition of the plaintiff, and in obedience to the statute, a condemnation jury was empaneled and the matter was tried to the jury, which returned a verdict, awarding compensation to the defendants in the sum of $6,000, after agreeing upon the necessity to take the proposed route for the sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">On January 28, 1971, the circuit court entered a judgment confirming the verdict of the jury and granting the easement as prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed by a divided panel of that Court, and we granted leave to appeal to review the issue addressed by the dissenting member of that panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The factual frame of reference for that issue is as follows: the resolution, of the plaintiff and the petition both state that the property to be taken consists of a 50-foot easement along a designated centerline \"and sufficient area for construction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Prior to the submission of the cause to the jury, counsel met with the trial judge in his chambers and discussed the proposed instructions to the jury. A stenographic record of that conversation was kept and the pertinent portion thereof was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\"><em>\"Mr. Turner [for defendants]: </em>And I think as far as where it says, 'There follows an easement as described in the petition ***.\u2019! think that should say, ' * * * a fifty foot easement, as described in the petition.\u2019 \u2014A fifty foot easement following the route described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>\"The Court: </em>Is this talking about the verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>Down here, your Honor. Fifty foot easement as described in the petition. I think what it should say is, the fifty feet easement following the route described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well, I think it says the same thing, doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\"><em>\"Mr. Glassen [for plaintiff]: </em>That\u2019s what the petition calls for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>No it doesn\u2019t, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well, I\u2019m not going to let the Jury dictate the route.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>No. I say, a fifty feet easement following the route described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Well that says the same thing, the easement as described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-13\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>It doesn\u2019t, because in their petition \u2014 I don\u2019t have it in front of me, now. \u2014 I can go get it.\u2014 They, in their petition, they say, fifty feet easement and whatever land might be needed for construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-14\"><em>\"The Court: </em>In their opening statement they didn\u2019t say they needed any more than fifty feet easement. Their proofs didn\u2019t say anything about more than fifty feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-15\"><em>\"Mr. Glassen: </em>The petition is in here. That\u2019s the wording of the Statute where I took it out of. That\u2019s why it\u2019s in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-16\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Is this a Statutory verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-17\"><em>\"Mr. Glassen: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-18\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>It has to conform to the proofs. You can\u2019t plead a hundred foot easement and then offer proofs on a fifty foot easement and then have the verdict something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-19\">\"You filed the petition. And in your opening statement you said fifty feet and your expert said fifty feet. You put in your proofs and I assumed that\u2019s what you wanted. And that\u2019s what I told my expert to come up with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-20\"><em>\"The Court: </em>All right, \u2014 Following the route as described in the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-21\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>Are you sticking in, fifty feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>\"The Court: </em>No. Just, ' * * * route as described in the petition * * * .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>Your Honor, does that give them more than fifty feet or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\"><em>\"The Court: </em>I guess that\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to cross when I get to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\"><em>\"Mr. Turner: </em>Okay. \u2014 Because, I\u2019m sure it will have to be crossed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The verdict of the jury did not specify the description of the property taken. It is assumed that the reference to statutory verdict and the wording of the statute made by the counsel and the court in chambers is a reference to MCLA 213.31; MSA 8.21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">While that section of the statute and the preceding section, MCLA 213.30; MSA 8.20, both permit a verdict to recite a finding of necessity for \"the proposed improvement\u201d and MCLA 213.31; MSA 8.21, recites only \"the private property described in the petition\u201d in the general portion of the blank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>verdict there described, the petition itself must describe the property to be taken; and the verdict, if not coextensive with the property described in the petition, must specifically describe whatever property is being taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The difficulty in the instant case stems from the failure of the plaintiff to describe the property to be taken in accordance with the mandate of MCLA 213.25; MSA 8.15. The phrase \"sufficient area for construction\u201d is too indefinite. It does not describe any specific piece or parcel of land. It cannot be staked out nor measured and is incapable of being evaluated by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">There is no question of the authority of the plaintiff to condemn private property to provide for the use of land during the construction of a sewer and the storage of its equipment and materials in connection with such construction, but if the plaintiff is desirous of doing so, it must determine, upon the usual conditions of public necessity, the specific area to be used for such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The condemnation of an easement or right-of-way does not automatically carry with it the right to go upon private property during the construction of public improvements or the right to take or use, even temporarily, more land than is defined and described in the petition for the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">A review of the record in this case before us demonstrates that this condemnation action was tried upon the theory that the land to be taken consisted of a 50-foot easement. We are not persuaded that the award of $6,000 was intended to compensate the defendants for the use of any land other than the easement as described by metes and bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Accordingly, we find no necessity for a new trial and we remand this cause to the circuit court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>directions to amend the judgment confirming the jury\u2019s award by deleting therefrom the words \"and sufficient area for construction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The record shows that the easement granted adjoins on a public highway and permits access to the easement at that point. We do not speculate upon the question of whether the interceptor can be constructed without trespass upon the defendants\u2019 lands, but we do hold that no right to go upon the defendants\u2019 land has been acquired in these proceedings except as to such portion of the defendants\u2019 land as falls within the described 50-foot easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Remanded with costs to appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b700-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, Williams, Levin, and M. S. Coleman, JJ., concurred with T. E. Brennan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\"> \"Sec.-11.
