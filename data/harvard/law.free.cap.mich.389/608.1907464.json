She was a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by John Boelma. The Boelma automobile first struck the car driven by defendant Roberta Linkfield, and was then struck by an automobile driven by defendant Jeanne Murphy and owned by defendant Eugene Murphy. At the time of the accident, May 11, 1968, all of the parties were Michigan residents. The Murphys were residents of Michigan at the time of the occurrence of the accident, but prior to the commencement of the lawsuit, the Murphys moved their residence to New Jersey where they presently reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">On May 7, 1970, plaintiffs filed suit against all of the defendants. On August 24, 1970, the Murphys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>filed a motion to quash service of process, to dismiss the action, and for accelerated judgment. On October 7, 1970, the trial court rendered an opinion holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over the defendants Murphy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 23, 1970, an order of accelerated judgment in favor of the defendants was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial holding that there was jurisdiction over the defendants under the long-arm statute, MCLA 600.705; MSA 27A.705.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since this is a question of first impression in our state, we granted leave to appeal. 387 Mich 811 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Two issues have been raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">(1) Whether the plaintiffs properly raised the question of the jurisdiction of the court over defendants pursuant to MCLA 600.705(3); MSA 27A.705(3) at the trial court level?</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">(2) Whether the defendants are subject to jurisdiction under MCLA 600.705(3); MSA 27A.705(3)? Whether the defendants are subject to jurisdiction under MCLA 600.705(1), (2) or (4); MSA 27A.705(1), (2) or (4)?</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">MCLA 600.705; MSA 27A.705 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-10\">\"The existence of any of the following relationships between an individual or his agent and the state shall constitute a sufficient basis of jurisdiction to enable the courts of record of this state to exercise limited personal jurisdiction over such individual and to enable such courts to render personal judgments against such individual or his representative arising out of the act or acts which create any of the following relationships:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>\"(1) The transaction of any business within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">\"(2) The doing or causing any act to be done, or consequences to occur, in the state resulting in an action for tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\"(3) The ownership, use, or possession of any real or tangible personal property situated within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">\"(4) Contracting to insure any person, property, or risk located within this state at the time of contracting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">\"(5) Entering into a contract for services to be rendered or for materials to be furnished in the state by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\"(6) Acting as a director, manager, trustee, or other officer of any corporation incorporated under the laws of, or having its principal place of business within, the state of Michigan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Defendants contend that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed because the case was decided upon a ground that the plaintiffs had not raised in the trial court. Defendants admit that plaintiffs argued there was jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705(2) and RJA \u00a7 705(1) but did not raise the issue of jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">The general rule that issues and claims not advanced in the trial court will not be considered for the first time on appeal has been upheld in Michigan. <em>Maxson v Bay County, </em>290 Mich 86, 89 (1939); <em>Village of St. Clair Shores v Village of Grosse Pointe Woods, </em>319 Mich 372, 375 (1947); <em>Therrian v General Laboratories, Inc, </em>372 Mich 487, 490 (1964). However, a review of the record demonstrates that the issue of jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705(3) was raised in the trial court. The court in passing on the motion was dealing with all of the subsections of RJA \u00a7 705. Defendants\u2019 attorney in arguing the motion for accelerated judgment went through all of the possible grounds for jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705 and contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>they did not apply. He stated concerning RJA \u00a7705(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">\"Now, the third ground, the ownership, use or possession of any real or tangible property situated within the state. Certainly, nothing like that in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney in response stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\"May it please the Court, Your Honor, I take it that what we have boiled this down to, at this point, is the question of whether or not the Long Arm Statute applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Defendants\u2019 attorney did not object to this statement, and it is apparent that plaintiffs were raising all of the possible grounds under RJA \u00a7705 and defendants were disputing that any of the grounds applied. The rule cited above was complied with in this case. The issue raised in the trial court was whether RJA \u00a7 705 conferred jurisdiction over the defendants. That is the same issue on appeal here. It was properly raised in the trial court below and is properly before the Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The basic issue involves the construction of MCLA 600.705(3); MSA 27A.705(3). It is not disputed that at the time of the accident, defendants owned personal property which was titled in Michigan but physically located in Indiana. Plaintiffs have pointed out that defendants had the following contact with the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">(1) The Murphys were residents of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">(2) The Murphy vehicle was licensed by the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>(3) The Murphy vehicle was titled in the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">(4) Defendant, Jeanne Murphy, the driver of the car, Was a driver licensed by the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In <em>Sifers v Horen, </em>385 Mich 195 (1971), the Court upheld the jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705(1) in a contract which resulted from a conversation between a lawyer, who was lecturing in Michigan, and a resident of the State of Michigan. The majority pointed out that the statute used the term \"any\u201d and stated in a footnote that the word \"any\u201d means each and every. 385 Mich 198-199. Likewise the word \"any\u201d is used in RJA \u00a7 705(3). We believe that under the facts of this case the defendants did come within the context of RJA \u00a7 705(3). \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Defendants have cited no case which would indicate that this interpretation of RJA \u00a7 705(3) violates the United States Constitution. As the majority held in <em>Sifers, supra, </em>199:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\"The courts of those states having 'long-arm\u2019 statutes similar to that of Michigan which confer, specifically, limited personal jurisdiction over defendants based on 'the transaction of any business within the state,\u2019 have generally construed their statutes <em>as extending the state\u2019s jurisdiction to the farthest limits permitted by due </em>process. \"(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Due process of law is not violated by permitting jurisdiction over the defendants in this case pursuant to the provisions of RJA \u00a7 705(3), and having thus determined this issue, it is not necessary to determine whether jurisdiction would be conferred under the provisions of subsections (1), (2) or (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>firmed and the cause is remanded for a trial. Costs to plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-4\">T. G. Kavanagh, J., concurred with Swainson, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Williams, J. <em>(to affirm). </em>While I feel Justice Swainson\u2019s opinion reaches the proper conclusion in this case using the Michigan long-arm statute to achieve a reasonable and just common-law result, part II of his opinion introduces into Michigan law the novel concept of \"constructive situs\u201d, a concept which goes well beyond the due process considerations which lead us to assert jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\"><em>International Shoe Co v Washington, </em>326 US 310; 66 S Ct 154; 90 L Ed 95; 161 ALR 1057 (1945), recites the oft-stated requirements for jurisdiction: \"minimum contacts\u201d <em>and </em>\"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d. The facts of this case demonstrate that these tests are met with respect to RJA \u00a7 705(3). Justice Swainson\u2019s opinion notes the significant relationships defendants had with Michigan at the time of the accident. These contacts, together with the fact that <em>all </em>the involved parties were Michigan parties, and that <em>all </em>the involved vehicles were both titled and licensed in Michigan, and given the proximity of this accident to the Michigan border, illustrate the fairness of jurisdiction in Michigan courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">But the rule of \"constructive situs\u201d goes far beyond the facts of the instant case. For example, the concept of \"constructive situs\u201d might be construed to allow the assertion of jurisdiction under RJA \u00a7 705(3) in the context of an Alaskan defendant who purchased her car in Michigan, titled it here, drove it back to Alaska intending to eventually change the title, and injured a California plaintiff in the State of Washington two months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>later. To say as a matter of course that \"constructive situs\u201d principles in such a situation satisfy <em>either </em>the fairness and justice demands or the minimum contacts requirements of <em>International Shoe </em>would be clearly absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The constitutional application of a statute must be determined in every instance in light of the facts of the particular case. Cooley, <em>Constitutional Limitations </em>(1st ed), p 180; <em>Straus v Elless Co, </em>245 Mich 558, 564 (1929); <em>People v Smith, </em>108 Mich 527, 529 (1896). Thus, while I concur in Justice Swainson\u2019s result with respect to the constitutionality of the application of RJA \u00a7 705(3) to the specific facts of the instant case, I note that this decision does <em>not </em>require us to promulgate such a sweeping generalization as \"constructive situs\u201d and that, in many instances, the due process constraints of <em>International Shoe </em>would prohibit the application of such a rule as an exclusive litmus test of jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and M. S. Coleman, J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"> Hereinafter referred to as defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\"> 40 Mich App 131 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"A8et\">T. E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azgl\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I cannot agree that the Michigan long-arm statute is long enough to reach these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\"It is not disputed that at the time of the accident, defendants owned personal property which was titled in Michigan but physically located in Indiana. Plaintiffs have pointed out that defendants had the following contact with the State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">\"(1) The Murphys were residents of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">\"(2) The Murphy vehicle was licensed by the State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">\"(3) The Murphy vehicle was titled in the State of Michigan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\"(4) Defendant, Jeanne Murphy, the driver of the car, was a driver licensed by the State of Michigan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">None of these four \"contacts\u201d are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">It is conceded that the Murphys were residents of Michigan at the time of the accident. The licensing and titling of their vehicle in Michigan were natural incidents of that residence. So, too, the licensing of the driver of the defendants\u2019 vehicle in Michigan was incident to the residence of Jeanne Murphy in Michigan at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The Murphys were not residents of Michigan at the time service of process was attempted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">They were nonresidents, just as surely as if they had never lived in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The majority tacitly concedes the irrelevance of the defendants\u2019 former residence in Michigan. They bottom the claimed jurisdiction upon the long-arm statute, MCLA 600.705(3); MSA 27A.705(3). That statute has to do solely with circumstances under which Michigan courts may exert limited personal jurisdiction over nonresidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">If the defendants were residents of Michigan at the time of service of process, or, even being nonresidents, if they were in fact personally served with process while physically within the State of Michigan, there would be no need to rely upon the long-arm statute. In such case, the Michigan courts would not have mere limited personal jurisdiction, it would have general personal jurisdiction. MCLA 600.701; MSA 27A.701.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">But the defendants were not Michigan residents at the time of service of process. Sometime between the happening of the accident on May 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>1968, and the commencement of the action on May 7,1970, the Murphys moved to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">This fact was not known to the plaintiffs until after the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">On August 3, 1970, plaintiffs filed in the Kent County Circuit Court a proof of service and an affidavit of nonresidency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\"PROOF OF SERVICE AND AFFIDAVIT OF NON-RESIDENCY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">\"(Filed August 3, 1970)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\"PROOF OF SERVICE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZa\">\"State of Michigan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">\"SS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">\"County of Kent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-11\">\"Joel M.
