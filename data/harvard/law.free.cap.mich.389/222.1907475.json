First, is that part of the Michigan kidnapping statute, MCLA 750.349; MSA 28.581, reading \"[a]ny person who wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority shall forcibly * * * confine or imprison any other person within this state against his will * * * shall be guilty of a felony,\u201d constitutionally viable without interpolating asportation or some similar element? Second, could the jury lawfully find asportation under the facts of this case? Third, was the jury lawfully charged?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It is necessary to detail the facts quite thoroughly in order that the elements of the kidnapping statute can be better examined and applied to this case. We adopt the statement of facts in the Court of Appeals\u2019 majority opinion which found them inadequate to sustain asportation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">\"On the morning of October 18, 1965, Adams consumed substantial quantities of alcohol and barbiturates in the company of several other inmates of Jackson Prison. Their conversation turned to the grievances \u2014real or imagined \u2014 which they felt against the prison administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\"Shortly after 11 a.m., Adams and inmate Edward Whitehead went to the main dining hall of the prison where lunch was being served. Adams cut into the serving line ahead of other inmates and was told by a guard to go to the end of the line. Adams directed some verbal abuse at the guard, then proceeded with Whitehead to the prison\u2019s 4-block, a cell block in the northwest portion of the prison. Adams\u2019 conduct aroused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>attention of two unarmed prison guards who followed him to 4-block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\"Because this was the lunch hour, several hundred prisoners were milling about 4-block. The presence of Adams and Whitehead, plus a third inmate, Alvin Shaw, all of whom were highly agitated, as well as the two guards and the hundreds of milling prisoners, led to \u00bf disturbance of uncertain proportions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\"At this time Inspector Joseph Dembosky, the highest ranking uniformed prison officer, was notified of the disturbance in 4-block. He immediately proceeded to the area and thrust himself into the center of the milling crowd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\"Before Inspector Dembosky could take any action, he was seized from behind by inmate Whitehead, who held a knife to his throat. Adams also produced a knife which he used to wave back the prisoners pressing in on Inspector Dembosky and Whitehead. At the trial Inspector Dembosky testified that at this point he said, 'Can\u2019t we talk about this?\u2019 Another witness testified that Dembosky said, 'Can\u2019t we go somewhere and talk about this?\u2019 Adams, Whitehead, and Shaw, all of whom had knives, then accompanied Dembosky at knifepoint out of 4-block into the prison yard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\"There were approximately one thousand inmates in the yard as Dembosky, Whitehead, Shaw, and Adams left 4-block. Inspector Dembosky testified that he felt that there was danger of a riot if the party remained in the yard. He suggested that they go to the prison gymnasium to talk things over. Instead, he was forced to accompany Whitehead, Shaw, and Adams to the prison hospital, which was roughly 1500 feet from the entrance to 4-block. During their journey to the hospital, the armed inmates repeatedly shouted warnings to the heavily-armed tower guards that Inspector Dembosky would be killed if they were fired upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\"Shortly before reaching the hospital building, the group was joined by another inmate, Milton Thomas, who was also armed. Together, immediately after entering the hospital, they seized two guards, a prison doctor, and an inmate elevator operator named Hubbard. Shaw, Whitehead, Thomas, and Adams, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Inspector Dembosky and the other victims, then proceeded to the doctor\u2019s lounge on the fifth floor of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\"Adams and his cohorts erected barricades around the lounge. Over an intercom, they repeatedly demanded to see various prison officials, as well as the warden, to air their grievances. They also demanded to see a newspaper reporter. There were repeated warnings that Inspector Dembosky would be killed if they were fired upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\"During the hours that followed, the armed inmates displayed contradictory behavior toward their captives. The physician was released when Adams ascertained that he had a heart condition. Thomas told the warden to notify the pregnant wife of one of the captive guards that he would not be harmed. Contrastingly, inmate Hubbard was severely beaten by Adams, then released as an example of Adams\u2019 serious intentions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\"A number of prison officials visited the fifth floor landing to discuss grievances. A newspaper reporter summoned to the scene was occupied for almost three hours in recording these grievances. Adams repeatedly expressed his fear of being shot by guards when he left the fifth floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\"After about 5-1/2 hours, Shaw, Whitehead, Thomas, and Adams were persuaded to abandon their barricaded position. Upon being given assurances that they would not be shot, they released their captives unharmed. They then proceeded to the deputy warden\u2019s office, where they surrendered their weapons.\u201d 34 Mich App 546,552-554.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The portion of the statute we are called on to construe is that set forth in the information. Defendant Adams was tried on charges of: \"wilfully, maliciously, and without lawful authority forcibly confining and imprisoning another person * * * within this state and against his will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">At trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty and in a split decision the Court of Appeals reversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Judge Levin for a divided Court held the statute unconstitutionally overbroad unless limitations were interpolated to confine its operative effect. He added this limitation by construing the statute to require an asportation so as to differentiate the offense from false imprisonment. This asportation, he held, must have a significance independent of the underlying crime <em>(i.e., </em>assault) and also must remove the victim from the environment in which he is found and expose him to an increased risk of harm. He held that as a matter of law the instant facts did not constitute such asportation and hence there was no kidnapping. Judge Gillis dissented saying the facts constituted a typical kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">II. THE STATUTE AND ITS CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The text of the statute involved, MCLA 750.349; MSA 28.581, with the part charged in the information in italics reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\"Any person <em>who wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority shall forcibly </em>or secretly <em>conf\u00edne or imprison any other person within this state against his will, </em>or shall forcibly carry or send such person out of this state, or shall forcibly seize or confine, or shall inveigle or kidnap any other person with intent to extort money or other valuable thing thereby or with intent either to cause such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this state against his will, or in any way held to service against his will, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Since this statute is not a model of clarity it is our constitutional duty to give a reasonable construction to it. The cases under the statute provide little guidance, however.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>We agree with Judge Levin\u2019s thoughtful and careful analysis that the sweep of this part of the statute is so broad that it requires the interpolation of the historical concept of asportation to render it constitutional, and it is our duty to do so. See <em>Michigan Towing Association, Inc, v Detroit, </em>370 Mich 440, 456 (1963); State <em>Bar of Michigan v Lansing, </em>361 Mich 185, 195 (1960). Failure to do so would result in denial of due process, <em>Giaccio v Pennsylvania, </em>382 US 399; 86 S Ct 518; 15 L Ed 2d 447 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Where a kidnapping statute does not in terms require asportation or its equivalent, such a requirement has not infrequently been judicially read into and made a part of the definition of the crime.1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">III. THE ASPORTATION REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"AXjx\">At common law, kidnapping was a misdemeanor with well defined elements; first, the forcible abduction of a person from his own country, and second, sending him to another country. This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>considered more than false imprisonment, since kidnapping included all the elements of false imprisonment with the additional element of asportation of the victim outside his own country and beyond the protection of its laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Statutory law, in modifying common-law kidnapping, has abolished the requirement that a national or regional boundary be breached.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, with the abolition of the breached boundary requirement, a lack of precision was created in the law as to the degree of asportation required to transform a lesser crime into kidnapping.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Torn between the common-law rule that a most significant asportation was required, and the obvious legislative intention to broaden the scope of the offense, the courts, virtually without exception, began by endorsing the idea-that any movement, however slight, was sufficient to constitute the asportation element of kidnapping.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Representative of this formulation were the opinions of the California Supreme Court in <em>People v Chessman, </em>38 Cal 2d 166, 192; 238 P2d 1001, 1017 (1951) and <em>People v Wein, </em>50 Cal 2d 383, 399-400; 326 P2d 457, 466 (1958). In <em>Chessman, </em>the defendant forced his victim to move 22 feet to his automobile, where he sexually assaulted her. The Court held that, \"It is. the fact, not the distance, of forcible removal which constitutes kidnapping in this state.\u201d In <em>Wein, </em>the Court applied the <em>Chessman </em>standard to uphold the kidnapping confession of a defendant who forced his victims to move from room to room in their own homes during a series of robberies and rapes. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\"If the section, as interpreted by this court is regarded as too harsh, the remedy is for the Legislature to redefine kidnapping, and not for this court to engraft some uncertain distance limitation. into the plain language of the section.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">However, after a time representative courts perceived that unrestrained recognition of any movement at all as adequate to support kidnapping was letting the pendulum swing to absurd and unconscionable results. The New York Court of Appeals in <em>People v Miles, </em>23 NY2d 527; 297 NYS2d 913, 922; 245 NE2d 688, 695 (1969) in referring to two cases that checked this wide swing said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\"In short, the <em>Levy-Lombardi </em>rule was designed to prevent gross distortion of lesser crimes into a much more serious crime by excess of prosecutorial zeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Speaking to this point Judge Levin for the Court of Appeals majority well said of that part of our kidnapping statute which concerns us here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">\"It is obvious that virtually any assault, any battery, any rape, or any robbery involves some 'intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>confinement\u2019 of the person of the victim. To read the kidnapping statute literally is to convert a misdemeanor, for example, assault and battery, into a capital offense. A literal reading of the kidnapping statute would permit a prosecutor to aggravate the charges against any assailant, robber, of rapist by charging the literal violation of the kidnapping statute which must inevitably accompany each of those offenses.\u201d 34 Mich App 546, 560 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">In 1969, the California Supreme Court overruled its prior constructions in the <em>Chessman-Wein </em>line of cases. <em>People v Daniels, </em>71 Cal 2d 1119, 1139; 459 P2d 225, 238; 80 Cal Rptr 897, 910 (1969) clearly repudiates the doctrine that any movement at all of the victim is sufficient to constitute the asportation element of kidnapping. There the victims had been forced to move about in their apartments during the commission of crimes of robbery and rape. The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\"[W]e hold that the intent of the Legislature * * * was to exclude from [the statute\u2019s] reach not only 'standstill\u2019 robberies * * * but also those in which the <em>movements of the victim are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">And in <em>People v Timmons, 4 </em>Cal 3d 411, 415; 482 P2d 648, 651; 93 Cal Rptr 736, 739 (1971), the Court elaborated on the <em>Daniels </em>standard by finding that forcing a robbery victim to drive five city blocks in order to facilitate the robbery, did not constitute kidnapping. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\"The true test is not mere mileage but whether the movements of the victims 'substantially increase the risk of harm\u2019 beyond that inherent in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>To summarize the two-fold California test, the type of asportation necessary to buttress a kidnapping conviction is that:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">1. The movement element must not be \"merely incidental\u201d to the commission of another underlying lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">2. The movement must \"substantially increase the risk of harm\u201d beyond that inherent in the underlying lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">New York, which in <em>People v Florio, </em>301 NY 46; 92 NE2d 881 (1950) had adopted the any movement rule, had previous to the above cited California cases written a standard similar to the movement \"merely incidental\u201d to a lesser crime rule in California in three cases: <em>People v Levy, </em>15 NY2d 159; 256 NYS2d 793; 204 NE2d 842 (1965); <em>People v Lombardi, </em>20 NY2d 266; 282 NYS2d 519; 229 NE2d 206 (1967); <em>People v Miles, </em>23 NY2d 527; 297 NYS2d 913; 245 NE2d 688 (1969). In the last case, the Court described the limitation of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\"The more complicated nature of the asportation, with changes in purpose and direction, first to a place in New Jersey, and then to New York, for purposes connected with but not directly instrumental to the attempt to kill Brooks, removes this case from the exception of the <em>Levy-Lombardi </em>rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">\"In the <em>Levy </em>and <em>Lombardi </em>cases, * * * , the restraint and asportation were parts of the crimes ultimately committed. * * * It is this kind of factual merger with the ultimate crime of the preliminary, preparatory, or concurrent action that the rule is designed to recognize, and thus prevent unnatural elevation of the 'true crime\u2019 to be charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\"Moreover, the rule has no purpose of ignoring as independent crimes alternative or optional means used in committing another crime, which, * * * , constitute and should constitute a separately cognizable offense. <em>Nor was the Levy-Lombardi rule intended to exclude </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>from the 'traditional\u2019 or \u2019conventional' kidnapping abductions designed to effect extortions or accomplish murder. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id, </em>23 NY2d 527, 539-540; 297 NYS2d 913, 921-922; 245 NE2d 688, 694.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">New York established three rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">1. The movement element must not be \"merely incidental\u201d to the commission of another underlying lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">2. The movement of a \"more complicated nature\u201d may sustain a kidnapping charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">3. Statutory kidnapping continues to include \"traditional\u201d or \"conventional\u201d kidnapping abductions designed to effect extortions or accomplish murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The first or \"merely incidental\u201d rule is common to New York and California', namely if the movement is merely incidental to the commission of another underlying lesser crime, it will not sustain kidnapping. We feel that this is the critical and significant criterion and regard the other two criteria illustrative and not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">IV. A MICHIGAN ASPORTATION STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In formulating its asportation standard, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that, as in the California cases of <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Timmons, </em>to constitute kidnapping the asportation must \"substantially\u201d increase \"the risk that the victim may suffer significant physical injuries over and above those to which a victim of the underlying crime is normally exposed\u201d and also devised its own \"change of environment\u201d rule. 34 Mich App 567. We hold that these are not determinative criteria to be applied in deciding the sufficiency of the asportation. We hold that it is sufficient that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>confinement and asportation are not merely incidental to the lesser underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Judge Levin for the Court of Appeals in an otherwise exemplary opinion adopted a two sentence standard for movement to constitute asportation sufficient to sustain kidnapping in the instant case. We agree with the first sentence although we stated it differently above. We do not agree with the second sentence nor believe it supported by the cases or reason. Part of the problem is a definition of \"environment\u201d \u2014 in one sense you can change the environment of the smallest room by intruding a criminal with a weapon, although in another sense it is still the same room. The two sentence standard established by Judge Levin is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\"We have concluded that under the kidnapping statute a movement of the victim does not constitute an asportation unless it has significance independent of the assault. And, unless the victim is removed from the environment where he is found, the consequences of the movement itself to the victim are not independently significant from the assault \u2014 the movement does not manifest the commission of a separate crime \u2014 and punishment for injury to the victim must be founded upon crimes other than kidnapping.\u201d <em>Id, </em>34 Mich App 568.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As above indicated we hold the movement element must not be merely incidental to the commission of a lesser underlying crime, <em>i.e., </em>it must be incidental to the commission of the kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">What is a kidnapping? This concept is not always too well defined but two New York cases at least specify some things that are kidnapping, as does the second half of the Michigan statute. We have already quoted the following from <em>People v Miles, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\"Nor was the <em>Levy-Lombardi </em>rule intended to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>from the 'traditional\u2019 or 'conventional\u2019 kidnapping abductions designed to effect extortions or accomplish murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The second pertinent quotation is from <em>People v Levy, supra, </em>and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\"><em>'!People v Black, </em>18 AD 2d 719 [; 236 NYS2d 240 (1962)], is an illustration of separately established crimes of robbery and kidnapping: One of the victims of the robbery was taken along <em>as a hostage </em>to another State and held for considerable time, long after the robbery had been completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In other words, whatever else kidnapping may or may not include, these two New York cases focus on extortions, murder, and taking a hostage. Murder is not pertinent to this case but extortion and taking a hostage may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">At this point the Michigan kidnapping statute in full is instructive although it is recognized that the latter half relative to extortion and holding \"to service against his will\u201d were not specifically pled. The statutory language is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\"Any person who wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority shall forcibly or secretly confine or imprison any other person within this state against his will, or shall forcibly carry or send such person out of this state, or shall forcibly, seize or confine, or shall inveigle or kidnap any other person with intent to extort money or other valuable thing thereby or with intent either to cause such person to be secretly confined or imprisoned in this state against his will, or in any way held to service against his will, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.\u201d MCLA 750.349; MSA 28.581.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">In interpreting the first part of the Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>kidnapping statute to avoid constitutional over-breadth the following factors are to be considered:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">1. Since the language of the first part of the kidnapping statute by itself is so general as to be susceptible of defining minor crimes as well as kidnapping, where appropriate, asportation must be interpolated to achieve the Legislature\u2019s intention to define the major crime of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">2. The movement element is not sufficient if it is \"merely incidental\u201d to the commission of another underlying lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">3. If the underlying crime involves murder, extortion or taking a hostage, movement incidental thereto is generally sufficient to establish a valid statutory kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">4. If the movement adds either a greater danger or threat thereof, that is a factor in considering whether the movement adequately constitutes the necessary legal asportation, but there could be asportation without this element of additional danger so long as the movement was incidental to a kidnapping and not a lesser crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">5. Where appropriate, secret confinement or some other non-movement factor may supply a necessary alternative to asportation to complete stat- \u2022 utory kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">6. Whether or not a particular movement constitutes statutory asportation or whether there is an appropriate alternative element must be determined from all the circumstances under the standards set out above and is a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">\"Jurors are the sole judges of the facts and neither the trial court nor this court can interfere with their exercise of that right.\u201d <em>People v Miller, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>301 Mich 93, 100 (1942). And in <em>People v Putnam, </em>323 Mich 374, 379 (1948), Justice Boyles stated, \"It is not the province of the Court to usurp the proper functions of the jury in determining issues of fact. It is not for the Court to say that the jury would have so found, if the issue had been submitted to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">V. THE STANDARDS APPLIED TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">As indicated above, the factual circumstances of the case present a jury question under proper instructions based on the standards set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Judge Levin was in his opinion, as we now are, faced with the dilemma of analyzing how the known facts in this case fit into the legal standards just established for the benefit of judicial review without presuming upon the jury\u2019s function. Judge Levin seized one horn of the dilemma and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\"Under the circumstances we are satisfied that the evidence does not support a finding that the movement had significance adverse to Inspector Dembosky independent of the continuing assault.\u201d 34 Mich App 571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Unfortunately since we disagree with this mixed law and fact conclusion, we are compelled to make analysis of the facts beyond what we would have wished giving due respect to the jury\u2019s function.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Judge Levin assumed, or found, that the lesser underlying crime was a \"continuing assault\u201d and that the movement was not \"independent\u201d of it. We can visualize at least three different possible underlying crimes to which the movement might relate rather than just this one. These three possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>bilities are: assault, common-law confinement or false imprisonment, and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">As to assault Judge Levin has written to that. If the jury had been properly instructed, it might or might not have chosen to regard this as the real crime involved. Depending upon the jury\u2019s view of what the assault really was, the asportation might or might not be incidental to it rather than to a kidnapping, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As to common-law unlawful confinement or false imprisonment, the jury might well find that the real crime had these earmarks more than an assault, for it might be difficult for the jury to find that the assault element constituted the real crime as there was no apparent motive for the assault in the sense of acting to harm Inspector Dembosky, as, if that were the motive, no direct physical harm was actually inflicted although there was ample opportunity to do so. If confinement or false imprisonment appeared to be the real underlying crime, then the question for the jury would be, was the movement such as to constitute the crime of kidnapping. Since kidnapping and unlawful confinement and false imprisonment have essentially common elements the character of the movement might be determinative as to whether a kidnapping existed. Because of the common elements it is difficult to clarify the situation by reliance on whether the movement was incidental to the lesser underlying crime or to kidnapping and the character and purpose of the movement might be vitally important. What this factor might be we shall consider as we turn to the third possibility, kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">As we describe the kidnapping possibility, it is useful to bear in mind the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 definition of \"traditional\u201d or \"conven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tional\u201d kidnapping focusing on extortion, murder or taking hostage. Did the charged confinement here relate more to confinement for the sake of confinement or for the sake of assault or more to the idea of extortion, murder or taking hostage? A jury would not easily find murder in the picture, but might find that extortion or taking hostage was clearly in the picture more so than assault or confinement for confinement. The scenario opens with the defendant complaining about grievances and ends with his discussing them with the warden, the press and others. Grievances might be found by a jury to be the reason for the charged confinement and actual movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Was Dembosky taken hostage and was his body\u2019s safety used as a fulcrum to attempt to lever a hearing and hopefully redress of grievances? Was Inspector Dembosky moved to the hospital room insulated from sniper fire, where ingress and egress of officials and press could be controlled by defendant and where there was a telephone with which defendant could communicate safely with prison officials and the outside world to attempt to extort redress of grievances? If these questions were answered affirmatively on the facts by the jurors under proper instructions, the underlying crime might be a kidnapping of taking Inspector Dembosky as a hostage to extort more favorable conditions and the movement to the secluded telephone-supplied room as incidental not to any lesser crime but to a kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">It would be the function of the jury to weigh the evidence presented to it in the light of the court\u2019s charge in order to determine whether the real crime herein involved was a minor one and the movement incidental thereto, or whether the real crime did indeed involve the taking of a hostage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>order to extort something of value and that the movement was an asportation incidental to committing a kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">VI. SUFFICIENCY OF THE INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Having determined that in this case in addition to confinement there must be asportation, we turn to the question of the sufficiency of the information. Was the information incomplete in that it did not specifically charge asportation?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The New York case of <em>People v Weiss, </em>252 App Div 463, 467-468; 300 NYS 249, 254-255 (1937) reversed on other grounds 276 NY 384; 12 NE2d 514 (1938) is instructive.* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellants were convicted of the crime of kidnapping under New York law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In discussing the appellants\u2019 attack on the indictment, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">\"Appellants attack the sufficiency of the indictment and contend that under the statute a specific criminal intent to cause the victim to be confined is an essential element of the crime of kidnapping and must be pleaded. They urge that since the indictment fails to allege such specific intent it is insufficient in law. There can be no doubt that, when a particular intent accompanying an act is requisite to constitute a crime, it <em>should be alleged. </em>It is likewise true that, under the statute, to constitute the crime of kidnapping there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>must be the willful and unlawful seizing of a person against his will with intent to cause him to be confined, imprisoned, or detained within the state. People v. Hope, 257 N.Y. 147-150, 152, 177 N.E. 402, 403 [1931]; Hadden v. People, 25 N.Y. 373 [1862]. In People v. Hope, supra, there are dicta to the effect that the intent with which the victim was seized and confined must be pleaded. I believe the absence of such an allegation is not fatal where, as here, it is alleged that on February 14th Wendel was seized against his will and without authority of law and actually confined and detained against his will and without authority of l\u00e1w until February 24th. The statute requires seizure with intent to confine. Seizure alone is not sufficient. But where seizure and actual confinement against the victim\u2019s will and without authority of law are alleged, the unlawful intent appears, it is implicit in the indictment, and the crime defined by the statute is sufficiently pleaded; and if those facts are established the crime is proven. <em>In determining the sufficiency of an indictment the test is: Does it identify the charge against the defendant so that his conviction or acquittal will bar a subsequent charge for the same offense; does it notify him of the nature and character of the crime with which he is charged so as to enable him to prepare his defense and to permit the court to pronounce judgment according to the right of the case? </em>People v. Farson, 244 N.Y. 413, 155 N.E. 724 [1927]; People v. Williams, 243 N.Y. 162, 153 N.E. 35 [1926], In applying this test courts should be liberal, not technical. Thus construed, the indictment is sufficient and the defendants were not prejudiced by the failure to plead the crime charged in the identical words of the statute. To hold otherwise would be to sacrifice substance to form and 'abandon much that has been accomplished to simplify procedure upon criminal trials.\u2019 People v. Marcus, 235 App. Div. 397, 400; 257 N.Y.S. 424, 428 [1932].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In applying the <em>Weiss </em>test, we hold that the information was sufficient but not exactly a standard for emulation. The charge against defendant was based on the wording of the kidnapping stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ute. The exact language of the statute was used. Defendant knew of the nature and character of the crime he was charged with. If the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of conviction is affirmed by this Court, he will not be able to be again charged with this crime of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">There is no contradiction between the <em>Weiss </em>test and 1963 Const, art 1, \u00a7 20 which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\"In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right * * * ; to be informed of the nature of the accusation; * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">See <em>Haskins v Ralston, </em>69 Mich 63, 67 (1888). Indeed <em>Weiss </em>merely fleshes out the skeletal constitutional minimum. Since defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated, any other minor defects in the information were waived by the pleadings. <em>People v Collins, </em>380 Mich 131 (1968); <em>In re Hoffman, </em>326 Mich 368 (1949). As was stated by justice Brennan in <em>Collins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">\"[T]his Court will not regard as the basis for a new trial or reversal of a conviction any <em>procedural error </em>which does not result in a miscarriage of justice. GCR 1963, 529; CL 1948, \u00a7 769.26.\u201d 380 Mich 135. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">VII. SUFFICIENCY OF THE CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The purpose of the court\u2019s charge to the jury is to explain the issues and the legal principles applicable to the facts in issue. The trial judge did not allude to asportation in his charge. He charged the jury:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\"While the testimony in this case has covered a wide range of facts and circumstances, the real issues for your determination are rather narrow ones and they may be stated briefly as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\"Did the defendant wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority forcibly confine or imprison Inspector Dembosky against his will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\"Or did the defendant aid and abet others in wilfully, maliciously and without lawful authority forcibly confining or imprisoning Inspector Dembosky against his will?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As decided above, asportation is a question of fact. It is also an essential element of the crime. \"It is the duty of a trial court in charging a jury as to the elements of an offense, and what must be proved in order to establish such elements, to do so accurately.\u201d <em>People v Tolewitzke, </em>332 Mich 455, 458 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Considering the charge as an entity, it was inadequate. The jury charge should have included the question of whether the necessary asportation was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The trial court is reversed, the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

No objection to the charge was made by defense counsel with reference to the question of asportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On appeal, five errors were assigned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\"I.

Did the trial court commit prejudicial error in refusing to give a requested instruction on a lesser includable offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The Court of Appeals, on its own motion, requested briefing of two additional issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-12\">\"1. Whether, under MCLA \u00a7750.349 [MSA 28.581], kidnapping can be committed without either an asportation or secret confinement of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-13\">\"2. If an asportation is required, do the facts in the instant case constitute an asportation sufficient to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tablish the offense of kidnapping? See <em>People v Levy </em>(1965), 15 NY2d 159 (256 NYS2d 793); and <em>People v Daniels </em>(1969), 71 AC 1165 (80 Cal Rptr 897).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In response to the requested briefing, defendant filed a supplemental brief, which concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\"It is the contention of the defendant-appellant that the facts in the instant case do not constitute asportation necessary to establish the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\"The defendant-appellant does admit that the facts in the case at bar would not support a <em>Levy-Daniels </em>argument. The assignment of error that the trial judge refused to grant instructions as to a lesser included offense is herein reiterated; but the defendant-appellant does not argue that the real crime committed in this case was felonious assault and not kidnapping. Defendant-appellant has no argument with the People\u2019s opinion that if a reversal of this conviction is in order that <em>People v. Shaw </em>(1968), 11 Mich. App. 255, 160 N.W. 2d 761 should also be reconsidered and overruled. The facts upon which <em>Shaws\u2019 </em>plea was affirmed are the same which buttress Adams\u2019 conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\"The reason cited by defendant-appellant for the reversal of both cases is this: The asportation necessary to convict in a kidnapping situation cannot possibly be present where all movement of the victim by the kidnapper had its origin and terminus wholly within the confines of a walled enclosure. The facts in the instant case are indisputed. Inspector Dembosky\u2019s movements initiated by <em>Adams, et al. </em>began and ended all within the confines of the State Prison of Southern Michigan. Defendant-appellant cites no cases for this proposition, but can put forward no better argument after an exhaustive review of the <em>Levy-Daniels </em>and related cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Despite defendant\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the bench-suggested line of argument, the Court of Appeals concluded that the facts did not support an asportation sufficient to warrant conviction of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Now this Court injects still another unsolicited dimension to the lawsuit. We reverse for new trial upon a claimed omission from the trial court\u2019s instruction never brought to the attention of the trial judge either by requested instruction or objection to the charge; never briefed nor argued in the Court of Appeals by the litigants either before or after the enlargement of the issues by that Court, <em>sua sponte; </em>and never argued nor briefed in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The issue of asportation was not before the Court of Appeals. The sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s instruction is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Perhaps the reason why no such issues were made at trial was the simple fact that no one connected with the case doubted that the seizure of the prison official, his forced march at knife point for over a quarter of a mile, and his confinement under guard as a hostage for several hours, constituted kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The disputed issue in this case was not whether Inspector Dembosky was kidnapped. It was whether Otis Adams was one of those who kidnapped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">By attempting to use this lawsuit as a vehicle to pronounce a new definition of the crime, we force a square peg into a round hole.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">By sending it b\u00e1ck for new trial, we impose upon able counsel on both sides and upon the trial court a brand new lawsuit, to be tried upon a brand new theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-10\">Levin and M.
