A woman was brutally raped and murder attempted. After the woman was found in critical condition she was questioned at the hospital by various persons as to the identity of her assailant. Based on that information, a suspect was arrested and a Polaroid shot taken of him. This Polaroid along with a number of \"mug shots\u201d was under various times and circumstances shown to the victim. In each case she identified the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The heart of the prosecution\u2019s case was identification of the defendant by the victim. At trial defendant objected to identification being made by the victim on the basis of <em>United States v Wade </em>and successor cases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of the character of the photo showup and because there had been no lawyer present at the photo showups. The issue in the case therefore is what the requirements of <em>Wade </em>and successor cases are and whether they were satisfied by the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">.

The victim had seen the defendant four or five times at the bar where she worked. On the night of the assault, the victim had seen but was not with the defendant in the bar. The accused left the bar prior to the \"last call\u201d. The victim left with a Mr. Whitman after closing and had \"coffee\u201d with him at her home until 3:30 when she left to see another male friend. Mr. Whitman said he saw a red car with fins and no headlights containing only the driver execute a U-turn and then follow the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">En route, the victim testified she stopped or was stopped. Thereafter she was personally struck, driven away in a red car with fins, and later assaulted. People\u2019s proofs included evidence of the victim\u2019s fingerprints on defendant\u2019s car, blood of her type on the car\u2019s seat and matching paint smears in damaged areas on the victim\u2019s and defendant\u2019s cars. There was also testimony placing the defendant and his car at a gas station near the victim\u2019s home just after 2 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">PRE-SURGERY</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">When found injured in a field the following morning, an ambulance was called and the ambulance driver, while preparing the victim for transport to the hospital, asked whether she had been in an accident and the victim responded \"uh uh\u201d (no); whether she had been beaten \u2014 \"uh huh\u201d (yes); whether she had been raped \u2014 \"uh huh\u201d (yes). The victim was taken to Midland Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Deputy Sheriff Gransden had been at the scene and followed the ambulance back to the hospital and was in the emergency room while the victim was being examined before surgery. He questioned her and her responses were by nodding her head \"yes\u201d or \"no\u201d and by writing on the back of a surgical glove envelope. She nodded \"no\u201d when asked if she knew assailant\u2019s name. She wrote her name on a pad. Asked again about the assailant she wrote \"he comes in where I work. Aladdin Bar Bay City\u201d. The victim was taken to X-ray before surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Present in the X-ray room were a nurse and the ambulance driver. The ambulance driver questioned the victim about her assailant further and her responses were by nodding her head \"yes\u201d or \"no\u201d. He asked whether he were white \u2014 \"no\u201d; colored \u2014 \"no\u201d; Mexican \u2014 \"no\u201d; Indian? \u2014 here she responded by voice and had to say the word several times before the ambulance driver and the nurse present both understood. The word was \"Indian\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\"It was a positive, she said Indian and she was very affirmative about the negatives (referring to white, colored, etc.) if you understand what I mean. She shook her head as best she could when I asked the questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The ambulance driver continued to ask whether the assailant had brown hair? \u2014 \"no\u201d; black hair?\u2014 \"yes\u201d; whether they had been friends? \u2014 \"no\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">POST SURGERY MEETING 8:15 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The victim was taken to surgery sometime after the questioning in the X-ray room and there was no further communication with her until 8:15 that evening after surgery in her hospital room. Pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ent for the questioning were Deputy Sheriff Grans-den, Sheriff\u2019s Matron Theisen, the prosecutor and a nurse. The victim was unable to talk but could nod her head and give gestures with her hands. Matron Theisen was there to take notes and later testified as to the questioning. Deputy Sheriff Gransden went through a series of names picked at random (including defendant\u2019s name) to see if she could pick out any certain name. (Frederick, James, Jim.) She was also asked \"Anderson\u201d but the record is unclear as to her response to that. When the name \"Frank\u201d was mentioned there was a definite response and she waved her hands around. Asked if she saw the car she nodded \"yes\u201d. Asked whether attacked in her car she shook her head no. Asked whether it was a pickup truck she shook her head no. She nodded yes when asked if it was a car. Deputy Gransden then went through four colors of cars, blue, black, white, red. She nodded yes to red. Deputy Gransden went through the different makes of cars and when he mentioned \"Dodge\u201d she indicated yes. Apparently by the same process it was established that the assailant was in the neighborhood of 6 feet, somewhere around 200 pounds and an Indian. Asked whether she could identify the person who attacked her she nodded her head \"yes\u201d. There were no pictures shown to the victim at this 8:15 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">POST SURGERY MEETING 11 P.M. \u2014 FIRST PHOTO LINEUP</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The defendant was arrested at about 9:30 p.m. and between 10 and 10:30 a black-and-white Polaroid photograph was taken of him by a Bay City officer. Deputy Gransden drove to Bay City, picked up the picture and returned to Midland, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>called ahead to have Matron Theisen select other pictures from the files for a photo showup. Deputy Gransden and Matron Theisen returned to the victim\u2019s hospital room at 11 p.m. with six pictures, including the Polaroid of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Defendant\u2019s picture was a Polaroid shot with perforated edges and depicted a single head-on view. The other five pictures were standard \"mug shots\u201d depicting front and side views. Each picture had prison numbers superimposed over the front view and an arrest card was attached to each picture except that of the defendant. Before being shown the pictures, the victim was told there was a suspect and his picture was included in those she would be shown. The pictures were shown to the victim individually with defendant\u2019s picture shown last. The victim identified defendant as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">DAY AFTER SURGERY \u2014 SECOND PHOTO-LINEUP</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">On the following day, the prosecutor conducted a \"lineup\u201d with the same pictures shown individually in the same sequence. The victim again selected defendant\u2019s photograph as pictorial identification of her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">THREE DAYS PRIOR TO PRELIMINARY EXAM \u2014THIRD PHOTO-LINEUP</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Three days prior to the preliminary examination a third photo lineup was conducted by Officer Whipple for the purported reason of making a \"positive identification\u201d. On this occasion the photos were given to her in folders.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">Counsel had been appointed after the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>lineup but the third lineup was accomplished without notice to counsel. On this occasion there were 12 pictures shown her, all except that of defendant being front and side views while that of defendant was the same polaroid photograph shown earlier. Each photograph, including that of defendant, had paper covering the place where prison identification numbers could have been seen. On this occasion the victim again identified Anderson. Officer Whipple said the reason he made folders as described was that it would have been \"suggestive\u201d otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Timely and continuous objections by defendant\u2019s counsel to the victim\u2019s in-court identification were made at the preliminary examination, pretrial motions and by oral trial objections. On the motion to suppress there was testimony by Dr. Russell Leach, a psychiatrist. A hypothetical question recited the facts up to and until the first photo show but excluded the fact that the victim had previously seen defendant in the bar numerous times. The doctor testified that it was \"highly probable\u201d that the first identification was suggestive; that as to the second identification it was \"possible that it would be highly probable\u201d to be suggestive. As to the in-court identification, however, the testimony is less clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\"><em>\"Q. </em>And, some twenty days later, an in-court identification of the man as the man who had, in fact, attacked her, a man who she had seen time and again, a face she would never forget, would you say that this in-court identification was the product of suggestion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\"><em>\u201dA. </em>I don\u2019t believe I can say so, under those conditions; as that is twenty-three days later. I don\u2019t think I could apply suggestion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>SECURITY PRECAUTIONS ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">During testimony as to matching paint smears on the victim\u2019s and defendant\u2019s autos, the jury and the court moved to the courthouse parking lot where both cars were. To assure defendant\u2019s presence without creating prejudice the trial judge ordered the defendant be taken down to the parking lot before the jury came out, his handcuffs removed, and that he be put in a car with the window down. Apparently the jury came to the courthouse parking lot too soon, and, rather than make a display of removing the handcuffs, the officer placed the defendant in the rear seat of the automobile with his arms handcuffed behind his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">HOSPITAL PHOTOS ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Over objection of defendant four photos taken by the hospital for teaching purposes were introduced in evidence depicting the victim on the operating table. There had previously been oral testimony as to victim\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Defendant claimed the only issue in the case was identification of the assailant and the photos were immaterial. On oral argument the people admit that the only purpose for using the photos was to show the victim\u2019s condition in order to establish that she would have died without treatment. They contend, however, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Defendant was found guilty by the jury and sentenced to life. The Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>People v Anderson, </em>29 Mich App 578 (1971). We granted leave, 384 Mich 838 (1971), primarily to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>consider the issues relating to eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">II. THE <em>WADE </em>RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In <em>United States v Wade, </em>388 US 218; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967), the United States Supreme Court in a \"post-indictment\u201d case held that, because of the established dangers of irreparable misidentification coupled with the inability to accurately reconstruct what happens at corporeal lineups, an accused in a Federal prosecution is entitled to counsel at a pretrial lineup in order to protect his right to meaningfully cross-examine the identifying witness at trial. Unless and until there is appropriate legislation or executive action, where a lineup is held without counsel, any subsequent in-court identification must be preceded by an evidentiary hearing out of the presence of the jury at which the prosecution must show by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification has a basis independent of the illegal lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In <em>Gilbert v California, </em>388 US 263; 87 S Ct 1951; 18 L Ed 2d 1178 (1967), in a \"post-indictment\u201d case the Court, applying <em>Wade </em>to a state prosecution, held as above regarding in-court identifications and held further that where the corporeal lineup was had without counsel, any direct evidence relating to the prior, pretrial lineup identification is per se inadmissible. Thus, <em>Wade, </em>which only required a foundation for admissibility of identification evidence, was extended to a separate class of \"hearsay\u201d evidence to provide a per se exclusionary rule <em>regardless of adequate foundation. </em>If evidence has been improperly admitted in violation of constitutional rights, a conviction must be reversed unless it is determined beyond a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sonable doubt that such evidence did not affect the verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In <em>Stovall v Denno, 388 </em>US 293; 87 S Ct 1967; 18 L Ed 2d 1199 (1967), the Court held in a \"preindictment\u201d case that although <em>Wade </em>was not to be retroactive in its application, there was an independent ground of constitutional attack where the procedures used are so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that it amounts to a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In <em>Simmons v United States, </em>390 US 377; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968), the principles of <em>Stovall </em>were applied to the identification by photograph of an unapprehended suspect. The Court noted that the right to counsel was not raised but recognized the dangers in photographic identification. Because of the widespread and effective use of initial identification by photograph from the standpoint of apprehending offenders and avoiding needless arrests of innocent suspects, however, the Court was unwilling to <em>prohibit </em>altogether the <em>initial </em>identification of unapprehended suspects by photograph but would subject all such permissible photographic identification to the <em>Stovall </em>standard of due process. Consequently, the Court said that convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following initial identification by photograph would be set aside on that ground only if the procedures used were so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">These cases develop the following pretrial identification rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">1. Defendant is entitled to counsel at pretrial identification procedures <em>(Wade).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>2. Unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification procedures deny due process <em>(Stovall).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">3. If there was no counsel at the pretrial identification or if the procedures were unnecessarily suggestive or conducive to irreparable misidentification, then before an <em>in-court </em>identification may be received in evidence, the trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing out of the presence of the jury at which the people must show by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification had a basis independent of the prior identification procedure <em>(Wade).</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">4. Direct testimonial evidence relating to the pretrial out-of-court identification. is per se excluded (Gilbert).<footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">5. On appeal, if the Court finds that the evidence was erroneously admitted under the above standards, the Court must reverse the conviction and order a new trial unless it is able to declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the in-court identification did not affect the verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">6. If the record is not complete and a determination either way cannot be made, the Court should vacate the conviction and remand to the trial court for a hearing on the issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In passing it should be said that the per se exclusionary rule of <em>Gilbert </em>(#4 above) is not here at issue, because no direct testimony was intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>duced by the people in <em>Anderson </em>as to the pretrial out-of-court photographic identification of the defendant. As the statement of facts shows, however, all of the information did come in on cross-examination by defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\"><em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682; 92 S Ct 1877; 32 L Ed 2d 411 (1972), modifies only part of the per se exclusionary rule of <em>Gilbert. </em>In a <em>plurality opinion </em>the per se exclusionary rule was held not to apply to testimony concerning <em>\"pre-indictment\u201d out-of-court corporeal identification procedures. </em>Since there is no agreement by a majority of the United States Supreme Court regarding the limitation of right to counsel in <em>Kirby, </em>we are not permitted to follow <em>Kirby </em>as authoritative precedent on the question of counsel. The clear rule in Michigan is that a majority of the Court must agree on a ground for decision in order to make that binding precedent for future cases. If there is merely a majority for a particular result, then the parties to the case are bound by the judgment but the case is not authority beyond the immediate parties. See <em>Hileman v Indreica, </em>385 Mich 1, 7, fn 1 (1971); <em>In re Curzenski Estate, </em>384 Mich 334, 335, fn 1 (1971); <em>Breckon v Franklin Fuel Co, </em>383 Mich 251, 278-279 (1970); <em>Kalamazoo v Crawford, </em>154 Mich 58, 60 (1908); <em>Corporation &amp; Securities Commission v McLouth Steel Corp, </em>7 Mich App 410, 412 (1967); <em>Corporation &amp; Securities Commission v American Motors Corp, </em>4 Mich App 65, 67 (1966); 7 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Courts, \u00a7\u00a7 51-53 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The same rules of decision govern the permissible construction by states of decisions of the United States Supreme Court. In <em>United States v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Pink, 315 US 203, 216; 62 S Ct 552; 86 L Ed 796 (1942), the rule is well summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\"[T]he lack of agreement by a majority of the Court on the principles of law involved prevents it [a case claimed to be determinative of <em>Pink] </em>from being an authoritative determination for other cases.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Applying these well-settled constructional mandates to <em>Kirby </em>we see that a majority of the Court agreed on a result only, that the per se exclusionary rule of <em>Gilbert </em>did not apply to the case before them. There was no \"opinion of the Court\u201d, but the \"judgment\u201d of the Court was to affirm the Illinois Court of Appeals. The most liberal construction of these rules might suggest that the <em>Kirby </em>case \"holds\u201d that the per se <em>exclusionary rule </em>of <em>Gilbert </em>does not apply in <em>\"pre-indictment\u201d </em>cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Constitutional rules of construction do not permit us to read <em>Kirby </em>as abrogating the preindictment requirements for counsel and the other rules of <em>Wade, Gilbert, Stovall </em>and <em>Simmons, </em>by all of which we are still bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">This Court and the Court of Appeals have both consistently applied the <em>Wade </em>requirements to <em>\"pre-indictment\u201d corporeal identi\u00f1cation procedures. </em>See <em>People v Schumacher, </em>29 Mich App 594 (1971), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>384 Mich 831 (1971); <em>People v Ranes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>385 Mich 234, 242 (1971); <em>People v Hutton, </em>21 Mich App 312, 320 ff (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">III. \u2014PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The psycho-legal fundamentals in this case derive from the tension between four factors involved in eyewitness identification in criminal cases. The four factors are:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">1. The natural and usually necessary reliance on eyewitness identification of defendants by the police and prosecution;</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">2. The scientifically and judicially recognized fact that there are serious limitations on the reliability of eyewitness identification of defendants;</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">3. The scientifically and judicially recognized fact that frequently employed police and prosecution procedures often (and frequently unintentionally) mislead eyewitnesses into misidentification of the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">4. The historical and legal fact that a significant number of innocent people have been convicted of crimes they did not commit and the real criminal was left at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">The first factor, the reliance on eyewitness identification of defendants by the police and prosecution, is too well understood to require review or comment. Since the United States Supreme Court has specifically recognized each of the other factors, this Court can reasonably take judicial notice of them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">However, these four factors and the United States Supreme Court discussions based on them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>have such widespread and deep-rooted impact on everyday police work, prosecution and criminal procedure rules that this opinion must briefly consider the scientific and historical data behind the last three factors in order to promote the fullest understanding and acceptance of the resulting rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">For the purpose of our decision, rather than unduly extend this opinion with elaborate examination and documentation of the scientific support for the limitations on the reliability of eyewitness identification and the significant legal record of proven misidentification, we will discuss the matter only briefly. If, however, anyone has questions about these propositions or wants to study the scientific and historical background of these propositions further, the results of our research, particularly the extensive references and bibliography, are annexed to this opinion as Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The second factor, the scientific fact that there are serious limitations on the reliability of eyewitness identification of defendants, was specifically recognized by the United States Supreme Court when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\"The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The conclusions of <em>Wade </em>rested on writings that depend either upon scientific analysis or the earlier works of scientists in the field which demonstrate the serious limitations of eyewitness identifications by the results of experiments. These results may at first blush be surprising but on just a little reflection make sense and fall right into line with everyday experience. Here follows a description of just one of many actual experiments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the startling results which indicate that identification of individuals \u2014 however earnest \u2014 is often unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">This experiment was conducted at Dartmouth College and was designed to evaluate the impact of even slight suggestibility in a \"lineup\u201d identification upon witnesses who were relatively sophisticated in nuances of psychology, Brown, <em>An Experience in Identi\u00f1cation Testimony, </em>25 J Crim L &amp; C 621 (1934-1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">By pre-arrangement and without warning, a workman entered a classroom in session, walked across it, paused in front of the instructor\u2019s desk, tinkered with the radiator, made an inquiry about the heat and finally left unobtrusively. The incident was treated casually by the instructor and none of the students were forewarned of the experiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">After a lapse of two weeks, the workman was again brought into the class with five other workmen of the same general dress and appearance. \"Lineups\u201d were then conducted separately before four different groups of students who were asked to indicate their selection of the workman they had previously seen as well as their degree of confidence in this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">1) The first group consisted of 30 persons studying legal psychology who were familiar with surprise psychological tests of this nature (many of them suspected a test when the man first walked in). Of this group 23 or 76.6% correctly identified the workman, 3 were unable to identify, 1 thought it was a hoax, 2 identified the wrong man, and 1 would have been willing to swear in court that the man was not in the lineup. One of the two who made the wrong identification also expressed his willingness to swear in court that his identification was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>2) The second group consisted of 64 students with no experience in \"surprise\u201d tests but some did suspect a test when the man first walked in. Of these, 42 or 65.6% made correct identifications but 11 or 17.1% were unable to make a correct identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">3) The third group consisted of 16 random students. The questionnaire upon which they were to indicate their identification was worded to provide the slightest suggestion that the correct man was probably in the lineup <em>(e.g., </em>\"which of the men\u201d rather than \"are any of these men\u201d). Only <em>five </em>men were shown to these students and the man who had actually entered the classroom was excluded from the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The amazing result is that <em>62.5% positively identified the wrong man. </em>Two persons were too unsure to make an identification and only four correctly stated that the original man was not in the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">4) The fourth group of 17 students had not witnessed the original incident at all. While 12 correctly stated that they did not remember the incident, the remaining 29.4% \"recalled\u201d an incident that they had never witnessed and attempted to identify one of the men.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Actual legal cases support the same conclusion. For example, in one Massachusetts case 12 witnesses identified the wrong man as the culprit. See P. Wall, <em>Eye-Witness Identi\u00f1cation in Criminal Cases </em>12 (1965, 2nd printing 1971). The author references other examples of erroneous identification by 13, 14, and 17 witnesses noting that \"these are by no means the most extreme examples * * * \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The classic British case of Adolph Beck resulted in a British Government Committee impaneled by royal command to present a report to Parliament. As the result of a complaint to the police by a prostitute that Beck was the man that had defrauded her, Adolph Beck was convicted and incarcerated. No sooner did he leave prison on the first charge than he was \"fingered\u201d, convicted and imprisoned again in a similar incident. Years later the real culprit confessed after committing many more crimes. The British Government Committee in their report to Parliament reached the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">\"[E]vidence as to the identity based on personal impressions, however <em>bona fide, </em>is perhaps of all classes of evidence the least to be relied upon, and therefore, unless supported by other facts, an unsafe basis for the verdict of a jury.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Despite the reputation the British have for no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>nonsense handling of criminal cases, British law is so concerned with the fallibility of eyewitness identification and the possibility of unfounded accusations in rape cases that corroborating evidence is required by statute and case law in some cases. Even where it is not required, the courts insist upon instructions to the jury of the great dangers of such identifications, even if the complainant\u2019s evidence is clear and convincing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Pre-lineup display of photographs in any case is so distrusted in England that it has long been grounds for quashing the conviction. See <em>Rex v Haslom, </em>19 Crim App R 59, 60; 134 LT R 158 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The third factor, the scientific fact that frequently employed police and prosecution procedures often mislead eyewitnesses into misidentification of defendants, was clearly recognized by Justice Brennan speaking for the United States Supreme Court when he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\"A major factor contributing to the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification has been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification. A commentator has observed that '[t]he influence of improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of justice than any other single factor\u2014 perhaps it is responsible for more such errors than all other factors combined.\u2019 Wall, Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases 26.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>228-229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Improper suggestion commonly comes about because of three things. First, the witness when called by the police or prosecution either is told or believes that the police have apprehended the right person. Second, if the witness is shown only one person or a group in which one person is singled out in some way, he is tempted to presume that he is the person. Third, as the second factor just discussed above shows, eyewitness identification has inherent weaknesses from the standpoint of the witness\u2019s problems of sensation, retention, etc., and the similarity in appearance of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The fourth factor, the historical and legal fact that all too many innocent people have been convicted of crimes they did not commit and the real criminal who committed the crime was consequently protected and left at large, was recognized by the United States Supreme Court in the quotation we set forth above but repeat here with the emphasis on the last clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\"The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; <em>the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification. \u201d Wade, </em>228. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In Borchard, <em>Convicting the Innocent </em>(1932), the author discusses some 50 of the best known cases of mistaken convictions. In the introduction the author singles out erroneous eyewitness identification as the one greatest source of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\"><em>\"Perhaps the major source of these tragic errors is an identification of the accused by the victim of a crime of violence. </em>This mistake was practically alone responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>for twenty-nine of these convictions. Juries seem disposed more readily to credit the veracity and reliability of the victims of an outrage than any amount of contrary evidence by or on behalf of the accused, whether by way of alibi, character witnesses, or other testimony. These cases illustrate the fact that the emotional balance of the victim or eyewitness is so disturbed by his extraordinary experience that his powers of perception become distorted and his identification is frequently most untrustworthy. * * * <em>How valueless are these identi\u00f1cations by the victim of a crime is indicated by the fact that in eight of these cases the wrongfully accused person and the really guilty criminal bore not the slightest resemblance to each other, </em>whereas in twelve other cases, the resemblance, while fair, was still not at all close. In only two cases can the resemblance be called striking.\u201d <em>Id, </em>xiii. (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">A number of other authors have collected cases where there have been convictions based on mistaken eyewitness identification. See, <em>e.g., </em>Du Cann, <em>Miscarriages of Justice </em>(1960); Frank &amp; Frank, <em>Not Guilty </em>(1957); Gardner, <em>The Court of Last Resort </em>(1952); Hale, <em>Hanged in Error </em>(Penguin ed 1961); Ram, <em>A Treatise on Facts as Subjects of Inquiry by a Jury </em>(4th Amer ed 1890); Rolph, <em>Personal Identity </em>(1957); Wall, <em>Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases </em>(1965); Watson, <em>The Trial of Adolph Beck </em>(1924); Wigmore, <em>The Science of Judicial Proof </em>\u00a7 254 (3d ed 1937); Wilder and Wentworth, <em>Personal Identi\u00f1cation </em>(1918); Williams, <em>The Proof of Guilt </em>(3d ed 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">For a number of obvious reasons, however, including the fact that there is no on-going systematic study of the problem, the reported cases of misidentification are in every likelihood only the top of the iceberg. The writer of this opinion, for example, was able to turn up three very recent unreported cases right here in Michigan in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>course of a few hours\u2019 inquiry. (See the cases of Charles Clark, Lewis Nasir, and Charles Edward Richardson in Appendix A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The excerpted material above is intended only to suggest a flavor of the consistent findings by researchers. Briefly, we find that there are serious problems concerning the accuracy of eyewitness identification and that real prospects for error inhere in the very process of identification completely independent of the subjective accuracy, completeness or good faith of witnesses. For almost 100 years these problems have occupied the energy of some very astute judges, prosecutors and scholars who have consistently identified the problems. We cannot blink at the evidence of the problem and must make a forthright effort to insure that evidence of eyewitness identification is as reliable as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">IV. THE APPLICATION OF <em>WADE </em>TO PHOTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURES IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">This Court has not heretofore ruled on the right to counsel at post-apprehension photographic showups. <em>People v King, </em>384 Mich 310 (1970), dealt with corporeal identification following uncounseled identification by photograph but the question of the right to counsel was not presented. The question was resolved under the <em>Simmons-Stovall </em>standard of due process and avoidance of impermissibly suggestive procedures. <em>Id, </em>313.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Our Court of Appeals, however, follows the rule that there is a right to have counsel present at a photographic identification of an accused who is in custody. See <em>People v Cotton, </em>38 Mich App 763 (1972) overruling <em>People v Wilkins, </em>36 Mich App 143 (1971); <em>People v Robert Thomas, </em>36 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>190, 193 (1971); <em>People v John Martin, </em>37 Mich App 621, 628 (1972); <em>People v Fossey, </em>41 Mich App 174, 182 (1972). See also, <em>People v Rowell, </em>14 Mich App 190, 198 (1968) (concurring opinion of Levin, J.); <em>People v Adams, </em>19 Mich App 131, 133, n 1 (1969) ; <em>People v Greer, </em>29 Mich App 203, 206 (1970).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">In <em>Cotton, supra, </em>defendant had been arrested and two corporeal lineups were held with defendant\u2019s counsel present. Both lineups produced identifications by both witnesses of persons <em>other </em>than defendant. Defendant\u2019s car was impounded but defendant was released. After his release one witness identified defendant from a group of pictures shown her by the police without counsel present. Defendant was asked to return to the police station and a third lineup was held with counsel present in which the witness identified defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Judge John H. Gillis, after noting that the dangers in photographic identification are at least as great or greater than in corporeal, wrote for the panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">\"[W]e hold that an accused being held in custody is entitled to be represented by counsel at-any photographic identification proceeding.\u201d 38 Mich App 763, 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The Court went on to apply the rule to the case where defendant Cotton was <em>not </em>in custody because the investigation had focused on defendant: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>against the defendant by eliciting identification evidence, not to extinguish a case against an innocent bystander.\u201d <em>Id, </em>769-770.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\"Turning to the photographic display in the present case, we are of the opinion that this was no longer an in-the-field identification. Its purpose was to build a case</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Cotton </em>and the other cases holding there is a right to counsel in photographic identification recognize that <em>Wade </em>was founded on well recognized principles of social science. The concurring opinion of Judge Levin in <em>People v Rowell, </em>14 Mich App 190, 197 (1968), is the basis for the later Michigan cases on this issue such as <em>Cotton, supra. </em>In <em>Rowell, </em>Judge Levin considers the problem as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\"><em>\"The photographic identi\u00f1cation stage is as critical as the lineup stage, perhaps more so. The danger of misidenti\u00f1cation at the photographic identi\u00f1cation stage is as great, perhaps greater. </em>Just as the facts and circumstances of a lineup identification cannot be readily reconstructed at trial * * * , so too the facts and circumstances of a photographic identification preceding the lineup cannot later be readily reconstructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\"I am persuaded, and this is the reason I write to state my separate views, that <em>on principle photographic identi\u00f1cation should be prohibited where the defendant is in custody </em>unless the witness is physically incapacitated from going to a place where a lineup can be conducted. * * * And in that rare situation where photographs may properly be displayed of an accused person already in custody, <em>the accused person in entitled to be represented by counsel at the photographic identi\u00f1cation stage for the reasons expressed in </em>Wade <em>and </em>Gilbert.\u201d 14 Mich App 190, 198-199. (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">As the citation in <em>Rowell, supra, </em>indicates, the authorities which persuaded Judge Levin are Wall, <em>Eye-Witness Identi\u00f1cation in Criminal Cases </em>(1965) and the extensive references quoted and cited therein. In all, 8 of the 13 Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Judges<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> plus 2 visiting Judges<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> have had occasion to consider this matter. All of them now appear to agree on the principle that an accused in custody is entitled to counsel at a photographic identification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">There is strong support for this Michigan position in the Federal Courts, in other State Jurisdictions and in England. The United States Supreme Court has not directly ruled on the subject yet, but Justice Harlan in <em>Simmons, </em>where the right to counsel was not raised, spoke of the greater dangers of photographic identification as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\"The reliability of the identification procedure could have been increased by allowing only one or two of the five eyewitnesses to view the pictures of Simmons. If thus identified, Simmons could later have been displayed to the other eyewitnesses in a lineup, thus permitting the photographic identification to be supplemented by a <em>corporeal identification, which is normally more accurate. </em>See P. Wall, Eye-Witness Identification in Criminal Cases 83 (1965); Williams, Identification Parades [1955] Crim. L. Rev. 525, 531.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>386, n 6. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The references to Wall by Justice Harlan in <em>Simmons </em>conclude in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\"><em>\u201d[AJ photographic identification, even when properly obtained is clearly inferior to a properly obtained corporeal identification. </em>Consequently, witnesses should be asked to examine photographs <em>only when a proper corporeal identification is impossible </em>(as where no suspect has yet been found) or <em>difficult. </em>In any other case, the use of photographs is <em>improper, </em>for it constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the unnecessary employment of an identification procedure clearly inferior in reliability to one which is available.\u201d Wall, 70. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>United States v Ash, </em>149 US App DC 1; 461 F2d 92 (1972), <em>cert granted, </em>409 US 909; 92 S Ct 2436; 32 L Ed 2d 682 (1972) Judge Leventhal wrote for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\"[T]he dangers of mistaken identification from uncounseled lineup identifications set forth in <em>Wade </em>are applicable in large measure to photographic as well as corporeal identifications. * * * While these difficulties may be somewhat mitigated by preserving the photograph shown, it may also be said that a photograph can preserve the record of a lineup; yet this does not justify a lineup without counsel.\u201d <em>Id, </em>9-10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">See also <em>United States v Zeiler, </em>427 F2d 1305, 1307 (CA 3, 1970).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But cf. <em>McGee v United States, </em>402 F2d 434 (CA 10, 1968), <em>cert den, </em>394 US 908; 89 S Ct 1020; 22 L Ed 2d 220 (1969); <em>United States v Bennett, </em>409 F2d 888 (CA 2, 1969), <em>cert den sub nom United States v Haywood, </em>396 US 852; 90 S Ct 113; 24 L Ed 2d 101; <em>reh den, </em>396 US 949; 90 S Ct 376; 24 L Ed 2d 256 (1970).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in <em>Commonwealth v Whiting, </em>439 Pa 205, 209; 266 A2d 738, 740; <em>cert den, </em>400 US 919; 91 S Ct 173; 27 L Ed 2d 159 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\"Wade <em>cannot be undercut simply by substituting pictures for people, nor can the police prepare a witness for the lineup by privately showing the witness pictures of the accused. </em>\"(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In <em>Thompson v State, </em>85 Nev 134, 137; 451 P2d 704, 706; <em>cert den, </em>396 US 893; 90 S Ct 189; 24 L Ed 2d 170 (1969) the Supreme Court of Nevada said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\"><em>\u201dWe can discern no substantial difference between a lineup of photographs of persons and a lineup of the persons themselves </em>insofar as the constitutional safeguards required by Wade, supra, are concerned.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court said in <em>People v Gould, </em>54 Cal 2d 621, 631; 354 P2d 865, 870; 7 Cal Rptr 273, 278 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">\"Identification from a still photograph is <em>substantially less reliable </em>than identification of an individual seen in person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In England, whose courts are known for their \"no nonsense\u201d approach to criminal evidence, prelineup display of photographs has long been grounds for quashing the conviction. See <em>Rex v Haslom, </em>19 Crim App R 59, 60; 134 LTR 158 (1925), where police showing of photographs to witnesses after the accused had been arrested was \"indefensible\u201d and the conviction was quashed. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>also <em>Rex v Goss, </em>17 Crim App R 196, 197 (1923) where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\"No doubt there are circumstances in which the police of necessity make use of photographs, but to make use of photographs beforehand to see whether important witnesses can identify an accused person whom they are afterwards going to see is to pursue a course which is not a proper one.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">From our own examination of the authorities as cited in this opinion and discussed briefly in Appendix A, we conclude that eyewitness identification through photographs is at least as hazardous as corporeal identification and probably is more hazardous to the securing of correct identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We therefore derive the following two rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">1. <em>Subject to certain exceptions,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> identi\u00f1cation by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>photograph should not be used where the accused is in custody.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\"><em>2. Where there is a legitimate reason to use photographs for identi\u00f1cation of an in-custody accused, he has the right to counsel as much as he would for corporeal identi\u00f1cation </em>procedures,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">V. APPLICATION OF RULES TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Although defendant Anderson was in custody before the first photo identification took place at about 11:15 p.m., the failure to have counsel present falls within a well-recognized exception \u2014 there was <em>necessity </em>for an immediate identification since the victim was critically ill in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and because of the hour and other facts it was not possible to arrange an immediate lineup. See <em>People v Adams, </em>19 Mich App 131, 133 (1969) ; <em>People v Rowell, </em>14 Mich App 190, 198-199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(1968). Under these circumstances, even a one-man corporeal confrontation such as used in <em>Stovall </em>might be justified, but the better course would be to <em>first </em>conduct a photographic \"lineup\u201d with a <em>fair </em>display of pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">A different conclusion follows respecting the second and third identifications. The second identification was conducted by the prosecutor on the day following the first identification. Although the use of photographs rather than a corporeal lineup may have been justified under the circumstances, there is no claim that the victim was in so serious a condition that there was still a need for swift action. There was plenty of time to arrange either for defendant\u2019s counsel or substitute counsel to be present or to secure an \"intelligent\u201d waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The third identification took place three days before the preliminary examination without the knowledge or consent of the prosecutor and without notice to counsel who had been assigned weeks earlier. On oral argument, the people concede that the use of this procedure was inexcusable. In view of the fact that the victim was well enough to testify for hours at the preliminary examination three days later, there is no excuse for not at least attempting to arrange a corporeal lineup rather than using photographs. There is also no excuse for failing to notify counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Our holding that defendant was denied his right to counsel with respect to the second and third photo identifications establishes the legal reason in this case why the people are required to show an independent basis for the in-court identification by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">While we agree that there is an independent basis for the in-court identification in this case, it is necessary because of the highly suggestive iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tification procedures employed, to establish more evidence than the two factors mentioned by the trial court and the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In cases where the identification procedures employed are suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification then, by definition, these procedures operate upon the unconscious recognition process of the witness and create a likelihood that there will be a misidentification irrespective of the degree of previous acquaintanceship between the witness and the culprit and irrespective of the opportunity to observe during the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Where the procedures used are, as in this case, grossly beyond the bounds of propriety it becomes even more important to examine the evidence of what \"independent\u201d knowledge the victim or witness had of the identity of the culprit <em>before </em>suggestive influences were brought to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Importantly, while in the emergency room at the hospital the victim was questioned by Officer Gransden and her responses were by nodding her head \"yes\u201d or \"no\u201d. When asked who did this to her she was able, despite her condition, to scrawl on the back of a surgical glove envelope the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\"He comes in where I work. Aladdin Bar Bay City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The victim was also questioned in the X-ray room before surgery by the ambulance driver in the presence of a nurse. He asked whether he was white and she shook her head \"no\u201d; colored?\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\"no\u201d; Mexican? \u2014 \"no\u201d; Indian? \u2014 here she responded by gutteral voice sounds and had to say the word several times before the ambulance driver and the nurse present were both to understand.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">\"It was a positive, she said Indian and she was very affirmative about the negatives, if you understand what I mean. She shook her head as best she could when I asked the question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Although there was testimony that an Indian other than the appellant was in an altercation with the victim and her male escort in a downtown Bay City bar a week or two before the crime and the same Indian was seen leaving the bar where the victim worked about a week before the crime occurred, there was no suggestion that this other Indian was either a regular patron of the Aladdin Bar or that he and the victim had ever been in the Aladdin Bar at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Because of this evidence of the victim\u2019s knowledge before the suggestion took place viewed in combination with her previous acquaintance with defendant, we are satisfied that her in-court identification was accurate in spite of the employment of grossly suggestive procedures calculated (albeit unintentionally) to prompt an identification of whatever Indian was pictured^ It just happens in this case that the Indian pictured was the right Indian, as the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt. Because we find there was an independent basis established by clear and convincing evidence, there is no occasion for us to determine whether the victim\u2019s identification testimony was \"harmless\u201d constitutional error.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">VI. MINOR ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">A. <em>Was it Prejudicial Error for the Defendant to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>be Handcuffed and Subjected to Security Precautions?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We recognize that a defendant may be prejudiced in the eyes of the jury by being shackled and manacled in their presence. <em>People v Duplissey, </em>380 Mich 100 (1968). However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that there was no prejudicial error in this case and we adopt that portion of their opinion, 29 Mich App 578, 582 (\u00b62)-583(\u00b61).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">B. <em>Was it Prejudicial Error to Admit Photographic Slides Depicting the Condition of the Victim While Being Treated at the Hospital?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">This issue is controlled by our recent decision in <em>People </em>v <em>Eddington, </em>387 Mich 551, 561-563 (1972). Under the standards of <em>Eddington </em>we find no reversible error or abuse of discretion in the use of the photographs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">This case graphically demonstrates the need for police and prosecutorial agencies to cooperate in promulgation and enforcement of legally sufficient and practically effective written guidelines for identification procedures, both corporeal and photographic.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-10\">T.

This Appendix A supplements the opinion with additional references to the legal and scientific recognition of the problem (Part I) and presents a survey of some psychological factors identified as major causes of the problem (Part II).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">I. LEGAL &amp; SCIENTIFIC RECOGNITION OF THE EXISTENCE AND SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\"[T]he assumption [is] that witnesses can see accurately, hear accurately, and recall accurately. This assumption which is the keystone 'As If of the law of evidence, is in fact contradicted by the findings of psychological science.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Scores of legal and scientific writers have commented on the make-believe quality of some of our rules of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\"The notion, still tolerably prevalent, that the faithfully sworn testimony of a mentally competent witness is in general to be regarded as an exact presentation of reality is without justification.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">For some reason, the law has until recent years in such decisions as <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons, </em>ignored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>what the behavioral sciences can tell us about the reliability of eyewitness testimony. Almost 90 years ago, Hugo Munsterberg, a pioneer in experimental and theoretical psychology, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\"The courts will have to learn, sooner or later, that the individual differences of men can be tested to-day by the methods of experimental psychology far beyond anything which common sense and social experience suggest. Modern law welcomes, for instance, for identification of criminals all the discoveries of anatomists and physiologists as to the individual differences; even the different play of lines in the thumb is carefully registered in wax. But no one asks for the striking differences as to those mental details which the psychological experiments on memory and attention, on feeling and imagination, on perception and discrimination, on judgment and suggestion, on emotion and volition, have brought out in the last decade.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>And even since <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons, </em>many decisions seem to have misconstrued the thrust of the Supreme Court\u2019s concern. See <em>e.g., </em>Notes, <em>Pretrial Identification Procedures </em>\u2014 Wade <em>to Gilbert to Stovall: Lower Courts Bobble the Ball, </em>55 Minn L Rev 779 (1971). We have therefore made our own examination of the authorities cited in <em>Wade. </em>In order to properly make an independent evaluation we have also examined additional authorities, including many of the citations and references documenting the authorities cited in <em>Wade. </em>Aside from the recognition of the impact of science and psychology on evidence generally, there is specific recognition of the problems in the area of eyewitness identification. For example, Dean Wigmore, in <em>The Science of Judicial Proof </em>(1937), \u00a7\u00a7 253, 254 catalogues numerous cases of erroneous identification. He says of the process of securing eyewitness identification: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>measures beforehand objectively to reduce the chances of testimonial error * **\u00a7** * <em>Id, </em>\u00a7 252, p 537.

On the other hand, <em>the risk of injustice being so serious, the great possibilities of lurking error should cause hesitation. * * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\"2. The process also calls for <em>precaution, </em>in taking</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The opinion, p 179, makes reference to a number of authors documenting examples of misidentification. Often quoted in cases and other materials on the problem are the comments of Felix Frankfurter:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\"What is the worth of identification testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent \u2014 not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u201d Frankfurter, <em>The Case of Sacco &amp; Vanzetti </em>(1927), p 30.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The actual number of these tragic miscarriages of justice may never be known. Although no systematic study has ever been conducted in Michigan, we were able in a few hours inquiry to turn up three recent examples of misidentification in Wayne and Macomb Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>1. Louis Nasir</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The case of Louis Nasir illustrates one of the reasons that cases of erroneous conviction are difficult to ferret out \u2014 the evidence offered and the testimony of eyewitnesses is no different, but to the contrary, the case is indistinguishable from cases of correct identification. The innocence of the convicted man comes to light not from the record or proof itself but, as in the Nasir case, by the confession of a criminal who is later arrested for an unrelated crime. In fact in the Nasir case, this might not even have happened except for the diligent post-trial investigation by the Warren Police Department, the Macomb Prosecutor\u2019s Office and court-appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Louis Nasir was once arrested for commission of a crime as the result of mistaken identification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Although no charges were brought his picture was taken and found its way into the \"mug book\u201d. Several years later in May of 1965, a bandit wearing wraparound sunglasses and a straw hat held up a credit union in Warren and escaped with almost $5,000. There were three witnesses, the manager, an employee named Dimples Anderson and a credit union customer. On the afternoon of the robbery the manager and Dimples were unable to select anyone from a mug book and were unable to select anyone from a lineup in which Louis Nasir was not present. The day after the robbery the manager and the employee picked Nasir from a mug book and also picked him in a one-man \"showup\u201d from behind a one-way glass. On the following Monday all three witnesses picked Nasir from a lineup that did not appear unfair in itself from the record, absent any prior suggestion in the one-man photo showup or any suggestion that may have occurred in the use of photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Nasir was tried for robbery and the sole issue was identification. Despite the testimony of six witnesses who said they saw Nasir at work the day of the robbery, the jury believed the identification testimony of the credit union manager, Dimples Anderson and the customer and returned a verdict of guilty. Nasir was sentenced to serve 7 to 20 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The court-appointed attorney who was to prosecute the appeal was convinced of Nasir\u2019s innocence and enlisted the aid of the two detectives who helped convict Nasir. Working together, the three men found the man who confessed to being an accomplice to the . crime. The real robber, who resembled Nasir, had been shot to death in February, 1966. A friend of the dead man, who was serving time in Jackson, corroborated the story by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>revealing that the crime had been admitted to him before the death of the real culprit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">An hour after Nasir took lie detector tests he was freed on bond pending a new trial and the charges were dismissed on motion of the prosecutor. Nasir had spent 375 days in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">One of the ironies of the case is the absolute certainty of the witnesses regarding their identification of Nasir. Dimples Anderson, for example, testified that she had no doubt whatsoever about the identity of the man:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>It\u2019s possible that you could have made a mistake today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\"><em>\"A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\"><em>\"Q. </em>If you should find out later \u2014 if I were to tell you \u2014 * * * that this man could not have possibly been there, would you say that you could be mistaken?\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">\n<em>2. Charles Edward Richardson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">On January 16, 1968, a man held up a gas station and escaped. The two gas station attend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ants positively identified Charles Richardson, who lived in the neighborhood and was about the same size as the man who robbed the station. Two or three months later a man named Kendrick was arrested on an unrelated charge and as the result of diligent police investigation he confessed to the robbery of the gas station. Charles Richardson was released from Jackson Prison. After this evidence was presented to the trial judge, Honorable Horace W. Gilmore, the charges were dismissed on motion of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">This is another case where there was no intentional suggestion and the witnesses were honestly \"positive\u201d in their minds about the earlier identification. Again the error is not apparent from the record but was only discovered by diligent police investigation of an unrelated crime. At the nolle prosequi hearing the identifying witness upon seeing both the innocent man and the confessed robber could no longer make an identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\"><em>\"The Court: </em>You are aware that Mr. Kendricks has admitted to committing this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, I heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\"><em>\"The Court: </em>And has testified that Mr. Richardson did not do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, I do, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Can you identify either one of them as the person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\"><em>\"A. </em>Well, right now, positively, I couldn\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIX\">\n<em>3. Charles Clark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">On November 23, 1937, three men held up a clothing store in Hamtramck. The owner was shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and killed. The owner\u2019s daughter, who was 21 years old at the time, went to the assistance of her father and was slugged with a revolver by one of the robbers. Charles Clark was later identified by the girl in a lineup as the man who shot her father. One of the other defendants implicated Clark in an initial statement, but he and two others said at the trial later that Clark had no part in it. Clark\u2019s landlady testified that he was home all that day. Nevertheless, Clark was convicted primarily on the identification testimony of the young woman and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Clark tried for a new trial several times over the 30-years imprisonment, but it was denied each time. Partly because Clark was an exemplary prisoner he was offered parole by the prison authorities and later was offered a pardon and commutation of sentence, but he turned these down because acceptance of such terms would have been a tacit admission of guilt. At one point in a quest for a new tried he was offered the opportunity to plead to a lesser charge, the sentence of which would have freed him immediately. Again he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Finally in 1968 the case was assigned to the Legal Aid &amp; Defenders Association of Detroit. The attorneys researched early transcripts and discovered that the victim\u2019s daughter, the sole identifying witness, had originally said that she could not identify Clark as one of the bandits. In an affidavit in support of the motion for a new trial the witness revealed that after she said she could not identify the defendant, the Hamtramck detectives had pointed Clark out as the guilty man before the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Clark was granted a new trial in 1968 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>case was dismissed on motion of the prosecutor. As a result of this, on January 28, 1972, Public Act No. 1 of the 76th Legislature was signed into law by Governor William G. Milliken as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\"Sec. 1. There is appropriated from, the general fund of the state the sum of $10,000.00, to Charles Lee Clark, born October 17, 1899 at Americus, Georgia, residing at 238 E. Mount Vernon, Detroit, Michigan, for mental suffering incurred in state prison for an offense of which he was found innocent upon later trial after 30 years of confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\"Sec. 2. The money appropriated under the provisions of this act is not made in payment of any claims for damages, but is provided solely out of humanitarian consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\"Ordered to take immediate effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\"Approved January 28, 1972.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">II. WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\"><em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>recognize the psychological factors entailed in identification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Briefly, the causes stem from the universal fallibilities of perception and memory. Even assuming favorable conditions attending both the original perception and the memory period, there is additional possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>bility for error inherent in the \"recognition process\u201d itself. The possibility for error from these sources will be increased by the operation of aggravating factors, a major one being the many subtle forms of suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The combined operation of these factors becomes even more significant in the process of seeking truth at trial because of another phenomenon singled out in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>\u2014 once <em>any identi\u00f1cation decision is made it may well be \"irreparable\u201d </em>\u2014 the witness, whether right or wrong, is unlikely to change his or her mind.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So for judges, lawyers and even more so to police (who have the most difficult job of finding and building a case against the one right man out of many) the important question is whether an identification is irreparably <em>correct </em>or whether it is probably an irreparable <em>misidenti\u00f1cation. </em>It is important therefore to understand something of the operation of some of the most basic of these principles of psychology because our only measure of the probative worth of identification evidence is an ability, however fragile, to weight the probability of error in a given set of conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A. <em>\"RECOGNITION\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Since \"identification\u201d entails an act of recognition, some knowledge of the literature on the psychology of recognition is helpful in appreciating the impact of suggestion and the effects of inaccurate memory or perception. Inherent in the process of recognition itself are two basic factors which encourage error. As will be seen, these factors are what the Court meant in <em>Wade </em>when it mentioned \"identification parades\u201d and \"showups\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>\"It is obvious that risks of suggestion attend either form of confrontation and increase the dangers inhering in eyewitness identification.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Simmons </em>also referred to the suggestion inherent in the procedure itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\"Even if the police subsequently follow the most correct photographic identification procedures * * * there is some danger that the witness may make an incorrect identification.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">1. <em>Identi\u00f1cation is a Result of \"Recognition\u201dMemory and is Less Accurate than \"Recall\u201d Memory.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\"Recall\u201d and \"Recognition\u201d are distinct forms of remembering. \"Recall\u201d is a straigtforward proposition in which there are only very limited \"cues\u201d available to aid memory and the range of possible responses eliminates any significance in guessing. \"Recognition\u201d memory, on the other hand, arises <em>only </em>where useful memory cues do exist and the job is to make a \"right\u201d choice, or \"reasoned\u201d guess between the presented alternatives.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Identification of suspects is a form of \"recognition memory\u201d involving an element of choice. As the number of possible choices decreases, the possibility of guessing and the consequence of unreliable results increases. A one-man or one-photo \"showup\u201d is, like a \"true and false\u201d exam, simply a form of \"recognition\u201d memory where there are only two choices \u2014 yes or no \u2014 and a flip of the coin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>would produce as many \"right\u201d answers as wrong ones. In a true-false exam in school, however, we can take comfort in our measure of accuracy because we have predetermined what choice is \"right\u201d. There is no such comfort in a showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Thus, in a display of six pictures, there is inherent in the very process a degree of suggestion (the mere display suggests one of them is \"correct\u201d) and a possibility of error (five out of six guesses).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">2. <em>\"Recognition\u201d Encourages Positive IdentiBcation of Things Merely Similar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>both note<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the very process of sight recognition presents dangers that persons who are merely similar may be perceived as one and the same. <em>Wade </em>leads us to the explanation found in Wigmore, <em>The Science of Judicial Proof </em>(1937), \u00a7\u00a7 250-253, and also noted in Wall, <em>Eye-Witness IdentiBcation in Criminal Cases </em>(1965), p 10. The gist of it is that Recognition depends on \"similarity\u201d and therein lies the key to false recognition and major opportunities for unintentional, subtle suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">When we \"see\u201d something \"out there\u201d, the original mental record consists of an \"attitude\u201d or \"sensation\u201d composed of the various items in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>object perceived. This \"attitude\u201d or \"sensation\u201d is preserved in the memory (more or less imperfectly) in the combination of the various perceived items by a process sometimes called \"association\u201d. What occurs during the recognition process is that a subconscious attitude or sensation of sameness or resemblance is aroused. This \"attitude\u201d or \"sensation\u201d of sameness is accompanied by a subjective feeling of \"familiarity\u201d when there are elements of similarity between the new and the previous situation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The way the mental processes operate in a hypothetical case (as lawyers are so fond of) is explained by Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 251. Dean Wig-more posits a simple case. There are two people, A and B. Each has perceivable characteristics (whatever they are) by which people identify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">PERSON A has perceivable characteristics which fall into patterns................... [bcdefg]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">PERSON B has perceivable characteristics which fall into patterns................... [bcdmnp]</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">You, the reader, have seen <em>only </em>person A previously and are now confronted with <em>either </em>A or B (you don\u2019t know which). THE QUESTION IS: What are your chances of mistaking PERSON B for A? Now this is completely apart from any \"suggestion\u201d intentional or otherwise but considers only the relationship between perception and memory as they operate in the \"recognition\u201d process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Four stages in the mental process which will produce the recognition are suggested by Wigmore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\"(1) First, the mind, when perceiving A, <em>perceived </em>a pattern, made up of items (say) b c d e f g.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\"(2) Next the observer\u2019s memory <em>recorded </em>an impression of this pattern, all or part, <em>i.e. </em>all or some of the items b c d e f g associated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\"(3) Next, on being shown A or B, the mind <em>perceives </em>all or some of these items in the person perceived; if that person is A, the items perceivable will be b c d e f g; but if that person is B, the items perceivable will be (say) b c d m n p.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\"(4) Next, comes the <em>recollection </em>of the originally recorded impressions by the stimulated process of association; and here the result depends on what took place mentally in stage (2) above:\u201d Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 251, p 535.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\"><em>\"Mental Condition 4a: </em>If in Stage 2 the items recorded were <em>all six </em>of b c d e f g, then on sight of A the recollection will reproduce them all (subconsciously or otherwise), <em>i.e. </em>the correct sensation of identity, positive and complete, will take place, and <em>correctly; </em>whereas, on sight of B, having b c d m n p, the sensation of nonidentity will take place, and <em>correctly.\u201d Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\"><em>\"Mental Condition 4b: </em>Now if in Stage 2 the memory record (or the original perception plus record) included <em>only </em>the items (say) bed \u2014, then the sight of <em>either A or B </em>(both of whom contain those three items) will produce a sensation of <em>identity, </em>because the sight of b or c or d will by association stimulate one or both of the remaining two items, and the sensation of identity will be more or less positive according to the number of items bed originally recorded and revived; but if person A is the one shown, the recognition will be <em>correct, </em>while if person B is shown this recognition .will be <em>incorrect. \u201d </em>Wig-more, <em>supra, </em>pp 535-536.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\"Now Case <em>4b </em>is a <em>very common case. </em>The mind ordinarily retains only a few of the items marking a personality; moreover, it will ordinarily perceive only a few in the first place, and the number recorded and revivable will be still fewer. Hence, the danger in such a case of the observer perceiving B and receiving the sensation of his identity with A.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In conclusion, Wigmore points out another variable noted in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>\u2014 that the danger of misidentification increases with the degree of <em>similarity </em>in general appearance between the person seen previously and the person(s) now before you for scrutiny.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Complicating it further, as the degree of similarity and danger of misidentification increase together they carry along a greater feeling of <em>certainty </em>that you have made the right choice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\"Moreover, the <em>danger increases </em>in the <em>proportion of B\u2019s actual likeness to A, </em>while really a different individual. <em>Eg. </em>in the case above supposed, A\u2019s items were b c d e f g, and B\u2019s items were b c d m n p. But if B\u2019s items are b c d e f p, and thus five out of six marks are the same, the chances are increased that the observer will record some or all of marks b c d e f, which are the same for both A and B, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>chances are reduced that his mind will record <em>g, </em>which is the only item different from B\u2019s item p.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In sum, real prospects for error and suggestion inhere in the very process of \"recognition\u201d completely independent of the accuracy and completeness of perception or memory, and whether or not other suggestive influences are present. The importance of the process is that recognition depends upon similarity \u2014 degrees of unspecified sameness which become easily affected by suggestion. The identification resulting from even a recognition process unaffected by suggestion is worth no more than the correspondence between what is accurately recalled of the original object and what is perceived of the compared object. Because of the fallability of perception and memory, there may be very little real correspondence between the two, but an apparent correspondence, though wrong, can result in \"identification\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>B. <em>PERCEPTION, MEMORY AND \"INTERFER</em>ENCE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Reference has already been made above to the fact that a great number of variables will affect not only the accuracy of perception but also will influence the amount and substance of what is retained in memory. Other than such obvious factors as the physical defects an observer may have, the opportunity to observe, environmental conditions and the like, there are some factors affecting the accuracy of perception and memory worth noting briefly.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>1. There is a general unreliability of observation for <em>unexpected events. </em>A person is capable of grasping only a limited number of impressions at one time and his already limited range of accuity is aggravated when the event is unexpected. Experiments indicate that six to eight impressions are about the maximum of what an experienced observer can grasp of a single, sudden event.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">2. In <em>critical situations </em>perception will become distorted and any <em>strong </em>emotion (as opposed to mildly emotional experiences) will aifect not only what and how much we <em>perceive, </em>but also will aifect our <em>memory o\u00ed </em>what occurred.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Related to this is the effect of what is called <em>\"retroactive inhibition \u201d </em>and <em>\"cerebral dysfunc</em>tionWhere a person has been in an experience coupled with high emotional stress and especially where there may have been blows to the head in an accident it is very commonly found that memory for the period just preceding the high stress or accident is blank or hazy at best. The generality of this effect, variously called as above or known as <em>\"retrograde amnesia, \u201d </em>has been well established.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The upshot of the evidence regarding the effect of emotion upon perception and recall is summed up well in Anastasi, <em>Fields of Applied Psychology </em>(1964), p 548:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\"Contrary to legal folklore, strong emotion at the time of observation or subsequent report tends to increase the probability of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">3. Because of the limited range and accuity of perception, much of what we perceive is actually a result of <em>\"filing </em>in\u201dby <em>our imagination </em>in accordance with our <em>attitudes </em>and <em>expectations</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>propensity to supplement perception by \"filling in\u201d in accordance with our attitudes and expectations also has a pronounced effect upon <em>memory. </em>That is, even assuming a completely accurate perception, our memory will often be incomplete in fact but by the unconscious process of \"filling in\u201d we believe we remember things that we have only imagined. This tendency to <em>unconscious invention of memory </em>during the recall stage provides a fertile ground for suggestive influences however unintentional.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">4. The accuracy of what we perceive as well as what we remember of that perception will be distorted by a number of other factors such as <em>fatigue, nervous exhaustion, alcohol </em>and <em>drugs;</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the influences of <em>group pressures, \"prestige\u201d </em>or <em>\"status\u201d </em>persons and especially those groups, causes or persons with whom the witness is in some way <em>\"identified\u201d;</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the effect of princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>pies of <em>Contiguity </em>(when two things are experienced together, the subsequent recurrence of one will tend to bring back the other), <em>Recency </em>(all things being equal, a most recent experience is better remembered than the more remote), <em>Primacy </em>(the tendency for the first association as well as the most recent to make a strong impression) and <em>Frequency </em>(if several things have been connected with another thing in the past, the one that has most frequently been connected in this way is most likely to recur).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">5. <em>The role of time is greatly misunderstood. </em>Although everyone knows that forgetting and time go hand in hand, it is not satisfactory to say that the <em>reason </em>we forget is time, because <em>time is not a causal agent. </em>Time does not enter as a factor in its own right, but merely permits a number of effective variables to operate, some of which have been discussed above. In general, and regardless of what of the variables are operating, <em>forgetting occurs rapidly </em>in a short interval after the incident to be remembered, becomes progressively slower and gradually levels off. This is described as the \"curve of forgetting\u201d.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Time allows for the operation of <em>interferring factors </em>between the particular activity and the occasion for remembering. The more similar the interpolated activity is to the original learning in substance and degree of sophistication, the greater the impairment in recall of the original material.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The amount of interference is also a function of the <em>amount </em>of interpolated activity, so <em>repeated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>interference </em>destroys memory as effectively as grossly misleading interpolated activity. An obvious factor that should not be underplayed is that the lesser the amount and accuracy of original learning, the more susceptible memory is to interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In short, forgetting is not so much a matter of \"fading away\u201d but of being crowded out by new impressions causing quantitative and qualitative changes in memory. Striking distortions in remembering may be produced by interpolated activity and material that is similar to the material originally perceived or learned.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The consequent inaccurate and altered memory of the witness at the time for identification magnifies the impact of the \"recognition\u201d process which, because it depends upon similarity,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> is only as reliable and trustworthy as the memory of the identifying witness. It is during the retention period and at the occasion for identification or \"recognition\u201d that the most potent of distorting influences comes into play \u2014 suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">C. <em>SUGGESTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Both <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>single out suggestive influences as a major factor contributing to the great number of misidentifications.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The authorities, including those cited in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>are unanimous that on top of the unreliability of sensation, perception and memory there is <em>\"one factor which, more than anything else, devastates memory and plays havoc with our best intended recollections: that is, the power of suggestion\u201d?</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Suggestion may be implanted deliberately by over-zealous investigators, by a hint, impressive manner, gesture, tone of voice, facial expression or in other ways.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The rare case of intentional suggestion, however, is not our concern here but rather we are concerned with the probability of innocent suggestive influences from a host of sources. It would serve no useful purpose here and there is not sufficient space to catalog the many forms of subtle, unintentional suggestive influences. <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>identify some of the most common ones.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The importance of the existence of so many possible forms of unintentional suggestion lies in the fact that <em>we are peculiarly susceptible to it </em>and the fact that it is an <em>unconscious process </em>so that we are <em>unable to detect its in\u00f1uehce </em>while it operates.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Experiments by psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated the extent to which people are susceptible to suggestion.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> One interesting test discussed in the opinion, graphically demonstrates the impact of even limited suggestion on the accuracy of a lineup identification. Brown, <em>An Experience in Identification Testimony, </em>25 Crim L &amp; Criminology 621 (1935). In another experiment an \"assault\u201d was staged in a law school class before 34 students. They were afterwards told to make notes and were given exact descriptions because they might have to testify in court. Five weeks later a seven-man lineup was held in which none of the \"other\u201d six closely resembled the \"right\u201d man. <em>Result? </em>\u2014 Only <em>3 or 8.8% of the 34 students could pick out the right man. </em>Comment, <em>Possible Procedural Safeguards Against Mistaken Eyewitness Identification, 2 </em>UCLA L Rev 552 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">D, <em>COGNITIVE DISSONANCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Given the dangers of misidentification resulting from the vagaries of perception, memory, recognition and . the impact of suggestion, it becomes important to understand another factor singled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>out in <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>\u2014 the effect upon a witness of having made an identification. Both <em>Wade </em>and <em>Simmons </em>recognize that the first identification may well be irreparable whether right or wrong because the witness who made that identification will be greatly influenced by what he then perceived and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In <em>Wade </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\"Moreover, '[i]t is a matter of common experience that, once a witness has picked out the accused at the lineup, he is not likely to go back on his word later on, so that in practice the issue of identity may (in the absence of other relevant evidence) for all practical purposes be determined there and then, before the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wade, </em>229.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>Simmons, </em>Justice Harlan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\"Regardless of how the initial misidentification. comes about, the witness thereafter is apt to retain in his memory the image of the photograph rather than of the person actually seen, reducing the trustworthiness of subsequent lineup or courtroom identification.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>383-384.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">This factor noted by the Court is a recognition of what psychologists refer to as \"dissonance\u201d theory. As one author puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\"[This theory] does not rest on the assumption that man is a rational animal; rather it suggests that man is a rationalizing animal \u2014 that he attempts to appear rational, both to others and to himself.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The essence of the theory of cognitive dissonance is that before a decision is made, a subject knows certain factors and alternatives which he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>weight to make the decision. The stronger the conflicts of a subject with respect to the alternatives in a decision process, the <em>greater </em>will his certainty be once the decision is made. In other words, the amount of \"dissonance\u201d existing <em>after </em>the decision is a function of the number of things the person knows that are inconsistent with the decision he has made. The greater the conflict before the decision, the greater the dissonance afterwards. Therefore, the more difficulty a person has making a decision, the greater is his tendency to justify that decision (reduce the dissonance) afterwards.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>It cannot be overemphasized that this apparent certainty of the witness after the decision is not the result of conscious or intentional suppression of countervailing factors. The <em>cognitive and recall processes actually change after a decision is once made </em>and we perceive the strength and weight of the alternatives that led to the decision much differently after we have made a decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\"Once the decision is made and the person is committed to a given course of action, the psychological situation changes decisively. There is less emphasis on objectivity and there is more partiality and bias in the way in which the person views and evaluates the alternatives * * * .\u201d Festinger, <em>Conflict, Decision &amp; Dissonance </em>(1964), p 155.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">This brief survey of some of the psychological phenomena involved in eyewitness identification is intended only to aid an appreciation of the seriousness of the problem and its manifold causes. With this background, not only can we evaluate better the claims of parties relating to identification procedures, but also we have at least a starting point to evaluate proposals for alternatives to counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\"> 388 US 218; 87 S Ct 1926; 18 L Ed 2d 1149 (1967); <em>Gilbert v California, </em>388 US 263; 87 S Ct 1951; 18 L Ed 2d 1178 (1967); <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; 87 S Ct 1967; 18 L Ed 2d 1199 (1967); <em>Simmons v United States, </em>390 US 377; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968); <em>Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682; 92 S Ct 1877; 32 L Ed 2d 411 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\"><em> </em>This is the so-called \"harmless error\u201d rule enunciated in <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\"> The holding of this evidentiary hearing is <em>not </em>discretionary with the trial judge.
