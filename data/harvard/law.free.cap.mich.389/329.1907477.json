It is a \"municipal\u201d court and a \"court of record\u201d, but so describing it does not define its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">In 1857, when recorder\u2019s court was established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in its present form by 1857 PA 55 (Chapter VI) it was given original and exclusive jurisdiction of all crimes, misdemeanors, and offenses committed within the corporate limits of the City of Detroit except \"in cases cognizable by the police court of the City of Detroit or by the justices of the peace of said city\u201d, and expressly granted the power and jurisdiction of a circuit court <em>in like cases. </em>It was also given condemnation jurisdiction (Chapter VII) in connection with the opening, altering and closing of streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The Charter of 1883 (1883 Local Act 326) which continued the recorder\u2019s court, continued its criminal jurisdiction in specific language but did not mention any condemnation jurisdiction. Thus the Charter of the City of Detroit ceased to be the source of condemnation jurisdiction for recorder\u2019s court in 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In that same year, however, just before the new charter was granted by the Legislature, recorder\u2019s court was given condemnation jurisdiction by another statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">1883 PA 124 which dealt with condemnation by cities and villages provided for jurisdiction over condemnation proceedings and mandated their institution in that court in \"cities having a Recorder\u2019s Court\u201d. Accordingly from 1883 until June 27, 1967 when that statute was repealed by 1967 PA 120, recorder\u2019s court had jurisdiction over condemnation cases by virtue of the 1883 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In this appeal the City argued that recorder\u2019s court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain condemnation cases arising in the City of Detroit is an inherent and integral part of its jurisdiction as it evolved as a municipal court. This begs the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Jurisdiction does not \"inhere\u201d in a court, it is conferred upon it by the power which creates it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>For this reason we hold that the 1967 repeal of 1883 PA 124 revoked the jurisdiction over condemnation proceedings which recorder\u2019s court had and unless and until the Legislature sees fit to restore it, that court has no condemnation jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AaA\">Affirmed. No costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. E. Brennan, T. G. Kavanagh, Swainson, Williams, Levin, and M. S. Coleman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
