A fellow worker noticed that he was limping. At the lunch hour, Lucas descended a ladder from the roof where he had been working, went to his car, and drove to The Pratt Clinic, Ltd., in Fredericksburg where he was examined by Dr. David B. Rice. Finding symptoms of \u201cdeep vein thrombophlebitis in the right leg\u201d, Dr. Rice recommended hospitaliza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>tion. After driving home for a bath, Lucas entered Mary Washington Hospital. He was discharged November 4, readmitted November 7, and transferred November 15 to Medical College of Virginia. Following surgery later that day, he expired. The death certificate showed that the \u201cimmediate cause\u201d of death was \u201ccardiac arrest due to massive pulmonary embolism\u201d and that the \u201cunderlying cause\u201d was \u201cDeep vein thrombosis, rt. femoral\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The job superintendent testified that he and Lucas had been working together on the roof; that he had followed Lucas down the ladder at noon; that Lucas had said nothing about an accident or injury; and that he had learned nothing until he read a letter dated November 22, 1978, addressed to the employer by an attorney. Lucas\u2019s widow, mother, and daughter and one of his neighbors testified that Lucas had told them that he had \u201cstruck his leg\u201d or \u201churt his leg\u201d at work but had not explained the circumstances. The claimant further testified that her husband had told her that he had asked a co-worker to advise the superintendent that \u201che had to leave and see a doctor on account of his leg was hurting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">According to the October 24, 1978, entry in the records of Pratt Clinic, Lucas had complained that \u201cMy glands swell up on me for 2 wks\u201d. That entry made no reference to an accident. Another entry made January 23, 1979, stated: \u201cHis widow came in to discuss the possible relationship of his having taken a hard blow on his affected thrombophlebitic leg just a day or so prior to his coming to the hospital. Apparently, because he had had other symptoms of the leg for a couple of weeks he did not really mention this injury at first \u2014 only mentioned it when I saw him in the hospital later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">The employer argues that \u201cwithout any evidence of how, when, where and why the accident happened, it would be rank speculation to conclude that the event \u2018arose out of\u2019 the employment.\u201d We do not decide whether the evidence supports the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the decedent suffered an injury from an industrial accident. For purposes of this opinion only, we will assume the affirmative and address the alternative question raised by the employer: Does the evidence support the Commission\u2019s finding of a causal connection between the injury and the death?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-8\">\u201c[Cjausal connection is established when it is shown that an employee has received a compensable injury which materially aggravates or accelerates a pre-existing latent disease which becomes the direct and immediate cause of death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Money, </em>174 Va. 50, 57, 4 S.E.2d 739, 741 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The parties agree that Lucas had been suffering from a \u201cpreexisting latent disease\u201d. According to the \u201cfinal summary\u201d of his first hospitalization, he had been \u201chaving some on and off aching and swelling in his leg for a month or more\u201d and had suffered \u201cmore discomfort in his right leg the preceding week before admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The claimant\u2019s position is that \u201cthe accidental injury materially aggravated or accelerated the pre-existing phlebitic condition of Lucas\u2019s right leg which led to the immediate cause of death.\u201d We consider first whether the evidence establishes aggravation. There was no evidence, lay or expert, concerning the nature or extent of the blow to Lucas\u2019s leg. In reply to a letter from the claimant\u2019s attorney, Dr. Rice reported that it was \u201cimpossible to estimate the percentage effect which the more recent trauma caused to an apparently already abnormal and probably already active phlebitic leg.\u201d While he said that \u201ctrauma could very possibly set off a chain of thrombophlebitic problems\u201d and that the trauma described by the attorney \u201cwas of real significance\u201d, he added that \u201cif [Lucas] was so stoic as to tolerate this sort of leg condition for this period of time, then, if the trauma had not occurred, he would not have sought medical attention and he may well have died at home in a much shorter period of time without any hospitalization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Dr. Rice\u2019s comments concerning the potential effects of a trauma upon pre-existing thrombophlebitis presuppose a trauma sufficiently severe to produce pathological consequences. But he does not say that the injury Lucas received was such a trauma. And the records of the Clinic and those of Mary Washington Hospital tend to show otherwise. Although the right leg was the focus of the examination, none of those records, all apparently dictated by Dr. Rice, made any mention of the existence of an abrasion or contusion. The \u201cfinal summary\u201d following the November 4 discharge noted that Lucas had \u201cmade regular progress although at first it was rapid and then more slow\u201d. After discharge, he \u201cwas seen in follow up in the Clinic and continued to do well, although not entirely cleared.\u201d During his second hospitalization, \u201c[h]e continued to improve with the pain going away and having no respiratory symptoms. He had been doing quite well and in fact was pushing for more activity when he was found in severely ill state about 9:45 on 11/15/78\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">Notwithstanding such evidence, we will assume that the blow to Lucas\u2019s leg caused some degree of aggravation of his pre-existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>disease. We must now determine whether there was evidence to support the Commission\u2019s implicit finding that it was sufficiently material to have become \u201cthe direct and immediate cause of death.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The Commission\u2019s factual findings are \u201cconclusive and binding\u201d, Code \u00a7 65.1-98, and a question raised by \u201cconflicting expert medical opinions\u201d is \u201cone of fact\u201d. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Capitol Hotel, </em>189 Va. 585, 590, 54 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1949). <em>See also C.D.S. Services </em>v. <em>Petrock, </em>218 Va. 1064, 243 S.E.2d 236 (1978). But where there is \u201cno conflict in the evidence, the question of the sufficiency thereof is one of law.\u201d <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>205 Va. 877, 880, 140 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">There is no significant conflict in the expert medical opinions of the two doctors who attended Lucas, and \u201cwe must inquire to determine if the correct legal conclusion has been reached.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">Dr. Lazar J. Greenfield described the operation at Medical College of Virginia. A \u201ccatheter was passed into the pulmonary artery\u201d. An autopsy \u201cconfirmed the fact that [Lucas] had sustained a massive embolus during the procedure\u201d. Dr. Greenfield felt that the characteristics of the embolus indicated that it had not arisen from the leg but \u201cfrom the right heart\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is possible that our catheter manipulation provoked such further embolization\u201d. In a letter to the claimant\u2019s attorney, Dr. Greenfield said that the \u201cembolism. .. may be a consequence of injury or immobilization\u201d and that \u201cthere may be a relationship to the injury you describe\u201d. Replying to a similar letter .requesting any \u201cinformation you could add which I could offer as proof of causal relationship\u201d, Dr. Rice said that \u201cwe cannot say even with the post mortum (sic) examination what was the source of the final fatal embolus; however, we have no doubt but what his morbid condition at that time was caused by the thrombophlebitic process in the right lower extremity.\u201d Significantly, as we have noted, Dr. Rice did not say that the thrombophlebitic process was aggravated by the trauma described in the attorney\u2019s letter or that any such aggravation was causally related to Lucas\u2019s morbid condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In summary, one of the attending physicians believed that a trauma such as the claimant\u2019s attorney described \u201ccould very possibly\u201d aggravate a thrombophlebitic condition. The other felt that the fatal embolism \u201cmay\u201d have resulted from such a trauma, but that it \u201cmay\u201d have resulted from \u201cimmobilization\u201d, and that, since the post mortem examination indicated that the embolus arose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>the heart rather than the leg, it might have resulted from \u201cour catheter manipulation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">At most, the medical evidence adduced by the claimant raises a purely theoretical possibility of aggravation and causal connection.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But, as we said in a case where the question was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that a cerebral hemorrhage had resulted from heavy lifting, \u201c[possibility is not enough.\u201d <em>Rust Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>194 Va. 975, 979, 76 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1953).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">\u201cWe have frequently pointed out that a claimant must prove a causal connection between the accident and the disability which he claims resulted therefrom. \u2018This proof must go beyond conjecture. If the evidence shows that it is just as probable that the disability resulted from a cause which is not compensable, as it is that it resulted from one which is compensable, the claimant has not sustained the burden of proof.\u2019 (Citations omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\"><em>Southall, Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Reams, Inc., </em>198 Va. 545, 548-49, 95 S.E.2d 145, 147-48 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">We hold that the claimant has not sustained the burden of proving causal connection, and the award will be reversed and the claim dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-10\"> In a letter introduced by the employer, Dr. John J. Nolan concluded from his review of the records that this \u201cis a case of spontaneous progressive, thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism, inadequately treated prior to the time of [Lucas\u2019s] death ... and having no demonstrable relationship to an alleged injury at work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">See <em>Colonna\u2019s Shipyard </em>v. <em>O\u2019Hearne, </em>200 F.2d 220 (4th Cir, 1952), where the court reversed a federal compensation award because the finding of causal connection between an ankle injury and a thrombus which required amputation of a leg was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
