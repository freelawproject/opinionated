Plaintiffs, Philip S. Jessup, II, and Elizabeth H. Jessup Smith, are among the heirs-at-law of the decedent, they being two of the children of her deceased brother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Philip Jessup. The defendants are the executor of the decedent\u2019s estate, her other heirs-at-law, and those persons identified as possible legatees under the holographic instrument mentioned above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Plaintiffs allege that the August 1, 1960 writing is not a valid will for the reason that it fails to manifest sufficient finality of intent, does not contain the essential dispositive provisions and, even if properly executed, was subsequently revoked by mutilation. Upon a trial of the case, the court below refused to admit certain evidence proffered by plaintiffs, struck their evidence, and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint <em>devisavit vel non.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Betty Sue. Jessup died on June 7, 1976, following a hospitalization period of two months. Her estate is alleged to have a value in excess of one million dollars. On July 12, 1976, two paper writings, the above one dated August 1, 1960, and the other, a \u201cmemo,\u201d dated September 15, 1973, from the decedent to Lucy Ann P. Celia, her niece, were probated in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County as the last will of the decedent. It is stipulated that both writings are entirely in the handwriting of Miss Jessup. The testamentary capacity of the decedent to make a will is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The August 1, 1960 writing was found in a small (6\" x <em>9\") </em>notebook with a blue cover. The first page of the book is neither numbered nor lettered, but on it is printed the word \u201cWill.\u201d The back of the first page is completely blank except in the top left corner is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>written \u201cPage 1(a).\u201d Thereafter three pages were torn and removed from the book. These pages have not been found, and there is no evidence showing when and under what circumstances they were removed. The writing begins on page 4 and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">Page 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>Special Instructions To Executors:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">I want No argument, dissension, unpleasantries nor \u201cbickering\u201d about my estate. 4 -am in-my- right Mind- -t-know-wha\u00ed-4 own and have-evidenee in my records to prove it \u2014 I leave it to the sole discretion of my appointed Executors to decide upon any question about properties which might have been willed to beneficiaries which might have died prior to my death and which I might have neglected to correct on the (a) side of the page referring to such bequeaths or properties which I might have disposed of, otherwise, prior to my death.

The proponents of the will then called Lawrence R. Burruss, Executive Vice President of the Monticello Dairy, Inc., a close personal friend and a business associate of the decedent. Mr. Burruss testified that he made a number of visits to the decedent during her last illness. He said that during one of these visits she requested that he obtain from her private office certain documents and told him where they would be found. Burruss said that they were found lying on an open shelf underneath a ledger book, along with \u201ctax papers,\u201d etc. The documents he removed from the office were the August 1, 1960 writing and another writing dated January 19, 1963, hereinafter set forth. The witness said that he placed the documents and four or five blank books of a similar nature in a manila folder, took them to the hospital, and left them on the nightstand beside the decedent\u2019s bed. He did not discuss the contents of the documents with the decedent at that time or at any time thereafter. Approximately two weeks later her brother, James Jessup, gave the documents to Burruss to be returned to the decedent\u2019s office for safekeeping. At the conclusion of Burruss\u2019 testimony the proponents of the will rested their case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the contestants made a motion to strike upon the same grounds as those alleged on this appeal. The motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The contestants then sought to introduce certain evidence which was objected to by the proponents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sustained the objection and refused to admit the evidence. Thereupon, on motion of the proponents, the court held, as a matter of law, that the paper writings dated August 1, 1960, and September 15, 1973, constituted the last will and testament of Betty Sue Jessup and that there existed no triable issue of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The contestants sought to introduce testimony that Miss Jessup was an exceptionally able, astute, and knowledgeable business woman who served as the chief executive officer of the Monticello Dairy and operated the business in a successful manner over a long period of years. The contestants attempted to introduce the evidence of Dr. and Mrs. Francis G. Langford, Jr., neighbors of the decedent. Dr. Langford is a former President of Longwood College. Mrs. Langford was a classmate of Miss Jessup at the College of William and Mary. The Langfords would have testified that at one time Miss Jessup had stated to them that she wanted to give them a lot that adjoined their property and said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t put it in my will, I\u2019m going to leave a letter. . . .\u201d Mrs. Langford said that several years before Miss Jessup died she heard the decedent say to her husband, \u201cI suppose I should be thinking about making a will,\u201d and asked Dr. Langford, \u201cDo you have any suggestions?\u201d She said her husband suggested his own lawyer, Junius Fishburne, and another lawyer, Mortimer M. Caplin, both of whom Miss Jessup knew, but that Miss Jessup was not interested in having them \u201cdo the will,\u201d and never mentioned the matter again. Dr. Langford confirmed that the decedent asked him if he might suggest someone to make a will for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The contestants also sought to introduce in evidence an unsigned writing by the decedent, dated January 19, 1963, which Mr. Burruss found in the decedent\u2019s office at the time the August 1, 1960 writing was located. This January 19, 1963 writing is also contained in a 6\" x 9\" notebook. There is no legend or writing on the cover of the notebook or on the first page. On the back of the first page in the top left-hand corner is written \u201cPage 1(a).\u201d Thereafter follow three pages, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\n<em>Page 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">January 19, 1963</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\n<em>EXPLANATION:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">I have chosen to write this, My last Will and Testament in my own hand writing as I sit here in my office, in sound mind and good health, being considered mentally competent to operate this Business (Monticello Dairy, Inc., Branches and subsidiaries) of which I am President and General Manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">Being very busy with responsibilities, both in business and management of the Family home \u2014 it will not be possible for me to complete this Will at one \u201csitting\u201d \u2014 It will require weeks .... or Months... or, perhaps, years \u2014 Since it must be written in this Manner, I shall sign each section as I write in order that, in case of unexpected death or disability, no portion of the will will Be Unsigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">Realizing that properties change and that named beneficiaries may be changed, because of death or other possible reasons, I shall write the main substance of my wishes (as they are at the time of each \u201cwriting\u201d) on the RIGHT-HAND sheets of this booklet as it lays on the desk before me \u2014 (In This Instance, <em>PAGE 1 </em>I shall leave <em>Blank </em>the opposite sheet of each double page (in This Instance, <em>PAGE 1 (a)), </em>as I write, in order that future <em>changes </em>or <em>corrections </em>may be made, thereon, as time goes on.

Pages 4 through 20 (and the backs thereof, pages 5(a) through 20(a)) are all numbered but are otherwise blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The contestants claim, <em>inter alia, </em>that the will of Betty Sue Jessup is invalid because of its failure to manifest sufficient finality of testamentary intent, and that the admitted mutilation of the will by the decedent was done with the intent to revoke it. Code \u00a7 64.1-58 provides that a will can be revoked \u201c. . . by the testator . . . cutting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tearing, burning, obliterating, cancelling or destroying the same, or the signature thereto, with the intent to revoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>192 Va. 684, 66 S.E.2d 504 (1951), it was not disputed that the paper writing involved there, if not revoked, met the requirements of a holographic will. The issue there, as here, was whether the evidence showed, as a matter of law, that the will involved had been revoked in some manner required by Code \u00a7 64-59 (predecessor of Code \u00a7 64.1-58). Mr. Justice Eggleston, later Chief Justice, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">As is pointed out in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Royall, </em>163 Va. 492, 497, 175 S.E. 748: \u201c*** revocation of a will by cancellation within the meaning of the statute, contemplates marks or lines across the written parts of the instrument, or a physical defacement, or some mutilation of the writing itself, with the intent to revoke. ***\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cIt is generally agreed that if a will produced for probate, which is shown to have been in the custody of the testator after its execution, was found among the testator\u2019s effects after his death, in such a state of mutilation, obliteration, or cancellation as represents a sufficient act of revocation within the meaning of the applicable statute, it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that such act was performed by the testator with the intention of revoking the instrument. *** Whatever presumption arises from acts of cancelation or mutilation is rebuttable, but the burden of the rebuttal rests upon the proponent.\u201d 57 Am. Jur., Wills, \u00a7 550, pp. 378, 379.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 689, 66 S.E.2d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 919 (5th ed. 1979), the word \u201cmutilation\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">As applied to written documents, such as wills, court records, and the like, this term means rendering the document imperfect by the subtraction from it of some essential part, as, by cutting, tearing, burning, or erasure, but without totally destroying it. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">We cannot ignore the background of this case. We are dealing with an estate consisting of real property and of tangible and intangible personal property. The owner was an educated woman, the chief executive officer of a successful business enterprise, who obviously had a layman\u2019s knowledge of wills and their importance but of course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>lacked drafting skills. We have no difficulty in concluding that when the August 1, 1960 document was written by Miss Jessup, it was an act on her part incident to making a testamentary disposition of her properties. It is equally as clear to us that what was written by the decedent was not intended to be complete and final. She intended to write more and said so. A critical question is whether what she did write had the finality of testamentary intent. Was the signature of the decedent affixed by her to indicate finality of intention to authenticate the concluded act of a partial disposition of her property, or was her signature simply an identification of the writing as hers and to make manifest that it was not a final act and that more was to follow? A further crucial issue is, assuming the decedent did intend a partial disposition when she signed her name on page 11 of the writing and dated it August 1, 1960, did she subsequently revoke and render the writing imperfect when she cut and tore essential parts therefrom?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201cP]t is not necessary to the validity of a will that it should have a testamentary form, or that the decedent should know that he had performed a testamentary act, or that he should intend to perform such act.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>183 Va. 663, 667, 33 S.E.2d 181, 182-83 (1945). The informal style of the writing can be explained by the.fact that Miss Jessup had no legal training and was attempting to write a document she was ill-equipped to author. However, the imperfections, inconsistencies, and omissions in substance, of what remained after mutilation, cannot be so easily explained. They are numerous and must be considered in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">1. Although Miss Jessup had a valuable estate, the settlement of which would be involved and complicated, she did not name an executor. Notwithstanding that she referred to the appointed executor or executors and gave them wide discretion, nowhere in the writing that remains does she name any person to administer her estate. We can surmise that her executor was named either in the first three pages that were destroyed, or that an executor would have been named had the decedent ever resumed the writing of the August 1, 1960 document. By reference to the January 19, 1963 writing, we can also surmise that the John Battle mentioned in the January 1, 1960 writing was not the former Governor of Virginia but John S. Battle, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">2. The proponents of the will made no effort to show when and under what circumstances the decedent destroyed the first three pages of her will and cut therefrom a paragraph. The record is completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>silent on this. Arguably, these pages and paragraph contained specific devises and bequests for, in the \u201cspecial instructions to executors\u201d that followed the excised pages, the decedent often used the past tense and referred to <em>appointed </em>executor, property of which <em>might have been willed, </em>beneficiaries <em>named </em>herein, items of property <em>bequeathed </em>herein, the bequests herein, excluding from any beneficiary <em>named, whatever 1 have willed </em>him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">3. Nowhere in the writing do we find the usual and customary dispositive clauses, such as \u201cI bequeath\u201d or \u201cI devise.\u201d In her \u201cinstructions\u201d the decedent used precatory language only. She \u201cinstructed\u201d her executors that she would \u201clike\u201d Lawrence R. Burruss to have ten shares of her stock; she \u201cwanted\u201d her brother James to have her Pepsi Cola stock. Clearly, at the time written, the decedent \u201cwanted\u201d the debts due her by others to be cancelled, and although the language to express the desire is imperfect, it also appears that in August 1960 she wanted the seven named \u201cloyal employees of long service\u201d to have the amounts set opposite their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">4. The writing contains no residuary clause. To construe the first paragraph on page 6 of the writing as a residuary clause, as the proponents contend it should be construed, would indeed be a tortured construction. While there is a reference to properties and belongings, the decedent was referring to items which she may have overlooked and not bequeathed in her will, items of a kind and character usually sold to and by dealers. A direction that \u201cany member of my family\u201d have the privilege of purchasing land or stocks and bonds at a 20% discount of fair market value would have been the surest way of promoting the dissension and bickering which the decedent deplored and desired to avoid. Obviously the paragraph refers only to tangible personal property of the decedent which could have been of sentimental or practical value to her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">5. The decedent failed to name any charitable organizations as a beneficiary of her will despite her expressed intent to list and name such charities. We can only speculate on whether any were named before the mutilation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">6. The writing speaks of beneficiaries and members of her family, of whom there were many. Included in her immediate family were brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, grandnieces, and grandnephews. Notwithstanding this fact, only one relative of the decedent (her brother James) is mentioned by name in the entire writing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>7. Mr. Burruss testified that the decedent had \u201ctwo loves,\u201d her father and the Monticello Dairy. Although in the writing she referred to the stock in the dairy as her \u201cmajor concern,\u201d she made no disposition of this stock, except to express a conditional desire for Mr. Burruss to have ten shares.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Apparently the paragraph she cut from page 10 of her alleged will concerned this stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">8. When Miss Jessup decided to bequeath her doll collection to Caroline Celia, she did not add the bequest to the August 1, 1960 writing, as might have been expected in view of the blank (a) pages in the booklet, and her expressed intent to \u201cresume later\u201d the writing. The memo to Lucy Ann Celia makes no reference to any existing will of the decedent. On the contrary, there is a plain intimation in it that at some time, subsequent to September 15, 1973, Miss Jessup planned to \u201crecord provisions in some other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">9. In the note found on page 5 of the August 1, 1960 writing, the decedent refers to the booklet in which she was writing as \u201cmy last will.\u201d It was in this booklet that the decedent indicated four times that the writing would not be completed in one sitting. On the last page the decedent wrote very little, but three times wrote that she had not finished. She said, \u201cI haven\u2019t time to write more now,\u201d and \u201cwill resume later.\u201d And then, as if an afterthought, she made a note of the fact that she wanted her brother James to have her Pepsi Cola stock and again she wrote \u201cwill resume later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Well-established principles decree that in construing a will we must seek to determine what the testator meant by what was said in the will. We look to the whole of the will and where possible give effect to all its provisions. <em>Spicely </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>199 Va. 703, 706, 101 S.E.2d 567, 569 (1958). These same principles apply in construing a mutilated will. We must take the will as the testator left it and look at what remains. <em>Ruth </em>v. <em>Jester, Adm\u2019r, </em>198 Va. 887, 890, 96 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1957). The proponents of Miss Jessup\u2019s will contend that what is left of the August 1, 1960 writing is her last will and testament and was so intended by her. They say that the will does contain a residuary clause and that the will makes a complete and final disposition of her estate. In effect, the proponents say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the will was not rendered imperfect by the mutilation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">If the proponents are correct, then we must find from the four corners of the document that the decedent, in spite of her deliberate act of mutilation during which she completely destroyed three pages and an additional paragraph on another page, did not intend to revoke the entire document, and that what was left constitutes her will. We must find that she intended to leave as her last will and testament a will which appoints no executor to administer it, is devoid of specific devises, makes only one bequest to any member of her family by name, makes no bequests or gifts to charitable organizations, virtually ignores brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews, provides no guidance for the future operation of a business, to the operation of which she had devoted her life, and gives her entire estate to grandnieces and grandnephews. (On August 1, 1960, the decedent had two grandnephews, ages five and two, and one grandniece, age two, all being the grandchildren of one deceased sister.) We find it difficult to believe that such an unlikely result was ever intended by the decedent, or that she had any intention at the time she mutilated her will other than the intent to render the will inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Miss Jessup intentionally mutilated her will. This fact is not denied. The proponents are therefore faced with the presumption that it was revoked. At the conclusion of their case and after the paper writing of August 1, 1960, and the \u201cmemo\u201d had been introduced and Mr. Burruss had testified, the trial court compared the facts in <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221 (1973), with the facts in the instant case and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">And reading on [from McKenzie] \u201cSince total obliteration could have been achieved as readily as partial obliteration, partial obliteration is \u2018evidence to the contrary\u2019.\u201d Now in that case it turned on the question of accident, in this case there is no question but what the act can be presumed to be intentional having been in the possession of the testatrix. The only question is whether it is sufficient to indicate an intent to revoke the entire instrument and, as the court said, examining the instrument itself can furnish the evidence of a contrary intent, that which is the rebuttal required of the proponents. My ruling is that the motion to strike should be denied on that ground, that the instrument itself reveals circumstances which are sufficient to be considered rebuttal testimony or rebuttal evidence, not testimony within the meaning of the McKenzie case and the statute. And the fact that the signature was intact and that a number of pages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>were intact indicates partial revocation and if further revocation is to be decided or declared, it would have to be upon the evidence offered by the contestants, which, of course they have the right to do. As the court goes on to say on page 107, \u201cwith the presumption neutralized, the burden of proving revocation falls on the contestants.\u201d And that\u2019s where we find the evidence on this issue right now. On the revocation I rule that the presumption has been neutralized and the burden shifts to the contestants to show any revocation which may include these acts or any other that this is partial evidence for them as well. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The trial court took out of context and misconstrued our language in <em>McKenzie </em>to the effect that \u201c[s]ince total obliteration [of the will] could have been achieved as readily as partial obliteration, partial obliteration is \u2018evidence to the contrary\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 197 S.E.2d at 223. There, a paper writing written wholly in the handwriting of a decedent was found in her personal effects and presented to the clerk of the court for probate. The clerk refused probate because a part of the decedent\u2019s signature and the right-hand portion of each of the five pages of the instrument were completely obliterated and illegible to the human eye. This order was appealed by parties who were named as beneficiaries in the will. Upon a trial the proponents of the will established by expert testimony that they were among the beneficiaries under the purported will and that what had been obliterated and was illegible to the human eye was made legible and could be deciphered by ultra violet examination, including the signature of the testatrix. The expert testimony showed that the obliteration to the instrument was probably caused by its being soaked in water for a period of at least three days. The proponents showed that some time after the will was written a water pipe burst in the room above the room in which the will was found. They also showed that when the damage to the will occurred it was encased in an envelope and that the will must have been completely dried out before the envelope was ever opened. Upon the basis of this testimony the trial court refused to strike the evidence of the proponents. We agreed and held specifically <em>that the proponents\u2019 evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption. </em>Those who contested the will in <em>McKenzie </em>attempted to show that the decedent stated that she had spilled a drink on her will, it was no good, had been ruined, and her signature could not be read. We held that the trial court did not err in holding as a matter of law that the contestants had failed to bear the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>proving that the obliteration was an act performed by the testatrix with the intention of revoking her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In <em>McKenzie </em>we took occasion to compare <em>Sutherland </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>192 Va. 764, 66 S.E.2d 537 (1951), and <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>192 Va. 684, 66 S.E.2d 504 (1951). We noted that <em>Sutherland </em>involved a lost will and that there the presumption of revocation had to be overcome by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d And we noted that <em>Franklin </em>involved a defaced will, and the presumption of revocation cast upon the proponents -the burden -of producing \u201cevidence to the contrary.\u201d This evidence did not necessarily have to be testimonial but could be physical and circumstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We did not hold, however, that the presumption of revocation applied only where there was a complete destruction, obliteration, or cancellation of a will. It also applies to a will which has been tampered with in some manner by cutting, tearing, or burning. Our holding went to the strength of the presumption and to the weight of the testimony necessary to overcome, rebut, or neutralize the presumption. A mutilated will seldom is one that is completely destroyed. There usually remain words, phrases, paragraphs, and even pages that are legible and unmarked. The mere fact that the mutilation is only partial does not of itself satisfy or neutralize the presumption of a revocation. The presumption remains until it is overcome. The kind and degree of the mutilation and a consideration of what remains of the mutilated instrument may or may not be sufficient to overcome the presumption. If such were not true, there would be no presumption without a total destruction or a total obliteration, and the presumption would serve no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In <em>McKenzie </em>the presumption was overcome by expert and other testimony and by an inference that the immersion was accidental and not purposeful. Our reasoning was that a person intending to revoke a will by mutilation, and who selected immersion in water as the means, would not likely immerse only the upper right-hand portions of the will\u2019s pages and the signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em>Hospital </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>199 Va. 524, 100 S.E.2d 721 (1957), relied upon by defendants, is inapposite. That case did not deal with a mutilated will, one from which pages had been torn and a paragraph deleted. There, the testator cancelled a clause (bequest) in his holographic will by drawing lines through the names and making an appropriate marginal notation. We found such a partial revocation of a holographic will by interlineation to be unobjectionable, citing <em>Ruth </em>v. <em>Jester, Adm\u2019r, supra. </em>An example of a deletion can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>found in the case under review. Miss Jessup deleted (lined through) from page 4 of her August 1, 1960 will the sentence, \u201cI am in my right Mind \u2014 I know what I own and have evidence in my records to prove it \u2014 \u201d Had she done nothing further to her \u201cbooklet\u201d we would not be concerned here with any presumption to revoke. But such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Borrowing language from <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Sharpe and Others, </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 249, 255 (1830), we believe the main question is whether Miss Jessup, by tearing pages and paragraphs from her booklet, designed what was left as a will, or only as a note, memorandum, project, or plan, or, using her language, as \u201cinstructions\u201d to be followed as guidelines of a will to be made by her at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The contestants say that it was the intention of Miss Jessup to revoke her will. They contend that the substance of the will was torn or cut therefrom and that what was left, designated as \u201cspecial instructions,\u201d was in fact a memorandum which the decedent planned to use, and did in fact use, when she attempted to write a second will in January 1963.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The contestants here are aided by a presumption which the proponents had to overcome, by the fact that even prior to the mutilation the decedent had not completed her will and planned to write more, and by the further fact that what was left unmutilated obviously did not operate to dispose of the decedent\u2019s estate in the manner she had contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The only evidence of the proponents to overcome the presumption of revocation is the remnant of the August 1, 1960 mutilated document from which it can be argued that at the time it was written the decedent desired her debts to be paid, debts due her to be forgiven, certain dairy employees rewarded, ten shares of dairy stock given to Mr. Burruss, and her Pepsi Cola stock given to her brother, all gifts having been expressed in precatory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Upon a consideration of what remains of the August 1, 1960 will, we hold that the decedent intended by her act of mutilation to revoke it. The presumption that she did so intend to revoke has not been overcome by evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying the contestants\u2019 motion to strike the evidence introduced by the proponents of the will. Miss Jessup\u2019s will of August 1, 1960, having been revoked by mutilation, the final decree of the lower court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>reversed, and this cause is remanded for such further proceedings as may be indicated consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> John S.
