The appeal arises from a judgment confirming a jury verdict which convicted Rupert F. Pearson, Jr., of second degree murder of John Lundmark and abduction of Lynn Shifflett. In accordance with the verdict, the trial court imposed concurrent sentences of 20 years and six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Before reviewing the facts and circumstances pertinent to the motion to suppress, we will summarize the evidence bearing upon the merits of the two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The evidence at trial showed that Pearson and Lynn Shifflett had been living together as man and wife in an apartment near Vienna. Shortly after midnight on the morning of May 29, 1979, the couple became involved in a heated argument. Shifflett admitted she had spent the night with a mutual acquaintance, John Lundmark, and Pearson attempted to force her to confess that they had had sexual intercourse. Shifflett testified that, over a period of \u201cabout three hours\u201d, Pearson assaulted her with a butcher knife and antique sword, \u201cbanged\u201d her head against the wall, broke the sword over her knee, knocked her to the floor, and held the knife to her face threatening \u201cto carve John\u2019s initials in [her] forehead.\u201d During the course of the assault, Shifflett \u201cpassed out\u201d twice and Pearson shut her in a closet for a short interval. She asked him to \u201cjust let me leave\u201d but \u201c[h]e wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d Then, \u201che held the knife to my throat and made me dial [Lundmark\u2019s] phone number\u201d. Lundmark agreed to \u201ccome and get me. . . and just hung up the phone.\u201d At that point, Pearson \u201cstated that he was going to kill us and that he was going out to his truck to get his gun.\u201d While he was gone, Shifflett ran from the apartment and hid in the shrubbery in front of the building. She saw Pearson returning to the apartment \u201cand he had the gun tucked in his pants.\u201d Ten minutes later, Lundmark drove into the parking lot and Shifflett attempted to intercept him before he entered the building. Unsuccessful, she tried to call the police from a pay telephone, but the telephone was out of \u25a0 order. \u201cSo, a few minutes later, that\u2019s when I heard the gunshot, and so I went to my car. . . and drove home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Testifying at trial, Pearson said that Shifflett confessed that she \u201cwent to bed\u201d with Lundmark. He admitted he had become enraged, hit her in the face, thrown her against the wall, and forced her to call Lundmark, but he denied that he had held a knife to her throat, choked her, or restrained her from leaving. He could \u201cnot recall telling her\u201d that he was going to kill Lundmark. He explained that he forced her to call Lundmark \u201c[s]o I could give him... [a] whipping or maybe just to scare her or scare him or something.\u201d He had gone to the truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>to get the gun, he said, to \u201cprotect\u201d himself in the event Lundmark should bring his two roommates with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">When Pearson discovered Shifflett had left the apartment, he searched the grounds for her. When he re-entered the building, he saw Lundmark leaning against the corridor wall opposite the apartment door. Describing what happened next, Pearson testified: \u201cHe made fists when he saw me coming down the steps.\u201d \u201cWe both started at each other.\u201d \u201cI hit him in the mouth.\u201d \u201cWe just kept scuffling around and then the gun got pulled out that I had and went off. The next thing I knew, he was lying down on the floor and there is the gun beside him.\u201d \u201cI picked up the gun and ran outside and threw it in a storm drain or whatever.\u201d Pearson then called a rescue squad and \u201ctold them a guy had been shot in the hallway\u201d. While waiting for the rescue squad, Pearson placed a towel on Lundmark\u2019s head and \u201cbeat on his chest a few times\u201d because \u201che had stopped breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">Officer John Monroe arrived about 3:30 a.m. and found Lundmark lying on the floor. Monroe testified that Pearson told him that \u201che was shot in the head.\u201d Investigator Colin J. Kozloff, who arrived about 5:00 a.m., testified that Pearson told him that he didn\u2019t know anything about what had happened; that he \u201cheard a noise or something outside the door and opened it and saw a subject lying on the floor of the hallway, called the police and that was it\u201d; and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really know\u201d the victim except \u201cby the name of John\u201d, a person he had seen \u201con occasions.\u201d On cross-examination, Pearson admitted he had lied because, he said, he wanted \u201c[t]o get my motorcycle and my truck. . . to my father\u2019s. I was afraid it would get stolen.\u201d \u201cI figured I would get my truck up there and come back and tell the truth.\u201d With the officer\u2019s permission, Pearson left and reported for work where he remained until arrested that afternoon. Kozloff then contacted and interviewed Lynn Shifflett. Based upon what she told him, he acquired a warrant for Pearson\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">The remainder of Kozloff\u2019s trial testimony was addressed to the events following the arrest and the acquisition of the evidence Pearson sought to suppress. Over Pearson\u2019s objection, a taped transcription of his post-arrest statement to the police was played to the jury. With minor exceptions concerning the details of Pearson\u2019s assault upon Shifflett, his purpose in forcing her to call Lundmark, and his reasons for arming himself, the transcribed statement was substantially consistent with Pearson\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">The testimony at the pre-trial suppression hearing showed that Pearson was arrested at 2:30 p.m. and was promptly advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In response to definitive questions, he stated that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>not want to make a statement and that he wanted a lawyer to represent him. Pearson was arraigned before a magistrate at 2:45 p.m. and \u201cprocessed\u201d. At 3:45 p.m. investigators Kozloff and Lawrence Oliff took him into a small room containing only one window in the door. Without repeating the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, they talked with him until 4:20 p.m. Oliff testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-5\">\u201cA. I asked him again the location of his truck. I told him that we thought that the weapon allegedly involved may be in the truck. That if he was found operating the truck, the truck would be seized and searched for the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-6\">\u201cI asked him if the truck was at his father\u2019s and he said it was at his father\u2019s. I asked him. where his father lived and he gave me directions of how to get to his father\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-7\">\u201cI asked him if the gun was in the truck. He didn\u2019t indicate one way or another. I told him that I didn\u2019t want to go all the way up there and search his vehicle if the gun was not there. Was the gun somewhere else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-8\">\u201cHe indicated that we ought to go to Vienna. I said, \u2018for what?\u2019 He said, T just think we ought to go there.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-9\">\u201cI said, \u2018well, I don\u2019t want to go on a wild goose chase driving all over Fairfax County. Is the gun in Vienna.\u2019 He indicated\u2014 I don\u2019t remember his exact words, but he indicated it would be in our best interest to go to Vienna to recover the weapon. Subsequently, we went to Vienna.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">Pearson testified that, at the time he was arrested, the officers had \u201casked me where my truck was and motorcycle and where the gun was\u201d and \u201cI told them I didn\u2019t have anything to say about it.\u201d When they \u201cput me in this little room.\u201d, he continued, \u201cOliff said that he is going to impound my truck and hassle my father, impound my motorcycle unless I told him where this weapon was\u201d and that the reason he agreed to take the officers to Vienna to get the gun was \u201c[bjecause I thought they were going to do something to my father or to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">Guided by Pearson, the officers retrieved the gun about 5:00 p.m. from a storm sewer in the parking lot. Recognizing a friend in a passing car, Pearson asked the officers to stop it. Pearson\u2019s friend gave him a note containing the name of a lawyer. The officers then took him to his apartment where they drafted a handwritten form granting consent to search and stating, \u201cI do not request a attorney at this time.\u201d Pearson signed the form, and the officers seized the butcher knife and sword introduced in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>From there, the officers took Pearson to their office where the three men ate sandwiches they had bought on the way. At 6:59 p.m., Pearson signed a standard <em>Miranda </em>waiver form which contained this additional language: \u201cI know what my rights are. I am willing to make a statement and answer questions. I do not want a lawyer. I understand and know what I am doing. No promises or threats have been made to me by anyone.\u201d Responding to the officer\u2019s questions, Pearson gave the tape-recorded statement played at trial. A stenographer arrived at 7:40 p.m. and began transcribing the statement. After Pearson had read and initialed the first page, he stopped and refused to go on. He explained that he realized that the statement was incriminating and \u2019 decided that \u201cI could take my chances on them beating me up or something instead of signing something to put me in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Shortly after he was taken to jail at 9:25 p.m., Pearson called an attorney. He said that he had not asked permission to make a call earlier because he did not know he had the right to do so. Pearson was released on bond, rearrested on the abduction charge, and again released on bond pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Holding that Pearson had not been subjected to coercion and that his conduct and statements were voluntary, the trial court denied the pre-trial motion to suppress and, during the trial, overruled Pearson\u2019s objections to the introduction of the gun, the knife, the sword, and the tape-recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The defendant asks us to reverse his convictions on the ground the challenged evidence was the product of violations of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As soon as he was arrested and given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he invoked his right to remain silent and his right to counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-8\">\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any tim,e prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>gation must cease... . [A]ny statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 473-74 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">As applied in <em>Miranda, </em>the Sixth Amendment right to \u201cAssistance of Counsel\u201d is an essential accessory to the right against self-incrimination. \u201c[T]he right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. The right to counsel attaches when \u201cthe investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into custody, [and] the police carry out a process of interrogation that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements\u201d. <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 490-91 (1964); <em>accord, Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 883, 891-92, 140 S.E.2d 688, 694 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">\u201cThe accused may, of course, intelligently and knowingly waive his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel either at a pretrial stage or at the trial.\u201d <em>Escobedo, </em>378 U.S. at 490, n. 14. \u201cThere is no question but that a defendant who has asserted his <em>Miranda </em>rights may change his mind and waive them.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>608 F.2d 1011, 1013 (4th Cir. 1979). <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 146, 157-58, 255 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1979). <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 677, 678, 232 S.E.2d 738, 739 (1977); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 211 </em>Va. 307, 311, 227 S.E.2d 737, 740-41 (1976); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 725, 727-28, 187 S.E.2d 180, 182-83 <em>(1912); Skinner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 260, 263, 183 S.E.2d 725, 728 (1971); <em>Land </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 211 </em>Va. 223, 228-29, 176 S.E.2d 586, 590 (1970); <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 229, 241, 169 S.E.2d 419, 427 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">However, \u201ca heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to. . .counsel.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. And \u201cthe admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 104 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">Less than two hours after Pearson had expressly claimed his rights, the officers took him into a small room. Since he had already been arraigned and \u201cprocessed\u201d, they could have had but one purpose. \u201c[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01 (1980). <em>See also Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387 (1977). As the record shows, Pearson was subjected, without benefit of new <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to express questioning. While the Attorney General insists that the questions put to him. were \u201cinnocuous\u201d and intended only \u201cto save the defendant\u2019s family and others some trouble\u201d, the questions concerning the location of the truck and gun were clearly intended to elicit information incriminating Pearson. The investigation, focusing upon him alone, had reached the accusatory stage. The officers knew that seizure of the gun, identification of its ownership, and tests establishing it as the murder weapon could be used as evidence to reinforce Shifflett\u2019s testimony against the defendant. While such evidence may have been merely corroborative, it was distinctly incriminating. \u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it does not distinguish degrees of incrimination.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The Attorney General next maintains that Pearson never specifically responded to the officers\u2019 questions \u201cbut, instead, <em>volunteered </em>that he wanted to take them to Vienna.\u201d \u201c[I]t was at this point,\u201d the Attorney General says, \u201cthat the defendant implicitly waived his previously asserted rights.\u201d We accept neither the premise nor the conclusion. Although Pearson\u2019s verbal replies were not literally responsive, they were effectually so; he told the officers where the gun could be found, and he helped them find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">The defendant testified that he did so only out of concern for the security of his property and his own safety and that of his father. We disregard that testimony as immaterial to our analysis. We are of opinion that the officers did not scrupulously honor Pearson\u2019s right to cut off questioning and his right to counsel. For that reason, his incriminating response was not constitutionally voluntary. Hence, it was not a constitutionally-sufficient waiver of his previously asserted rights. Manifestly, the evidence seized and the statement taken were the tainted products of the constitutional violations. We hold, therefore, that the court below erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and his objections to admission of the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">We consider now whether, as the Attorney 'General contends, the evidence apart from the inadmissible evidence is sufficient to enable us \u201cto declare a belief that [the error] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">The Supreme Court has held that, when a conviction rests in part upon an involuntary confession, the harmless error rule \u201cis an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>permissible doctrine.\u201d <em>Lynumn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>372 U.S. 528, 537 (1963). <em>See also Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 518 (1963); <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>356 U.S. 560, 568 (1958). But in <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371 (1972), a majority of the Justices applied the doctrine and affirmed a conviction challenged on Fifth and Sixth Amendment grounds. Although a minority believed the evidence did not satisfy the <em>Chapman </em>standard, the dissent did not dispute the majority\u2019s view that the doctrine is applicable on review of appeals involving Fifth and Sixth Amendment violations. And, relying upon <em>Milton, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has applied the doctrine in a case, much like the one at bar, where the police induced the accused to confess by continuing to question him after he had invoked his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>565 F.2d 86, 92 (6th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1070 (1978). <em>See also Harryman </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>616 F.2d 870, 875 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Carvey </em>v. <em>LeFevre, </em>611 F.2d 19, 23 (2nd Cir. 1979); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>584 F.2d 1185, 1189 (2nd Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 945 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Applying the doctrine here, we examine the evidence lawfully admitted at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pearson argues that once the incompetent evidence was introduced, \u201cthe defendant was forced to testify at trial.\u201d When an accused takes the stand \u201cin order to overcome the impact of confessions illegally obtained and hence improperly introduced, then his testimony was tainted by the same illegality that rendered the confessions themselves inadmissible.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>392 U.S. 219, 223 (1968). While Pearson\u2019s trial testimony did not \u201covercome the impact\u201d of his tape-recorded statement but, rather, confirmed it in all material respects, we will not notice any of his inculpatory testimony in considering whether the error committed below was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">We find Shifflett\u2019s testimony altogether sufficient to prove all the elements of the crime of abduction as those elements are specifically stated in Code \u00a7 18.2-47,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we address our harmless error inquiry to Pearson\u2019s conviction of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">\u201cThe burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>reasonable doubt that motive, time, place, means and conduct concur in pointing out the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.\u201d <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 309, 312, 170 S.E.2d 771, 773 (1969). All of the competent testimony at trial shows that Pearson was present at the <em>place </em>of the crime immediately before and after the <em>time </em>it was committed. Shifflett saw him enter the apartment building after Lundmark arrived and, a few minutes later, heard a gunshot. Lundmark died of a gunshot wound, and Shifflett had seen a gun in Pearson\u2019s pocket as he entered the building. Thus, it is plain the defendant had the <em>means </em>as well as the opportunity to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">And Shifflett\u2019s narrative of events preceding the killing establishes the <em>motive </em>to kill. Jealous and enraged by what he perceived to be Shifflett\u2019s infidelity, Pearson terrorized her in a brutal, protracted assault, forced her to call Lundmark to come to her aid, threatened to kill him, armed himself with a loaded gun, and remained at the apartment until Lundmark had arrived. Such evidence entirely justifies the jury\u2019s finding of <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">\u201cIn all cases of circumstantial evidence <em>the conduct of </em>the accused is always an important factor in the estimate of the weight of circumstances which point to his guilt.\u201d <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 912, 923 (1879). Pearson\u2019s words and deeds following the crime are factors equally as important as his earlier conduct. As appears from the testimony of the officers and that of Shifflett considered together, the story he told the authorities was a deliberate falsehood designed to conceal what had happened and focus suspicion upon some fugitive gunman. Significantly, he persisted in that falsehood until he learned the police had been told something about the gun he carried in his truck. The jury could have concluded that such conduct was not that of a man innocently involved in an accidental shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-7\">Ignoring all the evidence which should have been suppressed, we are of opinion the Commonwealth discharged its evidentiary burden of \u201cpointing out the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.\u201d <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>Indeed, there is nothing of record to support a reasonable hypothesis to the contrary. Accordingly, we \u201cdeclare a belief that [the error committed below] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, and the judgments will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1110-9\"> Alternatively, Pearson argued on brief that this evidence should have been suppressed as the product of a violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-80 which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">\u201c[A]n officer making an arrest under a warrant shall bring the arrested person without unnecessary delay before and return such warrant to a court... or before an official having authority to grant bail, who shall admit him to bail or commit him to jail....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">The purpose of this statute is to safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by proscribing unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment. <em>See Winston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 386, 394, 49 S.E.2d 611, 615 (1948); <em>Sands &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Norvell, </em>126 Va. 384, 101 S.E. 569 (1919). Pearson was taken before a magistrate only 15 minutes after his arrest. The constitutional errors of which he complains did not occur during this interval, and we find no merit in this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1113-8\"> We do not intend to hold that the doctrine of harmless error is applicable in all cases. \u201c[T]here are differences between those confessions which are inherently coercive and which have been traditionally stricken as lacking in voluntariness and those which, though otherwise voluntary, have failed to comply with the strict procedural requirements of <em>Miranda.\u201d United States </em>v. <em>Charlton, supra, </em>565 F.2d at 92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1113-9\"> The question whether asportation is an <em>implied </em>element of the statutory offense is not before us on this appeal. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 872, 275 S.E.2d 592 (1981), this day decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
