We conclude they were not and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Appellant Walter W. Stout, III, Virginia Administrator for the Estate of Thomas C. Halligan, deceased, filed this suit in September of 1976 against appellant Mobility, Inc., appellee Mario Onorati, trading as Moose\u2019s Quality Tractor Parts, and appellee Freddie L. Davis. The plaintiff sought recovery in damages on grounds of negligence and breach of warranty in connection with the death of Halligan which occurred in the City of Richmond on September 18, 1974. Moose\u2019s and Davis filed a special plea asserting the trial court was without jurisdiction- to hear the case as to them because the exclusive rights and remedies of plaintiff\u2019s decedent and his beneficiaries were covered by applicable workmen\u2019s compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing and the taking of a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition in June of 1977, the trial court sustained the special plea and in February of 1978 entered an order dismissing the action as to Moose\u2019s and Davis. Halligan\u2019s administrator and Mobility filed separate petitions for appeal which we granted and consolidated for hearing, limiting consideration of the Halligan appeal to the same two issues raised by Mobility.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">There are several conflicts and inconsistencies in the evidence. In addition, diverse conclusions of fact may be drawn from portions of the testimony. Under familiar principles, we will recite the facts in the light most favorable to the parties prevailing below.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Mobility was a Minnesota corporation engaged in the manufacture of heavy construction equipment such as front-end loaders and spreaders. Fleming Manufacturing Co. was also a Minnesota corporation, operating as a private carrier of goods and engaged in transporting equipment for Mobility and others. Halligan was a truck driver employed by Fleming.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Moose\u2019s was a Virginia business located in Richmond engaged in buying secondhand pieces of farm equipment for the purpose of salvaging and reselling their usable parts; it was also engaged in storing products manufactured by Mobility. As a part of the latter activity, Moose\u2019s aided in unloading those items upon delivery by Fleming. Moose\u2019s premises covered approximately two acres and included several buildings used \u201cfor warehousing of parts\u201d and \u201ca couple of sheds\u201d employed for storage of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Several years before the accident in question, Moose\u2019s had verbally contracted \u201cto unload, help unload, and store [Mobility\u2019s] equipment\u201d in its Richmond sheds to be later released to Mobility salesmen or customers. The owner of Moose\u2019s testified that because of the space <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>available at his business location, he had \u201call kinds of ways to make a dollar.\u201d He said, \u201cIf the people come to me and want to store equipment, I will store it for a certain amount of dollars.\u201d The charge to perform these functions for Mobility was $25 for each piece of equipment, and Moose\u2019s unloaded and stored approximately 20 pieces of Mobility\u2019s equipment annually. Davis was employed by Moose\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Halligan was under contract with Fleming as an \u201cover the road\u201d truck driver. Pursuant to this agreement, Halligan was also obligated to \u201chelp unload\u201d his cargo for which he was paid extra compensation. The evidence showed that Moose\u2019s employees routinely assisted Fleming drivers in unloading the equipment and relied on the drivers to help, because \u201cthey loaded it, and, so, they knew how to unload [the freight].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On the day in question, Halligan had driven a Fleming tractor-trailer unit from Minnesota to Virginia loaded with five pieces of heavy equipment, including a Mobility front-end loader called a \u201cBig Dipper.\u201d Because the small size of Moose\u2019s loading dock would not accommodate the larger Fleming trucks, it was necessary to transfer the equipment to be stored at Moose\u2019s from the Fleming trailer onto a Moose\u2019s truck to be then unloaded at Moose\u2019s loading dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Just prior to the accident, the unloading of one Big Dipper and two spreaders had commenced. Davis backed Moose\u2019s truck perpendicular to the side of Fleming\u2019s trailer forming a \u201cT.\u201d Halligan unchained the load. Davis mounted the Big Dipper and drove it forward off the Fleming truck and onto Moose\u2019s vehicle. The four wheels of the Big Dipper moved over the bed of Moose\u2019s truck. The two front wheels of the Big Dipper were touching Moose\u2019s vehicle but the rear two wheels were not because the counterweight at the rear of the equipment \u201chung up\u201d on the Fleming vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Then Halligan and Davis, using a jack, raised the Big Dipper until it was free of Fleming\u2019s truck and both assisted in placing \u201csome boards\u201d beneath the rear wheels. Halligan then drove Moose\u2019s truck about five feet forward with Davis on the Big Dipper applying its brakes to hold it in place. Halligan then alighted from the truck to secure the chains on two Big Dippers that were to remain on the Fleming truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">While Halligan was performing that task, Davis jacked the Big Dipper on Moose\u2019s truck up enough to free it of the boards and allowed it to settle to the bed of the truck. At that time, the Big Dipper rolled \u201cor whatever\u201d from the back of Moose\u2019s truck onto Halligan, killing him instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The survivors of Halligan, a resident of Minnesota, have recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from Fleming under the Minnesota Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In a letter opinion sustaining the special plea, the trial judge, applying Virginia law, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">The decedent was required to assist in the unloading of Mobility\u2019s equipment at the defendant [Moose\u2019s] Quality Tractor Parts. The defendant Freddie L. Davis, an employee of [Moose\u2019s], was paid . to assist in the unloading of Mobility equipment. The decedent, Davis and [Moose\u2019s], under the facts, were, at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, all engaged in the trade, business or occupation of each other and none were \u201cother parties\u201d within the meaning and intendment of the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In addition, the trial judge rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that under prevailing conflicts of laws principles, the substantive law of Minnesota and not Virginia should be applied in determining the issues raised by the special plea. That ruling was the subject of the other assignment of error made by both plaintiff and Mobility upon which we granted the appeals. But on brief and during oral argument, Mobility, Moose\u2019s and Davis all represented that it is \u201cimmaterial\u201d which law applies here because the \u201csame ultimate result is reached under Virginia or Minnesota law.\u201d The plaintiff does not dispute these representations. Consequently, in view of the concession, we do not reach the conflicts question and we shall apply Virginia law, as if the plaintiff\u2019s benefits had been paid under the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Under Code \u00a7 65.1-40, the rights and remedies granted by the Act to an employee, on account of personal injury or death by accident, exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee, or his personal representative, at common law or otherwise. But under Code \u00a7 65.1-41, such employee, or his personal representative, is authorized to maintain an action at law against the tortfeasor provided the wrongdoer is an \u201cother party\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 65.1-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Consequently, while the broad question here is whether Moose\u2019s and Davis were \u201cother parties,\u201d the litigants say the precise issue is whether at the time of the accident Halligan was performing work on behalf of his employer, Fleming, that was part of the trade, business or occupation of Davis\u2019 employer, Moose\u2019s. <em>See Bosher </em>v. <em>Jamerson, </em>207 Va. 539, 542, 151 S.E.2d 375, 377 (1966); <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>203 Va. 269, 274, 123 S.E.2d 369, 372 (1962). Stated differently, defendants Davis and Moose\u2019s were \u201cother parties\u201d if at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the accident, Halligan was not performing work that was part of Moose\u2019s trade, business or occupation. <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Walmont, Inc., </em>210 Va. 98, 99, 168 S.E.2d 107, 108 (1969). If Halligan was not so performing, the trial court erred; if he was so engaged, the court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Plaintiff argues the evidence demonstrates the unloading here was not part of Moose\u2019s trade, business or occupation but was merely \u201ctransitional contact between Fleming and Moose\u2019s.\u201d He further contends that \u201cthe principal business\u201d of Moose\u2019s is the sale of used parts and the repair of tractors and that storing of equipment by Moose\u2019s was a mere \u201caccommodation to Mobility and a way of adding some minor revenues to Moose\u2019s business.\u201d Relying on <em>Burroughs, </em>plaintiff next urges, somewhat inconsistently, that Moose\u2019s business \u201cis the storage of equipment\u201d in addition to the sale and repair of tractors and tractor parts. He then says that while this \u201cstorage\u201d was the \u201cprincipal purpose of the business relationship\u201d between Mobility and Moose\u2019s, \u201c[u]nloading was only incidental to the storage.\u201d Plaintiff argues that, in effect, Mobility hired two independent contractors, each a stranger to the other, to accomplish the distribution of its products and there occurred merely \u201cincidental contact of deliverer and recipient\u201d between Fleming and Moose\u2019s. He contends that these contacts are on the \u201cperiphery\u201d of Moose\u2019s trade, business and occupation and should not form the basis for denying plaintiff\u2019s common-law claim against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In a similar vein, Mobility argues that the trial court erred because under its holding, \u201cthe ordinary or normal business activities of the independent contractors are totally ignored, and a mere finding that they mutually cooperated in any transaction is sufficient to establish that they are not \u2018other parties.\u2019 \u201d Mobility also says the \u201cunloading activity was simply not a part of Moose\u2019s ordinary trade or business of selling used tractor parts.\u201d It contends that unloading was clearly part of Fleming\u2019s business and that \u201c[a]ny cooperation in unloading Big Dippers extended by Fleming to Moose\u2019s only incidentally aided Moose\u2019s in performing its limited obligation to Mobility of temporarily storing machines like the Big Dipper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Also relying on <em>Burroughs, </em>Mobility urges that \u201cHalligan never became involved in the ordinary trade or business of Moose\u2019s but merely completed the final act of delivery by attempting to unload the Big Dipper at Moose\u2019s yard.\u201d At the bar, Mobility argued that neither Halligan nor Davis was engaged in the business of the other; for one \u201cfleeting moment\u201d when the vehicles were being unloaded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>it was said, employees who were on the scene together merely came into contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We do not agree with the contentions of plaintiff or Mobility. Their argument is based on an erroneous view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The effect of the trial court\u2019s finding is that Moose\u2019s was in the business of unloading and storing Mobility\u2019s equipment and that Halligan, required by his employer to aid in the unloading process, was engaged in such act of unloading the cargo when he was killed. The evidence amply supports those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The owner of Moose\u2019s had contracted with Mobility to \u201cunload, help unload and store\u201d Mobility\u2019s product. The agreement to unload was not merely incidental to the provisions for a place of storage; clearly, its purpose was to assure that the truck driver delivering the Mobility product would have assistance in unloading the heavy equipment by someone at the place of delivery. Correspondingly, Fleming had agreed to pay Halligan additional compensation to assist with the unloading of Mobility\u2019s equipment. The evidence showed that when an unloading process became protracted, Halligan was paid by the hour instead of the usual \u201cflat fee\u201d for a routine unloading. Manifestly, when Halligan arrived at Moose\u2019s premises, both had definitive contractual obligations to unload Mobility equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">This case is controlled by <em>Bosher, supra. </em>There a general contractor was required to construct a concrete floor on a six-inch sand base. Under contract with the general contractor, the supplier of sand was obligated to deliver the sand to the job site, dump it, and spread it as directed by the general contractor. While the driver who delivered the sand was engaged in the spreading operation, the truck he was operating struck and injured the plaintiff, an employee of the general contractor. This Court held that because the truck driver was engaged in the business of the general contractor, the plaintiff\u2019s common-law action against the driver\u2019s employer was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Conversely, in <em>Burroughs, supra, </em>relied on by plaintiff and Mobility, this Court permitted prosecution of a common-law action brought by a plain tiff-deliveryman, injured while engaged in delivery of sheetrock in specified quantities to particular rooms of homes under construction. The Court held the plaintiff was not engaged in the trade, business or occupation of the defendant general contractor because he did not participate in the construction of the homes, but was merely engaged in the final act of delivery. This case, we said, was distinguishable from <em>Bosher </em>in which the truck driver both delivered the sand and participated in laying the sand base.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Hipp </em>v. <em>Sadler Materials Corp., </em>211 Va. 710, 180 S.E.2d 501 (1971), also cited by plaintiff and Mobility, we held the Act did not bar plaintiff\u2019s action at law. But there, an employee of defendant, which had agreed to furnish and pour concrete at a job site, struck and injured plaintiff while plaintiff was working for another subcontractor at the site. Defendant\u2019s employee, required to pour the concrete of specified strength into forms and footings as directed by the concrete finishing subcontractor, was not obligated to spread or finish the material. In that case, the Court held that defendant\u2019s employee was performing the final act of delivery, not an act of construction constituting the trade, business or occupation of the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The analysis of the preceding cases, considered with the evidence in the present case, demonstrates that Halligan, at the time of his death, was engaged in one aspect of the normal and ordinary business of Moose\u2019s, which was to unload Mobility Big Dippers. Plaintiff\u2019s decedent had become involved in an essential part of Moose\u2019s business and was not merely performing an act which was tangentially related to Moose\u2019s other activities of dealing in used farm vehicles and parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">For these reasons, we think the trial court correctly sustained the special plea. Thus, the judgment of dismissal will be</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
