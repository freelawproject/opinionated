The wife filed an answer denying the alleged desertion and a cross-bill seeking a divorce based upon Code \u00a7 20-91 (9) (a), which allows a divorce to be granted where the parties have lived separate and apart for one year. Following a hearing, the chancellor concluded that the wife had deserted her husband and entered an order granting the husband a divorce on that basis and dismissing the wife\u2019s cross-bill, including her request for spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">The parties were married in 1974. For approximately one year, two teenaged children by the wife\u2019s former marriage were the only children in the household. The husband subsequently obtained custody of a child born during his previous marriage and brought him into the household in 1975. This child, Henry, was seven years old at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">The wife testified that she left her husband on June 8, 1977, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>because of her deteriorating health and her husband\u2019s failure to assist her in maintaining the home and in safeguarding her health. She had suffered from multiple sclerosis for more than fifteen years prior to her marriage in 1974, but her condition had stabilized prior to and during the first year of the marriage. She perceived, however, a deterioration in her physical condition after Henry moved into the household. The wife testified that she \u201ccould not cope with\u201d Henry because he refused to obey her and did not accept her as a member of the household. This testimony was supported by the testimony of her mother, who cited several instances of Henry\u2019s harassment of and lack of respect for his stepmother. In addition, the wife contended that it was physically impossible for her to maintain the large house in which the Breschels lived. Her daughter was somewhat helpful, but her husband did not provide significant assistance in maintaining the house. Although she asked him to hire someone to clean the house once a week, he was unwilling to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition introduced into evidence at the <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, Dr. Laurie E. Rennie, the wife\u2019s physician since 1968, provided information about multiple sclerosis in general and the wife\u2019s condition in particular. He noted that the physicial condition of a patient with multiple sclerosis can deteriorate for many reasons, including emotional trauma and exhaustion. He concluded Mrs. Breschel was not physically able to perform household duties required in anything more than a three-room flat, considerably smaller than the house in which the Breschels lived. He noted that the wife\u2019s weight had recently fallen to a critically low level, she had fallen into a \u201cmarked depression,\u201d her left leg had become more numb, and her gait had been further impaired. He also testified that the deteriorating marital situation, including the problems with the husband\u2019s son, was \u201cprobably ... the major factor\u201d in the deterioration of the wife\u2019s physical condition. In addition, Dr. Rennie noted that he had been willing to meet with Mr. Breschel to discuss Mrs. Breschel\u2019s physical disability but that Mr. Breschel never came to talk with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Sarah McCowan, a social worker employed in a Family and Children\u2019s Services Clinic, testified that the wife came to the clinic because of her concerns about Henry, the husband\u2019s son. In Henry\u2019s meeting with McCowan, he indicated that he was misbehaving so that he would be returned to the custody of his mother and that he was doing everything he could to drive his stepmother out of the home. McCowan also testified that in her meetings with the husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>she suggested that Henry undergo counseling. The husband, however, indicated that since his child had been in therapy before and it had not been helpful, he was unwilling to have his child undergo counseling again. In subsequent meetings with the wife, McCowan noticed the deterioration in the wife\u2019s physical condition. When the wife concluded in these meetings that her only option was to leave the house, McCowan supported her decision because she believed the wife \u201cwas right on the verge of a complete breakdown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The husband testified that McCowan informed him his wife \u201ccould not cope with a typical nine-year-old boy\u201d and suggested Henry be sent to Henry\u2019s mother\u2019s home for the summer or come in for counseling. He also testified that his wife told him \u201cif he [Henry] stayed there [the Breschel residence] for the summer . . . she was going to her mother\u2019s until her health got better.\u201d He refused, however, to send Henry away for the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On appeal, the wife contends that she was justified in breaking off marital cohabitation because her health was endangered by remaining in the household.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The husband, on the other hand, argues that competent and credible evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s determination that the wife was not justified in leaving her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">A party is guilty of desertion, as the term is used in Code \u00a7 20-91(6), when he or she breaks off matrimonial cohabitation with an intent to desert. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>199 Va. 79, 84, 97 S.E.2d 663, 667 (1957). Nevertheless, where a party breaking off cohabitation establishes that such conduct was legally justified, that party is not guilty of desertion. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>210 Va. 608, 616, 172 S.E.2d 724, 730 (1970). When the desertion is established, the duty of going forward with the evidence of justification then rests upon the defendant, unless the justification appears from the testimony adduced by the plaintiff. 210 Va. at 610, 172 S.E.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">We have previously held that a spouse is not justified in leaving the other unless the conduct of the other is sufficient to establish the foundation of a judicial proceeding for divorce. <em>See, e.g., Hoback </em>v. <em>Hoback, </em>208 Va. 432, 435-36, 158 S.E.2d 113, 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(1967); <em>Wimbrow </em>v. <em>Wimbrow, </em>208 Va. 141, 143-44, 156 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1967). This principle remains applicable to claims of constructive desertion. A spouse may not break off cohabitation and successfully claim constructive desertion unless the other\u2019s conduct is sufficient to establish the foundation of a divorce proceeding. Nevertheless, <em>Capps </em>v. <em>Capps, </em>216 Va. 382, 219 S.E.2d 898 (1975), and <em>Rowand </em>v. <em>Rowand, </em>215 Va. 344, 210 S.E.2d 149 (1974), indicate that a spouse may be free from legal fault in breaking off cohabitation, and hence entitled to support and maintenance, even thought he or she cannot establish the other\u2019s conduct constituted the foundation of a proceeding for divorce. In <em>Rowand, </em>we held that a wife who left her husband at his insistence was free from legal fault even though she could not establish his constructive desertion. In <em>Capps, </em>we held that a wife was free from legal fault where she left her husband because of a single incident of his physical abuse even though she was not entitled to a divorce grounded upon his cruelty. Likewise, we conclude that a wife is free from legal fault in leaving her husband where she reasonably believes her health is endangered by remaining in the household and she has unsuccessfully taken whatever reasonable measures might eliminate the danger without breaking off cohabitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">At the time she left her husband, Mrs. Breschel had noticed a significant deterioration in her physical condition which she attributed to her inability to take care of the house and her inability to cope with her husband\u2019s young son. Her physician confirmed this assessment of her situation. She sought counseling for herself and sought to involve both her husband and his son in the counseling process. She asked her husband to provide someone who could assist in household cleaning, but to no avail. She lived in a household where one of the family members was attempting to do everything he could to drive her out of the home. When it became apparent that her inability to cope with her husband\u2019s son was affecting her health and that all avenues for resolving her difficulty with the son had been foreclosed, she warned her husband that if the child remained in the home over the summer, she \u201cwas going to her mother\u2019s until her health got better.\u201d When he refused to send his son away for the summer, she broke off cohabitation because she reasonably believed that her health was endangered by remaining in the home. These facts compel a conclusion that she was without legal fault in breaking off cohabitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The chancellor\u2019s decree awarding the husband a divorce on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>basis of his wife\u2019s desertion is reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings on the wife\u2019s cross-bill, and the chancellor will receive such additional evidence as may be required to determine the issue of spousal support in accordance with Code \u00a7 20-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"> In the petition for appeal, Mrs. Breschel\u2019s counsel argued that Mr. Breschel impliedly consented to Mrs. Breschel\u2019s departure from the home. This argument, however, was not raised before the trial court and consequently will not be considered on appeal. Rule 5:21. In the petition for appeal, Mrs. Breschel\u2019s counsel also contended that Mrs. Breschel lacked any intent to desert. This argument was deleted from Mrs. Breschel\u2019s brief and not raised in her counsel\u2019s oral argument. Moreover, this alleged error was not stated \u201cwith reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\u201d Rule 5:21. Thus, we will not consider this argument in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
