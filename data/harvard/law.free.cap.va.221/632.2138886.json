U. S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 10; Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 56-529, -530; Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-204 <em>et seq; </em>D. C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-1410 <em>et seq. </em>By contract dated June 29, 1976, PEPCO and WMATA agreed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">\u201cfor a period of two years or until the Virginia State Corporation Commission assumes direct regulation over utility rates to governmental bodies, whichever shall occur first, the rate schedule RT applicable to the Authority in the District of Columbia shall apply to comparable sales of electricity to Authority in Virginia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">After the two-year term expired, the contracting parties began negotiations on new rates. On April 6, 1979, PEPCO filed with the SCC an application for a permanent increase in the rates on all its sales in Virginia. Included in the general application was a request for a VA-RT tariff on sales to \u201cRapid Transit Service\u201d customers \u201cin the Virginia portion of [PEPCO\u2019s] service area.\u201d This tariff represented an increase of 18.1 % in the rate charged under the PEPCO-WMATA contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">WMATA intervened and, asserting that its purchases from PEPCO are exempt from SCC regulation, filed a motion to \u201cDismiss Proposed Initial VA-RT Tariff or Institute Separate Proceedings\u201d. In an order dated January 16, 1980, the SCC declined to consider the VA-RT tariff request and continued proceedings on the remainder of the application pending a report by the hearing examiner on the other tariffs proposed. By final order entered April 24, 1980, the SCC granted permanent rate increases on those proposals. On appeal, PEPCO assigns error to the January 16, 1980 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Addressing the primary question presented by the errors assigned, we consider the character and status of WMATA. On brief, PEPCO says that WMATA \u201cis not a <em>municipal </em>corporation\u201d or a local government as defined by Article VII, \u00a7 1, of the Virginia Constitution, and that it \u201cis not part of the <em>federal </em>government.\u201d We agree. We are of opinion, however, that WMATA is part of the <em>State </em>government.</p>\n<p id=\"AD8\">Construing the language of the exemptive clause of Code \u00a7 56-234, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>PEPCO contends that \u201c \u2018State\u2019 means the State of Virginia.\u201d Since WMATA is not the State, PEPCO reasons, rates on its sales to WMATA are not exempt from SCC jurisdiction. But the word \u201cState\u201d modifies the word \u201cgovernment\u201d. Since the State government exists and functions only as the sum of its parts, we interpret the exemptive clause to apply to sales to every constituent part of State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">A governmental entity is one created by government to perform a governmental function for a public purpose. <em>See Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 774, 107 S.E.2d 594, 601 (1959). Title III, Article III, Section 4 of the interstate compact provides that WMATA \u201cis hereby created, as an instrumentality and agency of each of the signatory parties hereto\u201d. Title III, Article VII, Section 18(a), states that \u201c[t]he General Assembly of Virginia hereby authorizes and designates the Authority as the agency to plan for and provide transit facilities and services for the area of Virginia encompassed within the [compact] Zone.\u201d Two of the six members of WMATA\u2019s board of directors represent Virginia. Title III, Article III, Section 5(a). WMATA is vested with the power of eminent domain. Title III, Article XVI, Section 82(a). WMATA is funded, in part, by Virginia through the Northern Virginia Transit District Commission. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 58-730.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Construing the compact in <em>Fairfax County </em>v. <em>County Executive, </em>210 Va. 253, 262, 169 S.E.2d 556, 562 (1969), and noting that other courts \u201chave recognized that an authority created and vested with power to establish and maintain subway or street railway projects . . . exercises a governmental function for public purposes\u201d, we characterized WMATA as a \u201cpublicly conceived, owned and controlled Authority . . . created under the Compact as an instrumentality and agency of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia\u201d. Thus, just as the Virginia State Ports Authority may share its governmental function with a private concern without forfeiting its public character, <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, 202 </em>Va. 967, 121 S.E.2d 615 (1961), an agency created to perform a governmental function for a public purpose does not lose its character as a governmental entity merely because it is a creature of an interstate compact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Applying the principles announced in these cases, we hold that WMATA is a governmental entity within the intendment of the ex-emptive clause of Code \u00a7 56-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">At the time its application was filed, PEPCO\u2019s only VA-RT customer was WMATA. But, PEPCO says, the rate it proposed for WMATA was \u201calso a generally applicable rate, designed for any customer possessing the electrical load characteristics of a railroad\u201d. Consequently, PEPCO argues, its application invoked the \u201cparamount jurisdiction\u201d of the SCC to establish a rate schedule of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>a schedule applicable to sales to customers generally, even though some purchases by some customers may fall within the exemptive clause of Code \u00a7 56-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The SCC\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction is not plenary. \u201cSubject to such criteria and other requirements as may be prescribed by law, the [SCC] shall have the power and be charged with the duty of regulating the rates, charges, and services . . . of . . . electric companies.\u201d Va. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 2. In light of the preface to this constitutional mandate, \u201cthe authority of the SCC to regulate the rates charged by electric companies for service furnished to governmental entities is subordinate to the power of the General Assembly to command otherwise\u201d, and \u201c[t]he exemptive provision of Code \u00a7 56-234 is just such a command otherwise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>214 Va. 457, 465, 201 S.E.2d 771, <em>777 </em>(1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Yet, PEPCO insists that the SCC has authority under its application \u201cto declare a reasonable rate for service which it cannot \u2018regulate\u2019 \u201d, and once such a rate is declared, \u201c[i]t is up to the utility and an \u2018exempt\u2019 customer to decide whether they will contract for the utility\u2019s service on some other basis; if not, the Commission-fixed rate of general applicability is available and service must be taken in accordance therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The flaw in PEPCO\u2019s position is that the VA-RT tariff proposed in its application was germane only to sales to one customer whose purchases were exempt from SCC jurisdiction; it had no customer for jurisdictional sales. Nothing in the constitution or the statutes <em>requires </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the SCC to entertain an application for a tariff on non-existent sales to non-existent customers or to promulgate advisory rate schedules for sales expressly exempted by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">We hold, therefore, that the SCC did not err in declining to do so, and we will affirm the order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\"> Making no reference to the views expressed in <em>Fairfax County </em>or the standards outlined in the two <em>Harrison </em>decisions, PEPCO relies upon two opinions of federal district courts to support its view that WMATA is not a state agency. C. <em>T. Hellmuth </em>v. <em>Washington Metro. Area Trans., </em>414 F. Supp. 408 (D. Md. 1976), held that WMATA is not subject to the disclosure provisions of the Maryland Public Information Act; <em>Gay Activists Alliance of Washington, D. C., Inc. </em>v. <em>WMATA, </em>No. 78-2217 (D. D.C. July 5, 1979), held that WMATA is not subject to the provisions of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act of 1977. The rationale underlying those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>opinions was that one party to this trilateral compact cannot unilaterally subject WMATA, an agent common to all, to a legal obligation <em>dehors </em>the compact. We find those opinions, sound as they may be, wholly inapposite to the case at bar. We are not asked to decide whether WMATA is subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 56-234; our statute prescribes the public obligations of public utilities, not those of their customers. Rather, the issue before us is whether the obligations imposed by our statute are \u201capplicable to schedules of rates, or contracts for service rendered by\u201d PEPCO to WMATA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-6\"> In its final order, the SCC fixed an \u201cSL\u201d rate schedule for PEPCO\u2019s sales to \u201cagencies of Federal, State and Municipal Governments, for street, highway and park lighting purposes\u201d. This action was not challenged below or on appeal, and we do not decide whether the SCC exceeded its jurisdiction in fixing this schedule. <em>But see Commonwealth </em>v. <em>VEPCO, supra. </em>We hold only that the SCC was not <em>required </em>by law to entertain PEPCO\u2019s application for a VA-RT schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
