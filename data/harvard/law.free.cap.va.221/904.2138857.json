Howard was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370 and sentenced to serve three years in the State penitentiary. On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment for failure to allege an offense, and in convicting him of a crime which, he insists, is not a lesser offense included under the indictment charging attempted sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">The indictment, citing Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-26 and 18.2-361, charged that Howard on or about June 27, 1979, \u201cfeloniously and by force did attempt to carnally know G......... T......., thirteen years of age, by the anus\u201d. Code \u00a7 18.2-361 provides that \u201c[i]f any person shall by force carnally know any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth he or she shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony\u201d. Code \u00a718.2-26 classifies for purposes of punishment attempts to commit noncapital felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Prior to trial, Howard moved to quash the indictment. Relying on <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>88 Va. 37, 13 S.E. 309 (1891), he argued, as he did on appeal, that the indictment was invalid because it failed to allege an overt, ineffectual act in the attempt to commit sodomy. There is no merit in this argument. <em>Cunningham, </em>an attempted rape case, held that it was necessary for the indictment to charge an act done towards the commission of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 39, 13 S.E. at 310. However, this holding was based upon the wording of Section 3888 of the 1887 Code, which provided specified punishment for a person \u201cwho attempts to commit an offense, and in such attempt <em>does any act towards its </em>commission\u201d. (Emphasis added). The present statutes contain no such language. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-25 and 18.2-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">To sustain a conviction of an attempted crime, the evidence must establish a specific intent to commit the crime and an overt but ineffectual act committed in furtherance of the criminal purpose. <em>Nobles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 548, 551, 238 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1977). But it is no longer necessary to include in the indictment an allegation of every fact in the chain of circumstances comprising the offense charged. <em>See Ward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 564, 568, 138 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1964). In the present case, the indictment did not merely charge \u201cattempted sodomy\u201d but paralleled the language of the relevant substantive statute and followed the illustrative short-form indictment for an attempted felony included in Form 5 of the Appendix of Forms contained in Part Three A of the Rules of Court. There was no suggestion that Howard did not understand the nature of the charge against him. As the indictment named the accused, described the offense charged and cited the applicable statutes, identified the city in which the offense was committed, and recited that Howard committed the offense on or about a certain date, it met the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:7(a). <em>Cf. Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411 (1976), where the language used in the indictment failed to charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">At trial, the chief witness for the Commonwealth was the thirteen-year-old child named in the indictment as the victim. She testified that on June 27, 1979, she was visiting a cousin in Newport News. That afternoon, while she was in the hall of the apartment house where her cousin lived, Howard, who was another cousin of hers, pulled down the top of her sundress and touched her breast. When she \u201chollered\u201d, Howard put his hand over her mouth. She resisted. He then turned her around, held her facing the wall, pulled her dress up and her underpants down, pulled his pants \u201chalfway\u201d down and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>unzipped them, placed his penis against her buttocks and tried to put it in her \u201cbehind\u201d. She turned sideways and Howard released her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence by the Commonwealth, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>ruled that the evidence was insufficient to prove attempted sodomy and reduced the charge to taking indecent liberties with a child in violation of \u00a7 18.2-370. Howard objected to this action of the trial court, arguing that violation of that statute is not a lesser-included offense of attempted sodomy. After the court overruled his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Howard testified in his own defense and denied the child\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-370 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">Any person eighteen years of age or over, who, with lascivious intent, shall knowingly and intentionally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-8\">(1) Expose his . . . sexual or genital parts to any child under the age of fourteen years .. .; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-9\">(2) In any manner fondle or feel, or attempt to fondle or feel, the sexual or genital part of any such child, or the breast of any such female child;. . . shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">Howard argued for the first time on appeal that lascivious intent is not an element of the offense of attempted sodomy and that \u201ctaking indecent liberties\u201d therefore is not a lesser-included offense of that crime. He relied upon <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 443, 158 S.E.2d 657 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1111 (1969), in which we held that indecent exposure with lascivious intent was not a lesser-included offense of sodomy. The Commonwealth, while arguing that this contention was not presented in the trial court and should now be barred by Rule 5:21, also maintained that the requirement of lascivious intent is implicit in the words \u201ccarnally know\u201d in the definition of sodomy in \u00a7 18.2-361. We find it unnecessary to decide either the procedural or the substantive question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">The trial court\u2019s ruling that the evidence was insufficient to prove attempted sodomy constituted an acquittal of Howard on that charge. However, the court expressed the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to prove assault and battery, a misdemeanor. The Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney then argued that the felony of taking indecent liberties with a child, as defined in \u00a7 18.2-370, was a lesser-included offense of attempted sodomy. After expressing doubt as to the validity of this argument, the trial court nevertheless reduced the charge to a violation of the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-370. Defense counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>relying upon <em>Ashby, </em>moved that the charge be dismissed. The Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney contended that <em>Ashby, </em>an indecent exposure case based in part upon a violation of Code \u00a7 18.1-214 (Repl. Vol. 1960), the provisions of which are now included in \u00a7 18.2-370(1), was distinguishable from the present case in which the evidence showed that Howard fondled or touched the child\u2019s breast in violation of \u00a7 18.2-370(2). When defense counsel asserted that touching the breast had nothing to do with sodomy or attempted sodomy, the trial court replied that touching of the buttocks with the penis \u201ccertainly would\u201d, and overruled the motion to dismiss, to which ruling defense counsel noted an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s position in the court below was that by fondling or feeling the child\u2019s breast, Howard had violated \u00a7 18.2-370(2), and that this was a lesser-included offense for which he could be convicted under the indictment charging attempted sodomy. On appeal, the Commonwealth\u2019s position was that Howard had violated \u00a7 18.2-370(2) by placing his penis on the child\u2019s buttocks, and that this was a lesser-included offense of attempted sodomy. The trial court did not make it clear which of the two acts was the basis for the conviction. So we must determine whether either act was a violation of \u00a7 18.2-370(2) and, if so, whether such violation was a lesser-included offense of attempted sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">The physical acts proscribed by \u00a7 18.2-370(2) are limited to the fondling or feeling of the genitals of a child under fourteen years of age or the breast of such female child. Therefore, while the trial court may have been correct in concluding that Howard\u2019s touching of the child\u2019s buttocks with his penis was related to attempted sodomy, this act, reprehensible as it was, was not a violation of \u00a7 18.2-370(2), the statutory offense of which Howard was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Fondling or feeling a child\u2019s breast with lascivious intent is, of course, a violation of the express provisions of \u00a7 18.2-370(2), but it is not a lesser-included offense of attempted sodomy. An offense is not lesser-included within another, if it contains at least one necessary element not required to prove the other. <em>Roderick Cecil Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 759, 240 S.E.2d 658, 660, <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 909, 439 U.S. 892 (1978). <em>See Ashby, </em>208 Va. at 446, 158 S.E.2d at 659. In the present case, evidence of feeling the breast of the girl with lascivious intent was a necessary element to prove a violation of \u00a7 18.2-370(2), but it is not required to prove attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>sodomy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court could not properly have convicted Howard of the violation of \u00a7 18.2-370(2) as lesser-included within the offense of attempted sodomy charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">For the reasons assigned, the judgment order will be reversed and the case will be remanded for such further proceedings as may be appropriate, provided that Howard, having been acquitted on the charge of attempted sodomy, may not be retried for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-8\"> The Commonwealth has never suggested that Code \u00a7 18.2-370(4), concerning a proposal to commit an act of sodomy, might apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-7\"> For conviction of attempted sodomy, as charged in the indictment, there must have been proof of some attempted contact with the anus of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
