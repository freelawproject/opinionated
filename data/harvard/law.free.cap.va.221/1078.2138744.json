Anderson, III, Assistant Attorney General (Marshall Coleman, Attorney General, </em>on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1247-9\">POFF, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVR\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">Iris Denise Christian, 17 years of age, mother of a two-year-old son and a six-month-old daughter, was tried under an indictment charging that she \u201cdid feloniously and unlawfully and maliciously cause bodily injury to [her daughter] with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill her\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Convicted by the trial court sitting without a jury, she was sentenced to a term of 10 years in the penitentiary with five years suspended on condition of good behavior for 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">In August 1979, the defendant placed the infant in a licensed child day care facility. The driver of a \u201cTiny Angels\u201d bus and \u201ctwo or three aides\u201d picked the child up at her home in the mornings and delivered her to the nursery where she remained until the late afternoon hours in the care of Barbara Vaughan and two assistants. On the morning of November 29, 1979, as Ms. Vaughan was changing the infant\u2019s diaper, the child \u201cgave ... a terrible startled scream\u201d. Since she had \u201cappeared all right\u201d when she left the nursery the previous afternoon, Ms. Vaughan had her admitted to the emergency room at the Medical College of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">An examination performed by Dr. Leslie Ann Price, a pediatrics resident, revealed a \u201cmild bruise above the left eye\u201d, a pale, \u201coval scar\u201d beneath the left eye, an \u201cold healing fracture of the left seventh rib\u201d, a \u201cnew fracture of the left femur\u201d, and a \u201cnew fracture of the lower bone of the right\u201d leg. Dr. Price testified that the oval scar was \u201cconsistent with the shape of a cigarette burn or some other round oval break in the skin of more than a few weeks duration.\u201d She was not \u201cabsolutely sure that a cigarette bum caused that scar\u201d and acknowledged that it \u201cpossibly\u201d could have resulted from a fall. She said that \u201ca substantial amount of force [was] required to break <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>the [rib] and a two year old child would not be capable of exerting that much force.\u201d Dr. Price described the leg injuries as \u201cbuckle fracture[s]\u201d and the causative trauma as a \u201ccompression and twisting force\u201d. She felt that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the fractures resulted from a fall from bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Ms. Vaughan testified further that she had once observed a \u201clittle red dot\u201d in one of the infant\u2019s eyes and \u201ca healing burn or wound which is round like a cigarette\u201d under the eye. She said that the defendant had never told her about any accident or injury suffered by the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Steve Dalton, the investigating officer, interviewed the defendant the day after her daughter was hospitalized and on several other occasions. Dalton testified that she told him in the first interview that \u201cshe was the only one that had custody of the child\u201d the night of November 28, that \u201cwithin the past two weeks the child had fallen off the bed at its grandmother\u2019s home\u201d, and that \u201cthe older child had sat on the baby\u201d sometime before that. Later, when Dalton made the arrest, the defendant repeated what she had told him in the first interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Called as a defense witness, Dr. Joyce L. Whitaker, a pediatrician, testified that the defendant had brought her baby to her on five occasions, the last on November 12, 1979. Dr. Whitaker treated her for gastritis and respiratory and ear infections and hospitalized her for 12 days for \u201can upper GI study\u201d. Dr. Whitaker said that the defendant \u201cwas very good about keeping follow-up visits\u201d. During the time the child was her patient, she was never treated for a bum or fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">The defendant\u2019s father, who had lived with his daughter and grandchildren since November 1, 1979, left for work at 10:45 p.m. on November 28. He testified that the defendant \u201ctreats both of [her children] like a mother \u2014 kind.\u201d He never saw her \u201cget mad at either of them\u201d, \u201cstrike\u201d them, or \u201cact violently\u201d toward them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Testifying in her own behalf, the defendant denied that she had injured her daughter or that she had been aware she had suffered any injuries. She said that she did not smoke and that the scar beneath her daughter\u2019s eye was caused by a scratch. \u201cBabies scratch themselves,\u201d she said, \u201cand I assumed she scratched herself.\u201d She acknowledged that she and her children were alone in the house after her father left for work the night of November 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction, the defendant first contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>the \u201crequisite criminal intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d and, hence, failed to establish the <em>corpus delicti. </em>In effect, the defendant argues that the evidence is consistent with the possibility that her daughter\u2019s injuries were caused by accidental means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Considering the <em>mens rea </em>contemplated by the mayhem statute, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1249-6\">\u201cMalice inheres in the doing of a wrongful act intentionally, or without just cause or excuse, or as a result of ill will. It may be directly evidenced by words, or inferred from acts and conduct which necessarily result in injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\"><em>Dawkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 61, 41 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1947). Quoting the comment in <em>Roark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 244, 250, 28 S.E.2d 693, 695-96 (1944), that an unarmed assault \u201cmay be attended with such circumstances of violence and brutality that an intent to kill will be presumed\u201d, we found the inference arising from the grievous nature of the injuries inflicted sufficient to prove Dawkins\u2019 criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Necessarily, the defendant\u2019s conviction is based upon the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the injuries suffered by this infant were the result of acts committed intentionally or without just cause or excuse. The defendant testified that the oval scar was caused by a self-inflicted scratch; but the expert testimony, and that of Ms. Vaughan, attributed the scar to a cigarette bum. The defendant suggested that her young son had sat on his sister and broken her rib; but the doctor said that \u201ca two year old child would not be capable of exerting that much force.\u201d When the officer questioned the defendant about the leg fractures, she told him that her daughter had fallen from her bed two weeks before; but the medical evidence showed that the buckle fractures were only two days old and that they had been caused by a \u201ccompression and twisting force\u201d. The trial court was entitled to accept the doctor\u2019s opinion that it is \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that such a force occurred with such effect in the manner or at the time suggested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that - the injuries were caused by criminal conduct, and we turn to the question whether it was sufficient to show that the accused was the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Like the body of the crime, criminal agency can be proven by circumstantial evidence. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>140 Va. 452, 457, 124 S.E. 429, 430 (1924). Were the rule otherwise, many atroc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>ious crimes would go unpunished. Often, the deceased is the only eyewitness to murder. Typically, child abuse is practiced by a parent in the privacy of the home with no one present but the victim and frequently, as here, the victim is an infant too young to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">A single circumstance seldom justifies a finding of criminal agency. Thus, mere opportunity to commit an offense raises only \u201cthe suspicion that the defendant may have been the guilty agent; and suspicion is never enough to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 778, 783, 160 S.E.2d 569, 573 (1968). Opportunity is always a relevant circumstance, of course, and, when reinforced by other incriminating circumstances, may be sufficient to establish criminal agency beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, where it appears that a criminal assault was made upon a child within a particular period of time, evidence which shows that the accused was sole custodian of the child during that period may be sufficient, standing alone, to prove criminal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">But there was no such evidence here. It is true that, after the defendant\u2019s father left for work the night of November 28, she had sole custody of her daughter until she placed her on the bus the next morning. Thereafter, however, at least five people had an opportunity to handle the child before Ms. Vaughan discovered that her legs were broken. If, as the Attorney General asks us to infer, the defendant injured her daughter during the night, it is strange the bus driver or his aides or one of Ms. Vaughan\u2019s assistants did not discover the painful fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">When the only evidence connecting the accused with the crime is circumstantial, the evidence is sufficient to establish criminal agency only when it meets the standard required for proof of other elements of the offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-8\">\u201cAll necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence. It is not sufficient that the evidence create a suspicion of guilt, however strong, or even a probability of guilt, but must exclude every reasonable hypothesis save that of guilt. To accomplish that the chain of circumstances must be unbroken and the evidence as a whole must be sufficient to satisfy the guarded judgment that both the <em>corpus delicti </em>and the criminal agency of the accused have been proved to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis and to a moral certainty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\"><em>Webb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 34, 129 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1963); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>quoted in part, <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 153, 156, 169 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">While the defendant\u2019s opportunity to injure her daughter and certain other circumstances in this case may raise inferences which \u201ccreate a suspicion of guilt... or even a probability of guilt\u201d, we are of opinion the evidence is insufficient to exclude a reasonable hypothesis that someone other than the defendant was the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">The judgment will be reversed and the indictment will be dismissed. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>101 S. Ct. 970 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
