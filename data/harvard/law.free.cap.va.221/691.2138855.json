On March 9, 1978, Wood took a voluntary nonsuit and eight days thereafter, on March 17, 1978, filed his second motion seeking to recover against Holcombe alone for the damages he suffered in the accident. Defendant\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations was sustained by the lower court, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The parties agree that the two-year limitation period is applicable, Code \u00a7 8-24, now in part with modifications \u00a7 8.01-243(A). Wood\u2019s nonsuit on March 9, 1978, and the filing of his motion for judgment on March 17, 1978, occurred more than two years after the date of the accident. Wood relies upon Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E) (3), which became effective on October 1, 1977. He contends the statute is remedial and should be liberally construed. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">If a plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-380 and shall recommence his action within six months, the statute of limitation with respect to such action shall be tolled by the commencement of the nonsuited action.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Wood therefore argues that having recommenced his action within six months from March 9, 1978, he thereby became entitled to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>tolled the period during which his first action was pending, <em>i.e., </em>the period from August 23, 1974, to March 9, 1978. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">For reasons set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Simpkins, supra, </em>we hold that plaintiff\u2019s action which arose and was pending prior to October 1, 1977, is governed by the two-year limitation period and the tolling provision of Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E) (3) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">In 1978 the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 8.01-229(E)(3) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-13\">If a plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-380 the statute of limitation with respect to such action shall be tolled by the commencement of the nonsuited action, and the plaintiff may recommence his action within six months from the date he suffers such nonsuit, or within the original period of limitation, whichever period is longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">1978 Va.
