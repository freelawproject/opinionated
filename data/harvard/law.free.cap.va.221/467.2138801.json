He was sentenced to serve a total of 40 years in the penitentiary on the maiming convictions. Sentences imposed on the other convictions were suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The defendant entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that Bilokur had committed the several offenses was uncontradicted. Testifying in his own behalf, the defendant described a history of drug abuse and mental therapy. He admitted stabbing Melanie with a kitchen knife and striking her on the head with a table but remembered nothing about the other offenses and could give no explanation for his conduct. Psychiatric proof that Bilokur was competent to stand trial and that he was sane when the offenses were committed was fully sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Two days before arraignment, counsel for the Commonwealth and the defendant jointly conducted an interrogation of Melanie. Melanie was not sworn, and the defendant was not present. Melanie described the attack in detail and identified Bilokur as her assailant. With the defendant standing mute, defendant\u2019s trial counsel stipulated a transcript of the interrogation into evidence in lieu of Melanie\u2019s personal testimony. Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel, whose motion to set aside the judgments was denied, contends that the use of the transcript violated Bilokur\u2019s statutory right to be present at trial and his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-259 provides that \u201c[a] person tried for felony shall be personally present during the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision is \u201cmerely declaratory of a principle of the common law\u201d; it is \u201can essential part of the process of law . . . without which the courts have no jurisdiction to pronounce judgment\u201d; and it is a right which \u201cthe accused cannot waive\u201d. <em>Noell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 600, 608-09, 115 S.E. 679, 681 (1923) (applying principles announced in <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574 (1884)); <em>accord, Lewis and Grant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 411, 184 S.E.2d 818 (1971). The statutory phrase \u201cduring the trial\u201d has been defined as \u201cevery stage of the trial from [the accused\u2019s] arraignment to his sentence, when anything is to be done which can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>affect his interest.\u201d <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>143 Va. 592, 605, 130 S.E. 398, 402 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It was the introduction of the transcript of Melanie\u2019s interrogation into evidence, not the conduct of the interrogation, which might have affected the defendant\u2019s interest. The orders entered upon the four convictions recite, and there is nothing of record to contradict the recitation, that Bilokur was present at every stage of the trial. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s statutory right of presence was not abridged by introduction of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We turn now to the constitutional issue. An accused has the right to be confronted by his \u201caccusers and witnesses\u201d, Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, and \u201cthe witnesses against him\u201d, U.S. Const, amend. VI. We en-quire whether the introduction of incriminating extrajudicial statements against an accused offends the constitutional guarantees and, if so, whether the right to invoke these guarantees may be waived by an accused or his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">\u201cIn Virginia, in criminal cases, [the right of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses] is preserved to the accused by the constitutional guarantee of confrontation.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 667, 669, 119 S.E.2d 324, 327 (1961). <em>See also Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 234 S.E.2d 79 (1977); <em>Woody </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 296, 199 S.E.2d 529 (1973). Concerning the Sixth Amendment guarantee, which the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the states, <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 (1965), the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">\u201cThe primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits . . . being used against the prisoner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242-43 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We recently considered \u201cwhether testimony given by a witness during a preliminary hearing . . . may properly be received as substantive evidence for the prosecution in the subsequent trial. .. when the witness is deceased at the time of trial.\u201d <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 808, 809, 232 S.E.2d 798, 799 (1977). In <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>156 U.S. at 241, the Supreme Court had said that \u201cthe authority in favor of the admissibility of such testimony, where the defendant was present either at the examination of the deceased witness before a committing magistrate, or upon a former trial of the same case, is overwhelming\u201d. Quoting that language and noting that the testimony of a deceased witness had been \u201cgiven under oath in a judicial proceeding which was distinctly adversary\u201d and that \u201cthe transcript of . . . testimony at the preliminary hearing carried sufficient indicia of reliability and provided the jury a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of [the deceased witness\u2019] prior statements\u201d, 217 Va. at 813, 232 S.E.2d at 802, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that his constitutional right of confrontation had been abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Relying upon <em>Fisher, </em>we denied a similar claim in a case where there was no transcript of the testimony at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201c[I]n criminal cases the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who is absent from the subsequent trial because of death may be proved by the <em>oral testimony </em>of a person who was present at the former trial and heard the witness testify. In applying this rule, however, it must be shown: (1) that the witness is dead; (2) that the testimony of the witness was given under oath . . .; (3) that the person who seeks to relate the testimony of the absent witness can state the subject matter with clarity and in detail; and (4) that the party against whom the witness was offered was present with counsel and was afforded the opportunity of cross-examination. (Citations omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-10\"><em>Shifflett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 25, 28, 235 S.E.2d 316, 318-19 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The principle underlying the decisions in these cases is that the constitutional right of confrontation does not attach where the prior testimony of a witness unavailable at trial bears sufficient indicia of reliability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But here, Melanie\u2019s testimony was not taken in a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>proceeding, the interrogation was not adversary, Melanie was not under oath, her statements positively incriminated Bilokur, the defendant was not present to conduct or assist his counsel in conducting cross-examination, and nothing of record indicates that Melanie was unavailable to testify in person at trial. Hence, none of the indicia of reliability present in <em>Fisher </em>and <em>Shifflett </em>is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We believe, therefore, that the defendant had the right to invoke the constitutional guarantee of confrontation against the introduction of the transcript of Melanie\u2019s interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">We must now decide whether such a right may be waived by an accused or his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">While there is always a \u201cpresumption against a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights\u201d, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938), and \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is ... a fundamental right\u201d, <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>380 U.S. at 403, the right may be waived by a guilty plea, <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238 (1969), by a defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct in the courtroom, <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337 (1970), by a defendant\u2019s voluntary absence from trial, <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 U.S. 17 (1973), and by a defendant\u2019s intimidation of a grand jury witness from testifying at trial, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>547 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 914 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">None of these cases addressed the question whether defense counsel has the power to waive his client\u2019s right of confrontation. But that question arose in <em>Brookhart </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1 (1966). There, the Supreme Court held that since the accused \u201cneither personally waived his right [of confrontation] nor acquiesced in his lawyer\u2019s attempted waiver, the judgment . . . must be and is reversed\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 8. This holding implicitly recognized that an accused may waive his constitutional right of confrontation, not only by express personal consent but also by passive acquiescence in a tender by his attorney. This rule had been applied in an earlier federal case where the court had said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">\u201cIf the accused, being present, manifests no dissent, it is usually fair to assume that he approves of, or at least acquiesces in, the decision taken in open court in his behalf by his counsel. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">\u201c. . . And where an accused is represented by counsel, we do not see why counsel, in his presence and on his behalf, may not make an effective waiver of this privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Cruzado </em>v. <em>People of Puerto Rico, </em>210 F.2d 789, 791 (1st Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In a <em>post-Brookhart </em>case, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, in order for a waiver to be effective, the record \u201cmust affirmatively reveal . . . that [the defendant] personally waived his constitutional right to confront witnesses by consenting to the stipulation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>489 F.2d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 948 (1974). And in the most recent federal decision on the question, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201c[C]ounsel in a criminal case may waive his client\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by stipulating to the admission of evidence, so long as the defendant does not dissent from his attorney\u2019s decision, and so long as it can be said that the attorney\u2019s decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>609 F.2d 230, 232-33 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">While this language was employed in a case in which the defendants had expressly approved the stipulation tendered by their counsel, we believe it is consonant with the holding in <em>Brookhart, </em>and we adopt it as the rule in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">As a matter of trial tactics, it is often advisable in criminal cases for the defense to stipulate extrajudicial statements and other evidence in lieu of personal testimony. The intonations and inflections of the spoken word are usually more persuasive than the printed word, and it is sometimes better to concede than to contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">A defendant\u2019s demand for proof of facts that are incontrovertible <em>(e.g., </em>time of sunset, fact of death, situs of the offense, physical verities, qualifications of experts) may irritate and tend to alienate the factfinder. It would be pointless for a defendant to demand proof of facts admitted or not contradicted in his own testimony. It may be prudent for the defense to stipulate adverse testimony which, if delivered in person, would only validate and magnify that of other witnesses at trial. And it may be highly imprudent to insist upon the in-court testimony of a witness who has a history of personal animus against the defendant, or a witness whose standing in the community is such that his very presence would add undue weight to his testimony, or a witness who is the victim of the crime charged against the defendant and whose age, physical appearance, or personal demeanor would arouse the sympathy and inflame the passions of the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"AuU\">With these considerations in mind and in view of the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Bilokur\u2019s plea and the trial strategy it entailed, we believe the decision of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to substitute the transcript of Melanie\u2019s extrajudicial statement for her personal testimony was a legitimate trial tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">And the record leaves no doubt that Bilokur acquiesced in that decision. Present when the stipulation was tendered, he did not dissent. There is nothing to show that he was unfamiliar with the content of the transcript or that he had any reason to impeach Melanie\u2019s statement by cross-examination. Applying the rule we have adopted, we conclude that Bilokur\u2019s silence was tantamount to assent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We hold, therefore, that the defendant, acting through counsel, waived his right to invoke the constitutional guarantee of confrontation, and the several judgments will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> The right of a person tried for a misdemeanor to be present at trial is qualified.
