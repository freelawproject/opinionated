The defendant concedes primary negligence, and we consider whether the trial court erred in ruling that the appellant-plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The collision occurred about 9:40 a.m. on a clear, dry day near the Suffolk Plaza Shopping Center. U.S. Route 460 borders the center on the west. It is divided into two northbound and two southbound lanes, each approximately ten and a half feet wide. Running north, the highway curves to the right as it reaches the southern entrance to the center. At the main entrance 350 feet to the north, traffic is controlled by traffic lights. From the stop line at the traffic lights, Route 460 curves slightly to the left as it passes an exit from the shopping center parking lot 300 feet farther north. The posted speed limit in the area is 35 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Two eyewitnesses testified for the plaintiff. Arthur Pulver stated that he was standing on the southeastern corner of the main shopping center entrance. As the traffic light turned to caution, he saw two cars stop in the right northbound lane. Starting to cross the street with the green light, Pulver looked south and saw a Cadillac \u201ccome flying up around that curve\u201d at a speed of \u201cat least 50.\u201d \u201c[Ajbout two and a half car lengths from the red light\u201d, the Cadillac \u201cwhipped . . . from the right lane over to the left lane in a manner that it made the tires holler\u201d and \u201cjust sped right on through the light.\u201d To his right, Pulver saw the plaintiff\u2019s pickup at the northern exit \u201cpulling out slow, just making a right-hand turn on 460.\u201d The front of the pickup was \u201c[mjaybe a foot or two\u201d onto the highway and \u201cwas just making the turn as the Cadillac came around the other cars and went through the red light.\u201d The Cadillac exhibited no brake light and \u201cin fact, as he come through the light, it was like he put more gas to it because his tires were squealing.\u201d After running the red light, the Cadillac \u201cstayed in the left lane\u201d. But as it entered the gradual left curve, it \u201cstarted drifting over to the right and\u2014 wham \u2014 right into the side of the driver\u2019s side of the truck.\u201d The pickup \u201cwas in the right lane\u201d and \u201c[njever went over that white line in the middle of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">According to the investigating officer, Pulver had told him in an interview a day or two after the accident that the Cadillac \u201ccame out of the shopping center entrance or exit and accelerated . . . and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>was going pretty good when the truck pulled out\u201d. But, in a second interview, Pulver said that the Cadillac \u201cwas coming through the light instead of coming out of the shopping center.\u201d On cross-examination, Pulver reaffirmed the account he had given on direct examination and could not remember having made the inconsistent statement to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">f^ugh Whitley, the other eyewitness, was driving a car following the plaintiff\u2019s pickup. Whitley testified that Parker stopped before he entered the highway. Stopping behind the plaintiff, Whitley \u201clooked to the left and so did Mr. Parker because I saw him look.\u201d Cars were waiting at the red light. No traffic was approaching. The plaintiff \u201cstarted to pull out and ... his truck hesitated like.\u201d After the plaintiff \u201chad pulled out into the road\u201d, Whitley \u201clooked back the second time\u201d and saw the Cadillac \u201cabout halfway from the stoplight\u201d. Continuing his turn, Parker \u201cswung a little wide\u201d. Whitley could \u201c[n]ot really\u201d say where Parker\u2019s left front wheel was, but he \u201chad almost straightened back up\u201d and was \u201con the inside lane\u201d when the Cadillac struck his left door. Whitley added that no traffic was obstructing the passing lane at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiff testified that he stopped about two feet from the highway and looked to his left. Seeing cars stopped at the red light and no traffic moving in his direction, he turned right across the drainage \u201cdip\u201d at the edge of the road. He continued to look to his left until his 14-foot vehicle was \u201chalf on the highway\u201d. Parker then looked to his right as he shifted gears and continued his turn. He had traveled only a car length and a half from the exit and was \u201cbetter than 90 percent straight\u201d when the collision occurred; his average speed had been seven to eight miles per hour, and \u201c[n]o part\u201d of his pickup had entered the left lane. Parker never saw the Cadillac before it struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The defendant\u2019s version contradicted the plaintiff\u2019s account. He testified that he stopped in the left lane at the red light \u201cfor a second or two\u201d and, when the light \u201cchanged to green\u201d, proceeded in the left lane at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour. \u201c[A]bout 20 feet from the north side of the exit\u201d, he saw the pickup \u201cmaybe 10 or 15 feet back from the highway.\u201d The pickup did not stop, he said, but \u201ccrossed over into the left-hand lane\u201d, \u201c[r]un right into the right side of my car\u201d, and \u201cI was hit before I could put on brakes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The investigating officer\u2019s testimony concerning the physical evidence was illustrated with photographs taken shortly after the accident. The pickup came to rest on its left side facing east on the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>shoulder of the highway five feet from the concrete curb and approximately 50 feet north of the northern exit. The Cadillac was found upright facing southeast in the right lane with the left front wheel on the curb near the rear of the pickup. The impact had wrenched the driver\u2019s compartment and door forward and collapsed the hood and left fender of the pickup. Damage to the Cadillac extended from the front bumper along the right fender and doors to the rear fender.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The officer stated that debris from the vehicles was deposited \u201cmostly in the right lane and some in the left \u2014 the edge of the left.\u201d He described three pressure tire marks which, the parties agree, were made after the collision. The marks originated near the extension of the north edge of the northern exit. The first commenced within three feet of the left side of the left lane and continued in a \u201csweeping\u201d arc to the rear tires of the Cadillac. The second, beginning two to three feet to the left of the line dividing the two lanes, led to the right front tire of the Cadillac. The third began one foot to the left of the dividing line and terminated at a point near the curb in front of the Cadillac and behind the pickup. Pulver, who had observed the tire marks at the scene and examined the photographs at trial, testified that he was \u201cpositive\u201d that all three marks had been made by the Cadillac as it \u201cspinned broadside\u201d following the collision. This was the only testimony attributing the third mark to either vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant\u2019s theory of contributory negligence is that the plaintiff, without maintaining a proper lookout for traffic dangerously near, entered the highway and crossed into the left lane directly in the path of his car. The defendant emphasizes the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that, traveling at an average speed of seven to eight miles per hour, he moved seven feet onto the highway while looking to his left and, after looking to his right, another 14 feet before being struck. Contending that the plaintiff is bound by his own testimony and applying a mathematical formula, the defendant insists that it was physically impossible for the Cadillac to travel 300 feet from the traffic light while the pickup traveled 14 feet. Referring to Whitley\u2019s testimony that he saw the Cadillac when it was \u201cabout halfway from the stoplight\u201d, the defendant claims that his car could have been no more than 150 feet away when the plaintiff entered the highway. Hence, he concludes, the plaintiff \u201ceither did not look or did not see the [defendant\u2019s] vehicle when it was in plain view and in dangerous proximity to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>A party litigant is generally bound by his own testimony. <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 462, 114 S.E. 652, 656 (1922). But there are exceptions to the general rule. \u201cIt does not apply to statements of opinion.\u201d <em>Baines </em>v. <em>Parker and Gladding, </em>217 Va. 100, 104, 225 S.E.2d 403, 407 (1976). Nor does the rule apply to an estimate of speed. <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>210 Va. 636, 639, 172 S.E.2d 784, 787 (1970). And \u201ca witness to an automobile accident is not held to . . . mathematical certainty in giving an estimate of distance\u201d. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Henley, </em>208 Va. 264, 269, 156 S.E.2d 618, 622 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The case at bar exemplifies the reason underlying the opinion exception to the <em>Massie </em>rule. Minor differences in estimates of speed and distance would undermine the conclusion the defendant draws from his mathematical formula. And the conclusion is contradicted by eyewitness testimony. Pulver said that the pickup already had entered the highway when \u201cthe Cadillac came around the other cars and went through the red light.\u201d When the plaintiff stopped in front of Whitley, Whitley saw no cars north of the traffic light; it was not until the plaintiff \u201chad pulled out into the road\u201d that Whitley saw the Cadillac. Looking to his left, the plaintiff saw no traffic moving in his direction, and looking to his right as he was obliged to do in completing his turn, he could not possibly see the Cadillac approaching from the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We find nothing incredible in this testimony. In three separate instructions, the trial court defined the plaintiff\u2019s duty to maintain a reasonable lookout as he entered the highway. The jurors\u2019 verdict shows that they rejected the rigid mathematical computation urged by the defendant and found that the plaintiff had kept a proper lookout. We cannot say as a matter of law that their finding is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Nevertheless, the defendant contends that the physical evidence proves the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. Although he testified at trial that the plaintiff ran heedlessly into the right side of his car, the defendant now argues that the plaintiff negligently drove into the left lane in front of his car. The physical evidence, he says, overcomes all oral evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u201c[Wjhen physical facts are relied upon to overcome oral testimony they must be established by evidence so clearly preponderating that the existence of such facts is unmistakable.\u201d <em>Weddle, Administratrix </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>204 Va. 319, 323, 130 S.E.2d 462, 466 (1963). Oral evidence is overcome only when \u201cthe physical facts are such as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>demonstrate that the oral evidence ... is incredible\u201d. <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>179 Va. 19, 23, 18 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The photographs arguably permit an inference that the tire mark leading from the left lane to a point near the curb was made by the pickup. But such an inference is not an \u201cunmistakable\u201d physical fact. Indeed, other physical evidence raises a contrary inference. If, as the defendant asserts, the Cadillac was wholly in the left lane and the pickup partly in the right lane when they collided, debris from the two vehicles probably would have fallen across both lanes; but, as the investigating officer testified and as the photographs graphically confirm, most of the debris was deposited in the right lane and only a minor portion in the left lane just across the dividing line. Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the physical evidence that the pickup was completely in the right lane when the vehicles collided.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Reinforcing this inference, the eyewitness testimony adduced by the plaintiff placed the point of impact in the right lane. When, as here, credible testimony is supported by an inference reasonably deducible from the physical evidence, a conflicting inference raised by the physical evidence does not overcome the oral evidence as a matter of law. Judging the credibility of the witnesses and weighing the evidence as a whole, the factfinders are free to choose among all reasonable inferences, although some inferences may be more probable than others. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>220 Va. 578, 582, 260 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1979). \u201c[T]he trial judge [may not] substitute his conclusion for that of the jury merely because he would have voted for a different verdict if he had been on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNeely, </em>204 Va. 218, 222, 129 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1963); <em>accord, Coleman </em>v. <em>Blankenship Oil Corp., </em>221 Va. 124, 129, 267 S.E.2d 143, 146 (1980); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Scott, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We hold that the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The judgment will be reversed, the jury\u2019s verdict will be reinstated, and final judgment will be entered here for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
