The policy was issued by appellee The Travelers Indemnity Company, also known as Travelers Insurance Company. Under the automobile coverages, the combination policy insured two motor vehicles owned by Whitaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The policy was effective on November 1, 1976, when Whitaker was operating a motor vehicle owned by appellant Michael Martin Bayer in which Bayer was riding as a passenger. On that day, a vehicle owned and operated by one James Dale Hay drove on the wrong side of a roadway and collided with Bayer\u2019s vehicle, injuring Bayer. Bayer previously had taken his car to Whitaker\u2019s shop for repairs, and Whitaker was in the process of road testing the vehicle some distance from the repair shop when the collision occurred. Both the Bayer and Hay vehicles were uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">Subsequently, Bayer sued Hay for damages. Bayer served Travelers with notice of that action, pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.1-381 (el), seeking to obtain coverage under the uninsured motorist provisions of Whitaker\u2019s policy with Travelers.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Later Travelers filed the instant declaratory judgment proceeding naming Bayer, Hay and Whitaker as defendants. Travelers sought an adjudication that it owed no contractual or statutory duty to Bayer under its policy of insurance with Whitaker. Upon consideration of the pleadings, the policy of insurance and argument of counsel, the trial court, in a memorandum opinion, ruled in favor of Travelers, finding that Bayer was not entitled to coverage under the policy. We awarded Bayer an appeal from the May 1978 judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The applicable uninsured motorist provisions of Travelers\u2019 policy provide that the insurer will pay, in accordance with Virginia\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Law, \u201call sums which the Insured . . . shall be legally entitled to recover\u201d as damages from the operator of an uninsured automobile because of bodily injury \u201csustained by the Insured.\u201d The uninsured motorist endorsement defines the word \u201cInsured\u201d as \u201c(a) the Named Insured and, while residents of the same household, his spouse and the relatives of either\u201d and \u201c(b) any other person while occupying an insured automobile.\u201d The endorsement defines \u201cInsured automobile\u201d as \u201can automobile registered in Virginia with respect to which the bodily injury and property damage liability coverages of the policy apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On appeal, Bayer contends the trial court erred in failing to rule he was afforded coverage under Travelers\u2019 Policy for his injuries sustained in the accident. He observes that to receive the benefits he must qualify as an \u201cInsured\u201d under the foregoing policy definition. Noting he is not the Named Insured nor a member of the same household or a relative of Whitaker, Bayer says the question is whether he meets the definition by virtue of being \u201cany other person . . . occupying an insured automobile.\u201d He contends resolution of the issue turns on whether the vehicle in which he was riding was an \u201cInsured automobile\u201d within the meaning of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Bayer\u2019s theory is that because Whitaker was a permissive user of Bayer\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident, the omnibus provisions of Whitaker\u2019s policy afforded Whitaker protection in the operation of the automobile. Thus, Bayer urges, in accordance with the policy language he was the occupant of an automobile \u201cwith respect to which the bodily injury and property damage liability coverages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the policy apply\u201d and was therefore riding in an \u201cInsured automobile.\u201d In effect Bayer argues, as the trial court noted, that Whitaker\u2019s liability coverage followed Whitaker into the Bayer vehicle, and thus the vehicle thereby became \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We do not agree with Bayer\u2019s contentions. Neither Travelers\u2019 general liability nor automobile liability policy provisions afforded coverage for Bayer\u2019s vehicle. Consequently, Bayer was not an \u201cInsured\u201d and his motor vehicle was not an \u201cInsured automobile\u201d within the meaning of the uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We will not burden this writing with detailed recitations of additional policy provisions. In summary, the combination policy was issued to Whitaker individually and covered two described motor vehicles. Non-owned automobiles, that is, automobiles not owned by Whitaker, were not covered. As to Whitaker, Bayer\u2019s automobile was a non-owned automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Moreover, the uninsured motorist endorsement was subject to the insuring agreements of the automobile and garage liability provisions of the policy; they covered Whitaker\u2019s use of a non-owned automobile only if Whitaker became legally obligated to pay damages. There was no allegation that Whitaker was at fault in the accident sued upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Furthermore, Bayer did not qualify as a \u201cperson insured\u201d under any of the basic liability provisions of the policy. In fact, the garage liability portion expressly eliminated as insured those persons like Bayer who were passengers in their own automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">In Virginia, uninsured motorist coverage is meant to protect an insured motorist, his family and permissive users of his vehicle against the peril of injury by an uninsured wrongdoer, not to provide \u201cinsurance coverage upon each and every uninsured vehicle to everyone.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mutual Casualty Co., </em>203 Va. 600, 603, 125 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1962). Here, Bayer seeks to use the basic liability coverage protecting Whitaker individually during his operation of a non-owned automobile as a means of cloaking the Bayer vehicle with uninsured motorist coverage. As we have demonstrated, the only Travelers\u2019 coverage \u201capplying\u201d to Bayer\u2019s vehicle was that afforded Whitaker in the event he was legally liable for damages while operating that vehicle. The words \u201cliability coverages\u201d in the \u201cInsured automobile\u201d definition of the uninsured motorist endorsement, <em>supra, </em>did not refer to Travelers\u2019 uninsured motorist coverage. Hence, Bayer\u2019s vehicle was not an \u201cInsured automobile\u201d and Bayer was not an \u201cInsured\u201d under the policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>See Davidson </em>v. <em>Eastern Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., </em>245 S.C. 472, 141 S.E.2d 135 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">For these reasons, we conclude the trial court did not err and the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Insofar as pertinent here, \u00a7 38.1-381(el) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">Any insured intending to rely on the coverage required by [the Virginia Unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>sured Motorist Law] shall, if any action is instituted against the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, serve a copy of the process upon the insurance company issuing the policy in the manner prescribed by law, as though such insurance company were a party defendant; such company shall thereafter have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle or in its own name;....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
