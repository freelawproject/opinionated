F. McMahon, filed a bill of complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the City of Virginia Beach (the City). Plaintiffs sought an adjudication that the mandatory water connection ordinance adopted in 1977 by the City Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>was unconstitutional and an injunction to prohibit the City and its agents from requiring plaintiffs to comply with the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The parties agreed to a comprehensive stipulation of facts. An <em>ore terms </em>hearing was also conducted and on April 28, 1978, the trial court entered a final decree dismissing the Committee to Save Our Wells as a party, and upholding the constitutionality and validity of the ordinance. The individual landowners have appealed, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s failure to rule that the City exceeded its power in adopting the ordinance requiring them to connect with the City\u2019s water system and to pay various water connection charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Prior to adoption of the ordinance the landowners, who reside in the various residential areas of the City, had at their own expense installed wells varying in depth from 50 to 165 feet, sufficiently deep to avoid contamination from septic tanks. Tests of some of the wells, which the City made at the request of the owners, revealed no bacterial contamination. Although the testing program was not complete, the parties stipulated that the quantity and quality of the landowners\u2019 well water was good. It was further stipulated that each landowner had invested several hundred dollars in wells and related equipment, and that some of the landowners, before making such investment, had been informed by City personnel that the City did not require \u201chookups to City water nor did the City contemplate mandatory hookups\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The City has been concerned for many years with the problem of providing an adequate water supply for its residents. Under a contract expiring in 1993, the City purchases its water at a bulk rate from surplus supplies of the City of Norfolk. Numerous studies made by consultants, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and others, have addressed the water problem. In the summer of 1977, a serious drought in Tidewater Virginia caused the City and the City of Norfolk to impose mandatory water conservation measures. Nevertheless, there was evidence that the City of Norfolk had recently increased its own water resources and expanded its treatment facilities sufficiently to assure an abundant supply of water for both municipalities until the end of the contract period. The City, however, had employed engineers to study and recommend alternative sources of water to supplement the supply available under the contract. These alternatives included potable water that might be withdrawn from shallow wells, such as those of the landowners, and brackish water that might be withdrawn from deep wells and made potable by treatment in a proposed desalinization plant. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the City had found that its water distribution system was deficient, and presented potentially serious health problems, especially at the waterfront.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">A capital improvement program was proposed to finance water and sewer lines. The City\u2019s financial consultants, in recommending that the City issue $20,000,000 in general obligation bonds, did not suggest a mandatory connection ordinance. Upon recommendation of the City Manager, however, approved by the financial consultants in a supplemental report, City Council in March, 1977, adopted a mandatory connection ordinance, providing in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">Sec. 37-28. Connection required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">The owner of any dwelling or other building in which human beings live or congregate shall, whenever a public water line hereafter is made available by the city, connect such building or dwelling with such water line within one year after such line becomes available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The parties stipulated that the word \u201cconnection\u201d, as administratively construed by the City, means bringing the water service line to the dwelling. The line does not have to be brought into the dwelling but \u201cshould be readily accessible if and when the supply is needed\u201d. It was further stipulated that the ordinance prohibited \u201cthe cross-connection between City and well water\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Section 37-29 of the City Code prescribed the applicable connection and installation fees, requiring a minimum fee of $220. This section also provided for payment of a fee for installation of a waterline in the street, the fee for the first 100 feet of frontage of a single-family residence lot being $500, plus $5 for each foot in excess of 100 feet. Thus, the minimum fees would be $220 and $500, respectively, or a total of $720.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The City estimated that the ordinance would require that approximately 4,500 dwellings be connected to the municipal water system, resulting in collection of fees aggregating $3,465,000 \u201cplus or minus $1,000,000\u201d. Clearly, the average fee, based upon an estimated total of $3,465,000, would be $770, or slightly in excess of the minimum. There was evidence that the average frontage of the landowners\u2019 lots exceeded 100 feet, and it was stipulated that the installation of the average eight-inch waterline in front of a dwelling cost $22 per linear foot. Thus the average cost of installing a waterline in the street abutting a landowner\u2019s property would be $2,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Included in the stipulation was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">K. Well water\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">(1) Subsurface wells could at any time become polluted without prior knowledge of the City or the plaintiffs. The Norfolk Water System is routinely monitored for water quality under the National Safe Drinking Water Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">(2) A prolonged water table decline could make plaintiffs\u2019 wells inoperable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">(3) A prolonged lack of electricity would render plaintiffs\u2019 wells useless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">(4) A significant drawdown of ground water might create a salt water intrusion in the plaintiffs\u2019 wells.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">The likelihood of the foregoing to occur is small.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">In its final decree the trial court ruled that Code \u00a7 15.1-875<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorized a city, under the police powers set forth in Code \u00a7 15.1-873,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to require connection of premises with a municipal water system. The constitutionality of such a requirement, as the court noted, was upheld in <em>Sanitation Commission </em>v. <em>Craft, </em>196 Va. 1140, 87 S.E.2d 153 (1955). In that case, pursuant to enabling legislation, a resolution required abutting property owners to connect with the public water system and to abandon the use of any privately owned well water. We held, relying upon <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>City of Valdosta, </em>227 U.S. 303 (1913), that the resolution was a valid exercise of police power as a public health measure, and did not constitute a taking of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The landowners conceded that the City under certain circumstances may require the use of public water if necessary to protect the health of its inhabitants. But they contend that the City cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>successfully argue that the ordinance, which requires them to connect with the water system but does not require them to use the water, is a valid health measure rather than an impermissible revenue-producing device. They distinguish <em>Craft </em>on this ground and additionally submit that in <em>Craft </em>there was evidence, not present in this case, that the private wells were located on lots where septic tanks, cesspools and outdoor toilets were maintained, and that some of the well water had occasionally been contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Although the landowners raised the due process question, they wisely chose not to pursue it. <em>Craft </em>resolved the due process issue in the context of a mandatory termination of use of private wells; the present case involves no such mandatory termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The landowners argue that even if the City can assess them with the cost of installing the waterlines in the streets abutting their properties it cannot charge connection fees until they elect to connect and use the City water. Contending that no reasonable relationship obtains between the connection fees and the police power of the City, the landowners assert that the charges, imposed upon them for a service that they neither need nor want, constitute invalid special assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We consider first the question whether the ordinance is a legitimate health measure. The trial court found that there was no evidence that the City in the exercise of its statutory authority had acted arbitrarily, unreasonably or capriciously, and accordingly affirmed the validity of the ordinance. We agree. A local governing body must necessarily enjoy broad discretionary powers to protect the public health and general welfare of its residents. To anticipate seemingly unlikely events, such as those included in Stipulation K, as public health hazards may be to exercise commendable prudence and foresight. There is no requirement that protective measures be limited to actions taken after a crisis has arisen or a catastrophic disaster has struck. Although Code \u00a7 15.1-873 designates other purposes which may justify the enactment of a mandatory connection ordinance pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-875, we find the public health purpose alone sufficient to support the conclusion that the present ordinance constitutes a valid exercise of the City\u2019s police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Moreover, the trial court found that because the charges imposed by the ordinance would not exceed the actual cost to the City of installing the waterlines in the streets in front of the landowners\u2019 residences, a reasonable correlation arose between the benefit conferred and the cost exacted. This finding, which negates the land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>owners\u2019 contention that the ordinance was adopted solely as a revenue measure, is amply supported by the evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the ordinance is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Inasmuch as the ordinance does not apply to vacant lots, we conclude that the trial court correctly ruled that the charges imposed by \u00a7 37-29 of the City Code are fees rather than special assessments. This ruling is consistent with our holding in <em>Craft, </em>where we rejected the argument that the mandatory connection resolution constituted a special assessment on abutting property owners that would have violated Section 170 of the 1902 Constitution of Virginia then in effect. The constitutional limitation on special assessments has been removed by Article X Section 3 of the 1971 Constitution, and Code \u00a7 15.1-239 now expressly permits special assessments for waterlines provided the assessments shall not exceed the peculiar benefits to the properties. The trial court found that either as fees or as special assessments the charges reasonably corresponded to the peculiar benefits conferred, and this finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We find no merit in the landowners\u2019 argument, unsupported by any case authority, that the City is estopped from enforcing the ordinance as to them. <em>See Segaloff </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>209 Va. 259, 261, 163 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">For the reasons assigned, we will affirm the decree of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-14\"> In view of the large number of applicants, as a matter of convenience only the name of B.
