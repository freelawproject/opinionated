Royal purchased a quantity of these windows from Lansing and installed them in houses of its customers. Subsequently, Royal began receiving complaints from its customers that the windows were drafty and that moisture formed between the panes of the windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">Lansing initiated these proceedings by filing two motions for judgment against Royal for debts due on account. (These claims were decided in favor of Lansing and are not in issue here.) Royal counterclaimed, alleging it suffered damage as the result of Lansing\u2019s breach of its warranty that the windows were \u201cDraft Free\u201d and \u201cCondensation Free\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">Lansing\u2019s account claims and Royal\u2019s counterclaim for breach of warranty were tried before a jury. At the close of Royal\u2019s case in chief on the counterclaim, Lansing moved the court to strike Royal\u2019s evidence and enter summary judgment for Lansing on the grounds that Royal had failed to prove the existence or breach of any express warranty, and that Royal had failed to prove damages resulting from any breach of warranty. The trial court did not expressly rule on the motion, but, <em>sua sponte, </em>and over Lansing\u2019s objection, interjected an implied warranty of fitness theory of recovery. At the conclusion of all the evidence, Lansing renewed its motion to strike Royal\u2019s evidence, and the trial court sustained the motion as it pertained to express warranty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but overruled it insofar as an implied warranty theory was concerned. The case was submitted to the jury on the theory of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>implied warranty and a verdict was returned on the counterclaim in favor of Royal in the amount of $25,000.00. Lansing\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and to enter final judgment in its favor was overruled by the trial court, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">An examination of Royal\u2019s counterclaim shows that it alleged the breach of an express warranty<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it contains no allegation of the existence or breach of an implied warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">It is firmly established that no court can base its judgment or decree upon facts not alleged or upon a right which has not been pleaded and claimed. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 207, 181 S.E. 521, 525 (1935). \u201cPleadings are as essential as proof, and no relief should be granted that does not substantially accord with the case as made in the pleading.\u201d <em>Bank of Giles County </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>199 Va. 176, 180, 98 S.E.2d 905, 907 (1957); <em>see also, Lee </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>200 Va. 799, 802, 108 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1959). This rule is clearly stated in <em>Potts </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-6\">The basis of every right of recovery under our system of jurisprudence is a pleading setting forth facts warranting the granting of the relief sought. It is the <em>sine qua non </em>of every judgment or decree. No court can base its decree upon facts not alleged, nor render its judgment upon a right, however meritorious, which has not been pleaded and claimed. . . . Pleadings are as essential as proof, the one being unavailing without the other. A decree cannot be entered in the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same, and if so entered it is void. . .. Every litigant is entitled to be told by his adversary in plain and explicit language what is his ground of complaint or defense... . The issues in a case are made by the pleadings, and not by the testimony of witnesses or other evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">165 Va. at 207, 181 S.E. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">In <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Acceptance Corporation, </em>204 Va. 4, 9, 129 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1963), and <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Oldsmobile Company, </em>207 Va. 972, 975, 154 S.E.2d 140, 143 (1967), we clearly recognized the distinction between an action for breach of express warranty and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>for breach of an implied warranty. This distinction is also recognized in the Uniform Commercial Code. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.2-313 to 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">In the <em>Bolling </em>case, the Bollings sought to show the existence and breach of an implied warranty, although their pleadings alleged a claim based only on an express oral warranty. In rejecting the Bollings\u2019 contention, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-5\">The Bollings\u2019 pleadings did not mention implied warranty but, to the contrary, set forth that an express oral warranty was made to them prior to the purchase of the truck and the execution of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-6\">The Bollings represented to the chancellor, during argument concerning the questioned testimony, that they wished to prove the existence and breach of an implied warranty, and that the testimony was admissible for this purpose. This position was taken in the face of the allegation in their pleadings that they relied solely upon the breach of an express oral warranty. Thus, they were attempting to prove a case different from that made out in their pleadings. The function of pleading is to inform the opposing party of the nature of the case to be made against him. That purpose would be defeated if it were permissible to allege one case and prove another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">204 Va. at 9, 129 S.E.2d at 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">In the present case, Royal\u2019s claim for damages was based on the theory that Lansing expressly warranted that the windows were \u201cDraft Free\u201d and \u201cCondensation Free\u201d and that it breached that warranty. Royal did not allege the existence or breach of an implied warranty of fitness or merchantability. We are of opinion that the court erred in submitting Royal\u2019s case to the jury on an implied warranty theory of recovery not raised by the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from will be reversed, and final judgment entered for Lansing on Royal\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-12\"> No cross-error having been assigned by Royal to this ruling, it has become final. Rule 5:27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1309-10\"> The counterclaim reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-11\">3. That the windows sold to Royal by Lansing as seller were warrented [sic] and represented to be \u201cDraft Free\u201d and \u201cCondensation Free\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-12\">4. That the windows sold to Royal, by seller, Lansing, contrary to their warrenty [sic], were not draft free and the windows allowed moisture to condense on the inside of the windows, creating a condensation problem inside the homes in which they were installed by Royal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
