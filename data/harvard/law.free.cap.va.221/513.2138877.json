The jury fixed Turner\u2019s punishment at one year in the penitentiary for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and life imprisonment for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-300(A). In the second stage of the bifurcated proceeding conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3 and -264.4, the jury fixed the defendant\u2019s punishment for capital murder at death. At the conclusion of a separate sentencing hearing conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court sentenced the defendant to death for capital murder and sentenced him in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdicts on the other two offenses. The defendant is here for an automatic review of the death sentence, consolidated with his appeal from his several convictions. Code \u00a7 17-110.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On July 12, 1978, at approximately 11:30 a.m., Willie Lloyd Turner, a black male, entered a jewelry store owned and operated by W. Jack Smith, Jr., a white male. In addition to Smith, an employee (Mary Huffman) and a customer were present when Turner entered the store. After entering the store,- Turner displayed a sawed-off shotgun previously concealed by a towel and demanded money and jewelry. Smith, while placing money and jewelry into the store\u2019s jewelry bags, triggered a silent alarm alerting the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Judith R. Cosby and Police Officer Alan D. Bain, having entered the store without knowing a robbery was in progress, were detained in the store by Turner. Having discovered Smith had triggered a silent alarm, Turner demanded that Smith turn off the alarm. After acceding to Turner\u2019s demand, Smith, along with Cosby, began placing additional valuables designated by Turner into jewelry bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Near the rear of the store, Turner examined a revolver taken from Bain and fired a bullet toward the rear wall. Turner stated if he saw or heard any additional police officers, he was going to start killing those in the store. About that time, Bain heard a siren. Turner then walked from the back of the store toward the middle of the store, where Smith was stationed behind a counter, and fired a bullet from the revolver at Smith without warning. Smith, with blood on his temple, slumped behind the counter. Bain began talking with Turner, promising him to take him anywhere he wanted to go and asking him not to shoot again. While Bain talked with Turner, two occupants scrambled out the front door. After Turner told Bain he was going to kill Smith because he had triggered the silent alarm, Turner leaned over the counter and fired two bullets from the revolver into Smith\u2019s chest in rapid succession. Bain then grabbed and subdued Turner while Cosby ran out the front door. Smith died as a result of the bullets fired by Turner into Smith\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">II. JURY SELECTION AND SEQUESTRATION</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Several of the defendant\u2019s assignments of error concern the manner in which voir dire was conducted. Over defense counsel\u2019s objections, the trial judge ruled that he alone would ask the questions of prospective jurors during voir dire. He also concluded that he would question jurors in groups of five, except when questioning jurors concerning their views on the death penalty. Although questioning concerning the death penalty occurred at least initially in groups of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>five, each prospective juror was required to answer individually at least two questions concerning capital punishment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the day of trial, the court asked counsel for the Commonwealth and the defendant to submit questions they wished to have asked. Turner\u2019s counsel submitted a list of fifteen questions, nine of which were asked by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">A. <em>Refusal to Allow Counsel-Conducted'Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The defendant contends that Code \u00a7 8.01-358<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives both court and counsel an unconditional right to question prospective jurors directly and that the trial court abridged this statutorily created right by refusing to allow counsel-conducted voir dire. Citing Supreme Court Rule 3A:20(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Commonwealth replies that trial courts have discretion in determining whether to permit counsel-conducted voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The Constitution of Virginia, Art. VI, \u00a7 5, prohibits the promulgation of any court rule \u201cin conflict with the general law as the same shall, from time to time, be established by the General Assembly.\u201d Supreme Court Rule 3A:20(a) clearly makes the right to counsel-conducted voir dire contingent upon the trial court\u2019s approval. In resolving the issue before us, we must determine whether Code \u00a7 8.01-358 confers upon attorneys the unconditional right to question prospective jurors directly. If Code \u00a7 8.01-358 confers such a right, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>prevails over that portion of Rule 3A:20(a) which makes the exercise of that right contingent upon the trial court\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 8.01-358 is useful in discerning whether the General Assembly intended to confer such a right upon attorneys. The Code of 1887 \u00a7 3154 required trial courts to question prospective jurors when requested to do so by the litigants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Code of 1919 \u00a7 6000 enlarged a trial court\u2019s powers by providing that a court could question jurors even though not requested to do so by counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The pertinent language remained unchanged for several decades. <em>See </em>Code of 1950 \u00a7 8-199 (1950). In 1966, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 8-199 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cThe court <em>and counsel for either party </em>may examine on oath any person who is called as a juror therein <em>and may ask such person or furor directly any relevant question </em>to ascertain whether he is related to either party, or has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein; and the party objecting to any juror may introduce any competent evidence in support of the objection; and if it shall appear to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause, another shall be drawn or called and placed in his stead for the trial of that case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Acts 166, c. 496, at 676 (language added in 1966 italicized). On June 15, 1971, this court promulgated a comprehensive set of rules governing criminal practice and procedure, to be effective January 1, 1972. One of these rules was Rule 3A:20, which unambiguously gives the trial court discretion in determining whether to allow counsel-conducted voir dire. 211 Va. cvi (1971). Code \u00a7 8-199 was recodified as Code \u00a7 8-208.28 in 1973 without any change. Acts 1973, c. 439, at 651-52. In another recodification, the texts of Code \u00a7\u00a7 8-215 (1957 Repl. Vol.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 8-208.28 were combined to form the present text of Code \u00a7 8.01-358. Acts 1977, c. 617, at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">As both parties recognize, we have not previously resolved whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the 1966 amendment to this statute confers upon attorneys an unconditional right to participate directly in voir dire. In <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 574, 166 S.E.2d 232 (1969), we held that when a litigant\u2019s attorney has agreed that the judge alone would ask the voir dire questions, he or she cannot require the trial judge to exercise that right in a particular fashion. In upholding Harmon\u2019s conviction, we concluded that the statutory <em>permission </em>for the court to ask such questions directly does not <em>require </em>a court to do so. Thus, the trial court was permitted, but not required as contended by Harmon, to question jurors individually. In regard to voir dire conducted by counsel, we noted that the propounding of questions by the trial judge, and not by counsel for the defendant, was \u201cin accordance with the usual practice.\u201d 209 Va. at 579, 166 S.E.2d at 236. We also concluded that the word \u201cmay\u201d \u201cis not mandatory but permissive and leaves the matter to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d 209 Va. at 580, 166 S.E.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Prior to the 1966 amendment, the litigants\u2019 counsel had no authority whatsoever for directly participating in voir dire examinations. \u201cAlthough the statute formerly required the judge alone to ask the questions, in practice most trial courts <em>permitted </em>counsel to ask them directly.\u201d Boyd, <em>Practice and Pleading </em>\u2014 The <em>Twelfth Annual Survey of Virginia Law: 1966-1967, </em>53 Va. L. Rev. 1763, 1781 (1967) (emphasis added). The 1966 amendment \u201csanctioned] this deviation and [brought] Virginia in line with the procedure in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the amendment authorized what was already in fact occurring: counsel\u2019s participation in voir dire when permitted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Cognizant that the statutory language might be subject to different interpretations, this court in 1971 promulgated Rule 3A:20(a) of the Rules of Criminal Practice and Procedure. This Rule, which clearly makes counsel\u2019s participation in voir dire contingent upon the trial court\u2019s approval, resolved any ambiguity present in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Turner suggests that, even if Code \u00a7 8.01-358 confers no unconditional right to counsel-conducted voir dire, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow defense counsel to question prospective jurors directly and in not questioning each prospective juror out of the presence of other jurors. While the defendant has a constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, he has no constitutional right to counsel-conducted voir dire. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>409 F.2d 669, 671 (4th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1062 (1970). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>In the absence of a statute or court rule to the contrary, as long as the selection procedure results in a fair and impartial jury, the manner in which a jury is to be selected is properly within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. Thus, the trial court\u2019s refusal to question jurors individually out of the presence of other prospective jurors and the court\u2019s refusal to allow counsel-conducted voir dire do not represent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dean </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 666, 669, 166 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1969). We have carefully examined the voir dire conducted by the trial judge and believe it resulted in a fair and impartial jury. Under such circumstances, we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">B. <em>Refusal to Ask Specific Questions Proposed by Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">As noted previously, the trial court refused to ask several questions proposed by defense counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Turner contends that the failure to ask these questions constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The pre-1966 text of what is now Code \u00a7 8.01-358 provided that \u201c[t]he court shall, on motion of either party in any suit, examine\u201d jurors to ascertain their qualifications concerning impartiality and lack of bias. The 1966 amendment deleted this requirement, providing merely that \u201cthe court. . . may examine [a prospective juror] and may ask [such juror] any relevant question.\u201d In <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>209 Va. at 580, 166 S.E.2d at 236, we held that this statutory language \u201cis not mandatory but permissive and leaves the matter to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d With the exception of seven questions, all of which were asked in this case, Rule 3A:20(a) makes voir dire questioning entirely discretionary with the trial court. Unless the refusal to ask a question amounts to a denial of due process or otherwise impinges upon the right to a fair and impartial jury, <em>see, e.g., Ham </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524 (1973), the present wording of Code \u00a7 8.01-358 and Rule 3A:20(a) empowers a trial court to use its discretion in determining whether to ask questions proposed by either the Commonwealth or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to ask the questions proposed by defense counsel did not impinge upon the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury. While \u201cthe wiser course generally is to propound appropriate questions designed to identify racial prejudice if requested by the defendant,\u201d a trial court\u2019s refusal to do so is not constitutionally objectionable in the absence of factors similar to those in <em>Hams.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Ristaino </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 597 n.9 (1976). The mere fact that a defendant is black and that a victim is white does not constitutionally mandate such an inquiry. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 31, 35-36, 235 S.E.2d 320, 323 (1977). The refusal of the trial court to ask other questions, those concerning the circumstances under which a prospective juror would vote for the death penalty, likewise is not constitutionally objectionable. The voir dire questioning conducted by the trial judge probed many of the areas touched upon by these questions and assured the removal of those who would invariably impose capital punishment. The court\u2019s instructions to the jury clearly delineated the circumstances in which the death penalty could be imposed. Since the questioning actually conducted by the court preserved the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury, the trial court\u2019s refusal to ask the voir dire questions proposed by defense counsel was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">C. <em>Examination of Prospective Jurors Concerning Attitudes About Capital Punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">For the reasons stated in <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 690-91, 251 S.E.2d 202, 207, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>(1979), we reject Turner\u2019s contention that the trial court should not have questioned prospective jurors concerning their willingness to impose capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We likewise believe that the trial court properly struck Samuel Cypress from the venire. After asking Cypress variations of the questions asked of others on the panel,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the trial judge concluded that Cypress\u2019 objections to capital punishment were absolute. While jurors may not be excluded \u201csimply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction,\u201d <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 522 (1968), those jurors irrevocably committed to voting against the death penalty may be excluded. <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 250, 257 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 464, 248 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). The trial court\u2019s determination that a juror is irrevocably committed to voting against the death penalty will not be disturbed on appeal unless we can say the prospective juror\u2019s commitment against the death penalty was not \u201cunmistakably clear.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 465, 248 S.E.2d at 141. <em>Accord, Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. at 250, 257 S.E.2d at 802. On the basis of the answers given by Cypress, the trial court reasonably concluded he was irrevocably committed against the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">D. <em>Sequestration of the Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Turner sought and obtained a change of venue from Southampton County to Northampton County. Upon learning of a recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Northampton County case involving the death penalty and another murder in the area, defense counsel moved for another change in venue and for sequestration of the jury, both of which were denied. Turner contends that the refusal to sequester the jury was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">As Turner\u2019s counsel notes, a judge has discretion in determining whether to sequester a jury. The mere fact of media coverage does not require a judge to sequester a jury. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 498, 247 S.E.2d 707 (1978). A trial judge\u2019s discretion regarding sequestration extends to cases involving capital punishment. We hold that, in the absence of any indication of pretrial prejudicial publicity, a trial judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to sequester a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">III. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE DEATH PENALTY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">A. <em>Facial Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Turner contends that Virginia\u2019s statutory provisions concerning the death penalty are facially unconstitutional for reasons previously rejected by us. <em>See Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 434-40, 271 S.E.2d 123, 125-26 (1980); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 1094-95, 254 S.E.2d 116, 118-19 (1979); <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 698-99, 251 S.E.2d 202, 211 (1979); and <em>Smith </em>v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 455, 476-79, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148-49 (1978). We reaffirm these prior holdings concerning the facial constitutionality of the death penalty statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Turner also argues that the imposition of the death penalty on the basis of a jury\u2019s conclusion regarding a defendant\u2019s propensity for future crime is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statutory objective of isolating a criminal, according to Turner, can be accomplished through the less drastic measure of life imprisonment. As Turner acknowledges, <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262 (1976), upheld as constitutional a Texas statute allowing the imposition of the death penalty where a jury determines, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant would probably commit \u201ccriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>to society.\u201d 428 U.S. at 269. While the only issue explicitly addressed concerning a defendant\u2019s propensity for future criminal conduct was whether the jury was being asked to resolve a question beyond its competency, 428 U.S. at 274-76, we believe <em>Jurek </em>holds that a defendant\u2019s propensity for future criminal acts of violence is an acceptable consideration in determining whether to impose the death penalty. <em>See also Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 183 n.28 (1976) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">B. <em>Constitutionality as Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Citing <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>446 U.S. 420 (1980), Turner contends there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that his conduct in committing the offense \u201cwas outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. As we noted in <em>James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980) (this day decided), <em>Godfrey </em>rested upon its unique facts. The <em>Godfrey </em>prosecutor conceded the defendant had not tortured the victims or committed an aggravated battery upon them. 446 U.S. at 426. Godfrey had no prior criminal record. Thus, the death sentence rested upon the jury\u2019s finding that Godfrey\u2019s actions had been \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that [they] involved . . . depravity of mind.\u201d 446 U.S. at 432. Rejecting such a conclusion as unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of the United States noted several facts: Godfrey\u2019s victims, family members who had caused him \u201cextreme emotional trauma,\u201d were killed instantaneously; and shortly after the killings Godfrey acknowledged his involvement and the heinous nature of his crimes. Godfrey\u2019s crimes were not deemed to reflect \u201ca consciousness materially more \u2018depraved\u2019 than that of any person guilty of murder.\u201d In summary, the state had not proven \u201ca principled way to distinguish this case, in which the death penalty was imposed, from the many cases in which it was not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The second clause of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 (hereafter, the \u201cvileness\u201d clause) provides specific criteria which must be met before the death penalty can be imposed on the basis of this clause. The conduct in committing the offense must be deemed to be \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Second, the jury must conclude that the conduct establishes one of the following: torture of the victim, an aggravated battery of the victim, or the perpetrator\u2019s depravity of mind. <em>See Hance </em>v. <em>State, </em>245 Ga. 856, 268 S.E.2d 339 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>In the present case, the Commonwealth established that Turner\u2019s conduct was \u201coutrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman.\u201d Turner first shot Smith in the head without warning. After Smith slumped behind the counter, Bain immediately pleaded with Turner not to fire any more. After the defendant had fired one bullet hitting the rear-wall and another one hitting Smith\u2019s head, Cosby became nauseous and asked if she could be seated. Rejecting Bain\u2019s pleas, Turner then leaned over the counter and fired two bullets into Smith\u2019s chest. While Smith was slumped behind the counter, Cosby heard him \u201cgurgling.\u201d The evidence also establishes Turner committed an \u201caggravated battery\u201d: a \u201cbattery which, qualitatively and quantitatively, is more culpable than the minimum necessary to accomplish an act of murder.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 478, 248 S.E.2d 135, 149 (1978). After being wounded by Turner, Smith slumped helplessly behind the counter. Unlike Godfrey\u2019s victims, Smith did not die instantaneously from a single discharge of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Virginia\u2019s death penalty statute authorizes the imposition of the death penalty if either the \u201cdangerousness\u201d or \u201cvileness\u201d standard is met. Even if Turner\u2019s crime did not meet the \u201cvileness\u201d standard, imposition of the death penalty would be permissible under the \u201cdangerousness\u201d standard.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the basis of Turner\u2019s prior criminal record, set forth in footnote 11, the jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant would probably \u201ccommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">IV. REFUSAL TO INSTRUCT THE JURY CONCERNING MURDER IN THE COMMISSION OF AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d), as noted earlier, provides that murder \u201cin the commission of robbery\u201d while armed with a deadly weapon is capital murder. Code \u00a7 18.2-32 provides that murder \u201cin the commission of, or attempt to commit,\u201d robbery is first-degree murder. Whereas Code \u00a7 18.2-32 is violated by a murder in an attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>robbery, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d) is not. To be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d), the defendant must have committed a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Turner contends that the jury should have been instructed concerning the lesser offense of first-degree murder because the evidence failed to establish the commission of a robbery. While Turner never had physical possession of the jewelry bags personally, we believe the requirement of asportation has been satisfied in this case. \u201cThe degree of asportation necessary to constitute a taking under the common law definition of robbery need be only slight.\u201d <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 166, 168, 198 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1973). A perpetrator exercises dominion and control over an object where he commands another to seize the object and the person complies. In this case, Turner at gunpoint commanded Smith and Cosby to place money and valuables into jewelry bags owned by the store. Placing the money and valuables into the bags as requested, Smith and Cosby then put the bags on the counter. Turner exercised dominion and control over the money and valuables when Smith and Cosby asported these items at his command.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">V. DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Citing <em>Busic </em>v. <em>United States, </em>446 U.S. 398 (1980), Turner contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was violated when he was convicted of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as well as murder in the commission of a robbery \u201cwhile armed with a deadly weapon,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d). In <em>Busic, </em>the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), providing enhanced punishment for one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>using or carrying a firearm<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in the commission of a felony, could not be applied to a defendant using a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a deadly weapon is used. Both <em>Busic </em>and its precursor, <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 6 (1978), were based upon a determination of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy consists of three separate guarantees: (1) \u201cIt protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. [(2)] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [(3)] And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415 (1980) quoting <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). In determining whether a defendant has been twice convicted for the \u201csame offense,\u201d U. S. Const., amend. V, courts have been guided by the test set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932): \u201c[T]he test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each [statutory] provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">We need not resolve whether one convicted of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony (Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1) and murder in the commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon [Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (d)] has been convicted twice for the \u201csame offense\u201d under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the defendant\u2019s convictions stem from a single criminal trial. Consequently, only the third constitutional guarantee (the guarantee against multiple punishments) is at issue in this appeal. The constitutional guarantee against multiple punishments \u201cis limited to assuring that the court does not exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977). Where two or <em>more </em>punishments for separate statutory violations are imposed in a single criminal proceeding, \u201cthe question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 698 (1980) (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The General Assembly has clearly indicated its intent to impose multiple punishments for capital murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides that a \u201c[v]iolation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony\u201d and that the punishment imposed for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cshall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.\u201d This language reflects an unambiguous intent to authorize multiple punishment for a single criminal transaction. Thus, Turner\u2019s double jeopardy claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">VI. REVIEW REQUIRED BY CODE \u00a7 17.110.1</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) requires that we consider and determine whether the death sentence \u201cwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u201d We have carefully considered the record in this case and find no indication that the death sentence was the product of these enumerated factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C) (2) requires us, after \u201cconsidering both the crime and the defendant,\u201d to determine whether the death sentence \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\u201d We have reviewed death sentences in those cases involving murder in the commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. <em>James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57, (1980); <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 532, 273 S.E.2d 48 (1980); <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 260, 257 S.E.2d 808 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 243, 257 S.E.2d 797 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). While the atrociousness involved in Turner\u2019s murder does not rise to the level evidenced in <em>Stamper, James Dyral Briley, </em>or <em>Coppola, </em>Turner\u2019s murder is just as brutal as the murders in <em>Linwood Earl Briley </em>and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 201, 257 S.E.2d 784 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>1049 (1980). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s criminal record, detailed in footnote 11, is one of the most extensive we have reviewed under Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C). Turner, unlike any of the other defendants except for Mason,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> had been convicted for a previous murder. Certainly his prior criminal record is as extensive or more extensive than the criminal records of those other defendants sentenced to death for murder in the commission of an armed robbery. Having considered \u201cboth the crime and the defendant,\u201d Code \u00a7 17-110.1 (C) (2), we conclude the death sentence is not excessive or disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">VII. OTHER ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">For the reasons stated in <em>James Dyral Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>and <em>Linwood Briley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>we reject Turner\u2019s contention that a further change in venue was necessary. We likewise reject his argument that photographs of the victim and crime scene should not have been introduced into evidence. <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 692, 251 S.E.2d at 207-08. Moreover, Turner\u2019s contention that the jury should have been given an instruction concerning the possibility of parole has no merit. <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. at 278, 257 S.E.2d at 821; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. at 214, 257 S.E.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Turner raises several other assignments of error, discussed neither in his brief nor in oral argument. After examining each of these assigned errors, we conclude that they have no merit and require no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Having given the defendant\u2019s case both appellate and independent review, we conclude there is no reversible error in either his convictions or sentences, and we find no other reason to disturb or commute his death sentence. Therefore, we affirm the judgments pronounced by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d) provides that \u201c[t]he willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of any person in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon\u201d constitutes capital murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> Jurors were asked variations of the following questions: \u201cDo you have any religious or conscientious scruples or objections against the imposition of the death sentence?\u201d and \u201cDo you feel that in each and every case, regardless of the facts, where a person is convicted of murder he should receive the death penalty?\u201d Those jurors answering no to both questions were deemed suitable, without further questioning, with respect to their attitude toward the death penalty.
