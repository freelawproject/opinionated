The defendant duly excepted. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">The evidence would have warranted the jury in finding the following facts. The plaintiff married Stavroula Mariolis on January 4, 1939. They lived together happily until about December 15, 1942. At that time the attitude of his wife toward the plaintiff changed. She became cold toward him. He found at that time a telegram in her pocketbook which read as follows: \u201cPlease call at once 2174. Bill\u201d (the defendant). The plaintiff discovered that she was making curtains for the defendant and chided her for so doing. On December 31, the plaintiff and his wife were invited by the defendant to visit him at Ayer for a New Year\u2019s eve party. They accepted. The plaintiff retired early, his wife remaining downstairs in the defendant\u2019s spa. Awakening at twelve midnight the plaintiff went downstairs and found his wife in the spa seated at a counter. She declined to go to bed and the plaintiff once more retired. He awoke at about 3 a.m., went downstairs, and saw his wife in the kitchen. She was leaning against the wall, and the defendant was leaning against her \u201cso close in an amorous way with his back towards the plaintiff.\u201d Seeing the plaintiff, his wife pushed the defendant away and the latter left the room. The plaintiff rebuked his wife. The plaintiff, his wife and the defendant returned to Cambridge the next day. The following day the plaintiff told his wife that he was going to New York. His wife packed his valise and he left the house at about 9 a.m. He \u201chung around in the vicinity.\u201d About 1 p.m. his wife came out of the house, walked along and made a phone call, and after a time the defendant approached and embraced her in the \u201cpublic\u201d street, and they walked away and as they proceeded the defendant had his arm around the waist of the plaintiff\u2019s wife. The plaintiff followed them for a while but finally lost sight of them. His wife did not come home that afternoon or work that night. (Her working hours were from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) She did not return the next morning, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>late in the afternoon he saw her in the defendant\u2019s automobile, in which they drove to an eating place. Entering, the plaintiff confronted them, called his wife a \u201cfilthy . . and accused her of being unfaithful, upbraided the defendant and threw a butter knife at him, challenging him. The plaintiff\u2019s wife said, \u201cYou have a right to call me what you called me, I have done wrong.\u201d The defendant said, \u201cLet us keep this thing quiet and I promise . . . [that] I will never, never, never see your wife again,\u201d There was evidence that in the meantime the plaintiff\u2019s wife and the defendant had been seen in the defendant\u2019s automobile \u201chugging one another,\u201d and that on another occasion, at about 9:30 p.m., they were making love in front of a building on one of the streets of Lowell. In February the plaintiff and his wife started for Florida to visit a relative of his wife. On the journey he noticed that she was wearing a diamond ring that he had not seen before. While in Florida he overheard his wife\u2019s relative asking his wife where she got that beautiful ring, and heard his wife say, \u201cthat is nothing, that is our engagement ring,\u201d and that \u201cBill Katralis, the defendant, gave [it] to her,\u201d and also heard her say \u201cbut wait until you see the one we have already picked out. It is a beautiful big diamond, at-\u2019s in Boston, when we get married.\u201d At the end of two weeks the plaintiff asked his wife to go to Colorado with him, and she refused saying that she had work to do, had other plans. He went to Colorado alone, returned to Massachusetts, and confronted the defendant, saying \u201cWhere is my wife? I want my wife.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s wife never returned but filed a libel for divorce in Florida against him on the ground of cruelty. The plaintiff did not contest the libel. He had failed to win back her affections and did not have the money \u201cto go to Florida.\u201d His \u201chouse, furniture, and store were all broken up and he has been broken up in health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">It is the contention of the defendant that the .evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in finding for the plaintiff, asserting that the plaintiff had the burden of proving infidelity on the part of his wife in which the defendant was a participant, and that the plaintiff had failed to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that burden. This contention cannot be sustained. The evidence would Warrant the jury in finding that the defendant had been a rival for the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Benbow, </em>211 Mass. 366, 368, and that the defendant by his conduct had induced her to deprive her husband of her consortium. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to allege or prove sexual intercourse between -his wife and the defendant. It was sufficient to prove that the defendant improperly \"persuaded and enticed . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] wife to leave his home: At common law such invasion of his rights has long been actionable.\u201d <em>Gahagan </em>v. <em>Church, </em>239 Mass. <em>558, 559, </em>and cases cited. The evidence of suspicious and familiar conduct on the part of the defendant toward the plaintiff\u2019s wife had a bearing on the mental attitude of the defendant and had weight \"even if it tended to show adultery. If believed, it had a tendency to throw some light upon the methods of enticement used by the defendant, and also upon . . . [his] motives. And this is so even if adultery is-not set out in the declaration.\u201d <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Benbow, </em>211 Mass. 366, 368. <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>254 Mass. 509, 511-512.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\">The- evidence in the case at bar amply warranted its submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
