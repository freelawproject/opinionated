At the time of his alleged injury he and one Moloney were unloading bags of bicarbonate of soda or other chemical from a hand truck. Each bag weighed one hundred pounds. The two men, one at each end of a bag, would swing the bag up to its place on the pile. The employee and Moloney stooped down and had lifted a bag to swing it up onto the pile and had raised it&gt; about three feet when the employee felt a pain \u201call across his stomach\u201d such as he had never felt before, and was nauseated. He was taken to a hospital where he was operated \u00fcpon the same day. He was found to have a ruptured spleen.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">Medical testimony was in agreement that the spleen was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>diseased, but was contradictory as to whether the strain of lifting the bag was a contributing cause of the rupture. Whether the strain could or did contribute to the rupture was a proper subject for medical opinion. The board found that \"the incident of lifting and swinging the hundred pound bag onto the pile was the exciting cause and aggravated a pre-existing condition, namely, a diseased spleen, to the point of causing it to rupture, resulting in the condition which disabled the employee,\u201d and that this was an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The findings were warranted. The case presents no peculiar legal problem. It is similar to a number of cases where it has been held that an occupational strain has operated upon a previously diseased organ in such a manner as to bring about at an ascertained time a lesion which constituted a compensable injury. <em>Donlan\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 291, and cases cited at page 294. The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 516, where there was no particular occasion upon which the employee\u2019s work operated to produce injury to the weakened organ, and from <em>Herlihy\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 232, where the claimant\u2019s evidence failed to convince the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Any discrepancies between the evidence and the subsidiary findings or between the subsidiary findings and the conclusion of the board are trifling and inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">. There was no error in accepting the qualifications of the medical witnesses, or in admitting the questions asked of one of them involving his opinion as an expert, or in the single member of the board who heard the case asking a leading question of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The Superior Court rightly awarded costs. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1939, c. 213, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In addition to the award in the decree there shall be entered in this court an order allowing the claimant the sum of $75 for attorney\u2019s fees, briefs, and expenses in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
