L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 39, to compel the respondent to authorize the employment of the petitioner as schoolhouse custodian in Boston and the payment of his salary. The Superior Court \u201cdenied\u201d the petition. This seems to have been intended as a final judgment dismissing the petition, and we so construe it. The petitioner appeals. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 1D, as inserted by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">It is provided by St. 1906, c. 318, \u00a7 1, as last amended by St. 1932, c. 231, \u00a7 1, that, in addition to certain other officers specifically mentioned, the school committee of Boston \u201cmay also elect and remove such other subordinate officers not specifically provided for by law as they may deem expedient.\u201d The committee by rules now incorporated in \u201cRules and Regulations of the Public Schools, 1935 \u201d has provided for a schoolhouse custodian (Rules, c. 1, \u00a7 2), who, \u201cwhen duly elected by the school committee, shall have tenure of office during good behavior and effi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ciency\u201d (\u00a74). He is \u201cthe executive officer of the school committee in all matters relating to the care ,and custody of land and buildings used for school purposes, and the administration building\u201d (c. 7, \u00a7 125). He has power, subject to the approval of the school committee, to appoint, transfer and remove custodians and may make temporary appointments when necessary, without applying to the school committee (\u00a7 127). He may suspend any custodian and then report the action to the school committee (\u00a7 128).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">. The civil service rules made under the authority of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 3, as amended, provide in Rule 4 for a \u201cClass 1\u201d consisting of superintendents, including deputies and executive officers, with some exceptions not here material, and for a \u201cClass 24,\u201d consisting of janitors, custodians, and persons employed in the care of schools, or other public buildings. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 15, as amended, provides that, with some exceptions not here material, no person shall be appointed or promoted to any position in the classified civil service, except upon requisition and certification from an eligible list. On May 3, 1944, the school committee purported to elect the petitioner to the position of schoolhouse custodian without requisition and certification. The respondent caused his salary to be stopped. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 38. The question to be decided is whether the position is one within the classified service.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">It is plain that the position is an \u201cappointive\u201d position in the government of a city of the Commonwealth and. is therefore the kind of position which the civil service commission had power to classify. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 3, as amended. The position is none the less \u201cappointive\u201d within the meaning of this section because the appointment takes the form of an election by a board like the school committee. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Trehy, </em>178 Mass. 186. The position, has been classified, either in \u201cClass 1\u201d or in.\u201cClass 24\u201d; it is immaterial which. And it has been-, so-classified, whether it is properly described as an office or-is merely an employment. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 3, as amended; \u00a7 5, as amended; \u00a7 43; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Russell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>166 Mass. 14, 15; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. 539, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">The petitioner seems to rely mainly upon the contention that the schoolhouse custodian is the head of a principal department of the city and is therefore exempted by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 5, as amended, from being classified in the civil service. But it is too plain for prolonged discussion that this position, owing its existence and continuance solely to the school committee, is not itself a principal department of the city of Boston. It is merely a subordinate position in the school department. And certainly one occupying this position cannot claim to be the head of the school department. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Trehy, </em>178 Mass. 186, 194-195. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>195 Mass. 35, 39. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Andrew, </em>206 Mass. 46. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil Service, </em>259 Mass. 447. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>264 Mass. 158, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The school committee attempted to appoint the petitioner to a classified position without obeying the civil service law. The petition was rightly dismissed. <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>315 Mass. 689, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
