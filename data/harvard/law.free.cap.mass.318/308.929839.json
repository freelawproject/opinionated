The employee worked in a hat factory. He was accustomed to come to work in an automobile of a fellow employee which would be parked in a \"parking lot\u201d owned and \u201cfurnished\u201d by the employer where the employer permitted its employees to park. At the time of the injury the automobile was parked as usual in the \"parking lot.\u201d The employee left it to go to. work, and while still on the lot and \u201cgoing down an incline.\u201d he lull and broke an ankle. \"It was no part of the duty of the employee to use an automobile to reach his work.\u201d The furnishing of the \u201cparking lot\u201d was \"no part of the contract of employment.\u201d Although the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>did not expressly find that this lot was opposite the employer\u2019s factory, the uncontradicted evidence both of the employee and of the insurer was to that effect, and that fact seems to have been assumed. It was necessary, however, to walk a short distance down the street to the plant entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">These facts require as matter of law a decree for the employee. Although the employee was not obliged to come-to work in an automobile and the employer was not obliged by contract to furnish the \u201cparking lot,\u201d yet it is plain that it did, furnish the lot as an incident of the employment, and that the employee, while actually on his employer\u2019s premises and on his way to the place where his day\u2019s work was to be performed by a route which he was permitted and expected to take, fell and was injured. It is of no consequence that a street intervened between the part of the employer\u2019s premises where the employee fell and the part where he was to work. The \u201cparking lot\u201d was used as an adjunct to the factory. The case stands just as it would if the automobile had been parked on the same lot on which the factory building stood and the employee had fallen while walking from the automobile to the factory door. The injury arose out of and in the course of the employment. <em>Latter\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 326. <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593, 595. <em>Mannering\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 517. <em>Sylvia\u2019s Case, </em>298 Mass. 27. <em>Nagle\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 193, 197. <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335, and cases cited. And in the very recent case of <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, 635, it was held that the defendant, who, preparatory to going to work, was parking his automobile on a parldng lot owned and maintained by his employer adjacent to its foundry, was within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The board relied upon <em>Savage\u2019s Case, </em>257 Mass. 30. In that case it would seem that the permission to the employee to put his automobile in the former coal bin could be found to have been wholly a personal favor to him and not an incident in the carrying on of the employer\u2019s business. At any rate, we prefer to continue in the direction pointed out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>by the cases hereinbefore cited, nearly all of which were decided more recently than <em>Savage\u2019s </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">The decree is reversed, and a decree is to be entered in favor of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
