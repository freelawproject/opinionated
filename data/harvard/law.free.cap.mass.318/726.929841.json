L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 23, was one filed before the entry of the final decree instead of \u201cwithin four days after . . . [a party entitled to appeal] has been notified of the entry of the decree,\u201d made a motion on May 4, 1945, that the judge make another \u201creport of material facts\u201d prepared by the defendants which added more than two thousand words to the \u201cfinding of material facts\u201d already filed. To the refusal of the judge to adopt and report the \u201creport of material facts\u201d prepared by the defendants, they claimed an exception, which they present to us upon a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">It is true that when a judge refuses, after timely request under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 23, to \u201creport the material facts found by him,\u201d his refusal to perform his statutory duty may sometimes be such an error of law <em>(Porter </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>236 Mass. 422, 425; <em>Bartley </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>317 Mass. 35, 43) as to give ground for an exception under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 113, 144. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Boston Blank Book Manuf. Co. </em>153 Mass. 456. <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>306 Mass. 387, 388, 389. But the material facts that a judge in an equity case may be required to report are facts that the judge acting in good faith thinks material to the decree entered by him and that form the basis for it, and not facts material merely to the case in some aspect of it. This is fully explained in our decisions. <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Houghton &amp; Dutton Co. </em>277 Mass. 209, 214, 215. <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Pamoukis, </em>301 Mass. 559. <em>Sidlow </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>310 Mass. 395, 397. <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>310 Mass. 597, 599. <em>Distasio </em>v. <em>Surrette Storage Battery Co. </em>316 Mass. 133, 135. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Morson, </em>316 Mass. 678, 680, 681. <em>Carilli Construction Co. </em>v. <em>John Basile &amp; Co.

The appellant must accept the report that the judge makes, and argue his appeal upon that report together with the rest of the technical record, which does not include the evidence unless the appellant has taken the precaution of seasonably requiring, and. thereby making part of the record, a report of the evidence under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 24, or c. 215, \u00a7 12. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>293 Mass. 327. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>298 Mass. 346, 349. <em>Sidlow </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>310 Mass. 395, 398. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Newburyport Five Cents Savings Bank, </em>311 Mass. 377, 381, 382. <em>Matter of Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 191, 196, note. <em>Counelis </em>v. <em>Counelis, </em>315 Mass. 694, 696. The exception taken by the defendants is founded upon a misunderstanding of our settled equity practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On its merits the case is simple. The defendant Paraskis obtained judgment and execution against the plaintiffs for about $5,000 in an action upon a note. The plaintiffs paid $506.30, besides expenses, to redeem their real estate from a sale on execution which reduced to that extent the amount due on the execution. <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Othon, </em>313 Mass. 115. But instead of crediting the amount paid in reduction of his claim, Paraskis brought suit for his whole judgment against one Poleway, who had become surety for the plaintiffs upion a bond to dissolve an attachment in the action in which the judgment was obtained, and recovered judgment against Poleway for the full amount, approximately $5,000. The plaintiffs then paid that judgment in full. Although Paraskis was thus overpaid to the extent of $506.30, he did not surrender his execution against the plaintiffs or return it satisfied, but obtained an alias execution which he transferred to the defendant Othon, who knew all the facts but refused to surrender the alias execution or to return it satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Obviously the facts stated in the bill and those found by the judge supported his final decree ordering the return of the execution satisfied and the repayment of the $506.30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>with interest and costs. The extensive litigation of which the defendants complain was caused by their own unconscionable attempt to compel the plaintiffs to pay twice. The exception and appeal are frivolous. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 211, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"A_J\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\n<em>Interlocutory decree overruling demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with double costs and interest at the rate of twelve per cent a year.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
