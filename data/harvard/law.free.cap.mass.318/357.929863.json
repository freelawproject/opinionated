His father, George M. Webb, claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>compensation as a dependent. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 32 (e). The single member found that the injury and death arose out of and in the course of the employment. The reviewing board reversed the decision of the single member, and denied the claim for compensation. The claimant appealed from a decree of the Superior Court reciting that \u201cthe findings and decision of the reviewing board be and hereby are affirmed.\u201d The decree is erroneous in form. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 493-494. <em>Di Giovanni\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 241, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The decision of the reviewing board superseded that of the single member. <em>Ricci\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 67, 68, and cases cited. It must be accepted as final if supported by evidence and not tainted by error of law. <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 75, 76. <em>Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 719, 722. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 734. The reviewing board\u2019s conclusion was amply warranted by the evidence and disclosed no error of law. The deceased was a messenger for the insured whose branch office was a front room on the third floor of a building at 184 Boylston Street, Boston. It was his first day of work. He did some errands in the morning, but was given no duties in the afternoon, merely being around the office under the supervision of the office manager. About 4 p.m. he was missed, and was soon found fatally injured on the sidewalk. The \u201cemployee left the office in the front of the building where he was employed, passed through a fire escape exit onto the fire escape in the rear of the building, descended to the second floor level, then ascended the fire escape to the roof and crossed the latter to the front of the building facing on Boylston Street, and from that point in some manner fell to his death on the sidewalk below.\u201d The reviewing board found that \u201cthe use of the fire escape and the roof by the employee were not incidents or hazards contemplated by his employment as a messenger coy.\u201d See <em>Horton\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 572; <em>Wozniak\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 471. The evidence, which included a conversation between the employee\u2019s motherland a representative of the insured, in which the mother stated that her son had never been in Boston alone and knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>nothing about the city, and the representative replied that he would have someone \u201csteer\u201d the boy around for a while and that he would be all right, did not require different findings or conclusion by the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The decree is modified by striking out the affirmance of the findings and decision of the reviewing board and-by dismissing the claim, and as so modified it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
