See <em>Howell </em>v. <em>First of Boston International Corp. </em>309 Mass. 194, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">The First Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The auditor found that \u201cupon all the evidence . . . every allegation of fact contained in the bank\u2019s declaration is borne out by the evidence.\u201d This places upon us the burden of searching through the declaration, and segregating the allegations of fact. For many years one Ivan O. Small was vice-president of the bank, and in connection with his duties from time to time received from its customers securities for \u201cholding, exchanging or selling . . . and reinvesting the proceeds for the benefit of said customers.\u201d Two such customers were Mrs. Katherine L. Welch and Miss Mary E. Lennon, who, on various dates between September 12, 1933, and June 6, 1934, delivered to Small \u201cas representative\u201d of the bank certain bonds \u201cfor the purpose of exchange or sale and reinvestment.\u201d Without the authority or knowledge of the bank or of these customers, as Paine Webber \u201cthrough their agents well knew,\u201d Small pledged the bonds with Paine Webber as collateral security for a margin account he opened. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>From time to time beginning in September, 1933, Paine Webber, upon the orders of Small, sold certain bonds, and out of the proceeds bought for Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon other bonds, some of which were respectively given to them and some of which were sold for reinvestment. In July, 1934, Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon discovered that their bonds- had been pledged, and demanded them and their respective balances of uninvested proceeds from Paine Webber, who complied as to the bonds still in their possession, but refused to pas'- the balances. Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon then demanded the amounts of the balances from the bank, which thereupon paid them. As conclusions of law, it is alleged that Paine Webber was liable to Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon for money had and received to th\u00e9ir use, \u201cthe right to receive which . . . passed\u201d to the bank, and that the bank, \u201cby reason of said payment, succeeded to all the rights\u201d of Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon against Paine Webber. The allegations of law we may disregard as surplusage. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>137 Mass. 119, 121. <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>299 Mass. 1, 4. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Brockton, </em>308 Mass. 34, 37.

The only question open is whether the plaintiff can recover in any form of action. <em>G. E. Lothrop Theatres Co. </em>v. <em>Edison Electric Illuminating Co. </em>290 Mass. 189, 191.

Gardetto, Inc. </em>306 Mass. 212, 220-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">The auditor\u2019s original report contained further findings. Small was \u201cexecutive\u201d vice-president of the bank, in charge of its management and carrying out policies under the direction of the president, John Sawyer, and had practically exclusive control of buying and selling securities for the bank\u2019s customers. In 1933, Small embarked upon \u201ca scheme of fraud and deception,\u201d to make which effective it was necessary to keep the transactions secret from the bank officials, and at the same time preserve a feeling by customers that Small was in fact acting as vice-president <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and as the bank\u2019s authorized agent. Accordingly, he \u201cabandoned\u201d an account with Paine Webber which re-' quired no collateral, and on August 21, 1933, opened the margin account with Paine Webber. The account was first entitled \u201cIvan 0. Small C/o Union Old Lowell National Bank, Lowell, Massachusetts.\u201d Later the words \u201cCustomers\u2019 A/C\u201d were added after \u201cIvan 0. Small.\u201d Still later, on April 3, 1934, Small sent to one Gately, an employee of Paine Webber in charge of the margin department, the following letter: \u201cDear Sir: The account standing in the name of Ivan 0. Small \u2018Customers Account\u2019 on Paine Webber &amp; Co. books is simply a clearing account for securities bought and sold for my customers. Yours very truly, Ivan 0. Small.\u201d This was sent because of an inquiry made of Small \u201cevidently by Gately\u201d following a discussion bjr two partners of Paine Webber arising out of a question asked by their auditor. \u201cIt is perfectly apparent from an examination of the account itself, even prior to the writing of the letter of April 3, 1934, that the account . . . was, in fact, a margin account, that Small was using the securities entrusted to him by the customers of the bank for his own purposes and to his own ends and that this situation was known to responsible employees of Paine, Webber &amp; Co.\u201d One Holdsworth, a salesman of Paine Webber, was introduced at the bank by Small to Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon as \u201ca very able representative of Paine Webber\u201d who would work with Small to try to increase the value of their securities and their income. In reliance thereon Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon \u201centrusted to Small as vice-president of the bank, as Holdsworth well knew, their securities for purposes of investment. Holds-worth at all times knew what Small was engaged in doing and assisted in the concealment of the affairs and manipulations of Small from the bank. . . . Small\u2019s position as vice-president of the bank was known to Paine, Webber <em>&amp; </em>Co. He was regarded by Holdsworth as \u2018the king who could do no wrong.\u2019 As executive vice-president Small was possessed of wide powers.\u201d The securities purchased in the account were uniformly inferior, and \u201csounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>definite and continued warnings to Paine, Webber &amp; Co. that Small was engaged in speculation.\u201d Paine Webber allowed Small to make withdrawals both by check and in cash. In January, 1934, the mailing address of statements of the account was changed from Small in care of the bank to Small\u2019s private post office box in Chelmsford. After July, 1934, when Small went to Arizona and the bank notified Paine Webber that Small had resigned as vice-president, the statements were held in the office of Paine Webber under direction of Holdsworth. There was no \u201crevelation\u201d to the bank of the existence of the account by Paine Webber until October, 1934, and \u201cthe bank was kept by Paine, Webber &amp; Co. from information\u201d concerning the account until that date. The \u201cconcealment by Small of' his scheme from the bank itself and from the customers of the bank was made possible to a large and devastating extent by Paine, Webber &amp; Co. . . . The bank might well have known, had Paine, Webber &amp; Co. not actively assisted Small in keeping his scheme secret.\u201d Small\u2019s \u201cfraud is not attributable to the bank nor am I able to find any facts upon which to predicate a finding that the bank had ... or should have had sufficient knowledge to have justified suspicion of these frauds. . . . It is clear that the account was conducted in such a way by Paine, Webber &amp; Co. that its existence would not be known by the bank. . . . [Complete] and ever-present knowledge of Small\u2019s scheme was known to two parties: 1, Small and 2, Paine, Webber &amp; Co. Both parties concealed their knowledge from the bank.\u201d The auditor then made findings relative to bonds of one Cover, which will be recited later, and stated: \u201cI find that Paine, Webber &amp; Co. intended to deal with Ivan O. Small in all of its transactions, including the Cover transaction, personally and that, therefore, the culpable and inexcusable negligence which Paine, Webber &amp; Co. attributes to the bank is, in fact, its own culpable and inexcusable negligence; that in no way did the bank mislead Paine, Webber <em>&amp; </em>Co.; that, to the contrary, Paine, Webber &amp; Co. misled the bank and the customers of the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Still further findings are contained in the auditor\u2019s third supplemental report. The bank had no knowledge that there was an Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account or that Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon were beneficiaries of it. Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon frequently talked with Small \u201cas an officer of the bank\u201d in connection with investments and reinvestments. They dealt only with Small, and never told the president about their dealings with Small. When at the bank talking with Small they were within sight of other officers of the bank. The securities handed to Small by Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon were receipted for by Small or by one Cooper, an assistant cashier. Some receipts were in the handwriting of a Miss Allen, a stenographer, and were signed by Cooper, who was called over to Small\u2019s desk by Small. The cashier of the bank, one Bourgeois, did not know that there was an Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account at Paine Webber\u2019s or that Small was doing business with Paine Webber. Bourgeois knew that Small was advising Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon as to the purchase and sale of securities, but did not know that Small was doing so through Paine Webber. The first intimation that Bourgeois had that anything was wrong with any account or matter at the bank handled by Small was around Easter, 1934, with respect to the Cover collateral hereinafter referred to. Mail arriving at the bank was left with the head stenographer for sorting and distribution, and letters addressed to an officer individually were not opened. Small exercised his authority as executive vice-president to conceal the true nature of his dealings, and Paine Webber assisted Small throughout. It was known to Holdsworth that subordinates of the bank would obey Small\u2019s instructions. In the exercise of his authority as executive vice-president Small caused unauthorized withdrawals to be made of customers\u2019 funds and subsequently deposited these funds to his own account. During 1933 and 1934 without questioning Small\u2019s authority \u201cthe bank tellers cashed various checks\u201d upon the authorization and approval of Small. \u201cI find further that, in so far as it is a fact, the knowledge of any teller or suspicion of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>teller that Small was guilty of any misconduct was not revealed to any officer of the bank.\u201d Certain checks sent to the Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account in care of the bank were deposited in the accounts of Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon. \u201cSmall caused such deposits to be made. In so far as it is a fact, I find that such deposits did not give notice to the bank of what Small was doing with securities of Miss Lennon or Mrs. Welch. During the time of the existence of the Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account, Small, without authority, withdrew funds from the account of one Cobban, a depositor of the bank, and put these funds in his own account. Small also forged the signature on some checks and cashed them. I find that he was able to do these things because of his position as executive vice-president, and that the knowledge of any teller, if in fact there was such knowledge of Small\u2019s misconduct, was not revealed to any officer of the bank. In so far as it is a fact, I find that the bank had no knowledge of the above misdeeds and had no reasonable cause to know that Small was defrauding Miss Lennon or Mrs. Welch. Upon these facts and upon all the evidence considered by me, I find no culpable and inexcusable negligence on the part of the bank, either as regards Paine Webber &amp; Co., or as regards Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon.\u201d The last finding had to do with an issue of subrogation (see <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>299 Mass. 158, 161), which, as hereinafter appears, we find it unnecessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">The facts as to the Cover transaction appear in the original auditor\u2019s report and in the third supplemental report. In 1931 Cover, a bank customer, deposited with the bank various securities, including $10,000 Cities Service bonds, as collateral to secure a loan. On July 19, 1933, Small took the Cities Service bonds from Cover\u2019s \u201cportfolio,\u201d but in October, 1933, replaced them by the purchase of similar bonds. \u201cAround Easter,\u201d 1934, Cover discovered that still other bonds were missing, and complained to Sawyer, the president, that Small had taken the bonds. Sawyer immediately spoke to Small. Later Cover arranged with Small to replace the collateral, and informed Sawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that the matter had been satisfactorily adjusted and was settled. \u201cI find that Cover himself informed Sawyer, the president of the bank, that the matter had been completely straightened out to the satisfaction of Cover, that the president had' lost no time in seeking to ascertain what the situation between Coyer and Small was- and that the president\u2019s conduct was reasonable following the assertion to him by Cover that the matter had been satisfactorily adjusted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">Paine Webber contends that the subsidiary findings of the auditor \u201cwarrant and require a finding contrary to his findings in regard to plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and to his general conclusion.\u201d These questions are open on the face of the report even if no objection has been brought in. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>English Construction Co. </em>303 Mass. 105, 111-112. But, in making the contention, Paine Webber indiscriminately rely, as though it were on an equality with the findings of the auditor, upon an \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d contained in the summary of evidence appended to the third supplemental report. The \u201cagreed statement of facts,\u201d however, was merely an agreement as to evidence \u201cin place of ordinary proof.\u201d <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 432. It was identical in character with the other evidence contained in any summary of evidence whether appended under Rules 89 and 90 of the Superior Court (1932) or, as here, pursuant to an order of court which, while unusual, is nevertheless permitted under Rule 86 of the Superior Court (1932). The summary in the case at bar is to be used for the purpose of enabling the court to determine whether the evidence was sufficient in law to warrant the findings to which the summary relates. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>296 Mass. 479, 483; <em>Meehan </em>v. <em>North Adams Savings Bank, </em>302 Mass. 357, 362. The case was recommitted to the auditor (1) to \u201cmake further findings with respect to the subsidiary facts upon the issue whether the plaintiff knew or had reasonable cause to know what Small was doing with the securities of Miss Lennon and Mrs. Welch, and how these facts bear upon whether it knew or had reasonable cause to know that Small was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>defrauding them\u201d; (2) to \u201cdetermine whether the facts so found constituted, when taken in relation to all other pertinent facts considered by him, culpable and inexcusable negligence on the part of the plaintiff either as regards the defendants or as regards Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon\u201d; and (3) to \u201cappend to his report a brief, accurate and fair summary of so much of the evidence as relates to the above issues.\u201d In the view that we take of the case it is unnecessary to analyze the contention that the summarized evidence does not warrant the findings on the enumerated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">The case has been argued on the footing of subrogation and contribution among tortfeasors. Upon our view of the subsidiary findings it is unnecessary to consider those questions. Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon delivered bonds to Small as vice-president of the bank \u201cfor the purpose of exchange or sale and reinvestment,\u201d and obtained receipts signed by Small and another employee of the bank. The transactions were contracts of bailment between the owners of the bonds and the bank for the stated purposes. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>111 Mass. 373. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>294 Mass. 236, 242. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank, </em>227 Ky. 179. <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>O'Carroll, </em>162 Md. 431. <em>Cadwell </em>v. <em>Peninsular State Bank, </em>195 Mich. 407.

Thereafter, Small, pursuing an independent fraudulent course, known to Paine Webber through their employees, wrongfully pledged the bonds on a speculative margin account of his own. The knowledge of Small is not to be imputed to the bank. <em>Shepard &amp; Morse Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>171 Mass. 516, 531. <em>Broadway National Bank </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>220 Mass. 247, 249-250. <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>246 Mass. 197, 207. <em>J. C. Penney Co. </em>v. <em>Schulte Real Estate Co. Inc. </em>292 Mass. 42, 45. The bank was not a guarantor of the integrity of its vice-president, as is contended, so as to avoid the operation of this rule. Nor is there any finding of benefit to the bank from the wrongful use by Small of the bonds. On the other hand, Paine Webber was bound by the knowledge of its employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>acquired while acting in the scope of their employment. <em>Suit </em>v. <em>Woodhall, </em>113 Mass. 391, 395. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>274 Mass. 407, 415.

Co. </em>222 Mass. 159, 162. <em>Marcotte </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Security Corp. </em>250 Mass. 246, 249. They could have been treated as conversions on the part of the pledgee. <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>213 Mass. 309, 312. <em>Childs, Jeffries &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>283 Mass. 283, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">On the findings, Paine Webber cooperated in the wrongful acts of Small and thus became hable to the bank for the loss sustained. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>150 Mass. 461, 465. <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>Alvord, </em>177 Mass. 466, 470. <em>Seeley </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>74 Fed.

Such liability could be for the retained proceeds of bonds which had been the subject of the relation between the bank and Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>214 Mass. 134, 154. <em>United Zinc Co. </em>v. <em>Harwood, </em>216 Mass. 474, 476. Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Agency, \u00a7 314. These are the amounts for which there were findings on the counts in contract, on which the order for judgment was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The conclusions of the auditor which it is chiefly urged do not find support in the subsidiary findings, relate to the bank\u2019s lack of knowledge as to the existence of the Ivan O. Small customers\u2019 account, as to the sale of bonds of Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon through Paine Webber, and as to fraudulent acts of Small respecting other customers of the bank. It is not necessary to consider these questions in detail. There is no finding indicating knowledge on the part of the bank of any fraudulent conduct of Small toward Mrs. Welch and Miss Lennon. At the most, these contentions mean that the bank was negligent toward customers. There was no finding indicating negligence of the bank, toward Paine Webber. \u201cWhere there is no legal obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tian or duty to do an act, there can be no negligence in an omission to perform it.\u201d <em>Combs </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>12 Allen, 493, 497. But, in any event, it is well settled that carelessness in the charge of property does not bar the owner (in this case the bank with the rights of a bailee) from proceeding against a converter of the property. <em>Shepard &amp; Morse Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>171 Mass. 516, 528, 531. <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>213 Mass. 309, 312. <em>Somerville National Bank </em>v. <em>Hornblower, </em>293 Mass. 363, 369-370. <em>Row </em>v. <em>Home Savings Bank, </em>306 Mass. 522, 525. Paine Webber fail to bring themselves \u201cwithin the principle that a purchaser for value in good faith from one entrusted with the apparent title and absolute ownership of personal property is protected from the prior right of the true owner and pledgor because the pledgor is estopped from showing the true state of the title.\u201d <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>234 Mass. 568, 575. See <em>O\u2019Herron </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>168 Mass. 573, 577-578.</p>\n<p id=\"AG_\"><em>5</em>78<em>Order affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Second Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The action by Paine Webber against the bank is on an account annexed to recover for $10,000 Cities Service bonds which on October 13, 1933, were alleged to have been \u201cpurchased for and delivered to the defendant by the plaintiffs, for which the defendant promised to pay.\u201d The defence was that the bonds were purchased by Small individually. For some reason which does not appear, Small, without his theft of the Cities Service bonds on July 19, 1933, being discovered, set about to replace them. In his original report the auditor stated: \u201cI find that these securities were, in fact, ordered by Small and sold by Paine, Webber &amp; Co. to Small personally and that they were not authorized by the bank; that the sale was a bona fide sale from Paine, Webber &amp; Co. to Small in his personal capacity and that the bank in no way is responsible to Paine, Webber &amp; Co. because of Small\u2019s purchase of these securities.\u201d There was a general finding for the defendant. The auditor\u2019s third supplemental report shows the following. On October 13, 1933, Small ordered $10,000 Cities Service bonds bought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>in the Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account. The bonds were delivered upon directions from Small to the bank and were receipted for by one Hartford, \u201ccashier.\u201d The purchase by Small was at a time when Paine Webber knew that the Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account was a margin account. Paine Webber dealt with Small and with Small alone. Small caused the bonds to be placed in Cover\u2019s \u201cportfolio,\u201d and Paine Webber made no demands upon the bank for payment until November 28, 1934, \u201cwhen Small\u2019s misconduct had been exposed and Paine, Webber <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s involvements with him had been revealed.\u201d Small caused \u201csome bonds\u201d related to the Cover matter to be delivered to him at his address at Chelmsford. The bank itself did not order the Cities Service bonds. \u201cI find upon all evidence that Paine, Webber &amp; Co. knew or had reasonable cause to know that Small personally was purchasing these bonds on a frolic of his own, and that Paine, Webber <em>&amp; </em>Co. dealt with Small and not with the bank.\u201d This finding we construe as meaning that Paine Webber dealt with Small as an individual and not as an agent of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\">The auditor was ordered to append to his report a summary of the evidence \u201cupon the issue whether the defendant is liable for the purchase price of the Cities Service bonds or whether they were, as the plaintiffs knew or had reasonable cause to know, purchased by Small personally while 'on a frolic of his own.\u2019\u201d In the third supplemental report the auditor stated that a summary of the evidence \u201cinvolving the purchase of the . . . bonds\u201d was set forth in that report and in the original report. In other words, the summary was contained in the subsidiary findings. See <em>Morin </em>v. Clark, 296 Mass. 479, 482-483. This had the effect of engrafting upon the auditor\u2019s report a statement that the findings upon the \u201cissue\u201d mentioned in the court order (which in terms included the main issue to be decided) are based upon the subsidiary findings reported. See <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Anna Jaques Hospital, </em>301 Mass. 431, 435-436. But this does not affect our right and duty to draw our own inferences. See cases cited, <em>ante, </em>316.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The subsidiary facts show that Small, alone guarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>secret of purloining Cover\u2019s bonds, ordered similar bonds to be bought \u201cin the Ivan 0. Small customers\u2019 account.\u201d The bank had no actual knowledge of the theft, and, by the design of Small and Paine Webber, no actual knowledge of the account. It was Small\u2019s account, used for his own purposes, and at first was simply in his name and not even described as a customers\u2019 account. It may have stood this way on October 13, 1933. From it at unstated times he made withdrawals by check or in cash. It was also Small\u2019s theft, for in the felonious taking of the bonds he was not acting for the bank. <em>Indian Head National Bank </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>166 Mass. 27, 29. No attempt was made to charge the bank for over a year and not until after the exposure of Small. While not conclusive, this permits an inference that Small was the one to whom credit was knowingly and designedly given. <em>James </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>4 Gray, 451, 452. <em>Banfield </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>10 Allen, 27, 30-31. <em>Slotnick </em>v. <em>Silberstein, </em>221 Mass. 59, 60. This inference that Small, and not the bank, was the contracting party in the purchase is a compelling one. The auditor made it. We make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">The conclusion that Paine Webber dealt with Small as principal is decisive of the case. See <em>Essex County Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Pierce-Arrow Sales Co. </em>288 Mass. 270, 276; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>S. M. S. Co. </em>289 Mass. 302, 307. It is not at variance with other subsidiary facts. The delivery of the bonds to the bank on Small\u2019s direction and the receipt by Hartford do not require the conclusion that there was a sale on the credit of the bank nor transform the transaction into such a sale. The findings establish a completed transaction of purchase by Small on his own credit before any delivery to the bank by his direction. The finding that Small caused the bonds to be placed in Cover\u2019s \u201cportfolio\u201d we interpret to mean that Small restored them to the collateral on Cover\u2019s note to the bank, thus vesting legal title in Cover. From this Paine Webber contends that the bank is hable because it took and retained in its possession the bonds which Paine Webber delivered to it. The ultimate disposition of the bonds is undisclosed, although the bank undoubtedly had possession of them for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>whatever time they were collateral on the note. But this contention cannot elude the finding that it was Small who was the buyer. The bank\u2019s holding of the bonds as collateral was derived, not from the contract of purchase, but. from the subsequent act of Small, who, as owner once he had bought them, could do as he pleased with them. It is not a case of the bank having to take any bitter with the sweet, if,' indeed, it took any sweet. Compare <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>246 Mass. 197, 207. The bank, in the circumstances, is not to be held to a ratification as matter of law on the ground that it has taken benefits of the transaction of purchase subject to the knowledge of its vice-president. Cases like <em>Atlantic Cotton Mills </em>v. <em>Indian Orchard Mills, </em>147 Mass. 268, 274, and <em>Chapple </em>v. <em>Merchants National Bank, </em>284 Mass. 122, are not in point. In any event, the bonds were not procured by Small from Paine Webber through fraud, and in receiving them the most that could be charged to the bank is knowledge that they had been bought by Small on his own credit in order to replace other bonds he had taken from the Cover collateral. Nor was there ratification in fact, because, if for no other reason, the purchase was not made for, or in the name of, the bank as principal. <em>New England Dredging Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>149 Mass. 381, 382. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Liston Lumber Co. </em>281 Mass. 440, 446. <em>Wedgwood </em>v. <em>Eastern Commercial Travelers Accident Association, </em>308 Mass. 463, 468. This is sufficient to distinguish <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Rockwell, </em>104 Mass. 167, 172, <em>Sartwell </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>122 Mass. 184, and similar cases. There also was no full knowledge of all the material facts on the part of the bank. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Newburyport &amp; Amesbury Horse Railroad, </em>141 Mass. 496, 499. <em>Eastern Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Nut Co. Inc. </em>264 Mass. 238, 242. <em>American Agricultural Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>273 Mass. 66, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
