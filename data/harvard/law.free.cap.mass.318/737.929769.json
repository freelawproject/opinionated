She was incapacitated for two periods during her employment, and for a third period starting with the time she quit her employment. Physical injuries to the hands of an employee which are caused by using a poisonous substance in doing his work are compensable injuries. <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600. <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530. <em>Sylvia\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 313. An examination of the evidence supports the action of the reviewing board in finding that the' employee suffered an injury which arose out of and in the course of her employment, in determining the extent of incapacity and in fixing the amount of compensation. The findings as to these matters accordingly cannot be disturbed. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732. <em>Webb\u2019s Case, ante, </em>357. <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, ante, </em>635.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">The failure of the employee to give a written notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>her injury to the insurer or to the employer \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening thereof,\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 41, or to file a claim within six months after the occurrence of the injury, \u00a7 41, does not bar her from maintaining a proceeding for compensation if she proves that the insurer, the employer or agent had knowledge of the injury or that the insurer was not prejudiced by the want of notice, \u00a7 44, and that her failure to make claim seasonably was due to mistake or other reasonable cause or that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay in filing the claim, \u00a7 49. The board found that the gasoline caused the hands of the employee to get dry, her skin to crack and her hands to swell. She was compelled to leave her employment three times on account of the condition of her hands. She spoke to the foreman about the condition of her hands on several occasions, and also showed them to the first aid man of the employer, who advised her to bathe them in Epsom salts. This was the treatment recommended by her physician. The board could find that she received proper medical attendance and that the insurer was not impeded in the preparation and presentation of its defence of the case. Whether the insurer was prejudiced by the want of notice or by the late filing of the claim was a question of fact for the determination of the board. There was no error in finding that no prejudice resulted to the insurer. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481. <em>Gaffer\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465. <em>Duggan\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We need not determine the correctness of the finding that the employee had reasonable cause for the delay in making her claim because, having proved that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay, it was unnecessary to prove that she had reasonable cause for the delay. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 49. <em>Dorney\u2019s Case, </em>259 Mass. 350. <em>Tingus\u2019s Case, </em>273 Mass. 453. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465. <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Soon after the hearing began before the single member, the employee was allowed to amend her claim by substituting September, 1936, as the date of injury instead of April, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>1940. There was evidence that the employee left her employment in September, 1936, in May, 1937, and finally on April 26, 1940, because of her inability to continue on account of the condition of her hands. The question might well arise at the hearing before the single member whether she had sustained three distinct injuries or whether there was but one injury in September, 1936, and the subsequent incapacities on the later dates were nothing but manifestations of the original injury. <em>Sylvia\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 313. Compare <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600. Her claim from the beginning was that she had been incapacitated on account of the use of gasoline. In view of the finding as to lack of prejudice, there was no error in permitting her to show that her injury arose in September, 1936. See <em>Mercier\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 238, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The insurer has argued various rulings, most of them relating to evidence, made by the single member. If the insurer considered that any of these rulings on evidence were material, it should have raised them before the reviewing board and given the board an opportunity to correct them if found to be erroneous. See <em>Filosa\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 592, 595. The insurer cannot complain that the board took no action on the rulings when, so far as the record appears, the insurer did not bring them to the attention of the board. Exceptions to rulings made by a single member are not brought to the Superior Court or to this court unless shown to have been urged and saved before th\u00e9 board. <em>Minns\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 459. <em>Di Clavio\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 259. <em>Indrisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520. <em>Donlan\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The matter of the allowance for attorney\u2019s fees, briefs, and expenses in accordance with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, as inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, is dealt with in a separate order of the court. See <em>McSweeney\u2019s Case, ante, </em>620.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
