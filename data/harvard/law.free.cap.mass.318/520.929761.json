The department assumed to act under the authority of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 91, \u00a7 12, which authorizes it to license and to pre-' scribe the terms of construction of structures (pipe lines, \u00a7 1) in certain rivers, including the nontidal part of Merrimack River, and which declares unlicensed structures to be public nuisances. The city brought this petition in the Superior Court to quash the proceedings of the department which resulted in the granting of the license, and now appeals from a final judgment adverse to it in that court and from certain interlocutory orders made in the course of the pro-, ceedings. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as inserted by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">1. The Attorney General in' his brief in behalf of the respondents assumes that inasmuch as the department gave notice of the hearing before it to all the world, and as the city appeared and was the principal objector before the department and was so situated that it and its inhabitants might conceivably suffer damage from a pipe line for oil or its products in the river above it, the city had such interest in the matter as would entitle it to bring this petition. By St. 1872, c. 79, the city of Lawrence was authorized to take water from Merrimack River for the use of the city and its inhabitants. In view of the importance to any municipality of its public water supply and of the unfortunate consequences that might result if that supply should become polluted with oil or oil products containing lead through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>breaks or leaks in a pipe line, and in view of the responsibility of the city to its water users for the purity of its water <em>(Horton </em>v. <em>North Attleborough, </em>302 Mass. 137), we think that the city has an interest in the construction of the pipe line different in kind from that of members of the public in general, and that the city is therefore in a position to bring this petition. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City Council of Springfield, </em>116 Mass. 84, 87; <em>Natick Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>175 Mass. 246, 252; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>182 Mass. 351, 354; <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>183 Mass. 421; <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>189 Mass. 439, 440; <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>Deister, </em>253 Mass. 178; <em>American Can Co. </em>v. <em>Milk Control Board, </em>313 Mass. 156, 160-161, and cases cited. Compare <em>Davis </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Hampshire, </em>153 Mass. 218; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Mayor of Taunton, </em>253 Mass. 116, 118; <em>Dube </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>308 Mass. 12, 14-15. The interest of the city is so different from that of a mere private landowner that it is not necessary to decide whether every riparian proprietor below the proposed pipe line would also have standing as a petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">2. We are not impressed by the city\u2019s argument that the department of public works could not grant the license because of the control over sources of water supply conferred upon the department of public health by the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 111, particularly \u00a7 5 and \u00a7\u00a7 159 to 174A. We find nothing in c. 111 which affects the power to grant licenses expressly conferred upon the department of public works by c. 91, \u00a7 12, or which conflicts with the full exercise of that power. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>179 Mass. 385, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">3. But the city presses another point of more difficulty. It appears from admissions not disputed and evidently accepted by the trial judge as true that one of the respondents, former Associate Commissioner Whipple, had, on November 18, 1944, written to the Governor requesting him to accept his resignation as associate commissioner of public works \u201cto take effect not later than December 15\u201d (the date of the granting of the license), and that on November 27 the Governor had accepted the resignation \u201cas of December 15.\u201d We agree with the concession made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Attorney General at the argument that facts relating to the resignation of one of the commissioners would not commonly form part of the record of proceedings of the department relative to the granting of a license, and that such facts, not appearing in the return, may be shown outside of it. See <em>Marcus </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>252 Mass. 331; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 490; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>312 Mass. 121, 124-125. It therefore appears in this case that Associate Commissioner Whipple, whose vote and signature were necessary to the validity of the license (G. L. [Ter. Ed] c. 91, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 18), ceased to hold office on the very day on which he voted for and signed the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">The question on this part of the case is not one of measuring a period of time expressed in days. That matter has been the subject of many decisions. The question here concerns the relation to each other of two inconsistent acts or events, each taking place upon the same day, the time of neither of which is fixed any more definitely than by reference to that day. It is a further peculiarity of this case that the time of the resignation is incapable of being more definitely fixed by any further evidence of facts but depends entirely upon the legal consequences of the written resignation and acceptance already described. It is a matter of the legal construction of the documents and not a question of fact in the ordinary sense. Both sides invoke the common law rule that the law takes no account of fractions of a day. The petitioner contends that Whipple\u2019s resignation was effective through the whole of December 15. The respondents contend that he remained in office through the whole of that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">It is plain that Whipple\u2019s resignation by its terms and by the terms of its acceptance could not take effect at any moment of time which was later than the fifteenth. If it took effect earlier than the fifteenth, the license was invalid. But if, as we assume, it took effect on the fifteenth, it must have taken effect at some moment lying within the confines of that day, and the rule against splitting the day demands that no one moment of that day any more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>any other moment be singled out as the moment when it took effect. The last moment within the day cannot be chosen, since that would leave the resignation, which by hypothesis took effect on that day, ineffective during all but the last moment of the very day on which it took effect, thus splitting the day. The practical result, as applied to a case like the present one, seems to be that <em>\u201ca </em>thing done at any time in a day is taken the same as though it had been done in the first minute of the day.\u201d <em>Mathewson </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>21 R. I. 203, 204. <em>In re Lawson, </em>30 Del. 338, 342. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>59 Ore. 378, 386. See <em>Miniard </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>206 Ky. 125, 126. This accords with the common law rule that an infant becomes of age \u201cat the earliest minute\u201d of the day preceding the twenty-first anniversary of his birth. <em>Bardwell v. Purrington, </em>107 Mass. 419, 425. Williston on Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 224. Another way of putting .the matter in the case before us would be to say that at whatever moment on December fifteenth the license is deemed to have issued, Whipple\u2019s resignation, since the day is indivisible, must be deemed in effect at that moment. The view we take is not inconsistent with the decision in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>6 Gray, 316, since in that case the statute was not to take effect upon some designated future day, with no hour fixed, and so leaving the precise time to be ascertained by the application of a rule of law, but was to take effect immediately upon being signed by the Governor, a moment capable of ascertainment through proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">The only exactly similar case which we have seen, <em>Loughran </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Jersey City, </em>86 N. J. L. 442, holds that a resignation to take effect May 4, became effective at the stroke of midnight of May 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">4. In the discussion of the case in this court the suggestion has been made that Whipple might have been acting as an officer de facto during the day of December 15 even after his resignation took effect; that if he was an officer de facto the license was valid; and that the petitioner has not shown that he was not an officer de facto.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">No such contention as this was made by any party at the argument or in the briefs. There is nothing whatever in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the record before us to show that Whipple continued to act as a commissioner during the day of December 15, or that he purported to exercise any of the functions of his office for a single moment after his resignation took effect, except that he purported to take part in granting the license in question. Proof of the performance of the very act in question is not in itself even evidence that the one performing it was an officer de facto. <em>Short </em>v. <em>Symmes, </em>150 Mass. 298. If it were, any usurper could create evidence that he held . an office by purporting to perform some single act pertaining to that office. On the contrary it is almost, if not quite, universally held that a person cannot become an officer de facto without something approaching a general exercise of the functions of the office in such a way as to create an appearance of office holding and to involve some degree of recognition of the person by the public as the holder of the office. This requirement is fully accepted in our more recent cases and has been met in those instances in which it has been held that a person was an officer de facto. The cases are collected in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also <em>Waite </em>v. <em>Santa Cruz, </em>184 U. S. 302, 323 (quoting from <em>Petersilea </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Mass. 465, 468); Mechem on Public Officers, \u00a7\u00a7 315-321; Throop on Public Officers, \u00a7\u00a7 626-628; 46 C. J., Officers, \u00a7\u00a7 366, 368, and cases collected; -43 Am. Jur., Public Officers, \u00a7\u00a7 477, 478, and cases collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">There can be no- presumption that an officer who has just completed his resignation continues on as an officer de facto. Continuing to exercise the functions of the office even for a single day is in a broad sense inconsistent with the act of resigning. To hold without evidence that a former officer who purports to perform an official act shortly after he has ceased to hold office has performed that act as an officer de facto is to establish something in the nature of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>presumption at variance with the laws regulating office holding, likely to introduce conflict and confusion, and generally dangerous in its possible consequences. Reason and practical considerations of justice alike require that when in the trial of a cause the question arises whether a person who was not the holder of an office de jure was an officer de facto, at least the burden of going forward with evidence of that fact, if not indeed the true burden of proof itself, should rest upon the party asserting the fact. In general, offices are held de jure, and it is important that they should be so held. The holding of an office de facto even for a day, is an unusual and anomalous situation. Office holding de facto is a fiction of the law designed to serve a useful purpose, but the fiction does not abolish the law. A de facto \u201cofficer\u201d is not an officer, although his acts may have legal effect. A litigant ought commonly to be able to rely upon the statutes and the public records to determine who is a public officer. He should not be called upon to meet in advance a possible contention by his adverr sary that one not entitled to an office has acquired its powers by exercising them. See <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authority, </em>317 Mass. 297, 300-301. \"When the petitioner proved that Whipple was not in office on December 15 it went as far as it was required to go. A contention that, although not an officer, he was exercising the functions of the office as an officer de facto would require proof of new facts \u2014 the facts showing such exercise \u2014 to avoid the effect of the fact first proved and would be in the nature of confession and avoidance. If the respondents desired to make this contention (and it does not appear that they desired so to do), it was at least incumbent upon them to go forward with the necessary evidence, and it may well be that the actual burden of proof was upon them. The broad governing principle was concisely but fully explained by Chief Justice Shaw over a century ago in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Pick. 69, 76-77, and has been constantly followed ever since. A few of the many illustrative cases are <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>7 Cush. 213, <em>Crowninshield </em>v. <em>Crowninshield, 2 </em>Gray, 524, 531, <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>196 Mass. 492, 495, <em>Hughes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>v. <em>Williams, </em>229 Mass. 467, 470, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>232 Mass. 188, and <em>New </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>309 Mass. 17, 24. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>260 U. S. 592, 594. See also discussion in Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7.2485, 2486.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\">All cases which have come to our attention from other jurisdictions bearing upon the burden of proof as to a de facto officer, with one doubtful exception, tend to sustain the view herein expressed. <em>Sandlin </em>v. <em>Dowdell, </em>143 Ala. 518, 522. <em>Loughran </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Jersey City, </em>86 N. J. L. 442. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Long, </em>119 N. C. 52, 55-56. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>37 Ohio St. 72, 73. The possible exception is <em>Macey </em>v. <em>Stark, </em>116 Mo. 481, 504, but that case seems to rest upon the prima facie character of certain certificates under seal of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We cannot treat Whipple as an officer de facto in the absence of any proof that he was such. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">It follows from what has been said that the license is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">. One Hale, who signed the license and also the return in this cause as director of the division of waterways, does not appear to be a member of the department and should not have been joined as a party respondent. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Railroad Commissioners, </em>205 Mass. 94, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The appeals from interlocutory orders have become immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The interlocutory appeals are dismissed. The final judgment is reversed, and final judgment is to be entered dismissing the petition as to the respondent Hale and quashing the proceedings of the department of public works and the purported license issued by that department.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Field, C.J. I do not agree with the opinion. I think that the record does not show that the license was invalid and consequently I think that the license should not be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">The majority of the court reaches the conclusion that the license was invalid on the ground that it appears that Associate Commissioner Whipple\u2019s resignation of his office took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>effect before the license was granted so that he could not be counted as one of \"a majority of the commissioner and associate commissioners\u201d whose concurrence was necessary for the granting of the license. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 16, \u00a7 4. I do not agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\">The question whether Whipple\u2019s resignation of his office had taken effect before the license was granted on December 15, 1944, related to his title to the office on that day, that is, to the question whether on that day he was an officer de jure. But the validity of the license does not depend upon Whipple\u2019s having had legal title to the office at the time the license was granted. This \"is not a proceeding against him to test his title to the office, but one in which the rights of third persons and of the public, acquired by virtue of his official acts, are concerned, as to whom the official acts of a public officer de facto are as valid as if he held the office de jure.\u201d <em>Attorney General </em>v. Crocker, 138 Mass. 214, 217. As was said in the <em>Crocker </em>case, \"Public necessity and policy require that the acts of an actual incunibent of a public office, in the performance of its duties, shall be held valid, although the incumbent should not have a legal right to the office, and though his right should be questioned and disputed. . . . The public and parties, having rights depending upon official acts, are not so much concerned with the title to an office, as they are that the duties of the office shall be performed, and the rights depending upon their performance secured and protected; and, when they find an actual incumbent of an office performing its duties, they have a right to rely upon his acts as done by virtue of the office\u201d (pages 221-222). This doctrine of de facto officers has been given broad application in this Commonwealth. See <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bebee, </em>9 Mass. 231; <em>Petersilea </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Mass. 465; <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, </em>122 Mass. 445; <em>Moloney </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Milford, </em>253 Mass. 400, 406-407; <em>Sevigny </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>260 Mass. 296; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, </em>297 Mass. 347, 350-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The present case is not to be confused with cases where the title of an officer to his office is directly involved, such as an information in the nature of quo warranta to oust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>him from, the office (see G. L. [Ter. Ed] c. 249, \u00a7 12; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>128 Mass. 308, 311; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>225 Mass. 372, 376; <em>Brierley </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>299 Mass. 292, 294-295; compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>10 Mass. 290, with <em>Fowler v. Bebee, </em>9 Mass. 231, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>123 Mass. 525, with <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, </em>122 Mass. 445), an action for salary or fees (see <em>Phelon </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>140 Mass. 386, 389; <em>Short </em>v. <em>Symmes, </em>150 Mass. 298, 300), or an action of tort for interference with the person or property of another justifiable only because done by a public officer. See <em>Short </em>v. <em>Symmes, </em>150 Mass. 298, 299-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">If Whipple was at least a de facto officer when the license was granted it was valid. And in my opinion the burden of proving that he was not at least a de facto officer was on the petitioner and this burden has not been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Upon a petition for a writ of certiorari the return of the respondents is \u201cconclusive as to all matters of fact, within their jurisdiction, passed upon by them\u201d <em>(Tewksbury </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of Middlesex, </em>117 Mass. 563, 565-566; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>312 Mass. 121, 124), although it was open to the petitioner under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 1, \u201cto contend at the hearing upon the petition that the evidence which formed the basis of the action complained of or the basis of any specified finding or conclusion was as matter of law insufficient to warrant such action, finding or conclusion.\u201d However, a decision of respondents, express or implied, that they had jurisdiction would not necessarily be conclusive. A \u201cpetitioner may attack the jurisdiction of the inferior tribunal and may, if necessary, introduce evidence in support of his contention\u201d <em>(Marcus v. Street Commissioners of Boston, </em>252 Mass. 331, 333; <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, </em>312 Mass. 121, 124-125), but the burden rests upon the petitioner \u201cto prove by evidence outside the record, if necessary, that the respondents were without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Weymouth, </em>279 Mass. 486, 490. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>State Ballot Law Commission, 312 </em>Mass. 121, 125. The statutory requirement appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>cable to the present case that \u201cthe concurrence of at least a majority of the commissioner and associate commissioners shall be necessary in every official act of the department\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.J c. 16, \u00a7 4) is not merely procedural. It relates to the jurisdiction of the department. Consequently, unless such a majority participated in the act of granting the license here involved, the department was without jurisdiction to grant it. See <em>Sesnovich </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>313 Mass. 393, 398. Such a majority did not participate in the act of granting the license unless Whipple is to be regarded as so participating. The question whether he is to be regarded as so participating relates to the jurisdiction of the department to grant the license \u2014 a question depending upon whether he was at least a de facto officer when the license was granted. Consequently the question whether he was at least a de facto officer relates to the jurisdiction, of the department and is within the principle that the burden of proving \"that the respondents were without jurisdiction\u201d rests upon the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\">The issue whether Whipple was at least a de facto officer when the license was granted was a single issue, not a combination of the separate issues whether he was a de jure officer and whether he was a de facto officer, although facts bearing upon his standing- as a de jure officer or as a de facto officer may be material upon the single issue. But proof that Whipple was not a de jure officer does not warrant a finding by way of inference that he was not a de facto officer. Even if he was not a de jure officer, he may have been a de facto officer, and evidence or the established fact that he was not the former would be insufficient to establish that he was not the latter, on the ground that it was more probable that he was not. See <em>Sargent v. Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, 250. Such a conclusion, in the absence of anything more than appears in the record, would be mere conjecture. Proof that Whipple was not a de jure officer creates no presumption or prima facie case that he was not a de facto officer. Such proof does not split\" the burden of proof resting upon the petitioner of the single issue and shift to the respondents the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>going forward with evidence or of establishing that Whipple was a de facto officer. Such a shift of burden as to a part of the single issue cannot be justified on the ground that evidence as to whether Whipple was a de facto officer might be more readily available to the respondents than to the petitioner. And such a shift of burden is particularly inappropriate upon a petition for a writ of certiorari, which is not an adversary procedure in the ordinary sense but is a proceeding for the correction of errors in the proceedings of the respondents, upon their return to the petition or writ setting forth such proceedings, where the burden of showing lack of jurisdiction of the respondents of such proceedings, if not shown by the return, rests upon the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">In my opinion the burden of proof, resting upon the petitioner, that Whipple was not at least a de facto officer at the time the license was granted, has not been sustained. Although the facts shown by the record may be sufficient to establish the fact that Whipple was not a de jure officer, they are not, in my opinion, necessarily inconsistent with his having been a de facto officer and are insufficient, without more, to establish the fact that he was not at least a de facto officer. In considering hereinafter facts not shown by the record I do not intimate what, if any, of these facts, if shown, would establish that Whipple was not at least a de facto officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The record does not show that any successor to Whipple had been appointed. Indeed, the record perhaps may be interpreted as showing affirmatively that no successor to him had been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The facts that Whipple had resigned, that his resignation had been accepted, and that the resignation had taken effect before the license was granted, although showing that he had ceased to be an officer de jure, were not necessarily inconsistent with his being an officer de facto. It cannot, in my opinion, be ruled as matter of law that an officer whose resignation has taken effect cannot thereafter in any circumstances be an officer de facto. I know of no sound reason why the doctrine of de facto officers should not be applied to an officer whose resignation has taken effect but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>who has continued, without interruption, to be the \u201cactual incumbent\u201d of the office, in the sense in which those words were used in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>138 Mass. 214, 221, \u201cin the performance of its duties.\u201d And I think that this is true even if \u201ccolor of title\u201d is an essential characteristic of a de facto officer \u2014 as to which there is some doubt. See <em>Petersilea </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Mass. 465, 467-468.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">It is readily conceivable that Whipple was within the language of the <em>Petersilea </em>case applied in that case to an officer whose term for which he was appointed had expired. It was there said: \u201cHe who thus continues to hold his office erroneously but under a claim of right honestly and reasonably made has color of title from his original appointment or election\u201d (page 469). It is readily conceivable that under the language of Whipple\u2019s resignation \u201cto take effect not later than December 15,\u201d and the Governor\u2019s acceptance thereof \u201cas of December 15,\u201d Whipple continued to hold his office on December 15 \u201cunder a claim of right honestly and reasonably made.\u201d The time at which the resignation took effect is not wholly free from doubt although, for reasons stated in the opinion of the majority, I am led to the conclusion that it took effect before the license was granted. But it is not shown that Whipple did not continue to hold his office \u201cunder a claim of right honestly and reasonably made\u201d even if erroneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">And, to my mind, \u201ccolor of title\u201d in Whipple, if necessary to constitute him a de facto officer, may exist even if his resignation was such a fact \u201cas third persons and the public are, as a general rule, required to take notice of.\u201d See <em>Loughran </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Jersey City, </em>86 N. J. L. 442, 444. And even if it was such a fact, it would not necessarily prevent him from being a de facto, officer. To hold that the doctrine of de facto officers is inapplicable to cases where third parties and the public are, as a general rule, required to take notice of the termination of the de jure tenure of officers would impose a stricter limitation upon the doctrine of de facto officers than has been recognized by the decisions in this Commonwealth, and would prevent the application of the doctrine in cases within the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>.the doctrine in the interest of \u201cpublic necessity and policy.\u201d See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>138 Mass. 214, 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\">In <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case, </em>122 Mass. 445, a special justice of a police court, one Hawkes, continued to perform the duties of the office after he had been elected to the House of Representatives and had taken his seat, notwithstanding the provision of art. 8 of the Amendments to the Constitution that \u201cNo judge of any court of this commonwealth (except the court of sessions) . . . shall, at the same time, . . . have a seat in the senate or house of representatives of this commonwealth.\u201d It was held that even if this special justice had ceased to be a justice de jure, he was a justice de facto. (In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>123 Mass. 525, upon an information by the Attorney General to try the title of this special justice to his judicial office, the court held that he had \u201clegally vacated his judicial office,\u201d \u00f3n the principle that his \u201cacceptance of the second office is in law an implied resignation of the first\u201d [pages 529-5303). It is rather difficult to see why third parties and the public were not under as great a duty to take notice of the facts in <em>Sheehan\u2019s Case </em>as were third parties and the public to take notice of the resignation of Whipple and the acceptance thereof by the Governor as disclosed by correspondence between Whipple and the Governor, the interpretation of which involved a question of law as to which laymen, if not lawyers and judges, might honestly differ. It follows that even if Whipple\u2019s de jure tenure of his office came to an end by reason of the acceptance of his resignation that fact did not necessarily preclude his being a de facto officer after his tenure as a de jure officer had-come to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The conclusion that the termination of Whipple\u2019s tenure as officer de jure would not necessarily preclude his being a de facto officer after he ceased to be a de jure officer is in accordance with general public policy that governmental duties are not to go unperformed for lack of an officer to perform them. The \u201cpublic and parties, having rights depending upon official acts, are not so much concerned with the title to an office, as they are that, the duties of the office shall be performed, and the rights depending upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>their performance secured and protected.\u201d <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>138 Mass. 214, 222. In pursuance of this general public policy G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 30, \u00a7 8, provides expressly that a \u201cpublic officer appointed for any term by the governor, with or without the advice and consent of the council, shall hold his office during the term for which he is appointed and until his successor in office has qualified, unless he is sooner removed in accordance with law.\u201d This statute was applicable to the office held by Whipple and would have been applicable to him if the term for which he was appointed had come to an end by reason of lapse of time. There is some support for the interpretation of this language as applicable to an officer whose term of office \u2014 as in the case of Whipple \u2014 had been cut short by the taking effect of his resignation (see <em>Badger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S. 599), although I am not inclined to interpret the statute in this way. Even in the absence of such a statute the same general public policy obtains. In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>275 Mass. 575, 579, it was said: \u201cIt is a general principle of expediency in the absence of any binding regulation that an officer may continue after the expiration of his term to exercise the duties of his position until his successor is selected and qualified. This is simply a holding over for convenience and confers no right for any defined period. It is not a part of the necessary tenure of his office. It prevents interruption in the performance of the public business. It commonly is in the interests of the general welfare. Whether a person thus holding over is a de facto or a de jure officer is not germane to the questions presented and need not be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\">Whether or not the principle stated in this <em>Opinion of the Justices </em>is an application of the doctrine of de facto officers, \u2018this doctrine itself is, in part at least, based upon the general public policy, \u201cin the interests of the general welfare,\u201d of preventing \u201cinterruption in the performance of the public business.\u201d No reason appears why this doctrine should not apply to the case of an officer whose resignation has taken effect but who continues to act as an \u201cactual incumbent\u201d of the office \u201cin the performance of its duties.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ground in general public policy for the application of the doctrine of de facto officers \u2014 subject to its ordinary limitations \u2014 to the case of an officer whose resignation has taken effect but whose successor has not been appointed would seem to be as great as for the application of the statutory or analogous principle \u2014 perhaps somewhat broader in scope \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 to the case of an officer whose term has expired by lapse of time and whose successor has not been appointed. There is no greater likelihood of harm resulting from action of an officer whose resignation has taken effect than from action of an officer whose term of office has expired by lapse of time. In either event the remedy for any possible harm lies in the hands of the appointing power \u2014 the appointment of a successor.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\">I can see no justification for a general principle that would take the case of an officer whose resignation has taken effect out of the doctrine of de facto officers. On the contrary I think that this doctrine is particularly adapted to the case of such an officer. The present proceeding is an apt illustration of the wisdom of applying the doctrine of de facto officers to such an officer. In this case, on a peti-_ tian to the department of public works filed on November 30, 1944, for the license here in question, notice was given of a hearing to be held on December 12, 1944, and such a hearing was held at which testimony and statements were heard. Whipple participated in this hearing as he had authority to do. His resignation did not take effect before midnight December 14, 1944. The hearing did not culminate in a decision until December 15, 1944, when the license was granted. Clearly, if the license was invalid by reason of the participation of Whipple in granting it, the hearing upon the petition therefor became abortive and, if the petition is pressed, a new hearing will be required. The avoid-' anee of such an interruption \u201cin the performance of the public business\u201d is one of the grounds of the doctrine of de facto officers. That doctrine should not be denied application to the present case merely because of the particular way in which Whipple\u2019s de jure tenure came to an end. So far as <em>Loughran </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Jersey City, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>86 N. J. L. 442, is inconsistent with what is here said, it should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\">No other facts disclosed by the record are necessarily inconsistent with Whipple\u2019s having bfeen at least a de facto officer at the time he participated in the granting of the license. It may perhaps be suggested that the period after his resignation took effect and before the granting of the license was not long enough for him to acquire the standing of a de facto officer. This period would not have exceeded one day, but is not shown to have been less. A course of conduct by Whipple acting as the \u201cactual incumbent\u201d of the office \u201cin the performance of its duties\u201d after as well as before the license was granted might have a bearing upon his standing at the time the license was granted. It would be somewhat extraordinary, if a person so conducted himself over a considerable period of time, that his acts in the earlier part of the period would be invalid because his conduct had not then become sufficiently \u201cnotorious,\u201d but that his acts in the later part of the period would be valid. But even a period of one day or less would not necessarily be too short for, Whipple to acquire the standing of a de facto officer. In <em>Moloney </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Milford, </em>253 Mass. 400, 405-407, the period of time in which such a standing was acquired was much shorter. Three persons, including one Fitzsimmons, were declared elected selectmen \u201cin the early morning of March 3, 1925.\u201d A petition for a recount \u201cwas filed during the forenoon of March 3.\u201d \u201cThe three declared elected selectmen held a meeting on the afternoon of March 3, at which time they all knew that the petition for a recount had been filed.\u201d At that meeting one Moloney \u201cwas appointed chief of police by a majority vote, when much other business . . . also was transacted.\u201d The recount, completed on March 7, showed that Fitzsimmons had not been elected selectman. On a petition by Moloney, who meanwhile had been removed from office, to be reinstated, it was held that \u201cFitzsimmons was at least a de facto selectman when the petitioner was elected, and the petitioner\u2019s election as chief of police is not here open to successful attack.\u201d The record in the present case does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>show that the period between the taking effect of the resignation of Whipple and the granting of the license was so short that he could not have been a de facto officer when he participated in granting the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\">It is my' conclusion, for the reasons herein stated, that, the petitioner, which had the burden of proving that the respondents were without jurisdiction to grant the license, has failed to make such proof, since it has failed to show that Whipple, at the time he participated in granting the license, was not at least a de facto officer. The result of this conclusion would be that the license is not invalid and should not be quashed.
