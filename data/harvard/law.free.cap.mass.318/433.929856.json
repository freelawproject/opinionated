MacPherson (hereinafter called the defendant) and to reach and apply certain shares of capital stock. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3 (7). From decrees aggregating nearly $17,000 in favor of the plaintiff, the defendants appealed, but the appeals have not reached this court. On April 4, 1945, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court in each case a \u201cmotion to turn securities into cash.\u201d The motions, which are substantially identical, recite that \u201cwhereas in part the security to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the plaintiff must look for the satisfaction of his judgment consists of sixteen hundred forty . . . shares of the preferred stock of Consolidated Film Industries, Inc., now in the hands of the defendant Framingham National Bank together with other securities as collateral to a loan, which shares are highly speculative and of a fluctuating .value, having,, as appears from . . . the master\u2019s report filed in this case, sold as low as . . . $4.25 ... in October, 1937, and . . . $4.50 ... in March, 1938, and having in the year 1944, sold on the New York Stock Exchange at prices ranging from a low of . . . 16| ... to a high of . . . 30| . . . and at present selling at approximately . . . $30 . . . per share, the plaintiff now moves that under and by virtue of the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 223, \u00a7 86A, and other powers in this court vested, the court enter an order, directing that said shares be sold and that the proceeds thereof be held by the defendant Framingham National Bank subject to its own lien in lieu of and in substitution for said shares to await the final disposition of this action.\u201d A judge \u201cdenied the motions not as matter of discretion but as matter of law,\u201d and reported \u201cthe questions raised by the motions\u201d to this court. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 111. The reports state, \u201cAt the hearing before me, the facts stated in said motions not being disputed, it further appeared that the indebtedness of the defendant James E. MacPherson to the bank was in excess of $30,000 and that securities in the hands of the bank, including the shares of stock described in the motion were held under preliminary injunction issued by this court upon the bills to reach and apply in these two proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">There is no basis for the motions in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 223, \u00a7 86A (first enacted in 1925), which provides in part: \u201cUpon motion of the plaintiff at any time after a verdict has been rendered or a finding of liability or otherwise made in his favor in any action at law in the superior court, or after a finding in his favor fixing the amount of an unliquidated claim has been made in a suit in equity in the supreme judicial or superior court, and before final judgment or decree therein, such court shall thereupon have jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tian in equity by appropriate procedure and process to cause to be reached, held and thereafter applied in payment of any judgment or decree in his favor in such action or suit the same kind of property, right, title or interest, legal or equitable, of a defendant . . . which may be reached and applied under clauses (7) and (8) of section three of chapter two hundred and fourteen.\u201d The references to clauses (7) and (8) are respectively to \u201cany property, right, title or interest, legal or equitable . . . which cannot be reached to be attached or taken on execution in an action at law\u201d (first enacted in 1851) and to \u201cshares or interests in corporations\u201d (first enacted in 1910). By \u00a7 86A such property \u201cafter a finding\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in a suit in equity may be \u201creached, held and thereafter applied in payment of any . . . decree.\u201d The fair import of the language is that the property shall be \u201cheld\u201d until there is a final decree. There is nothing to indicate that before ultimate determination of his right the Legislature intended that a plaintiff with merely a lower court \u201cfinding\u201d in his favor should be empowered to bring about a change in the character of the defendant\u2019s property so \u201cheld.\u201d In the cases at bar no property was \u201creached\u201d following the findings in the plaintiff's favor. The capital stock had all been \u201creached\u201d at the beginning of the suits which were brought under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3, reading in part: \u201cThe supreme judicial and superior courts shall have original and concurrent jurisdiction in equity of the following cases: ... (7) Suits by creditors to reach and apply, in payment of a debt, any property, right, title or interest, legal or equitable, of a debtor . . . which cannot be reached to be attached or taken on execution in an action at law, although the property sought to be reached and applied is in the possession or control of the debtor independently of any other person or cannot be reached and applied until a future time or is of uncertain value, if the value can be ascertained by sale, appraisal or by any means within the ordinary procedure of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The next question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to this remedy under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 3V(7). \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>remedy provided' by this statute often has been referred to as an equitable trustee process. It is a relief resting wholly upon the statute and not belonging to any branch of general chancery jurisprudence. . . . The relief afforded of reaching property not otherwise accessible by legal process is the single feature which renders proper its statutory classification under equity jurisdiction. In its essential nature the remedy thus afforded is the same as that given by the trustee process in an action at law. The same general principles have been applied in determining whether the equitable process lies as in deciding whether attachment could be made by trustee process in an action at law.\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>218 Mass. 360, 362. See <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Toledo, Cincinnati, &amp; St. Louis Railroad, </em>148 Mass. 411; <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, <em>S. C. </em>227 Mass. 501. Compare <em>Hyde Park Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Davankoskas, </em>298 Mass. 421.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAs attachment on mesne process prevailed in this Commonwealth, the Legislature . . . [followed] the analogy of trustee process in creating this new remedy for the collection of a debt.\u201d <em>Pettibone </em>v. <em>Toledo, Cincinnati, &amp; St. Louis Railroad, </em>148 Mass. 411, 417. \u201cThe statute is remedial in nature and should' not be given a constricted interpretation. But on the other hand it should not be stretched to cover cases not within its fair import.\u201d <em>H. G. Kilbourne Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Stamp Affixer Co. </em>216 Mass. 118, 120-121. Statutes relating to attachment upon mesne process are to be read in the light of custom and common practice, and are not to be construed so as to be \u201ca surprise to the profession.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wenz, </em>187 Mass. 421, 424. Such custom and practice do not support the plaintiff\u2019s position. In trustee process in an action at law \u201cgoods, effects or credits\u201d from early times have been \u201cattached and held to respond to the final judgment.\u201d See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 246, \u00a7 20. Likewise real and personal property when attached have been \u201cheld as security to satisfy such judgment as the plaintiff may recover.\u201d See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 223, \u00a7 42, as amended by St. 1937, c. 295, \u00a7 1. In the case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>attachment of tangible personal property since 1822 there has been a statutory exception allowing the sale of \u201canimals or of goods which are liable to perish, waste or greatly decrease in value by keeping, or which cannot be kept without great and disproportionate expense.\u201d See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 223, \u00a7 88. \u201cThe authority to attach does not of itself give any authority to sell on original process, and before judgment and execution.\u201d <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 Allen, 207, 208. We have seen no. case which is a precedent for the course the plaintiff seeks to follow. Receivership and bankruptcy cases where the property is eventually to be sold are readily distinguishable. Here until the plaintiff becomes eventually successful, there is no way.of knowing whether he is entitled to have the defendant\u2019s interest sold. See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Love, </em>3 Lea, 374. It is true that \u201cthe property, by judicial order, is charged with an equity for the security of the plaintiff, and is taken directly into the control of the court.\u201d See <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Mass. 58, 62. But it is in the control of the court subject to the purpose intended by the statute. We do not think that it was the legislative intent to confer a broad equitable power to bring about an involuntary conversion of a defendant\u2019s stock into cash prior to final adjudication of a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim.\u201d Compare <em>DeBeers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The result is that there was no error of law in the action of the trial judge in the matters reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Decrees denying motions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-5\"> The same is true of \u00a7 3 (8). <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>295 Mass. 245, 246. <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Boston Railroad Holding Co. </em>315 Mass. 591, 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
