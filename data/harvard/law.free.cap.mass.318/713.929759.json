The plaintiff Mosset (hereinafter called the mortgagee) held a mortgage on the real estate, and the plaintiff Bedrosian (hereinafter called the owner) was the mortgagor of the real estate and the owner of the personal property. So far as now material, the loss was allegedly covered by two policies issued by the defendant, one for $2,000 on- the contents, and another for $6,000 on the real estate. These three actions of contract were brought, two by the owner for the losses on the personal property and real estate respectively, and the third by' the mortgagee. The jury returned a verdict for the owner in the personal property action and a verdict of $6,000 and interest in the action by the mortgagee. By order of the judge the jury returned a verdict for the defendant in the owner\u2019s action on th$ real estate policy, as the amount of that policy had been exhausted by the verdict for the mortgagee, and we need not consider that,action. The defendant\u2019s exceptions which have been argued relate to the denial of its motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal contention is that the policies never became effective contracts. The defendant relies upon <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Monitor Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>108 Mass. 56, <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Assurance Co. Ltd. </em>162 Mass. 29, <em>Bowditch </em>v. <em>Norwich Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>193 Mass. 565, and <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>219 Mass. 454. See also <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Norwich Union Fire Ins. Society, Ltd. </em>128 N. J. L. 314. Compare <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Northern Ins. Co. </em>42 R. I. 354. The real estate policy contained the clause: \u201c$6000. On the story frame building . . . while used for dwelling purposes only and designed for occupancy by not more than one families [sic]. \u201d There was a similar clause in the other policy. The defendant concedes that there was evidence warranting a finding that the building was used for dwelling purposes only, but urges that the building was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>unwarrantably found to be one \u201cdesigned for occupancy by not more than one\u201d family. The structure was \u201ca long frame building set alongside\u201d the main road to Taunton about a mile from a race track, and had \u201ctwo or two and one half stories.\u201d It was occupied by the plaintiff and her husband \u201cas a home dwelling and for no other purpose.\u201d The main building was thirty-three feet by twenty-four feet, and was adjoined by an ell twenty-eight feet by sixty feet. There were two front, and two back, entrances. On the first floor of the main building were a \u201clarge\u201d living room connected by an arch door with a back parlor; a bedroom, formerly used as a dining room; a bathroom; and a kitchen containing utensils valued at $75. On the second floor were two bedrooms and a bathroom. On the first floor of the ell was a room \u201cas large as two regular parlors\u201d which was once used as a restaurant and \u201cdine and dance place,\u201d but was utilized by the owner as a play or card room for parties when relatives and friends came for entertainment without charge. On the second floor were eight small bedrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\">In 1932 the mortgagee foreclosed a mortgage on the property, which was then known as \u201cOld Homestead.\u201d In 1934 and 1935 it was called \u201cBrown Derby\u201d and then \u201cWayside Inn,\u201d and was operated by one Nassau, who held liquor licenses for the last four and one half months of 1934 and for the last month of 1935, and a victualler\u2019s license and a Sunday license for the last seven months of 1935. The premises were vacant until 1939, when \u201csome woman\u201d became a tenant for a year and a half. The place was renamed \u201cWayside Inn,\u201d but never opened. The property thereafter was unoccupied until the owner acquired it on April 17, 1941, for the sum of $500 and a purchase money mortgage of $6,000. From 1935 until the fire there were two signs alongside the road, reading \u201cWayside Inn \u2014 \u25a0 Parking front or rear \u2014 Tourists welcome-rooms with or without board,\u201d and \u201cRear entrance\u201d with an arrow pointing to the words. There were electric lights attached to the signs which were lighted, at least at times, in the summer of 1941. The jury could have accepted both the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>many of-the owner\u2019s husband that this was to illuminate the driveway, and the testimony of the owner that no one ever asked for rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The crux of the question is the meaning to be attributed to the word \u201cdesigned.\u201d We have been referred to no case and have found none which is particularly helpful in its interpretation. \u2022 The language signifies a building architecturally adapted for occupancy by one family. Thus construing the contract, it is our opinion that the judge rightly permitted the jury to find whether the building came within its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The defendant also contends that, contrary to the instructions of the judge, there was evidence from which the jury could have found that \u201cthe fire was set by the insured or the mortgagee acting independently, or more probably in collaboration, for the purpose of defrauding the defendant.\u201d The burden of proof on this issue was on the defendant. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Travelers Fire Ins. Co. </em>288 Mass. 391, 393. <em>Canton Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>300 Mass. 243. It is unnecessary to recount this evidence, which falls far short of permitting any such conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
