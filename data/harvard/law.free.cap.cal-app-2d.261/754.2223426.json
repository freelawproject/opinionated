Defendant issued the policy to plaintiff, describing a 1956 Chevrolet automobile and a 1957 Plymouth automobile owned by him. Plaintiff\u2019s minor son, Herman, was not mentioned in the policy, nor, for that matter, were any of plaintiff\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">During the time the policy was in effect, Herman bought a 1955 Dodge automobile with his own money. It is not contended that plaintiff had any interest in or control over the Dodge automobile. However, plaintiff had signed Herman\u2019s application for an operator\u2019s license and, as a result, incurred vicarious liability by reason of an accident in which Herman was involved as driver of his own Dodge automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">Plaintiff filed this declaratory relief action, alleging the existence of the policy, his liability by reason of Vehicle Code section 17707, that defendant refused to defend the lawsuit arising from an accident of Herman\u2019s which resulted in plaintiff being sued as a defendant therein, which is the basis for the dispute between plaintiff and defendant. Plaintiff also sought attorney\u2019s fees incurred by reason of having to engage the services of an attorney to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">Defendant answered, asserting that Herman and his automobile were not covered under the policy so there was no obligation upon defendant to defend plaintiff as to his alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>vicarious liability. Summary judgment was entered for defendant.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">\u25a0 Plaintiff argues, first, that since his liability is statutory, public policy requires coverage as a matter of law. He finds a basis for this theory in the following language of <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Emp. Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 31, 40 [307 P.2d 359]: \u201cInasmuch as sections 402 and 415 of the Vehicle Code set forth the public policy of this state such laws must be considered a part of every policy of liability insurance even though the policy itself does not specifically make such laws a part thereof. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">But the facts of our ease are not apposite to <em>Wildman, </em>where- the automobile involved in the accident was covered by the policy and the insurance company attempted to evade liability arising from the operation of the covered vehicle. Here, the automobile was <em>not </em>covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., </em>58 Cal.2d 142 [23 Cal.Rptr. 592, 373 P.2d 640], cited by plaintiff, approved the language of <em>Wildman </em>but, again, the court was concerned with imputed or statutory liability imposed upon the insured as the owner of a motor vehicle covered by the policy. The upshot of the holding is that certain uses. of a covered vehicle cannot be excluded. At page 150 the court explains that the doctrine of the <em>Wildman </em>case was to \u201ceffectuate the public policy of the state by making 1 owners of motor vehicles financially responsible to those injured by them <em>in the operation of such vehicles,\u2019 </em>\u201d and that \u201cany provision in a policy which purported to exclude certain classes of <em>permissive users </em>from coverage was declared to be contrary to this public policy and, therefore, void. \u2019 \u2019 (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s liability here was not predicated upon ownership of the vehicle or its permissive use. The minor was driving a vehicle not covered by the policy, and he himself was not named as an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">It is asserted that plaintiff is covered under the \u201cUse of Other Automobile\u201d provisions of the policy, relying upon <em>Fazzino </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America, </em>152 Cal.App.2d 304 [313 P.2d 178]. However, the <em>Fazzino </em>ease turns upon the ambiguous language of the policy which the court construed against the insurance carrier. The court said, at page 308 : \u201cA study of paragraph V forces the conclusion that the coverage thereby provided is for bodily injury and property damage liability of the named insured <em>in connection with automobiles other than the named automobile regardless of whether such </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>automobile is used by the named insured. </em>There is nothing in the policy to limit the coverage to the insured\u2019s use of other automobiles. It covers the named insured's liability arising from the use of other automobiles <em>no matter who </em>causes that liability, the named insured or some other person.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The same ambiguity does not appear in the policy before us. Not only is the affirmative or covering language applicable; to use of \u20181 other automobiles\u201d limited to use by the insured and his spouse, but there is also the following specific exclusion under \u201cUse of Other Automobiles\u201d: \u201c(d) This insuring agreement does not apply: (1) to any automobile owned by or furnished for regular use to either the named insured or a member of the same household other than a private chauffeur or domestic servant of such named insured or spouse. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The points raised by plaintiff in this ease were discussed by the court in <em>Wisdom </em>v. <em>Eagle Star Ins. Co., </em>211 Cal.App.2d 602 [27 Cal.Rptr. 599].  The facts of that case parallel those before us, and the court had this to say: \u201cWe are of the opinion that the code section, by its requirement that the policy cover liability imposed \u2018on him\u2019 by law for damages arising out of use by \u2018him\u2019 of any motor vehicle not owned by \u2018him\u2019 (the antecedent of the pronoun being \u2018the person named as insured\u2019), does not incorporate into the policy coverage for liability imposed on the named insured for damages arising out of use by his son, whose application the insured had signed. We believe \u2018use by him\u2019 does not mean \u2018use by him or by anyone through whose use liability may be imputed to him.\u2019  We recognize that the purpose of financial responsibility laws is to give monetary protection to the persons .lawfully using the highways, and that they are to be construed liberally. [Citations.]  This proposition, however, does not vitiate the elementary principle that the judicial function is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the statute, not to insert what has been omitted, or omit what has been inserted. [Citation. ]  Courts cannot depart from the. meaning of language in a statute which is free from ambiguity, even though the consequence would be to defeat the object of the statute,] [Citation,] We_have no means of knowing,_anyway, that it was the object.of the Legislature to incorporate'.into every operator\u2019s policy coverage of the insured for the acts of q.ny: minor \u2022.whose application- for ' driver\u2019s- license ' he may choose to' sigh and be qualified to sign. (A minor\u2019s appliea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>tion may be signed by, and the minor\u2019s liability imputed to, parents [citation], an adult spouse [citation], persons having custody of the minor if the minor is a nonresident [citation].) It is to be noted that there is no allegation in the complaint of agency for the parent of the minor, nor is there any allegation that the driving of the vehicle by the minor at the time of the accident, was of advantage to the parents.\u201d (Pp. 605-606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">So, here.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Conley, P. J., and Gargano, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
