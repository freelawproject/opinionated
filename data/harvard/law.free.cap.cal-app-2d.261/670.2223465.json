The following narrative takes at face value the material allegations of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Appellant was the daughter-in-law of John Porporato, decedent; respondent was the residuary beneficiary of decedent\u2019s will and devisee of real property located on Marina Boulevard at Webster Street in San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Appellant married decedent\u2019s son in. 1935. The couple moved to San Francisco from Omaha and lived for a year and a half in a flat owned by the decedent. During this period a close and tender relationship developed between appellant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>decedent: When decedent decided to build a residence on his Marina property, he also had a second dwelling constructed on the lot for the use of his son and daughter-in-law. Decedent\u2019s wife refused to move from North Beach to the Marina dwelling; thereupon decedent asked appellant and his son to move into the main house. They did so, and appellant has lived there ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Appellant\u2019s husband entered the Navy in 1942. In 1943 appellant gave birth to a son. During appellant\u2019s pregnancy, decedent was a frequent visitor at her residence. Decedent idolized his grandson who greatly resembled the boy\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">While appellant was visiting her family in Omaha, she received word that her husband had been killed in action. Her family wanted her to remain in Omaha. She believed that it would be better fpr her to do so as she could resume her nursing career and be near her family. Decedent, however, begged her to return to the Marina Boulevard home and raise her son in San Francisco in order that decedent would have the companionship of his grandson. The relationship with his grandson brought comfort to decedent and eased the burden of his loss. At this time decedent orally promised that if appellant remained in San Francisco, she could continue to reside in the Marina home and he would devise the property to her. Appellant placed great trust in decedent and believed that if she complied with his wishes, he would bequeath the property to her. In reliance on this oral promise appellant did remain in San Francisco. Appellant, living on a small pension, told decedent that she desired to obtain employment to augment her income, and also to qualify for social security benefits. Decedent opposed this idea and told appellant he would like her to remain at home and raise his grandchild. He reiterated his promise that the property would pass to her on his death. Relying on this assurance, appellant did not seek employment. Appellant was thus unable to acquire any savings or to qualify for social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Absent decedent\u2019s promises to leave her the property, appellant would have settled in Omaha and secured employment there as a nurse. Moreover, once she decided to remain in San. Francisco, she relied on decedent\u2019s promises to leave her the property and therefore gave up any opportunity for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Contrary to his promises to appellant, decedent left the Marina property, to . respondent. .Thus, it is contended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>respondent holds the property for appellant\u2019s use and benefit. Appellant prayed judgment that respondent had no right, title or interest in the property and that appellant be declared the owner thereof. She also prayed for an order restraining respondent from disposing of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The trial court sustained a demurrer on the following grounds: (1) no cause of action was stated; (2) the complaint alleges an oral contract to make a will but pleads no facts avoiding the statute of frauds; (3) the facts pleaded do not show estoppel: there is no showing of either unjust enrichment or unconscionable injury; (4) no cause of action for monetary relief is stated because there is no allegation that any claim was made against decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim is that decedent breached his oral agreement to devise her the Marina property. The statute of frauds provides that oral contracts to make a will are unenforceable (Civ. Code, \u00a71624, subd. 6); but it is contended that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to estop respondent from taking advantage of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The relief which may be granted in an action for quasi-specific performance of a contract to bequeath or devise property is the imposition of a constructive trust upon the property in favor of the promisee-plaintiff. It differs from the relief which would be available in a traditional specific performance action, and the remedy bears a different name, because the court cannot compel the making of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The following elements are requisite to relief: (1) a contract sufficiently definite and certain in its terms to be enforced (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3390, subd. 6; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 637, 646 [47 Cal.Rptr. 154]; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 468, 473 [46 Cal.Rptr. 173]); (2) that the contract was just and reasonable (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3391, subd. 2; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>supra); (3) that the plaintiff has performed his side of the bargain (Civ. Code, \u00a73392; <em>Shive </em>v. <em>Barrow </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 838, 847 [199 P.2d 693]; (4) that the promisor has failed to perform; and (5) that the contract was supported by adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\u2022As in all eases which invoke equitable powers, the plaintiff must show (6) that her remedj'- at law is inadequate. <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 468, 473-474; <em>Zellner </em>v. <em>Wassman </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 80, 84 [193 P. 84] [inadequacy of legal remedy is the \u201ckeystone of equitable jurisdiction\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">If specific performance is sought, the foregoing elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>must be pleaded whether the contract sued upon is written <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 468, 470, 473) or oral <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 637, 646). Where the contract was oral as is alleged here, the complaint must also allege (7) that the defendant is estopped from reliance upon the statute of frauds because failure to enforce the contract would result in either unconscionable injury to the plaintiff or unjust enrichment of the defendant. <em>(Estate of Baglione </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 192, 197-198 [53 Cal.Rptr. 139, 417 P.2d 683]; <em>Day </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 404, 410-411 [29 Cal.Rptr. 785, 380 P.2d 385, 94 A.L.R.2d 802]; <em>Monarco </em>v. <em>Lo Greco </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 621, 623-624 [220 P.2d 737].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The complaint unquestionably alleges the first four elements.  Turning to the adequacy of the consideration, appellant alleged that the decedent promised to permit her to occupy a portion of the Marina property, and devise the property to her, if she would comply with his request to remain there and raise her child near decedent. In exchange for the promise, \u2018 \u2018 she agreed to . . . remain in San Francisco. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Thus, the consideration she exchanged for the promise now sued upon was her agreement\u2014in 1945\u2014to do as the decedent asked.  The proper time for testing the adequacy of consideration is as of the formation of the contract, and the court may consider \u201csuch factors as the relationship of the parties, their friendship, love, affection, and regard for each other, and the object to be attained by the contract.\u201d <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 468, 474.)  Appellant\u2019s promise was exchanged for the decedent\u2019s: and in a bilateral contract \u201cMutual promises are concurrent considerations, ...\u201d <em>(Papadakos </em>v. <em>Soares </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 411, 412 [170 P. 1114].)  Her agreement to raise her son near the decedent was manifestly a \u201cbenefit conferred, or agreed to be conferred, upon the promisor ... to which the promisor [was] not lawfully entitled\u201d and as such was a good consideration for the decedent\u2019s promise to her. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">It is also sufficiently alleged that appellant performed the contract she seeks to enforce. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3392; <em>Shive </em>v. <em>Barrow, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 838, 847.)  In the typical quasi-specific performance case, personal services were bargained for and rendered as the consideration for the promise sued upon. When enforcement of the promise is sought, quasi-specific performance relief may be denied because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>services rendered were adequately compensable in \"money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other cases, where a money payment would not adequately compensate for the services, relief has been granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These cases have fallen into one category or the other depending upon whether the plaintiff has shown the inadequacy of legal remedy which is requisite to equitable relief. But \u201cservices\u201d in a menial or other wage-compensable sense are not a <em>sine qua non </em>of the consideration which will support a contract to bequeath or devise property. Quasi-specific performance .of s\u00fach a contract has been granted where the promisee-plaintiff had agreed to and did \u201clive near\u201d the promisor \u201cand furnish her with companionship\u201d without performing services as such <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 156, 159); and again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>where the promisor, although in his last illness, \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>desired none of the usual services of a nurse or housekeeper\u201d and received from the promisee only \u201ccomfort, care and consolation.\u201d <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Calloway, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.2d 675, 682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The first question, then, is whether appellant\u2019s complaint sufficiently shows that she is without adequate remedy at law. We hold that it does,, for two reasons. First, the complaint alleges a contract for the transfer of real property.  Because of the historic treatment of land as unique, it is presumed in such case that damages would not adequately compensate for the breach; specific performance\u2014or, in the present case, quasi-specific performance\u2014of the contract will be granted \u201cas a matter of course unless some other equitable reason for denial is shown\u201d; the party seeking enforcement need not establish inadequacy of the legal remedy, and may rely upon the presumption. <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 468, 473; 5A Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 1143, pp. 126,132-134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Secondly, the complaint independently shows the inadequacy of her legal remedy by virtue of the unusual character of the \u201cservices\u201d she allegedly rendered.  An agreement in consideration of personal services is subject to specific performance if the services are 11 of such a peculiar, extraordinary or exceptional character that it is impossible to estimate their value by \u00e1ny pecuniary standard or to adequately compensate for them in money.\u201d <em>(Fowler </em>v. <em>Hansen, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 518, 522; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 637, 647.) This requirement of \u201cpeculiar\u201d services as a ground for specific enforcement of an agreement to bequeath or devise property exists whether the agreement is oral or in writing. (See, e.g., <em>Mutz </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 100, 104-105, 107, 111-112; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Freese </em>(1938) 28 Cal.App.2d 608, 610, 612, 620 [83 P.2d 82].) The requirement relates, not to the statute of frauds or to an estoppel to take advantage qf the statute, hut to the question of whether the legal remedy is inadequate: and the decisions speak of \u201cpeculiar\u201d services in dealing with the latter question only.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In most of the cases granting quasi-specific performance of a contract to devise property, the \u201cservices\u201d rendered as consideration for the agreement were menial or otherwise commonplace, but they were \u201cpeculiar\u201d because\u2014typically, by reason of a family or other close relationship between the contracting <em>parties\u2014only the promisee could perform them. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>(See factual summaries of cases cited, footnote 2, <em>supra.) </em> Under the facts alleged in her complaint, only appellant\u2014 by living in San Francisco with her child after 1945\u2014could have provided the solace sought by the decedent in his bereavement at the loss of his son. We therefore conclude that she alleges the rendition of \u201cservices\u201d which were \u201cpeculiar, extraordinary or exceptional\u201d because only she could have performed them; and that, having done so in the \u201ccontinuation of a close family relationship, \u2019 \u2019 she sufficiently alleges that she is without an adequate legal remedy. <em>(Monarco </em>v. <em>Lo Greco, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 621, 626.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The next question is whether facts are alleged sufficient to show that respondent is estopped from reliance upon the statute. The complaint alleges that in complying with the decedent\u2019s request that she live and raise her child in San Francisco, appellant forsook the advantages of living in Omaha commencing in 1945 and of obtaining employment later. Respondent relies on <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 637, 648, where allegations of similar sacrifices and forbearances were held to be insufficient. But in <em>Kennedy </em>the court had previously held <em>(id. </em>at p. 647) that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy at law was adequate: and its ensuing discussion (pp. 648-649, citing <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Hoge </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 257 [250 P.2d 174], and <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Swanson, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 380, 385) merely points out that her sacrifices were elements of damages in the exercise of the legal remedy to which she was restricted.  <em>Kennedy </em>holds only that the detriment incurred by a plaintiff in the performance of a contract will not establish a cause of action to enforce the contract in equity if she has a cause of action at law for its breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">However, where a plaintiff establishes that her remedy at law is <em>not </em>adequate, equitable relief may be appropriate; and, where the contract was oral, the detriment incurred in performing it may retain its materiality as tending to show change of position which will raise an estoppel and avoid the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">In this light we conclude that appellant\u2019s complaint pleads sufficient facts to raise an estoppel. The complaint alleges that appellant <em>did </em>come to San Francisco with her child to live near the decedent. (Cf. <em>Mutz </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 100, 103, 112 [promisee moved from Canada to California]; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Calloway, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.2d 675, 677 [Michigan to Los Angeles]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 156, 157-158 [New Hampshire to California]; <em>Fowler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>v. <em>Hansen, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 518, 521 [Texas to Los Angeles]; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Beamer, supra, </em>8 Cal.App. 200, 204-205 [Marysville to Lassen County, California]; <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Healy, supra, </em>138 Cal. 81, 84 [Ireland to California].) It alleges that she did <em>not </em>resume her former home in Nebraska. (Cf. <em>DeHermosillo </em>v. <em>Morales, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.2d 819, 823-824, 829 [promisee, visiting in California when the promise was made there, did not return to her home in Mexico].) In all of the cases cited, quasi-specific performance relief was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It is true that appellant did not uproot herself from elsewhere to keep her promise, but only remained in San Francisco, where she had already lived for several years. But the complaint also alleges that appellant was in Omaha when her husband was killed, and that she believed at the time that her interests and those of the child would be best served if she remained there with her own family and friends and obtained employment which was available to her there: nevertheless, she came back to San Francisco in reliance upon the decedent \u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">According to the allegations of the complaint, appellant returned to San Francisco as a new widow with an infant, entering a new and wholly different mode of life which cannot justly be characterized as merely \"remaining\u201d in her former home, as contended by appellant. Her return to California was a significant change of position. That being so, she sufficiently pleads an estoppel; having alleged that she gave 20 years of her own life and the childhood years of her son in keeping her bargain, she will suffer \"unconscionable injury\u201d if she is not permitted to enforce the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Devine, P. J., and Rattigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 29, 1968, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 26,1968.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-5\"> E.g.: <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d 637, 644, 647 [services as domestic servant and assistant in gasoline station]; <em>Kobus </em>v. <em>San Diego Trust &amp; </em>Sav.
