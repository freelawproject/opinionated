Bingham, seek review and annulment of a decision by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board that Bingham\u2019s death was not the result of injuries arising out of and occurring in the course of his dual employment with respondents California Inspection Rating Bureau and Macy\u2019s of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Decedent had been employed by the California Inspection Rating Bureau (hereafter Bureau) since 1952, and at the time of his death was a senior field auditor. His job was to audit payroll records of all types of businesses, in a territory extending from Bakersfield to Red Bluff and Ukiah, in connection with computation of premiums for workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. In the course of his employment decedent did a great deal of driving; this tended to upset and exhaust him, and he got so he \u201chated it.\u201d He also disliked the aspects of his job which caused him to be away from home frequently while making field audits. Decedent was often exposed to harassment and delay from certain employers who resisted the auditing of their books. He was required to rearrange his schedule in order to locate missing books and ledgers, and sometimes got behind in his assignments. When delays occurred decedent felt he had to \u201crace\u201d to make up for his lost time. The employer furnished decedent with an adding machine so that he could catch up on his audits at home. Decedent met all of these pressures and strains with determination, and his supervisor praised his work highly.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">In 1954 decedent, with the knowledge of the first employer, took a second job as a salesman in the liquor department at Maey\u2019s Hillsdale store. The job was taken in order to produce supplementary income after the birth of a third child, and because of a continuing inability to meet rising household expenses. Bingham worked Friday evenings, all day Saturdays, and frequently on Monday and Thursday nights. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>addition to selling, he was required to receive and handle cases of liquor. This work included lifting, stacking and unstacking from two to fifty cases a day, depending on the store\u2019s needs. The cases weighed about fifty pounds each, and there was evidence that during sales decedent sometimes had to strain to work faster so that he could stack eases and wait on customers during the same work period. Decedent\u2019s hardworking and conscientious performance earned him recognition as \u201cSalesman of the Year\u201d at Macy\u2019s; fellow employees described him as an \u201c excellent worker. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On October 1, 1964, after working all day on his audits for the Bureau, decedent had dinner, and then left for his job at Maey\u2019s. Later he returned home feeling \u201cawfully sick,\u201d and immediately went to bed. During the night he awakened his wife and asked her to call a doctor. Dr. Stanley Hanfling arrived, found decedent \u201cacutely ill, cold, cyanotic, clammy\u201d and hospitalized him. Decedent complained of sharp pains in his chest which radiated down both arms. Dr. Hanfling at first believed decedent\u2019s condition might be caused by a diseased gall bladder or peptic ulcers <em>\u2022 </em>later he diagnosed the condition as a myocardial infarct occurring at 4 a.m. on October 2. Decedent remained in the hospital until his death on October 24, 1964. The death certificate, signed by Dr. Hanfling, stated the cause of death to be \u201cshock (2 hrs.), due to acute myocardial infarction (3 wks.), due to Arteriosclerotic heart disease (3 months).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Medical records received at the referee\u2019s hearing established that decedent had been under the care of a Dr. Stitch three years before the fatal attack and that Dr. Stitch had diagnosed hypertension. A report prepared by decedent\u2019s family physician indicated that decedent had suffered pains the year before which might have been signs of a coronary attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Dr. Blise M. Bose, who had been retained by applicants for purposes of testimony, stated in a report received in evidence by the referee that decedent \u201ccarried a heavy work load; tension was present in his job with the . . . Bureau; physical effort was present in his job at Maey\u2019s. This man pushed himself beyond the point where his cardiovascular system could take further insults.\u201d Dr. Bose concluded that decedent's jobs had aggravated the underlying coronary heart disease and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Dr. Hanfling, the physician who treated decedent during his last illness, testified that ulcers are common in hard striv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ing people and \u201cplay the same role as does heart disease, and . . . stress may aggravate either condition.\u201d He stated that in his opinion heart disease was inherited and that decedent\u2019s disease was inherited. Cardiograms taken of decedent showed evidence of \u201can old injury to the heart.\u201d Dr. Hanfling concluded that he did not believe that decedent\u2019s heart attack was 11 industrial.''</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\">Another physician, Dr. Eliaser, was retained by the Bureau\u2019s insurance carrier for purposes of testimony. In his opinion, \u201cthere was no relationship between the work and the time of infarction . . . the time interval between the performance of work and the infarct is too great to be industrial. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The referee found that Bingham died as a proximate result of injuries arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment by Macy\u2019s, and the Bureau, and awarded $20,500 in death benefits. The appeals board granted reconsideration and, under Labor Code section 5703, subdivision (b), appointed Dr. Meyer Friedman to act as independent medical examiner, review the file, and respond to the following questions : \u201c1. In your opinion, what was the medical cause of decedent's death? 2. Was decedent\u2019s death caused by his employment? 3. If the Examiner feels that decedent\u2019s employment caused his heart condition, to what period of time is he referring? 4. If the injury industrially caused, what apportionment, if any, among the two employers ? \u2019 \u2019 Dr. Friedman expressed in his report sharp disagreement with what he termed Dr. Eliaser\u2019s persistent refusal 1 \u2018 to accept the increasing evidence that is now in the medical literature of the relationship of stress and strain to coronary heart disease. \u201d He then went on to give the following answer to the question whether Bingham\u2019s death was caused by his employment : \u201cI might say that any type of employment that was performed by this man in the way he did it would have been partially responsible for his development of coronary artery disease and the accidents that are associated with this disease. <em>The real cause of his death was his continuous drive to hold down two positions without adequate rest for himself. </em>[Italics added.] This in part, as I have already stated, was due to the kind of personality he had that impelled him to continuously drive for status enhancement. Put it in another way, the same sort of drive that allowed him to be considered the salesman of the year by Macy\u2019s is the drive that enhanced his coronary heart disease. So either type of employment served as tinder to the flame of his drive. His employment in two jobs did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>produce Ms documented restlessness but rather Ms restlessness sought two jobs and I haven't much doubt that if a third type of employment had been offered to him, he would possibly have found a way to take on a third responsibility. &lt; &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\u201cI would say that I don\u2019t believe that this is an industrial injury. This man himself took on the two jobs and I think that he must be considered responsible for his coronary artery disease and not the employers. However, if my opinion is not considered true in regard to the nonliability of employment for his heart disease, and if employment is considered absolutely responsible for Ms ilMess then I would say both employers are equally at fault. But I would like once more to stress that neither type of employment that he had, as I see it described in the file, carried in itself any legitimate cause for hastening of the coronary atherosclerotic process. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">After filing Dr. Friedman\u2019s report, the appeals board prepared and filed an \u201cOpinion, Order and Decision After Reconsideration\u201d denying benefits. The opinion declared that the board\u2019s conclusion was \u201cbased upon the report of Dr. Friedman, that the deceased employee\u2019s heart attack did not arise out of and occur in the course of his employment.\u201d Petitioners contend that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Whether an employee\u2019s work contributed to his injury is a question of fact for the determination of the appeals board. <em>(Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 111, 115 [41 Cal.Rptr. 628].)  \u201cWhen a finding of fact ... is attacked . . . the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the finding of fact.\u201d <em>(Douglas </em>Aircraft, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 903, 905 [306 P.2d 425].)  \u201cWhere there is substantial evidence to support the findings and order of the commission, the reviewing court may not substitute its views for those of the commission and annul the award. . . .  If the findings . . . are supported by inferences which may fairly be drawn from evidence, even though the evidence is susceptible of opposing inferences the reviewing court will not disturb the award.\u201d <em>(Pacific Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 410, 422-423 [139 P.2d 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">It is true that there were conflicts in the medical evidence: for example, evidence that Bingham\u2019s fatal coronary attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>was hastened by the long continuing pressure of two demanding jobs was directly contradicted by Dr. Eliaser's opinion denying the existence of a causal relationship between stress and coronary heart disease. But the board\u2019s award did not represent a resolution of such conflicts in the evidence; it was expressly and exclusively founded upon Dr. Friedman's report which we have just reviewed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From that report the board concluded that Bingham\u2019s stress was not the result of his employment but \u201cof the personality that he took to the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\">Petitioners contend, in effect, that instead of responding directly to the board\u2019s inquiry whether Bingham\u2019s death was caused by his employment Dr. Friedman gave an erroneous legal opinion: \u201cThis man himself took on the two jobs and I think that he must be considered responsible for his coronary artery disease and not the employers.\u201d We are persuaded by petitioners\u2019 contention.  Entitlement to workmen's compensation benefits is not defeated by a showing of negligence or bad judgment on the part of the employee. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600; <em>Associated Indem. Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 40, 44, 46-47 [112 P.2d 615].) Several passages in Dr. Friedman\u2019s report imply his opinion that the long hours Bingham worked under stress did play a part in causing the fatal attack but that Bingham\u2019s work should be absolved as a causative factor because if he did not have these two jobs he would have had some other and, given his personality, would have driven himself unreasonably in any employment setting. Dr. Friedman\u2019s analysis of causation is inappropriate in a workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding. Not all jobs are as stressful as the two held by Bingham. Moreover, had Bingham been physically disabled he could not have held either of these jobs; had he possessed financial means he would not have needed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In adopting Dr. Friedman\u2019s conclusion as the basis of decision, the board declared that \u201cfor an injury to arise out of and occur in the course of employment, the employment itself must be a positive factor influencing the course of disease.\u201d (Citing <em>California etc. Exchanges. Industrial Acc. Com. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 836 [174 P.2d 680].) But that is not to say that the conditions of employment need be specially hazardous. It is sufficient that the injury be \u201cproximately caused <em>by </em>the employment\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600, subd. (e)) without regard to whether some other factor such as financial necessity or the personality of the employee operates as a previous link in a chain of causation. <em>(Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 492, 496 [175 P.2d 832].) It would not be a defense to a compensation claim made by a workman injured in the more usual type of industrial accident to show that he would not have been present at the job site in order to be injured were it not for financial or other personal motivations that caused him to accept employment. Similarly, it is not a defense that Bingham\u2019s striving personality caused him to continue to perform two demanding and stressful jobs the performance of which, according to the clear implication of Dr. Friedman\u2019s report, hastened his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Where the appeals board\u2019s findings have applied an incorrect test of causation the substantial evidence rule does not prevent review and annulment of the award. <em>(Hawaiian Pineapple Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 656, 664 [255 P.2d 431].) But we have already seen that the evidence as to causation was in conflict; it is therefor not within our powers to substitute our judgment as to an appropriate ultimate disposition for that of the appeals board.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The award is annulled, with directions to take further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Devine, P. J., and Eattigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-5\"> It is true that the opinion after reconsideration recites in passing that \u201cthe Appeals Board has studied the entire record herein\u201d; hut that recital is connected in context only with the hoard's preliminary determination that Dr. Friedman's report was admissible. A fair reading of the entire opinion makes it clear that the result was exclusively based upon Dr. Friedman\u2019s conclusion that the employment was not a \u201clegitimate\u201d cause of hastening Bingham\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
