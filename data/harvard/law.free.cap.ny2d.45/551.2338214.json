The Appellate Division, reversing a ruling that Graphic alone is responsible, held that both Graphic and Bakers must provide coverage. Only Graphic appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The dispute between insurers, submitted on stipulated facts, arises out of a two-vehicle collision in which Wacht, an employee of Chimes Cake Co., sustained personal injuries. Wacht was a passenger in a truck owned by his employer and driven by a coemployee, Carr, when the truck collided ;with a vehicle owned by Armor Elevator Co. and operated by one Jarnatowski. For present purposes it is accepted that both vehicles had been operated negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">There are two issues, each involving limitations in the Graphic automobile policy. The first concerns the exclusion for bodily injury of an employee arising out of employment by the insured. At issue is whether the employer\u2019s vicarious liability for the concurrent negligence of its employee, Carr, is within the exclusion when, on the third-party complaint of a nonemployee joint tort-feasor the employer is subject to comparative or equitable apportionment for injuries sustained by its employee, Wacht (see <em>Dole v Dow Chem. Co., </em>30 NY2d 143, 148-149; CPLR art 14). Assuming such vicarious liability is not one for bodily injury of an employee arising out of employment by the insured, also at issue is whether it is an excluded \"obligation for which the insured * * * may be held liable under\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> There should be an affirmance. An employer\u2019s vicarious or derivative liability to a third-party tort-feasor for the bodily injuries sustained by one employee due to the negligence of a coemployee does not necessarily arise out of employment by the insured. Even though the injured party be an employee, the employer\u2019s obligation to contribute a coemployee\u2019s apportioned share of liability for negligence to a third-party nonemployee joint tort-feasor arises, instead, out of the third party\u2019s independent right to seek comparative or equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ble apportionment under the <em>Dole-Dow </em>doctrine. Nor does the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law require the employer to contribute to the nonemployee joint tort-feasor the share of damages apportioned to the coemployee joint tort-feasor. The conclusion that neither exclusion in the Graphic policy relieves Graphic of its obligation to cover the derivative liability of Chimes, moreover, is in consonance with a functional analysis of separate lines of insurance. It makes sense that an automobile liability policy cover obligations arising out of operation of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Wacht, the injured employee, brought a personal injury action against the owner and operator of the second vehicle, Armor and Jarnatowski, who, in turn, served a third-party complaint on Carr and Chimes. In the third-party claim \"indemnification or contribution\u201d, based on the concurrent negligence of the coemployee Carr and the derivative liability of the owner and employer Chimes, was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">At the time of the collision, Graphic was Chimes\u2019 automobile liability insurer, and Bakers its workers\u2019 compensation and employer liability carrier. To settle a dispute between the two insurers as to which one, under the terms of the insurance policies, was responsible for any judgment against Chimes and Carr, Graphic brought this declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In the interim the underlying tort action by Wacht was settled for $125,000. Seventy-five percent of the settlement was to be paid by Armor and Jarnatowski, and the remaining 25%., or $31,250, by either Graphic or Bakers. As noted, the Appellate Division held that under the terms of their respective policies both insurers were obligated to indemnify Chimes against the third-party claims. Since no appeal has been taken by Bakers, only the obligation of Graphic is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In disclaiming responsibility, Graphic relies on two exclusions in its policy. Paragraphs (d) and (e) provide that the policy does not apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\"(d) under coverage A [bodily injury liability], to bodily injury * * * of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of (1) domestic employment by the insured, if benefits therefor are in whole or in part either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, or (2) other employment by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">\"(e) under coverage A, to any obligation for which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation * * * law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Turning first to paragraph (d), no support is offered or perceived for the conclusion of the Appellate Division that the words \"other employment\u201d refer to incidental or nonregular employment by the insured. In context, the term \"other\u201d in clause (2) serves to include all employees not covered in clause (1), that is, all but domestic employees (see <em>City of Albany v Standard Acc. Ins. Co., </em>7 NY2d 422, 431).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">It is then argued by Graphic that since Chimes\u2019 liability on the third-party claim is ultimately one for bodily injuries sustained by the employee Wacht, it arises out of \"other employment by the insured\u201d and is therefore not covered by the Graphic policy. Paragraph (d), no doubt, relieves the automobile liability carrier from direct liability as an insure for injuries sustained by employees, other than domestics not covered by any workers\u2019 compensation law, whether caused by a stranger or a coemployee (see <em>City of Albany v Standard Acc. Ins. Co., supra, </em>pp 431-433). This accords with the general prohibition of a tort right of action by a covered employee against his employer, or for that matter against his coemployee (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u00a7 11). It does not follow, however, that every liability of the employer triggered somehow by injuries sustained by a covered employee, in this case Wacht, is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The right under the <em>Dole-Dow </em>doctrine to seek equitable apportionment based on relative culpability is not one intended for the benefit of the injured claimant. It is a right affecting the distributive responsibilities of tort-feasors <em>inter sese. </em>(See <em>Dole v Dow Chew. Co., </em>30 NY2d 143, 152-153, <em>supra; </em>CPLR art 14.) It is elementary that injured claimants may still choose which joint tort-feasors to include as defendants in an action and, regardless of the concurrent negligence of others, recover the whole of their damages from any of the particular tort-feasors sued (see <em>Kelly v Long Is. Light. Co., </em>31 NY2d 25, 30; 2A Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 1401:04; McLaughlin, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR 1404:1, p 381). Thus, to urge on behalf of Graphic that the third-party claim against Chimes assumes legally the color of the claim of Wacht does not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Chimes may not be directly liable for injuries sustained by its employee Wacht. It may be, and was, however, liable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a third party for the third party\u2019s suffering liability for negligence concurred in by Chimes\u2019 employee, Carr. So, too, Graphic may not be directly liable for injuries sustained by its insured\u2019s employee, in this case Wacht. But, it is liable for recovery against its insured where the concurrent negligence of its employee Carr exposes the insured to equitable apportionment under the <em>Dole-Dow </em>doctrine at the suit of a joint tort-feasor. This is just as it would have been had a stranger been the injured party in the principal tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">As a practical matter, Graphic should be responsible for the damages paid by Chimes. Applying a functional analysis to separate lines of insurance, and an insurance policy should be read in light of the role it is to play, it makes sense that the automobile liability carrier not exclude from coverage liabilities sustained by the insured owner in connection with operation of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Similarly unavailing is Graphic\u2019s resort to paragraph (e), which excludes \"any obligation for which the insured * * * may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation * * * law\u201d. That Chimes is obligated to Wacht, as a covered employee, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is undisputed. As noted by the Appellate Division, however, the liability at issue is not one owed to Wacht, but to third parties for the apportioned negligence of a coemployee of Wacht. Even though it is an employee who is injured, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not require the employer to contribute to a nonemployee joint tort-feasor the share of damages apportioned to the coemployee tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In sum, then, neither exclusion paragraph relieves Graphic of its responsibility to provide coverage for accidental bodily injuries arising out of Chimes\u2019 ownership of the truck. In thus concluding, there is agreement with the relevant determinations at the Appellate Division and at Special Term, which held Graphic responsible for the equitable apportionment of liability between the third-party tort-feasors and Carr, and, vicariously, Carr\u2019s employer under principles of <em>respondeat superior. </em>There is no necessary agreement with all of their reasoning, or with their comments upon issues not before this court on the present appeal. In passing it is noted that the Appellate Division accurately read the opinion in <em>Rogers v Dorchester Assoc. </em>(32 NY2d 553) as holding that the rule of <em>Dole v Dow Chem. Co. </em>(30 NY2d 143, <em>supra) </em>did not extend to apportionment of liability between one vicariously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>liable and the one primarily liable. Nothing there suggested, however, that the apportionment rule was not applicable as between one vicariously liable and a third-party tort-feasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
