Sometimes they travel by air and settle into lakes, rivers, oceans, and the like. Sometimes pipes dump pollutants directly into those waters. In this case, we consider pollution that reaches surface waters by way of subsurface water, or groundwater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellee-Defendant Kentucky Utilities Company (\"KU\") burns coal to produce\n   energy. It then stores the leftover coal ash in two man-made ponds. The plaintiffs here, two environmental conservation groups, contend that the chemicals in the coal ash are contaminating the surrounding groundwater, which in turn contaminates a nearby lake. They say that this conduct violates two separate federal statutes: the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With their first argument, we disagree. The CWA does not extend liability to pollution that reaches surface waters via groundwater. But RCRA does govern this conduct, and because the plaintiffs have met the statutory rigors needed to bring such a claim, the district court must hear it. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We are tasked with interpreting two federal statutes in this case: the CWA and RCRA. As such, some background information on each statute is a helpful starting point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    CWA.\n   </em>\n   Congress passed the CWA in 1972 with the stated purpose of \"restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the ... Nation's waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). To promote that goal, the CWA forbids all unpermitted polluting of navigable waters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1342(a). In that sense, the statutory scheme is relatively straightforward: get a permit or do not pollute. Those permits are issued pursuant to the statute's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1342.

The discharge of a pollutant is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12)(A). Navigable waters are broadly defined as \"the waters of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(7).

Thus, in order to add a pollutant to the waters of the United States via a conveyance, a permit must first be issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Congress enacted this program as a major overhaul to the CWA's predecessors, the 1948 Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Water Quality Act of 1965. Under those two statutes, liability arose when pollutants in a given body of water exceeded certain levels. Once excess pollution was detected, enforcement authorities had to trace the pollution back to its source. Trouble was, tracing those excess levels back to a particular defendant's actions proved all but impossible-only one prosecution was levied under that regime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 92-414 (1971),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3668, 3672 (\"The record shows an almost total lack of enforcement. Under this procedure, only one case has reached the courts in more than two decades.\"). To remedy that problem, Congress changed its focus from the receiving water to the discharging source.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    at 3675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under [the CWA] the basis of pollution prevention and elimination will be the application of effluent limitations.

As the text makes clear, RCRA is concerned with solid waste management, unlike the CWA, which concerns itself with water pollution. As such, the regulatory reach of RCRA begins and ends with solid waste, and the statute expressly excludes \"industrial discharges which are point sources subject to [NPDES] permits under [the CWA].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206902\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6903(27). So while coal ash is stored and treated in the coal ash ponds, RCRA governs; once the ash pond wastewater is discharged by way of a point source to navigable waters, the CWA kicks in.

Factual Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   KU operates the E.W. Brown Generating Station (\"E.W. Brown\"). E.W. Brown is a coal-burning power plant in Kentucky. Like all similar power plants, E.W. Brown burns coal in order to heat large amounts of water. The water turns into high-pressure steam and is funneled through pipes to a series of turbines connected to generators. The steam's pressure causes the turbines to spin, which, in turn, causes the generators to produce electricity. The steam passes through the turbines where more water is piped in to cool it and convert it back into condensed water. The condensed water then returns back to the start to repeat this cycle. Just as it sounds, the process uses a lot of water-both for power generation and to cool and condense steam. Water is also used to treat the coal waste generated from this process. As a result, most coal-burning power plants sit near bodies of water from which they draw for their power generation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   E.W. Brown is one such plant. It is located West of Kentucky's Dix River and adjacent to Herrington Lake, which was created by damming a portion of the Dix River. Herrington Lake is a large man-made lake, with a 4.6 square-mile footprint and a 35-mile span. It is a popular recreation destination for Kentucky residents. Since 1957, E.W. Brown has taken water from Herrington Lake in order to generate power for nearby residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The problem with burning coal to produce power is that the process also produces ash, or \"coal combustion residuals\" (commonly referred to as \"CCRs\"). Two forms of ash are generated by burning coal: (1) light-weight ash known as \"fly ash\" that is carried through the smokestacks and discharged into the air;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) heavier particles known as \"bottom ash\" that remain at the base of the smokestacks. The bottom ash needs to be removed and disposed of in order to create room for new coal to be burned in the furnaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To dispose of coal ash, KU uses a \"sluice\" system-it combines the ash with lots of water and pipes that wastewater\n   into man-made ponds nearby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once discharged into those ponds, the ash sinks into the banks and the bottoms of the ponds, where it is intended to remain permanently. KU has constructed two ash ponds at E.W. Brown, unceremoniously titled the \"Main Ash Pond\" and the \"Auxiliary Ash Pond.\" The Main Ash Pond has twice been expanded since it was opened and currently stretches 114 acres. It is estimated to house six million cubic yards of coal ash. The Auxiliary Ash Pond was first constructed as a temporary reservoir while KU expanded the Main Ash Pond. It covers 29.9 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiffs, two environmental groups: Sierra Club and Kentucky Waterways Alliance (collectively \"Plaintiffs\"), contend that groundwater flows cause the ash ponds to release pollutants into Herrington Lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Some background on groundwater and its flow is necessary. Groundwater is subsurface water that tends to migrate from high elevation to low elevation. Different subsurface materials allow passage of groundwater at different rates and in different volumes. For example, groundwater can hardly flow through clay, whereas it may pass quickly through fractured rock. Those types of terrain that facilitate groundwater movement-like fractured rock-are known as \"aquifers,\" whereas relatively impermeable terrain-like clay-is known as an \"aquitard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' concern is that the ash ponds are contaminating the nearby groundwater and that this groundwater flows into Herrington Lake, causing excess pollution. The problem is exacerbated, they say, by the fact that the ash ponds sit on top of an aquifer. Specifically, the two ash ponds were built on top of karst terrain. Karst is created when a highly-soluble subsurface rock, often limestone, erodes. This creates a series of caverns, sinkholes, tunnels, and paths. Plaintiffs argue that because the ash ponds sit atop karst terrain, the groundwater flows through it more quickly and more abundantly, thus increasing the rate of pollution into Herrington Lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Coal ash can pollute water with a number of different chemicals including, but not limited to, arsenic, lead, calcium, and boron. What caught Plaintiffs' attention in this case was another of those chemicals: selenium. Plaintiffs hired an ecotoxicology expert to test the water near E.W. Brown and he discovered elevated selenium levels in Herrington Lake and in the groundwater surrounding the coal ash ponds. He also found that the fish in Herrington Lake were already being harmed by the selenium levels. While selenium is healthy (indeed, necessary) in certain small amounts, too much of it can become extremely toxic for fish. Excess selenium accumulates in fish tissue, where it is passed to offspring through a parent's eggs. This can kill developing fish before they hatch or lead to deformities such as misshapen bones once they hatch Those deformities are often lethal. In short, selenium poisoning poses a critical problem for aquatic wildlife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Regulatory Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2011, KU decided to convert its Main Ash Pond into a dry landfill. It submitted its application to do so to the Kentucky Department of Environmental Protection (\"KDEP\") in August 2011. KDEP required KU to monitor the groundwater surrounding the Main Ash Pond before it would issue a landfill permit. In 2013, KU submitted\n   a report based on its testing that showed increased levels of certain chemicals in nearby areas. After reviewing the report, KDEP issued KU a permit to build the landfill, but it withheld the permit KU needed to operate it. To earn the operation permit, KDEP required KU to submit another plan outlining the actions it planned to take to treat contaminated groundwater and prevent further contamination. KU submitted that plan in February 2015 and, over Plaintiffs' objections, KDEP issued KU an operating permit for the landfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Displeased with that outcome, Plaintiffs notified the relevant parties that they intended to sue KU under both the CWA and RCRA. KDEP reviewed Plaintiffs' notice and their corresponding groundwater studies and determined that KU was in violation of its water pollution limits. It issued a Notice of Violation to that effect in January 2017. Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet (the \"Cabinet\") and KU then entered into an \"Agreed Order\" in an effort to address the pollution problem. As required by the Agreed Order, KU submitted a \"Corrective Action Plan\" (\"CAP\") in April 2017. It outlined extensive monitoring that KU was required to conduct in order to track the progress of the pollution coming from the coal ash ponds. If those studies indicated that the pollution was not improving, the CAP contemplated additional remedial measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Unsatisfied, Plaintiffs filed their federal lawsuit in the Eastern District of Kentucky in July 2017. The district court dismissed both of Plaintiffs' claims. First, it rejected Plaintiffs' legal contention that the CWA covers pollution of this sort. Second, it held that Plaintiffs lacked standing on their RCRA claim because it could not redress a claim that was already being remedied by Kentucky's regulatory agencies. Since it concluded that Plaintiffs lacked standing, the district court held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Web. 22 Aug. 2018. But groundwater is none of those things. By its very nature, groundwater is a \"diffuse medium\" that seeps in all directions, guided only by the general pull of gravity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    26\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crown St. Assocs., LLC v.

Conn. July 11, 2017). Thus, it is neither confined nor discrete. And while dye traces can roughly and occasionally track the flow of groundwater, they do not render groundwater \"discernible.\" Indeed, Plaintiffs' own expert explained that when he injected dyes into three different locations from the Main Ash Pond in 2012, only one was recovered. One cannot look at groundwater and discern its precise contours as can be done with traditional point sources like pipes, ditches, or tunnels.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14). For that reason, the CWA's text forecloses an argument that groundwater is a point source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs' spin-off argument-that the karst underlying the coal ash ponds is a point source-fares no better. They contend that the soluble rock has given way to subsurface conduits and pipes, making the groundwater system discernible, confined, and discrete. But this argument still treats the groundwater system as the point source. All that differs between groundwater in the more traditional sense and groundwater in this case is the terrain through which it passes. As noted, some terrain allows for speedier groundwater flow (like karst); some is less conducive (like clay). The only difference is expediency. That groundwater may move more quickly through karst does not change that it is neither discernable, discrete, nor confined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the CWA's text does not support the argument that either groundwater or the karst that carries it is a point source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The CWA's text also forecloses the hydrological connection theory.

The CWA's text suggests otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the guidelines by which a CWA-regulated party must abide-the heart of the CWA's regulatory power-are known as \"effluent limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(11); \u00a7 1314(b). These are caps on the quantities of pollutants that may be discharged from a point source and are prescribed on an industry-by-industry basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1314(b).

The term \"into\" indicates directness.

Thus, for a point source to discharge\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters, it must dump\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   into those navigable waters-the phrase \"into\" leaves no room for intermediary mediums to carry the pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the CWA addresses only pollutants that are added \"\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the CWA requires two things in order for pollution to qualify as a \"discharge of a pollutant\": (1) the pollutant must make its way to a navigable water (2) by virtue of a point-source conveyance. Under the facts of this case, KU is discharging pollutants into the groundwater and the groundwater is adding pollutants to Herrington Lake. But groundwater is not a point source. Thus, when the pollutants are discharged to the lake, they are not coming\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   a point source; they are coming from groundwater, which is a nonpoint-source conveyance. The CWA has no say over that conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Often, proponents of the hydrological connection theory turn to\n   <em>\n    Rapanos v.

Those decisions that base their reasoning on the statute's stated purpose of protecting the nation's waters fail to recognize the CWA's corresponding purpose of fostering cooperative federalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, turning to a statute's purpose is a \"last resort of extravagant interpretation,\" because Congress does not \"pursue[ ] its purpose at all costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    547 U.S. at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).

But it also imposed several textual limitations on the means used to reach that goal. Had it wished to do so, Congress could have prohibited\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   unpermitted discharges of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   pollutants to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   waters. But it did not go so far. Instead, Congress chose to prohibit only the discharge of pollutants to \"\n   <em>\n    navigable\n   </em>\n   waters from any\n   <em>\n    point source\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, Congress did not pursue its stated goal \"at all costs,\" because the CWA precludes federal regulation over non-navigable-water pollution and over nonpoint-source pollution. And the CWA's backdrop illustrates why Congress decided to develop this point-source framework. Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Water Quality Act (the CWA's predecessors), enforcement failed-federal authorities were unable to trace pollution back to polluters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 92-414 (1971),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3668, 3672. In response, Congress revamped the water pollution laws to focus on polluters (through the point-source requirement), rather than pollution. It left the rest to the states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to the CWA's stated purposes, other environmental statutes demonstrate why adopting either of Plaintiffs' theories of liability would be untenable. Specifically, RCRA is designed to work in tandem with other federal environmental protection laws, including the CWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206905\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"The [EPA] shall integrate all provisions of [RCRA] for purposes of administration and enforcement and shall avoid duplication, to the maximum extent practicable, with the appropriate provisions of ...

In that way, RCRA and the CWA are mutually exclusive-if certain conduct is regulated under the CWA and requires an NPDES permit, RCRA does not apply. Were we to read the CWA to cover KU's conduct here, KU's coal ash treatment and\n   storage practices would be exempted from RCRA's coverage. But coal ash is solid waste, and RCRA is specifically designed to cover solid waste.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206903\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6902(a)(1). Reading the CWA so as to remove solid waste management practices from RCRA's coverage is thus problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   What is more problematic, though, is the fact that, pursuant to RCRA, the EPA has issued a formal rule that specifically covers coal ash storage and treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C302\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 21,302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Apr. 17, 2015) (the \"CCR Rule\"). The CCR Rule was designed to regulate, among other things, coal ash ponds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C302\">\n    at 21,303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet because the EPA issued the CCR Rule under RCRA, reading the CWA to cover coal ash ponds would gut the rule. Adopting Plaintiffs' reading of the CWA would mean that any coal ash pond with a hydrological connection to a navigable water would require an NPDES permit, thus removing it from RCRA's coverage and, with it, the CCR Rule. Almost all coal ash ponds sit near navigable waterways because of the large amounts of water needed to operate coal-fired power plants. For this reason, adopting Plaintiffs' interpretation of the CWA would leave the CCR Rule virtually useless. We decline to interpret the CWA in a way that would effectively nullify the CCR Rule and large portions of RCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hibbs v.

Fortunately for Plaintiffs, their complaint also alleges a RCRA violation. But unfortunately for them, the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear that claim. Its reasoning was straightforward-it believed that the state had already implemented a plan designed to address the conduct about which Plaintiffs complained and thus it could not issue separate relief. In other words, the district court perceived that it could not redress the Plaintiffs' problems. Without a redressable claim, Plaintiffs lacked Article III standing, and the district court lacked jurisdiction. On appeal, KU urges us to affirm either because the district court lacked jurisdiction or because abstention was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The motivation behind the district court's decision was sound: states are typically left to regulate their own environments and federal environmental regulatory statutes typically make room for state\n   regulation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206902\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7) (one of RCRA's purposes is to create a \"Federal-State partnership\" wherein the EPA will \"give a high priority to assisting and cooperating with States in obtaining full authorization of State programs\"), \u00a7 6926(b). Since Kentucky was regulating the challenged conduct under Kentucky law (albeit administratively),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ky. Rev.

The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have said no. In two cases today,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the majority says yes. Because the majority's conclusion is contrary to the plain text and history of the CWA, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that Plaintiffs' CWA claim was properly dismissed. Meanwhile, I concur in the majority's determination that the district court erred by dismissing Plaintiffs' claim under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs have invoked the citizen-suit provision of the CWA, which provides that \"any citizen may commence a civil action ... against any person ... who is alleged to be in violation of ... an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"For purposes of this section, the term 'effluent standard or limitation under this chapter' means,\" among other possibilities, \"an unlawful act under subsection (a) of section 1311 of this title.\" \u00a7 1365(f). In turn, \u00a7 1311(a) prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The broad sweep of a defendant's potential CWA liability is limited in two ways. First, Congress included a list of exceptions in \u00a7 1311(a) itself: the discharge of a pollutant is unlawful \"[e]xcept in compliance with this section and sections 1312, 1316, 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1344 of this title.\" Second, Congress gave the phrase \"discharge of a pollutant\" a very specific definition: it means \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A). Taken together, Congress thus authorized citizen suits to prevent the \"addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12)(A), but if a listed statutory exception applies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1311(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The majority argues that this standard cannot be satisfied when, as here, pollution travels briefly through groundwater before reaching a navigable water. Plaintiffs counter that such an exception has no statutory\n   basis and would allow polluters to shirk their CWA obligations by placing their underground drainage pipes a few feet away from the shoreline. This case could have profound implications for those in this Circuit who would pollute our Nation's waters. And the issue is novel. This Court has never before considered whether the CWA applies in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have. Both courts determined that a short journey through groundwater does not defeat CWA liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever v.

The Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion where the pollutants traveled briefly through fields (which are not necessarily point sources) and through the air.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concerned Area Residents for Env't v.

Until today, no Circuit had come out the other way. The reason is simple: the CWA does not require a plaintiff to show that a defendant discharged a pollutant from a point source\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   into navigable waters; a plaintiff must simply show that the defendant \"add[ed] ... any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   any point source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphases added), 1365(a), 1311(a);\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516584\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/637/\">\n    887 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   650 ;\n   <em>\n    Hawai'i Wildlife Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516480,12516479\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/737/\">\n    886 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Supreme Court addressed this precise issue in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos v.

By contrast, the majority's approach defeats the CWA's purpose by opening a gaping regulatory loophole: polluters can avoid CWA liability by discharging their pollutants into groundwater, even if that groundwater flows immediately into a nearby navigable water. This exception has no textual or logical foundation. As one district court observed,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   it would hardly make sense for the CWA to encompass a polluter who discharges pollutants via a pipe running from the factory directly to the riverbank, but not a polluter who dumps the same pollutants\n   into a man-made settling basin some distance short of the river and then allows the pollutants to seep into the river via the groundwater.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

Based on the majority's logic, polluters are free to add pollutants to navigable waters so long as the pollutants travel through any kind of intermediate medium-for example through groundwater, across fields, or through the air. This would seem to give polluters free rein to discharge pollutants from a sprinkler system suspended above Lake Michigan. After all, pollutants launched from such a sprinkler system would travel \"in all directions, guided only by the general pull of gravity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 933.

In cases where, as here, a plaintiff alleges that a defendant is polluting navigable waters through a complex pathway, the court should require the plaintiff to prove the\n   existence of pollutants in the navigable waters and to persuade the factfinder that the defendant's point source is to blame-that the defendant is unlawfully \"add[ing] ... any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

For its textual argument, the majority refers us to the term \"effluent limitations.\" This term, the majority says, is defined as \"restrictions on the amount of pollutants that may be 'discharged from point sources\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters.' \" Maj.

The majority should heed this commonsense advice. Congress did not hide a massive regulatory loophole in its use of the word \"into.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   But more importantly, the majority's quoted definition of \"effluent limitation\" from \u00a7 1362(11) -the supposed origin of the loophole-is not relevant to this case. The citizen-suit provision uses the term \"effluent standard or limitation\"-not the term \"effluent limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). As the majority itself argues, minor distinctions in statutory language sometimes matter. This one does. The phrase \"effluent standard or limitation\" is a term of art and is wholly distinct from the term \"effluent limitation.\" This conclusion is supported not by tea leaves or a carefully selected dictionary, but rather by the CWA itself. The citizen-suit provision of the CWA provides that \"effluent standard or limitation\" means, among other things, \"an unlawful act under subsection (a) of section 1311 of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Turning to \u00a7 1311(a), we find that, absent certain exceptions, \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful,\" \u00a7 1311(a), and the \"discharge of a pollutant\" means \"any addition of any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters from any point source,\" \u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming the majority correctly parses the definition of \"into\"-a dubious proposition at best-the word \"into\" is not contained in any of the statutory provisions at issue. Rather, we find the word \"to,\" which does not even arguably suggest a requirement of directness; the word \"to\" merely \"indicate[s] movement or an action or condition suggestive of movement toward a place, person, or thing reached.\"\n   <em>\n    To\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is therefore entirely unclear why the majority relies on the definition of \"effluent limitation.\" That definition is simply irrelevant to this lawsuit. As a result, the majority's criticisms of the approach taken by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits miss the mark. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit analyzed\n   the correct statutory text when it rejected the argument that the citizen-suit provision requires directness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [t]he plain language of the CWA requires only that a discharge come \"from\" a \"point source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

It is true that\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   dealt with different facts. But it is irrelevant that the pollution in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   traveled through point sources before reaching a navigable water, whereas the pollution in this case allegedly traveled through groundwater, which, according to the majority, is not a point source. In both cases, the legal issue is the same: whether the CWA applies to pollution that travels from a point source to navigable waters through a complex pathway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    547 U.S. at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (asking whether \"the contaminant-laden waters ultimately reach covered waters\").

On this view, the states alone are responsible for regulating pollution of groundwater, even if that pollution later travels to a navigable water. Wrong again. To be sure, the CWA recognizes the \"primary responsibilities and rights of States\" to regulate groundwater pollution.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Maj. Op. at 938. The majority notes that if a polluter's conduct is regulated through a CWA permit, then RCRA does not also apply. The majority therefore suggests that a straightforward reading of the CWA is incompatible with RCRA. The majority would gut the former statute to save the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But the EPA has already dismissed the majority's concern. Indeed, the EPA issued federal regulations on this issue many decades ago. The EPA's interpretation is that the industrial discharge of waste such as CCR is subject to regulation under both RCRA and the CWA: RCRA regulates the way polluters store CCR, and the CWA kicks in the moment CCR enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The EPA first articulated this approach in a set of regulations from 1980, which provide that \"[i]ndustrial wastewater discharges that are point source discharges subject to regulation under section 402 of the Clean Water Act\" \"are not solid wastes for the purpose of\" the RCRA exclusion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). This exclusion, the regulation explains, \"applies only to the\n   <em>\n    actual point source discharge\n   </em>\n   . It does not exclude industrial wastewaters while they are being collected, stored or treated before discharge, nor does it exclude sludges that are generated by industrial wastewater treatment.\" \u00a7 261.4(a)(2) (comment) (emphasis added). Thus, under the EPA's reading, a polluter can be liable under RCRA for improperly storing CCR-even if the CCR never enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, a polluter can be liable under the CWA for adding CCR to a navigable waterway-even if the polluter's storage methods comport with RCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And of course, a polluter can be liable under both statutes if the polluter both improperly stores CCR and discharges it to a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The EPA settled any doubts on this matter by publishing a detailed description of its rationale in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033098\">\n    45 Fed.

The EPA says that imposing CWA liability for the discharge of CCR to navigable waterways does not eliminate the possibility of RCRA liability for the storage and treatment of CCR.

The common denominator between wells, containers, ditches, and vessels is that each is a man-made, defined area where liquid collects.
