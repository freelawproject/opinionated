Through these alleged general partnership interests, each investor/partner would own a fractional interest in the parcels to hold as a speculative investment-in the hopes that the areas where the land was located would become developed and the value of the land would increase. Specifically, Schooler would identify a tract of land, purchase it in the name\n   of his company, and then turn around and mark up the price (often by several multiples of the price originally paid) to sell the land to investors. Schooler sold interests in a general partnership to the investors that would collectively hold the land (typically with several other general partnerships). Schooler marketed these general partnership interests to individuals across the United States and ultimately sold 3,400 such interests over the lifetime of the operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, the SEC brought suit asserting a host of federal securities law violations. The SEC sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) and the appointment of a receiver. The district court granted a TRO and eventually converted the order to a preliminary injunction. The parties litigated the case through summary judgment, where the district court granted the SEC's summary judgment motions and denied Schooler's.

The district court primarily rested its decision on the fact that investors placed their money with Schooler significantly before their general partner interests (and associated powers) became effective. The district court characterized this circumstance as complying with the first\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   factor, but it also noted that, whether this fact fit squarely within the first factor, it nonetheless found it to be an important other factor establishing dependence on Schooler. The district court also analyzed the second and third\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   factors but ultimately concluded that, although the SEC had submitted significant undisputed facts to support these factors, the record was not sufficient to establish these factors as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court treated each of the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   factors as an issue for summary judgment. However, the\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   factors are not in fact distinct \"claims\" or \"issues\" that need be decided individually for summary judgment purposes. These factors are simply heuristics useful in answering the ultimate question of whether a general partnership interest should be considered an investment contract for purposes of federal securities laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Even giving Schooler the benefit of all reasonable inferences, the collective force of the following undisputed facts identified by the district court establish as a matter of law that the general partnership interests in this case were securities under federal law. First, the facts establish beyond dispute that Louis Schooler, personally and through Western, exercised near total control over the investments between receipt of investor payments and execution of the partnership agreements. Unlike a traditional general partnership, the partnership agreements in this case were not effective upon delivery of investor funds. Rather, the agreement stated that it became effective upon the date identified (and intentionally left blank) on the first page of the partnership agreement. Because the agreements were not yet effective, investors had no power to control their investments during this period. Yet, it was during this precise time that nearly all meaningful decisions were made that would determine the success or failure of the investment. Schooler controlled how many interests to market and sell in each partnership, diluting the power of partners by selling a large number of interests in each general partnership. Schooler determined the properties to purchase and the price the partnerships would pay. He determined how many different general partnerships to include as co-tenants of a single property. Likewise, Schooler determined when to close the final partnership and establish the co-tenancy arrangements. During this critical period, 93% of the investors' money was expended-without any opportunity for investor input or control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By the time Schooler executed the partnerships by filling in the effective date, there was little that could be done to determine the success or failure of the investment. At the time of execution, general partners were transferred fractional interests in land and could do little more than hope that the land would appreciate in value substantially more than the ongoing maintenance expenses Schooler charged. An investment in land for long-term holding is inherently speculative, as expressly noted in the partner representations. Nonetheless, decisions about what property to purchase and how much to pay for it are among the most important decisions in determining the success of the investment. In this scheme, general partners had no real control over these decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, once the partnership agreements were executed and co-tenancies established, Louis Schooler acknowledges that it was \"potentially unworkable\" for partners to exercise their powers to jointly manage the parcels. Louis Schooler and his associates at Western meanwhile exercised all practical authority in the operation of the partnership, having defaulted authority to themselves and hand-picked signatory partners. From the viewpoint of investors, this passive arrangement was what many expected-having been lured in by the promise of Schooler's expertise in finding parcels and directing when they should be sold. Under these circumstances the SEC made a clear showing that investors \"were prevented from exercising their powers\" as general partners.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matek v. Murat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825537\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/720/#p731\">\n    862 F.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731-32 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding a general partnership not a security where no practical impairment to exercising partnership authority had been shown),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koch v.

But there is an obvious flaw in this argument-the effective date was on the very first page of the partnership agreement and it unambiguously articulated that the agreement\n   (including all of the shared authority and control) did not become effective until the date indicated (and originally left blank). Nothing in the California code overrides the parties' express agreement that the partnership not begin until the date identified on the face of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016101\">\n    Cal.

Instead, he again articulates that the offerings occurred over a long period of time and makes additional arguments unrelated to any of the factors. Accordingly, he has waived argument on this issue.\n   <em>\n    Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526741\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/971/#p977\">\n    28 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court correctly determined that all but the timing factor weighed in favor of finding an integrated offering. All of the offerings were used to finance Western's acquisition of land for the partnerships, each involved the issuance of general partner interests in exchange for cash, and all were for the purpose of holding real estate in hope of subsequent appreciation.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   supports\n   the district court's conclusion that all sales were part of an integrated offering even though the offerings were not made at the same time,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651515\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/633/\">\n    626 F.2d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Schooler identifies no authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, Schooler presents no due process violation. Schooler argues that his due process rights were violated by the district court's decision to amend its order after the SEC filed an amended summary judgment motion. This argument fails because the parties had full opportunity to brief and argue the only issue on which the district court amended its opinion-who bears the burden of producing sufficient facts to establish a genuine issue for trial on exemptions. Schooler can establish no prejudice, because he does not argue that the district court's resolution of this legal issue was erroneous. Without prejudice, Schooler has not established a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Am.

By not raising it before the district court, Schooler waived this issue for appeal.\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Burt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191511\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/927/#p931\">\n    141 F.3d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 931 (9th Cir.1998) (deeming issues not raised before the district court to be waived). Moreover, Schooler's briefing fails to identify any basis for excusing the waiver. We will not make arguments for him.\n   <em>\n    Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526741\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/971/#p977\">\n    28 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the merits, the defense likewise fails because \"Section 5 is a strict liability statute\" so \"good faith reliance on counsel\" cannot \"preclude liability under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v. CMKM Diamonds, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701065\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/1248/#p1255\">\n    729 F.3d 1248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 n.6 (9th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lastly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the SEC on its claims under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. To establish this violation, the SEC must demonstrate that Schooler made a materially misleading misrepresentation or omission in connection with the offer or sale of a security in interstate commerce and with the requisite scienter.\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Phan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20F.3d%20895\">\n    500 F.3d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907-08 (9th Cir. 2007). The district court correctly concluded that the SEC established these elements based on the undisputed evidence that Schooler represented to investors that the value of the \"Stead property\" was $2.50 per square foot. Instead, Western had recently purchased the property for $0.40 per square foot and the property was appraised at just under $1.00 per square foot (when the value of water rights was taken into account). This misrepresentation was \"so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality.\"\n   <em>\n    TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n    426 U.S. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178202\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/438/#p450\">\n    48 L.Ed.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Schooler's only defense is good faith reliance on the advice of counsel. Yet, the district court concluded that Schooler had failed to meet his burden in establishing his defense with respect to the Stead property. Specifically, the court found no evidence to establish that Schooler \"made a complete disclosure to counsel\" by informing counsel that their advertising included representations as to the fair market value of particular parcels.\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Goldfield Deep Mines Co. of Nev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311828\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/459/#p467\">\n    758 F.2d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 (9th Cir. 1985) (identifying complete disclosure as an element of the affirmative defense of reliance on counsel). On appeal, Schooler cites no record evidence\n   to rebut the district court's finding. Schooler's cited pages make the conclusory assertion that disclosure was complete, but they do not identify any evidence to support the conclusory allegation. Accordingly, we affirm entry of summary judgment for the SEC on the securities fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment against Louis Schooler with only two exceptions acknowledged by the SEC.
