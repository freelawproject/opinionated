Likewise, Land of Lincoln owed millions to HHS. As part of its regulatory oversight, HHS has elected to set off its own debt payments by first paying down Land of Lincoln's debt. The Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance, who is Land of Lincoln's appointed liquidator, contends that this setoff violates an order issued by the Illinois court overseeing the liquidation proceedings that prevents any creditors from setting\n   off money owed to Land of Lincoln without prior leave of the court. The Director asked the state court for a declaration that HHS violated the order, but HHS removed the motion to federal district court arguing that the federal government was not subject to the state court's jurisdiction. The district court remanded the case back to state court relying on a narrow reading of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as principles of abstention. We reverse on both grounds and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case centers on debts in the Affordable Care Act's three premium-stabilization programs-the Risk Adjustment, Risk Corridor, and Reinsurance programs-all of which were designed to redistribute money among insurance companies and thereby mitigate each company's exposure to risks in the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018061\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 18063. For the purposes of this appeal, the parties broadly agree that HHS intended to implement these programs in a budget-neutral way paying out only the funds that each program had taken in from other insurance companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Land of Lincoln participated in these premium-stabilization programs and incurred a debt of roughly $32 million in the Risk Adjustment program. This debt, though large, should not have been a problem for the company, as HHS owed Land of Lincoln over $70 million, the bulk of which it owed under the Risk Corridor program. The government, however, was not able to pay what it owed because it was taking in far less money than it had expected, and it refused to dip into its limited discretionary funds. Like other insurance companies, Land of Lincoln sought the overdue Risk Corridor payments in a suit with the Court of Federal Claims, but it was rebuffed,\n   <em>\n    Land of Lincoln Mut.

By late 2016, Land of Lincoln was incapable of paying its Risk Adjustment debt, and thus became insolvent and began rehabilitation proceedings that turned into a liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As part of the liquidation, the Chancery Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County-one of two Illinois courts empowered to oversee insurance rehabilitation and liquidation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   215 ILCS 5/199 -entered an order naming the Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance as liquidator,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   215 ILCS 5/191, and prohibited all of Land of Lincoln's creditors, including any \"governmental entity,\" from \"setting off or netting monies owed Land of Lincoln without the prior leave of this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   215 ILCS 5/189. Despite this order and the Director's protestations, HHS began to offset its overdue payments against Land of Lincoln's debt in the Risk Adjustment program, as its own regulations permitted,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20156.1215\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). HHS has since withheld $27 million in payments that it put toward Land of Lincoln's debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   HHS's refusal to comply led the Director to move the state court for a declaratory judgment finding that HHS was in violation of the court's order. In the motion, the Director asserted that she \"is not asking at this point that [HHS] be ordered to release the funds or pay them over to the estate,\" and instead she hoped that the declaration would lead HHS to follow the order of its own accord. In the event HHS did not choose to comply, the Director expressly asked for \"leave to seek an appropriate remedy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   HHS removed the Director's motion to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal officer removal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that permits \"[t]he United States or any agency thereof\" to remove a \"civil action ... that is commenced in a State court and that is against or directed to\" the agency. Because the full liquidation proceeding in the Chancery Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County was not removable, HHS relied on \u00a7 1442(d)(1), which permits an agency to remove, separate from the entire case, \"any proceeding (whether or not ancillary to another proceeding) to the extent that in such proceeding a judicial order, including a subpoena for testimony or documents, is sought or issued.\" Shortly after removal, HHS filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss under the doctrine of \"derivative jurisdiction,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodas v. Seidlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n    656 F.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615-16 (7th Cir. 2011), arguing that the state court lacked jurisdiction over the United States. In its motion, HHS argued that because the United States had not waived its sovereign immunity, the federal court could not hear the case except as an original suit. The Director responded by moving to remand the case back to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court granted the Director's motion to remand. Relying on the legislative history surrounding \u00a7 1442(d)(1), the district court concluded that Congress had not aimed that provision toward this sort of motion for declaratory relief, but instead Congress was concerned, principally, with removal of actions \"pertaining to pre-suit discovery and specifically those affecting Federal officers.\" Because the district court thought it necessary to construe the statute strictly against removal, it determined that it lacked removal jurisdiction over this motion, which neither related to discovery nor involved an officer. The district court then certified its remand order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; N.D. ILL. L.R. 81.2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   HHS filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied mainly because HHS had only rehashed its earlier arguments for removal, which the district court already had thoroughly addressed. At that time, the district court also bolstered its decision to remand explaining that even if it had erred in remanding on statutory grounds, it would have exercised its discretion to remand under the abstention doctrine first set forth in\n   <em>\n    Burford v. Sun Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    319 U.S. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366586\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/315/\">\n    87 L.Ed. 1424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943). In the district court's view, removal of this motion would be disruptive to the state's efforts to establish a uniform rehabilitation system centralized in specialized state courts. The district court further concluded that federal policy favoring state regulation of insurance-codified in the McCarran-Ferguson Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201012\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -also favored abstention. Again, the district court certified its remand order, and, that same day, the state court began to schedule briefing on the Director's motion for declaratory relief. HHS timely appealed from the order denying its motion to reconsider, and we expedited the appeal to minimize the uncertainty surrounding the state court's jurisdiction to proceed on the Director's declaratory relief motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin, as we must, with our jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.H.

Because the remand order in this case is reviewable, the certification of the remand order imposes no independent bar on either our jurisdiction or the district court's jurisdiction.

Removal under \u00a7 1442 creates an exception to the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule and allows removal of a case that presents a federal question beyond the narrow confines of the complaint, including a case in which an officer or agency can raise a \"colorable\" federal defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Cty. v.

Because the motion for declaratory relief neither related to discovery nor affected an individual federal officer, and the district court considered itself duty-bound to construe the removal statute narrowly, the court concluded that the motion for declaratory relief was not an \"ancillary proceeding,\" and therefore not a \"civil action,\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1442.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, HHS argues that the district court erred in narrowly construing \u00a7 1442(d)(1).

The definition of \"civil action\" is independent of the nature of the party removing. Section 1442(a) uses the term \"civil action\" only once to refer to all the different entities and persons that may remove a case under the section, including individual officers, persons acting under those officers, federal agencies, and the United States itself. Due to this drafting choice, the text of the statute gives no reason to believe that the phrase \"civil action\" should have different meanings depending on whether the defendant is an officer or an agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The text of the statute also gives no reason to limit removal only to discovery disputes. The statute applies to any proceeding seeking a \"judicial order,\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   a subpoena for testimony or documents.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added).

Accordingly, the only question is whether the Director is seeking a judicial order, and we are certain she is because her request is for a \"declaratory judgment or order\" per 735 ILCS 5/2-701.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because the Director seeks an order declaring her right to money withheld by HHS, her motion requesting that order is an \"ancillary proceeding\" and, therefore, a \"civil action\" within the plain text of \u00a7 1442. There is no need then to delve into the legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517995\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/720/#p725\">\n    898 F.3d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725-26 (7th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, the motion for declaratory relief is also \"against or directed\" to HHS within the meaning of \u00a7 1442. The district court correctly recognized that the liquidation of Land of Lincoln (as a whole) was not a civil action \"against or directed to\" HHS, or any other part of the federal government. The government merely has an interest in the proceeding that does not, inherently, make it a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rural Elec. Convenience Co-op Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542975\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/429/#p434\">\n    922 F.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434-35 (7th Cir. 1991). The Director contends that this ends the inquiry. If Congress wanted to allow agencies to remove only portions of proceedings, the Director reasons, it could have worded\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as it did in \u00a7 1452(a), which allows removal of \"any claim or cause of action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Director's position has two faults. First, it wrenches the district court's reasoning from its context. As the court correctly explained, \"removal could only be proper if contemplated as arising from an ancillary proceeding [and] Section 1442(a) does not otherwise provide that DHHS can remove the action as a non-ancillary proceeding.\" This part of the district court's analysis is correct because this case is removable only if it is an ancillary proceeding. The district court erred solely in its determination that this case was not an ancillary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, we cannot ignore the plain meaning of the statute because Congress could have, arguably, made the statute's meaning even plainer. (Though we also question the Director's premise and doubt that the language in \u00a7 1452 would be clearer in this context because a motion is not a \"claim or cause of action,\" but it does seek a \"judicial order.\") Regardless, \"[t]he mere possibility of clearer phrasing cannot defeat the most natural reading of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Caraco Pharm.

The language governing removal of ancillary proceedings states that \"[i]f removal is sought for a proceeding described in the previous sentence, and there is no other basis of removal,\n   <em>\n    only that proceeding may be removed to the district court\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added). If \"only\" some portion of a proceeding is removable, then that necessarily implies that other portions of that proceeding are not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516173\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/269/\">\n    884 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273 n.8. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that any other reading of the statute would \"create an incentive for forum shopping\" and make the availability of a federal forum unduly dependent on the manner by which a litigant chooses to challenge federal action-whether in an independent suit or through a motion ancillary to some other claim.\n   <em>\n    Goncalves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275819\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1237/#p1249\">\n    865 F.3d at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having concluded that the statute allows removal of only part of a proceeding, we turn to whether the Director's motion is \"against or directed to\" HHS. That much is plain from the fact that the Director served HHS with a notice of the Director's motion, and HHS must respond to the motion. That the Director may eventually ask the court to order HHS to produce the withheld money only bolsters this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We also agree with HHS that it has alleged a colorable federal defense. HHS specifically argues that the Director's motion cannot proceed because it has not waived its sovereign immunity. It asked the district court to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and now asks this court to do so in the district court's stead. To conclude that removal was proper, we need find only a \"colorable\" or \"plausible\" federal defense, because removal is \"concerned with who makes the ultimate determination, not what that determination will be.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruppel v.

Regarding the first factor, the district court viewed the case as arising principally under state law with HHS raising only federal law defenses. Next, the district court gave great weight to Illinois's interest in maintaining a uniform liquidation process and found that removal (and dismissal) of this case would disrupt\n   that uniform process and lead to piecemeal litigation. Because the state court is competent to interpret federal law, the district court reasoned that the federal government's interest in removal was minimal. Also, the district court recognized that Illinois's provision concentrating liquidation proceedings to only two specific chancery courts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   215 ILCS 5/199, sufficed to create a special forum.

The determination of that question would necessarily require a court to answer antecedent federal questions, including, most importantly, whether the federal agency enjoys sovereign immunity preventing the state court from deciding the state-law question in the first place.

Accordingly, the district court's recognition that \"HHS seeks only to raise federal defenses,\" was a reason to exercise jurisdiction, not to relinquish it.

In contrast, the Director points us to no case in which a court of appeals has affirmed abstention of a case removed under \u00a7 1442, and we have not found one. Nevertheless, we need not declare an inviolable rule because a presumptive one will suffice. A federal court should not abstain, absent the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, when the federal government has properly removed a case under \u00a7 1442.\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647607\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/483/#p496\">\n    644 F.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a federal court's ability to abstain from exercising federal jurisdiction 'is the exception, not the rule,' and can be justified only in exceptional circumstances.\") (citations omitted).

It is the opposite because the Director is asking the state court to interfere with a complex federal regulatory system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Critically, the budget-neutral nature of the premium-stabilization programs-in particular the Risk Adjustment program in which Land of Lincoln owed money-means that HHS has already distributed the money it offset to other insurance companies which, like Land of Lincoln, needed that money to maintain solvency. HHS informs this court that there are more than twenty insurance companies throughout the country that are in rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings and whose debts HHS has been offsetting to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Exposing HHS's actions-whether lawful or not-to the inconsistent decisions of so many different state fora could have dire consequences for the complex regulatory framework of the Affordable Care Act, if not the insurance market as a whole. The federal government's interest in the relative uniformity of the federal courts is substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In contrast, we do not see how removal of this case will disrupt the liquidation in Illinois court. The court can continue to freely distribute Land of Lincoln's assets to creditors according to the state's priority scheme, albeit with $27 million less to distribute for now. The Director is justifiably worried that this money may not be distributed to Illinois policyholders if this case were removed. This is a lofty concern, and we do not disparage the Director's\n   desire to protect the people of her state. Nonetheless, whether the money ultimately goes to the benefit of the people of Illinois is a question of substantive law.

The Director is correct that Illinois courts must respect federal law to the same extent as federal courts, but, especially given the policy favoring removal of federal defenses in \u00a7 1442, there is no reason to prefer the state court to the federal court to resolve this same substantive question.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prop. &amp; Cas.

Moreover, unlike the danger in non-uniform treatment of HHS's offsets among the several state court systems, there is negligible impact on the uniformity of the liquidation if HHS removes this case on a sovereign immunity defense. The need for uniform treatment implies that the parties are similarly situated, but Land of Lincoln's other creditors and debtors are not the federal government. We said in\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   that \"where similar suits would not be disruptive of the rehabilitation process, a federal court would have to hear the case.\" 913 F.3d at 426. If the federal government, in its unique posture as a sovereign, can remove this case and jump in line, there is no implication from that conclusion that other creditors could do the same, thereby disrupting and diminishing the whole estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The McCarran-Ferguson Act does not change our analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Hartford\n   </em>\n   , we relied on the Act to abstain from deciding \"the amount and existence of liability that an insolvent Illinois insurer owes to Hartford.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534192\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/419/\">\n    913 F.2d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, both the amount and the existence of liability are federal questions and they are not in dispute.

We also think the district court was wise to reject the Director's argument that the Act prohibited removal outright. The courts of appeals have consistently rejected the argument that the Act prohibits diversity removal of insurance-related claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ESAB Grp., Inc. v.

The district court, in the first instance, must evaluate HHS's sovereign immunity to the Director's motion, as well as the propriety of dismissal under the doctrine of derivative jurisdiction, which despite its name is \"a procedural bar to the exercise of federal judicial power\" and does not go to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Rodas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n    656 F.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Director could, if she so chooses, amend her motion for declaratory relief to constitute a proper complaint that engages with the federal court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n    at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a modification would cut out the intermediate step between dismissal of this case and the filing of a new one, and HHS itself admits that an action seeking relief other than money damages could proceed in the district court under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C \u00a7 702, which waives the United States's sovereign immunity to declaratory relief in the federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On the other extreme from HHS's request that we dismiss the case outright, the Director argues that under any circumstance this case belongs in state court, even if it is removable, the district court erred in abstaining, and the doctrine of derivative jurisdiction bars the case. She relies principally on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which requires a district court to remand if at any time it determines it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Section 1447(c) does not apply to this case by its own terms. Although HHS made the error of filing its motion to dismiss for lack of derivative jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), we have already explained that derivative jurisdiction is not an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n    656 F.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the entire principle behind derivative jurisdiction is that that the case was not \"properly constructed\" because it was brought in the wrong forum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831886\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/610/#p615\">\n    at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Remanding to a forum deemed wrong is nonsensical. Even if we believe the state court would be duty-bound to dismiss the case, the Director's procedural mechanism for reaching that result would undermine the strong federal interest in having federal defenses adjudicated in a federal forum regardless of their ultimate merit. Just as a losing federal\n   defense may be resolved in federal court, so too must a winning defense that leads to a situation in which \"[t]he suit would be removed only to be dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Willingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771705\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/402/#p407\">\n    395 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771705\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/402/#p407\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because we base our holding on the conclusion that HHS's claim of sovereign immunity is only \"plausible,\" we leave to the district court the final evaluation of the defense. The parties framed this question as primarily concerned with whether this motion is\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   , but failed to fully explore the consequences of this antecedent issue, and in particular the limits of \"the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Goncalves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275819\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/1237/#p1249\">\n    865 F.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. $79,123.49 in U.S. Cash &amp; Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1763335\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/830/94/#p97\">\n    830 F.2d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (7th Cir. 1987) ;\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk Heating\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621272\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/530/154/#p158\">\n    530 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   157 ; 13F CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 3631 (3d ed.).

Though we have concluded that it is plausible that this removed motion for declaratory relief is not entirely\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   for several reasons, if the district court finds otherwise, then it must determine whether the state court has prior jurisdiction over the same\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   . If both actions are\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   , the court must dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction independent of any abstention principal or the validity of removal. But if one of the two cases is not\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    quasi in rem\n   </em>\n   , there is no jurisdictional bar and the case should stay in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141653\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/314/549/#p554\">\n    314 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141653\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/314/549/#p554\">\n    62 S.Ct. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Kline v.

Though the Director cites\n   <em>\n    Fabe\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the United States may, if it so chooses, submit its claims to a state liquidation proceeding without undermining its sovereign immunity, we note that even in that case the question presented to the Supreme Court originated in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11654\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/491/#p508\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11654\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/491/#p508\">\n    at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525632,11654\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2202/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
