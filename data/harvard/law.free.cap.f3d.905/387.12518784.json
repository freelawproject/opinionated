The district court granted summary judgment for Defendants on the grounds that time related to security checks is not compensable as \"hours worked\" under Nevada and Arizona labor law. Because we conclude that time spent undergoing mandatory security checks is compensable under Nevada law, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment with regard to the Nevada claims and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings.

(\"Integrity\"), provides warehouse labor services to businesses throughout the United States where hourly workers fill orders, track merchandise, and process returns. Integrity employs thousands of hourly warehouse employees like Plaintiffs at each of Defendant Amazon.com's (\"Amazon\") facilities. Some Plaintiffs in this case were hourly employees of Integrity at warehouses in Nevada and Arizona. Other Plaintiffs were directly employed by Amazon. According to Plaintiffs, \"Amazon.com exercises direct control over the hours and other working conditions of all Plaintiffs and all similarly-situated hourly shift employees\n   who are paid on the payroll of Integrity working at all Amazon.Com's [sic] warehouse locations nationwide.\" (R. 134, Third Amended Compl., PageID # 2351.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case concerns a security clearance policy that is enforced by both Integrity and Amazon at all Amazon locations throughout the United States. Under the policy, Plaintiffs and all other hourly paid, non-exempt employees were required to \"undergo a daily security clearance check at the end of each shift to discover and/or deter employee theft of the employer's property and to reduce inventory 'shrinkage.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The policy worked like this: \"At the end of their respective shifts, hundreds, if not thousands, of warehouse employees would walk to the timekeeping system to clock out and were then required to wait in line in order to be searched for possible warehouse items taken without permission and/or other contraband.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 2352.) Plaintiffs allege that \"Defendants' policy of requiring hourly warehouse employees to undergo a thorough security clearance before being released from work and permitted to leave the employer's property was solely for the benefit of the employers and their customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 2351.) Plaintiffs further allege that this screening process took approximately 25 minutes each day. Plaintiffs were also required to undergo the same security clearance prior to taking their lunch breaks, thereby reducing the full thirty-minute break they were supposed to receive. Because employees were required to \"clock out\" before undergoing the security screening, they were not compensated for their time spent waiting in line for and then undergoing the screenings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 2351, 2352.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action in the District Court of Nevada against Integrity on behalf of similarly situated employees in the Nevada warehouses for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FLSA\") and Nevada labor laws. The employees alleged that they were entitled to compensation under the FLSA for the time spent waiting to undergo and actually undergoing the security screenings. They also alleged that the screenings were conducted \"to prevent employee theft\" and thus occurred \"solely for the benefit of the employers and/or their customers.\" (R. 30-3, First Amended Compl., PageID # 223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' first amended complaint for failure to state a claim, holding that the time spent waiting for and undergoing the security screenings was not compensable under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Busk v. Integrity Staffing Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:10-cv-01854,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202971265\">\n    2011 WL 2971265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Nev. July 19, 2011). It explained that, because the screenings occurred after the regular work shift, the employees could state a claim for compensation only if the screenings were an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities they were employed to perform. The district court held that these screenings were not integral and indispensable, but instead fell into a noncompensable category of postliminary activities. As for Plaintiffs' Nevada state law claims for unpaid wages arising from the security checks and shortened meal periods, the Nevada district court found that Plaintiffs had properly asserted a private cause of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20608.140\">\n    Nev.

The Ninth Circuit asserted that\n   post-shift activities that would ordinarily be classified as noncompensable postliminary activities are nevertheless compensable as integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activities if those post-shift activities are necessary to the principal work performed and done for the benefit of the employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/525/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/525/\">\n    at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting as true the allegation that Integrity required the security screenings to prevent employee theft, the court concluded that the screenings were \"necessary\" to the employees' primary work as warehouse employees and done for Integrity's benefit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/525/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/525/\">\n    at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that the time related to the security checks was not compensable under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs asserted their claims as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the following persons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Nevada Class\n   </strong>\n   : All person [sic] employed by Defendants, and/or each of them, as hourly paid warehouse employees who worked for Defendant(s) within the State of Nevada at anytime [sic] within three years prior to the original filing date of the complaint in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Arizona Class\n   </strong>\n   : All person [sic] employed by Defendants, and/or each of them, as hourly paid warehouse employees who worked for Defendant(s) within the State of Arizona at any time from within three years prior to the filing of the original complaint until the date of judgment after trial, and shall encompass all claims by such persons for the entire tenure of their employment as provided in A.R.S. 23-364 (G).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (R. 134, Third Amended Compl., PageID # 2353.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Nevada plaintiffs allege claims on behalf of themselves and the Nevada Class for failing to pay for all the hours worked ( NRS \u00a7 608.016 ), daily and weekly overtime ( NRS \u00a7 608.018 ), and a minimum wage claim under the Nevada Constitution ( Nev. Const. art. 15, \u00a7 16 ). The Nevada plaintiffs seek continuation wages in the amount of 30-days of additional wages for failing to pay employees all their wages due and owing at the time of separation from employment ( NRS \u00a7 608.020 -.050). The Arizona plaintiffs allege claims on behalf of themselves and the Arizona Class for failing to pay regular and minimum wages ( A.R.S. \u00a7 23-363 ).

The district court dismissed the Nevada claims on three grounds: first, there was no private right of action to assert claims under Nevada's wage-hour statutes, NRS Chapter 608; second, Nevada law incorporated the FLSA in relevant part and Plaintiffs' Nevada state claims were barred by Nevada's incorporation of the Portal-to-Portal Act and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Busk\n   </em>\n   ; and third, Plaintiffs' claims for minimum wages failed because they failed to identify any workweek in which they were paid less than the minimum wage. The district court concluded the same with respect to the Arizona claims, holding that Arizona impliedly adopted the Portal-to-Portal Act and thus Plaintiffs \"have not demonstrated that they are entitled to compensation under Arizona law for time spent undergoing, or waiting to undergo, security screenings.\" (R. 236, Order, PageID # 4702.) The court also concluded that Arizona minimum wage claims failed because Plaintiffs had failed to identify a particular workweek in which they were paid less than the minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The determinative factor is always whether the Legislature intended to create a private judicial remedy. We conclude that the Legislature intended to create a private cause of action for unpaid wages pursuant to NRS 608.140.

It concluded that Nevada had adopted the Portal-to-Portal Act because Plaintiffs were unable to \"identify any Nevada law that is irreconcilable with the Portal-to-Portal Act.\" (R. 236, Order PageID # 4695.) The district court reasoned that because Nevada and Arizona wage-hour statutes do not define \"work,\" it must turn to the federal law for a determination of what is \"compensable work\" and this included the Portal-to-Portal Act.

Upon closer examination, however, they are entirely distinct. The first is NRS \u00a7 608.200, which limits the 8-hour work requirement to \"time actually employed in the mine and does not include time consumed for meals or travel into or out of the actual worksite.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20608.200\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 608.200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, significantly, this provision applies only to mineworkers, and it includes no mention of \"preliminary\" and \"postliminary\" activities. The second is NAC \u00a7 608.130, which generally provides payment for travel and training but excludes time the employee spends traveling between work and home.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20608.130\">\n    Nev. Admin. Code \u00a7 608.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b). This regulation also omits any reference to \"preliminary\" and \"postliminary\" activities. Thus, neither of these provisions can be read to imply that the Nevada legislature intended to adopt the Portal-to-Portal Act. Indeed, if it had adopted the Act, there would be no need to pass NRS \u00a7 608.200 or for the Commissioner to issue the regulation \u00a7 608.130(2)(b) to exclude time spent traveling to or from a place of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants make multiple references to places where Nevada wage-hour law parallels the FLSA, and they refer the Court to cases holding that Nevada courts will interpret\n   a provision of Nevada law the same as its parallel provision in the FLSA. None of that is surprising. But this reasoning is simply irrelevant where Nevada law has no provision parallel to a particular FLSA provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants also argue that \"there is no Nevada law ... obviating the Portal-to-Portal amendments to the FLSA.\" (Brief for Appellees at 23.) True enough. But there is no reason to think such a law would be necessary. Instead, the Nevada legislature has chosen not to affirmatively adopt the law anywhere in the Nevada state code. If, at some point, the Nevada legislature decides to explicitly incorporate the Portal-to-Portal Act into its Code, it can do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Furthermore, despite the apocalyptic implications that Defendants seem to believe rejecting the Portal-to-Portal Act in the state of Nevada would have, both California and Washington have declined to incorporate it into their state codes and they seem to be doing fine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Morillion v.

Arizona\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As for Arizona, Plaintiffs argue that it too has not \"adopted the Portal-to-Portal Act or any comparable legislation.\" (Brief for Appellants at 13.) The district court, however, held that \"[t]he Arizona plaintiffs' claims fail for similar reasons\" as the Nevada plaintiffs, (R. 236, Order, PageID # 4699), namely, that Plaintiffs were unable to \"identify any [Arizona] law that is irreconcilable with the Portal-to-Portal Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4695.) As with the Nevada claims, Plaintiffs' argument is that there is no evidence that the Arizona legislature adopted the Act. Indeed, nothing in the Arizona code seems to parallel or incorporate the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Arizona law also seems inconsistent with the Portal-to-Portal Act. For instance, the Industrial Commission\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   has promulgated regulations that state that \"no less than the minimum wage shall be paid for\n   <em>\n    all hours worked\n   </em>\n   , regardless of the frequency of payment and regardless of whether the wage is paid on an hourly, salaried, commissioned, piece rate, or any other basis.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Admin. Code R20-5-1206(A) (emphasis added). And as explained above, \"hours worked\" is defined under Arizona law as \"all hours for which an employee covered under the Act is employed and required to give the employer, including\n   <em>\n    all time during which an employee is on duty or at a prescribed work pace and all time the employee is suffered or permitted\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to work\n   </em>\n   .\" Ariz. Admin. Code R.20-5-1202(9) (emphasis added). And \"on duty,\" means \"time spent working or waiting that the employer controls and that the employee is not permitted to use for the employee's own purpose.\" Ariz. Admin. Code R20-5-1202(12). Plaintiffs thus characterize the Arizona Commission's definitions as creating something of an \" 'anti' portal-to-portal act.\" (Brief for Appellants at 29.) Whether or not this is a fair characterization, the language of the regulations strongly suggests that Arizona law is more inclusive than the Portal-to-Portal Act in the types of work it compensates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants point to an advisory statement from the Commission as evidence that Arizona has adopted the FLSA. As cited by Defendants, that statement reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   For purposes of enforcement and implementation of [the Arizona Wage Act], in interpreting and determining \"hours worked\" under this Act ... the Industrial Commission of Arizona will be guided by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and rely upon\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   29 CFR Part 785 - Hours Worked Under the Fair Labor Standards Act ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Brief for Appellees at 26 (alteration and emphasis in Appellee's brief).) Part 785 includes subpart 785.50, which is the codification of the federal Portal-to-Portal Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20785.50\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 785.50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Defendants' version of the statement omits important qualifying language. Indeed, the ellipses Defendants introduce after the word \"Act\" and before \"the\" obscure the full meaning. The unaltered statement reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   For purposes of enforcement and implementation of this Act, in interpreting and determining \"hours worked\" under this Act,\n   <em>\n    and where consistent with A.A.C. R20-5-1201 et seq. (Arizona Minimum Wage Act Practice and Procedure)\n   </em>\n   , the Industrial Commission of Arizona will be guided by and rely upon 29 CFR Part 785 - Hours Worked Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Substantive Policy Statement Regarding Interpretation of \"Hours Worked\" For Purposes of the Arizona Minimum Wage Act, available at https://www.azica.gov/labor-substantive-policy-hours-worked.aspx (last visited May 31, 2018) (emphasis added). The unaltered statement, rather than adopting the FLSA's interpretation in its entirely, merely sets forth the same principle discussed above: namely, that Arizona, like Nevada, looks to the federal law for guidance where it has parallel provisions. Where Arizona law does not have a parallel provision, this statement is not a license to create one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In sum, there is nothing to suggest that the Arizona legislature intended to adopt the federal Portal-to-Portal Act into its Code. As with Nevada, we refuse to read-in such a significant statute by inference or implication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
