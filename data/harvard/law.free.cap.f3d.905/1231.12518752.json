The provision challenged here- \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s \"residual clause\"-defines the term \"crime of violence\" to mean a felony \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is in some respects a successor to\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In the wake of those decisions, all here seem to agree that if \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause is interpreted to require determination of the crime-of-violence issue using what (in court-speak) has come to be called the \"categorical approach,\" the clause is doomed. As the Supreme Court has explained and applied it, this categorical approach-which the provisions at issue in both\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   were deemed to embody-does not permit consideration of a defendant's specific conduct or how she \"might have committed [her crime] on a particular occasion,\" but rather focuses exclusively on \"how the law defines the offense\" as a formal matter and whether, in the abstract, \"the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case\" meets the statutory standard.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In both\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that application of a standard that requires a reviewing court \"to 'imagine' an 'idealized ordinary case of the crime' \" rendered the challenged clauses impermissibly vague.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2557-58 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the flip side,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   also make clear-and it is common ground here-that if \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause is instead interpreted to incorporate what we'll call a \"conduct-based approach\" to the crime-of-violence determination, then the provision is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   unconstitutionally vague. As its name suggests, the conduct-based approach, in stark contrast to the categorical, focuses not on formal legal definitions and hypothetical \"ordinary case[s],\" but rather on the real-world facts of the defendant's offense-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , how the defendant actually went about committing the crime in question. And as the Supreme\n   Court emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   -and then reiterated in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   -there is no reason to \"doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoted in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1214 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The obvious (and decisive) question, then: Which is it here-categorical or conduct-based? Because we find ourselves at this fork in the interpretive road-the categorical approach imperiling \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause, a conduct-based reading saving it-we invoke the canon of \"constitutional doubt.\" Pursuant to that \"elementary rule,\" the Supreme Court has long held, \"every reasonable construction must be resorted to in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Hooper v.

As particularly relevant here, Ovalles was charged with (1) attempted carjacking in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and (2) using and carrying a firearm during a \"crime of violence\"-the attempted carjacking-in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A). Ovalles entered into a written plea agreement in which she admitted that \"she [was] in fact guilty\" on all six counts. At her plea hearing, the government outlined the elements of each crime, and Ovalles explained that she understood what the government would have to prove should she opt to go to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government then made a comprehensive factual proffer detailing Ovalles's involvement in the crimes. In general, the proffer summarized the evidence demonstrating that Ovalles and her co-conspirators (1) robbed a grocery store while armed with baseball bats, then (2) still wielding the bats, carjacked a Dodge Ram, then (3) carjacked a Toyota 4-Runner, pistol-whipping its owner, then (4) attempted to carjack a Chevy Venture-more on this one below-and finally (5) carjacked a Ford F-150 at gunpoint. More specifically, concerning the attempted carjacking of the Chevy Venture-during which one of Ovalles's accomplices fired an AK-47, and which therefore serves as the predicate offense for Ovalles's \u00a7 924(c) conviction-the government's proffer explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   They see a family getting out of a Chevy Venture in Clayton County, Georgia, and as the family is getting out of their car, these two defendants along with their co-conspirators go up to the family and demand the keys to the car and demand the car. Now, they have a baseball bat and guns with them. There's a juvenile, a 13-year-old female, who is part of that family group of victims. They hit that juvenile in the mouth with a baseball bat. The damage to her I am sure will be addressed at sentencing. It was not-she did not go to the hospital. Let me say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   They are demanding the keys. Somebody comes out of the apartment complex where this is happening and that person has a gun. He then confronts the assailants .... They flee, not taking the Chevy Venture, which is why it is an attempted carjacking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The government would show that the Chevy Venture traveled in interstate commerce, that it was not made in the State of Georgia. The government would prove it was these defendants not only through their confessions as to this event, also through the victims' testimony. They do I.D. the defendants in this particular case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   On the way out of the apartment complex ... co-conspirator ... Jerry Arriaga ... has an AK-47 style assault rifle and he then discharges that gun several times towards the victim family, the guy who came to rescue them, who was armed, and the car, and that is the basis of Count Five, the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With respect to each of the charges-including, as relevant here, the attempted-carjacking and \u00a7 924(c) counts-Ovalles stated that she had no \"material disagreement with what the government sa[id] it could prove ....\" Having heard the government's summary of the evidence against her, Ovalles pleaded guilty to each of the charged offenses, acknowledged that her pleas were voluntary, and explained that she was so pleading because she was \"in fact guilty as charged in the criminal information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court thereafter sentenced Ovalles to serve 120 months in prison on the \u00a7 924(c) count-which, per the statute, the court imposed to run consecutively to the concurrent 108-month terms on the remaining charges. Ovalles did not object to her sentences, nor did she file a direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Several years later, Ovalles filed a motion for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   contending that her \u00a7 924(c) conviction and sentence were unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In short, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   invalidated as unconstitutionally vague the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause-which, for purposes of applying that statute's recidivism-based sentence enhancement, defines the term \"violent felony\" to include any crime that is punishable by a year in prison and that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii). The Court voided the ACCA's residual clause principally based on its conclusion that the provision necessitated the categorical approach to determining whether an underlying conviction constitutes a \"violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557-58, 2561-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ovalles asserted that because \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause is \"nearly identical to\" the ACCA's,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's reasoning rendered it unconstitutional, as well. Accordingly, she argued, she was \"no longer guilty of violating\" \u00a7 924(c) because her predicate attempted-carjacking offense \"no longer qualifie[d] as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court denied Ovalles's \u00a7 2255 motion, reasoning that \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause did \"not suffer from the same unpredictability\" as the ACCA's. The court subsequently granted Ovalles a certificate of appealability on the question whether \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A panel of this Court affirmed the district court's decision. For our purposes, the panel's opinion did two significant things. First, in accordance with (and citing to) our earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   , it held that the question whether Ovalles's attempting-carjacking offense constitutes a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of \u00a7 924(c)(3) had to be answered using the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ovalles v.

Indeed, the Court made clear that application of the categorical approach was the hinge on which its vagueness determination turned: \"It is one thing,\" the Court stressed, \"to apply an imprecise 'serious potential risk' standard to real-world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction\" of the sort required by the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2558.

Next, the less obvious but no less true: While the panel decision in this case offered several distinctions between \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause and the ACCA's-which at the time had recently been invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   -the Supreme Court's intervening decision in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   (in a portion of the opinion joined by a majority of the justices) demolished all of them.

Surely the usual means of considering that issue would be to account for all of the specific circumstances surrounding the offense's\n   commission-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the actual facts.

The question there was whether the reference to \"burglary\" in the ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause meant burglary as defined by each of the 50 states' separate laws or, instead, burglary in some \"generic\" sense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 579-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In concluding that the ACCA referred to \"generic\" burglary, the Court rejected not only the idea that the definition of \"violent felony\" should vary from state to state, but also the notion that the government, in seeking to prove the violence of the underlying crime, could introduce evidence about the \"particular facts\" of the defendant's conduct, and instead adopted what the Court dubbed-and we still call-a \"categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 598-602,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In explaining why the ACCA's enumerated-offenses clause requires the categorical approach, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   Court emphasized two factors-one textual, the other practical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, the Court concluded that when read in context, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\"most likely refers to the elements of the statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 600-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reason, the Court explained, is that the language of the ACCA's operative provision, \u00a7 924(e)(1), \"refers to 'a person who ... has three previous convictions' for-not a person who has committed-three previous violent felonies or drug offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, relying on and quoting its earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the Court highlighted the ACCA's operative clause's focus on \"convictions\": \"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   explained that the relevant part of the [ACCA] refers to a 'person who ... has three previous convictions' for-not a person who has committed-three previous violent felonies or drug offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

A four-justice plurality concluded that \u00a7 16(b) incorporates the categorical approach for a handful of (now increasingly familiar) reasons. First, as in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the plurality noted that the government hadn't advocated a conduct-based approach: \"To begin where\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did, the Government once again 'has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1217 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2562 ).

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Third, the plurality explained that \"[b]est read,\" the text of \u00a7 16's residual clause incorporates the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Quoting the Court's earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan v.

And the words 'by its nature' in \u00a7 16(b) make that meaning all the clearer. The statute, recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense,\n   <em>\n    by its nature,\n   </em>\n   poses the requisite risk of force. An offense's 'nature' means its 'normal and characteristic quality.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1217 (internal citations omitted). Fourth, and relatedly, the plurality said that \"the same conclusion follows if we pay attention to language that is\n   <em>\n    missing\n   </em>\n   from \u00a7 16(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1218. In particular, the plurality reasoned, \"the absence of terms alluding to a crime's circumstances, or its commission, makes a [conduct]-based interpretation an uncomfortable fit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, following\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the plurality stressed the \"utter impracticability\" of applying a conduct-based approach to a statute, like \u00a7 16(b), that requires consideration of prior convictions-in particular, the \"daunting difficulties of accurately reconstructing, often many years later, the conduct underlying a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As already noted, Justice Gorsuch concurred separately in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , explaining that he was \"proceed[ing] on the premise\"-without definitively concluding-that as used in the INA, \u00a7 16(b) incorporates the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1232 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). He gave several reasons for his circumspection: (1) \"because no party [had] argued for a different way to read\" the provision at issue; (2) because Supreme Court precedent (by which he presumably meant\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ) \"seemingly require[d]\" application of the categorical approach to \u00a7 16(b) ; and (3) \"because the government itself ha[d] conceded (repeatedly) that the law compels\" the categorical approach in immigration-related \u00a7 16(b) cases.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He emphasized, though, that he would \"remain open\" in future cases \"to different arguments about our precedent and the proper reading of language like\" that found in \u00a7 16(b).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   So ... what are the takeaways? What factors have led the Supreme Court to conclude that a statute requires the categorical approach? The decisions interpreting the ACCA and \u00a7 16 reveal that the Court has historically applied the categorical approach to those statutes' residual clauses for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   1. because the government never asked the Court to consider a conduct-based approach (\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   2. because the text of those statutes' operative provisions focused not on conduct, but rather on \"convictions\"-and thus, the Court reasoned, solely on formal legal elements (\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   3. because those statutes' definitional provisions used terms and phrases like \"offense,\" \"felony,\" and \"by its nature,\" which the Court concluded pointed toward a categorical (rather than conduct-based) inquiry (\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   4. because those statutes lacked any reference to the underlying crime's commission or circumstances (\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   5. because applying the categorical approach would avoid the impracticability of requiring sentencing courts to engage in after-the-fact reconstructions of the circumstances underlying prior convictions (\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   6. because applying the categorical approach would avoid the Sixth Amendment issues that could arise from sentencing courts making findings of fact that properly belong to juries (\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The decisive question, it seems to us, is whether those considerations require us to interpret \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s own residual clause to incorporate the categorical approach-or whether, instead, the clause can \"plausibly\" be read to incorporate the conduct-based approach. For reasons explained below, we conclude that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) can at the very least plausibly be read to bear a conduct-based interpretation, and we therefore hold, pursuant to the canon of constitutional doubt, that because the conduct-based reading spares the residual clause from the near-certain death to which the categorical approach would condemn it, the conduct-based approach must prevail. In so doing, we join the Second Circuit, which also recently concluded-likewise applying the constitutional-doubt canon-that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) should be interpreted to embody the conduct-based approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, and in any event, Justice Thomas's linguistic observation about the alternative meanings of the word \"nature\" remains-and indeed, finds support in dueling dictionary definitions. Especially in light of the inapplicability of other reasons for applying the categorical approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), we simply aren't convinced that the phrase \"by its nature\" requires application of the categorical approach here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition to focusing on what the controlling statutes\n   <em>\n    say\n   </em>\n   in assessing the categorical-approach issue, the Supreme Court has emphasized what they\n   <em>\n    don't say\n   </em>\n   .

In particular, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   fretted about the prospect that mounds of evidence would need to be introduced at sentencing in order to reconstruct the circumstances underlying long-since-passed convictions-potentially turning sentencing proceedings into de facto mini-trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    495 U.S. at 601-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So, unlike in the ACCA and \u00a7 16 contexts-where courts have to look backwards in time to consider past crimes remote from (and wholly unconnected to) the charged offense, \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s definition of a \"crime of violence\" is never applied to an unrelated prior crime or conviction. Instead, in \u00a7 924(c) cases, the firearms offense and the predicate \"crime of violence\" go hand-in-hand; they inherently arise out of the same event. By dint of the statute's plain language, the gun-related conduct must occur \"during,\" \"in relation to,\" or \"in furtherance of\" the crime of violence, and with respect to that underlying offense the actionable risk of force must occur specifically \"in the course of committing\" it. In short, it's all one big ball of wax-the crimes are typically (as here) charged in the same indictment, and if they are tried, they are considered by the same jury.

In particular, the government admits that under a conduct-based approach, a \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) conviction requires a jury separately to find (or the defendant to admit through a plea) not only (1) that the defendant committed the underlying federal offense, (2) that the defendant used, carried, or possessed a firearm, and (3) that any use, carriage, or possession of the firearm occurred during and in relation to (or in furtherance of) the federal offense, but also-and importantly-(4) that the federal offense was in fact a \"crime of violence.\" As has the Supreme Court in similar circumstances, we conclude that the government's concession that, absent a plea, it must prove and a jury must find all four elements-including that the underlying offense qualifies as a \"crime of violence\"-\"eliminat[es] any constitutional concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    557 U.S. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , 903 F.3d at 182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204288566\">\n    2018 WL 4288566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (\"The Sixth Amendment concern is avoided because the trial jury, in deciding whether a defendant is guilty of using a firearm 'during and in relation to any crime of violence,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), can decide whether the charged predicate offense is a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the felony offense 'by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B).\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   So where does all of this leave us? With something of a mixed bag, frankly. While some of the factors to which the Supreme Court has pointed in adopting and applying the categorical approach might be thought (on balance) to favor a similar interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), others cut pretty decisively in the opposite direction, toward a conduct-based approach. And in constitutional-doubt land, the tie (or the toss-up, or even the shoulder-shrug) goes to the statute-saving option-which, here, is the conduct-based interpretation. So to be clear, we needn't-and don't-conclude that textual, contextual, and practical considerations\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   a conduct-based reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause.

Reasonable minds-say, for instance, the minds of the (putatively) reasonable judges who join this opinion-can and will disagree about that.

The only element in dispute here is the second: Did Ovalles's attempted-carjacking offense,\n   <em>\n    as she has admitted it actually occurred\n   </em>\n   , constitute a \"crime of violence\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , did her own acknowledged conduct \"involve[ ] a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense\"? Easy. Of course it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As it pertained to the attempted-carjacking count, the information charged Ovalles with \"attempt[ing] to take a motor vehicle ... from the person and presence of another, by force, violence and intimidation\" with \"the intent to cause death and serious bodily harm.\" Ovalles then executed a written plea agreement acknowledging that she understood each charge in the information-including the attempted-carjacking charge-and that \"she [was] pleading guilty because she is in fact guilty of the crimes [as] charged.\" If attempting\n   to steal a car \"by force, violence and intimidation\" and with \"the intent to cause death and serious bodily harm\" (as Ovalles has admitted she did) doesn't involve a \"substantial risk\" that physical force may be used, then it's hard to imagine what does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Here, though, there's no need for imagination-the real-life details of Ovalles's crime, all of which she has admitted, confirm it. We won't restate in full the government's factual proffer recounting Ovalles's involvement in the three-day carjacking spree. Suffice it to say that, in general, the proffer demonstrated that Ovalles and her co-conspirators robbed a grocery store, successfully carjacked three automobiles by force, and attempted to carjack a fourth. With respect to the attempted carjacking, in particular-which, again, serves as the predicate offense for Ovalles's \u00a7 924(c) conviction-the proffer detailed that Ovalles and her co-conspirators approached a family getting out of their minivan, demanded the keys, hit the family's 13-year-old child in the face with a baseball bat, and then, in making their escape, fired an AK-47 assault rifle at the family and a Good Samaritan who had come to their aid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1235.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Especially when layered on top of Ovalles's admission to the overtly violent charge in the information, the government's detailed factual proffer-with which Ovalles repeatedly said she had no \"material disagreement\"-leads inexorably to the conclusion that the attempted carjacking at issue here constitutes a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Based on the facts to which she has expressly stipulated, there simply can be no serious dispute that Ovalles recognized that her conduct posed a very real \"risk\" that physical force \"may\" be used-just, as it turns out, it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    VI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, we hold as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   1.

It's nuts. And Congress needs to act to end this ongoing judicial charade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   I join the majority opinion in full, but I write separately to explain why our resolution of this appeal forecasts how Congress should address the vexing issue of how to\n   punish violent recidivists under laws like the Armed Career Criminal Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   : by restoring the traditional role of the jury. The caselaw about how to punish recidivists has confounded the federal courts for decades and has made the resolution of this appeal tricky, but our decision also suggests a way out of the mess. Although our decision involves a contemporaneous crime and not a prior conviction, our conclusion that a jury may make findings about a defendant's violent conduct applies with equal force to recidivist statutes. Indeed, the modern abandonment of the jury's traditional role of making findings about prior convictions has created more problems than it has solved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    A. Recidivist Wars\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Empirical research proves that Congress has good reason to punish recidivists with long sentences of imprisonment. A recent study by the United States Sentencing Commission found that \"[c]areer offenders, as a group, tend to recidivate at a higher rate than non-career offenders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, \"almost two-thirds ... of career offenders released between 2004 and 2006 were rearrested\" in the eight-year period after their release, while just under \"one-half ... of non-career offenders released in 2005 were rearrested\" in the same period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And a defendant's criminal history as calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines is a strong predictor of future encounters with the justice system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Offenders without any criminal history points are rearrested at a rate of 30.2 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This rate jumps to 63.3 percent for offenders with five criminal history points and catapults to 81.5 percent for offenders with more than 10 criminal history points.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, offenders with the lowest criminal history category are rearrested at a rate of 33.8 percent, while offenders with the highest criminal history category are rearrested at a rate of 80.1 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Among career offenders, violent offenders, not surprisingly, pose the greatest risk to the public. For example, \"drug trafficking only\" career offenders recidivate at a rate of 54.4 percent, while \"violent [crime] only\" career offenders recidivate at a rate of 69 percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The median drug trafficker recidivates after 26 months, while the median violent offender recidivates after only 14 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The median drug trafficker commits two \"[r]ecidivism [e]vents,\" while the median violent offender commits three.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And when a drug trafficker reoffends, he is most likely to commit another drug trafficking offense, while a violent offender is most likely to commit robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, even \"mixed\" career offenders who have at least one violent offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   recidivate at a rate of 69.4 percent and are most likely to commit assault when they recidivate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Past offenses involving a firearm are also a strong predictor of future crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, \"[o]ffenders whose federal offense involved firearms [are] most likely to be rearrested\" at a rate of 68.3 percent, and \"[o]ffenders who received an enhanced sentence for a weapon ... ha[ve] higher recidivism rates than other offenders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, criminals with an affinity for guns and violence are the least likely to change their ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   That recidivists merit longer sentences is hardly a new discovery.

But these developments have not benefited all offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Recidivist drug traffickers who possess a firearm are still subject to the 15-year mandatory minimum under the Armed Career Criminal Act. But after the demise of the residual clause in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   violent recidivists who possess a firearm-the ones akin to the violent career offenders who recidivate at a rate nearly 15 percentage points higher than recidivist drug traffickers and who tend to commit violent crimes when they do so-sometimes escape the mandatory minimum if their earlier offenses lacked a legal \"element\" that involves physical force, regardless of how the offender actually committed the offense. For example, an offender may have been convicted of \"sexual abuse in the first degree ... by forcible compulsion\" under Alabama law for a crime that was actually violent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   But because the Supreme Court of Alabama has adopted a \"water[ed] ... down\" interpretation of the statute that \"means that [the statute] does not categorically include as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\" the conviction will not count as a crime of violence because \"the true facts matter little, if at all, in this odd area of the law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The same problem may exist for other offenses that can technically be committed in nonviolent ways-but rarely, if ever, are-such as kidnapping, arson, and other sex crimes. Criminals who have committed violent crimes may escape the mandatory minimum sentence of the Armed Career Criminal Act because sentencing judges must \"close [their] eyes\" to everything but the legal definitions of prior convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, the so-called categorical approach \"divorces what a habitual offender actually did from the punishment they are meant to receive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The bizarre results\" occasioned by this approach \"are hard to grasp\" because \"the doctrine is not based in reality, but rather relies on the legal fiction that crimes are [merely] comprised of a set of elements, as opposed to the underlying criminal conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   I do not mean to suggest that the residual clauses of the Armed Career Criminal Act or of the federal definition of a crime of violence in recidivist statutes\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   should have survived-at least not in their original forms that required the sentencing judge to decide whether the offender's criminal history qualified him for an increased punishment.

[was] a failed enterprise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   And even the elements clause has created confusion, with members of this Court disagreeing about whether crimes like attempted murder, attempted armed robbery, robbery, aggravated assault, and felony battery are violent crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The problems with the categorical approach also cannot necessarily be remedied by having the sentencing judge make findings about the underlying facts of prior convictions. The Sixth Amendment requires that, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the specific details of a recidivist's past crimes go beyond the simple \"fact of [his] prior conviction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, some members of the Supreme Court have opined that, under the Sixth Amendment, even the bare fact of a prior conviction should be proved to a jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    C. Return of the Jury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The combination of the need to punish violent recidivists and the problem of judicial\n   factfinding about prior convictions yields an obvious solution for Congress: rewrite the Armed Career Criminal Act and other recidivist statutes to require that the government must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has previously been convicted of a felony the actual commission of which involved the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person. For example, in the case of a defendant with a prior conviction under Alabama law for first-degree sexual abuse by forcible compulsion, the prosecution could introduce evidence that the defendant in fact used violent force to subdue his victim. This evidence might include certified charging documents, stipulations, plea agreements, factual proffers, and verdict forms from the past prosecution, as well as traditional evidence such as witness testimony and physical evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Tasking the jury with determining recidivism is consistent with the common law. \"Habitual offender laws like the ACCA enjoy a long tradition in this country that dates back to colonial times.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   And\"[a]t common law, the fact of prior convictions\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   to be charged in the same indictment charging the underlying crime ... and submitted to the jury for determination along with that crime.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1967, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \"[t]he common-law procedure for applying recidivist statutes ..., which requires allegations and proof of past convictions in the current trial, is, of course, the simplest and best known procedure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   And earlier decisions of state courts left little doubt that \"a verdict of the jury finding the prior conviction ... [was] essential to the power of the court to impose the increased punishment\" absent a statute that displaced the common law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \"[T]he right to have a jury decide prior-offense status ... was the law in virtually every federal and state jurisdiction, from the Founding past World War II.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, a former Texas recidivism statute provided enhanced penalties when the prosecutor proved to the jury that the offender \"ha[d] been before convicted of the same [felony] offense ... or one of the same nature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   And a jury finding was more than a formality. Under a former Indiana statute, \"the previous convictions, sentences, and imprisonments [had to] be described specifically, and the jury [had to] find that the defendant was convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned in the instances described, and not otherwise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Supreme Court of Indiana held that the prosecution could not rely on \"a certified transcript of a judgment\n   ... [that did] not describe the crime for which [the defendant] was convicted, but merely recite[d]\" that the defendant was sentenced to between one and seven years of imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The common-law method for proving prior convictions ordinarily permitted the prosecutor to rely on a broad array of evidence if the defendant refused \"to stipulate as to the prior conviction[ ] and thereby relieve the State of the necessity of ... adducing proof before the jury of such prior convictions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Crocker v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   after a defendant accused of \"robbery with a prior conviction for robbery\" contested the fact of his first conviction, the prosecutor introduced \"records from the penitentiary,\" \"testimony of one of the officers involved in the prior case,\" and a \"comparison of finger prints of the [defendant] with the finger prints taken in connection with the prior offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Dozier v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   the jury was tasked with weighing \"certified copies of the judgment and sentence,\" \"records of the Texas Department of Correction, including fingerprints,\" and \"expert testimony identifying [the fingerprints] as identical with those of the [defendant].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Factfinding by juries was considered essential to recidivism statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   And still today, there are states that require factfinding by juries to sentence an offender under their own recidivist statutes. Under Indiana's current habitual offender statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"habitual offender proceedings are treated as substantive criminal trials. The State must prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt\" to a jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The test for determining whether a prior conviction from another jurisdiction qualifies as a predicate offense under Indiana's statute does not turn on the elements of the offense, but on whether the acts that resulted in the out-of-state conviction would have constituted a predicate offense \"if they had been committed in Indiana.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   California also uses a conduct-based approach in cases in which it is not possible to determine whether an offense committed in another jurisdiction would qualify as a predicate felony through an inspection of the elements of the offense alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although California law permits judges to make the factual findings required to determine that the conduct that resulted in an out-of-state conviction would have been a predicate offense if committed in the state, a California court \"may not rely on its own independent review of record evidence to determine what conduct 'realistically' led to the defendant's conviction,\" but must instead rely on \"those facts that were already necessarily found by a prior\n   jury in rendering a guilty verdict or admitted by the defendant in entering a guilty plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Within our own Circuit, Alabama\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Georgia\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   likewise require the state to prove that the conduct underlying an offender's prior out-of-state conviction would have been a predicate offense under the state's recidivist statute if committed in the state, although both Alabama\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Georgia\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   permit judges to make the requisite factual findings. So in advocating a return to the jury's traditional role in determining recidivism at the federal level, I am not advancing a proposal untested by contemporary experience. I am instead proposing a solution that has proved workable in practice in several states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Some may object that jurors' knowledge of past convictions will lead them to engage in propensity reasoning,\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the Supreme Court long ago held that the \"use of prior convictions in [a] ... criminal trial ... [is not] so egregiously unfair upon the issue of guilt or innocence as to offend\" the guarantee of due process of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the details of past convictions are unlikely to reach the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   To begin, about 97 percent of federal prosecutions end in guilty pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   And those few defendants who go to trial can stipulate to their past convictions and limit any proceedings to the charged offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The supposed unfairness to defendants of admitting proof of prior convictions is the same concern that motivated the failed experiment of allowing judges to assess recidivism. When the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Spencer v. Texas\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 1967 and upheld the common-law jury method against a challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   the majority opined that it \"might well agree\" that other methods of assessing recidivism, such as \"leaving that question to the court,\" would be \"faire[r]\" than placing a defendant's criminal history before the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Justice Stewart also wrote in his concurring opinion that, \"[i]f the Constitution gave [him] a roving commission to impose upon the criminal courts of [the states his] own notions of enlightened policy, [he] would not join the [majority] opinion\" because other \"recidivist procedures ... are far superior to those utilized [under the common law].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   And then-contemporary academic commentators critiqued the common-law method and identified alternatives, including \"determination of [recidivist] status by the judge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   But here we are. The cure of judicial factfinding has proved worse than the disease it was supposed to treat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Another objection might be that compiling evidence of prior convictions will be burdensome. But with the advent of electronic records and other advantages of modern technology, the task of reconstructing the details of prior convictions will today be far easier than it was under the original common-law procedure and, over time, will become easier still.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because most state and federal prosecutions end in guilty pleas, the relevant details of prior convictions ordinarily will be preserved in factual proffers and other plea records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in the light of the rapid rate at which many violent offenders recidivate, other relevant evidence likely will be fresh.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In any event, Congress has some options for ensuring that all violent recidivists remain subject to the mandatory minimum penalty. As explained above, the elements clause may fail to capture offenders who commit broadly defined crimes in violent ways. But the facts of their prior crimes, when ascertainable, should not be immune from consideration when they commit new crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   That this country comprises 50 states with different criminal codes all but ensures that a formalist approach to defining a crime of violence-administered only by judges-will be either over- or underinclusive and almost certainly will be vulnerable to persistent litigation like that which felled the residual clause. For example, a recent bill introduced in the United States Senate proposes to apply the mandatory minimum to defendants with \"[three] or more previous serious felony convictions,\" namely \"any conviction ... for an offense ... punishable by imprisonment for a statutory maximum term of not less than 10 years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this definition is both too narrow and too broad. It would exclude the offense of \"felony battery\" under Florida law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   a third-degree felony with a maximum term of imprisonment of five years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   even though this crime requires the infliction of \"great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also would exclude convictions for \"domestic battery by strangulation\" under Florida law\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for \"assault[ing] another and inflict[ing] substantial bodily harm\" under Minnesota law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it would include the Florida offense of \"[u]nlawful possession or use of a fifth wheel,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   a second-degree felony with a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would include a conviction under Utah law for \"the intentional sale of five or more unlawful telecommunication devices within a six-month period,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   also a second-degree felony with a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   And it would include the Massachusetts offense of knowing possession of \"ten or more pieces of false money ... with intent to utter or pass the same as true,\" a crime punishable by a life sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the light of the substantial recidivism differences between violent and nonviolent offenders, Congress should ensure that their punishments are based on the nature of their past convictions and not the potential sentences for those convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Make no mistake-Congress must eventually do something. The need to punish violent recidivists is just as strong today as it was when the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   over 50 years ago.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only question is what Congress should do. Restoring the common-law role of the jury is the right place to start.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As United States Circuit Judges, we have been given great power and privilege. And our positions call upon us to decide the fate of many people who have neither. In a nation that incarcerates a larger percentage of its population than almost all others, federal judges devote much time to examining (and reexamining) the sentences imposed on people serving time in our federal and state prisons. The interpretation the majority of this en banc Court gives to the sentencing statute at\n   issue here, which gives no relief for Irma Ovalles, presents the opportunity to review the development of this Circuit's sentencing jurisprudence in recent years. My review reveals a body of law that has relentlessly limited the ability of the incarcerated to have their sentences reviewed. Decisions of this Court have left only a narrow path to relief for those serving sentences longer than the law now allows. Yet this narrow path is not mandated by decisions of the Supreme Court or by Acts of Congress. Indeed, this Court has withheld relief from prisoners even when precedent counsels otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   As did my colleagues in the majority, I begin with the landmark Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 576 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Having read the majority opinion, the reader is surely aware that in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court invalidated part of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a sentencing statute designed to punish violent repeat offenders more harshly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was not whether violent repeat offenders should be punished more harshly. Rather, the question was how to decide who is a violent repeat offender.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that one definition the statute used to identify violent repeat offenders was so vague, and so susceptible to divergent meanings, that relying on it to lengthen people's prison sentences violated the protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Supreme Court struck down the part of ACCA known as the residual clause. This ruling called into question the sentences of thousands of federal prisoners sentenced under ACCA and other, similarly worded statutes-including the one that was the basis for Irma Ovalles's sentence. After\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , it was the job of the Eleventh Circuit, and all inferior federal courts, to review the lawfulness of these sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Yet at every turn, this Court erred in ways that stopped prisoners from getting their sentences reviewed and prevented people who had meritorious claims from getting relief. Ms. Ovalles's case is a \"successor\" to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Maj. Op. at 1233, and it is the latest in this line of decisions. Judge Jill Pryor's dissent shows how the majority strays from the plain text of the statute and from Supreme Court precedent. I fully join her opinion. I write separately to provide the context of the Eleventh Circuit's response to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . This is not the first time this Court has mistakenly applied\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , nor the first time our mistake will leave an unlawful sentence intact. Indeed, today's en banc decision, like others before it, promises to have lasting effects for many prisoners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    JOHNSON\n   </em>\n   AFTERMATH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   When the Supreme Court invalidates a statute that was the basis for sentences being served by thousands of federal prisoners, the first question becomes, who benefits? Do we simply quit relying on this unconstitutional statute for those who will be sentenced in the future, or do we go back and give relief to those who were sentenced under the flawed statute in the past? There are rules governing who gets relief.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teague v.

Generally, people sentenced under a flawed statute more than a year before the Supreme Court announces a new rule like the one in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   get relief based on the new rule (retroactive relief) if the Supreme Court has told us they can.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3), (h) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126185\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/1151/#p1157\">\n    757 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157-60 (11th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   One statutory tool for a person seeking relief from an unlawful federal prison sentence is found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This one-year statute of limitations goes by quickly indeed for most federal prisoners, who are routinely sentenced to serve decades-long prison terms. Section 2255 does allow prisoners to bring a second or successive challenge to their sentences after that first year, but it is much harder. For starters, prisoners seeking relief when they are years into serving their sentence must first come to a court of appeals to get permission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h).

This is understandable because many of them had been sentenced under a statute they now knew was, in part, unconstitutional. To the best of my knowledge, our Court applied\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to give relief to inmates exercising their direct appeal rights, and to those who were within the one-year time limit for bringing their first collateral attack.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mays v.

And the Court did this based on\n   the limited filings, which the prisoner understood was just a permission-seeking document intended to allow him to present the merits of his claims in District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The questions that come up about sentences after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   are complicated. Every ACCA sentence is based on the individual criminal history of the people serving them. Under ACCA, a prisoner who had in the past committed three or more crimes that qualified as either a \"serious drug crime\" or a \"violent felony\" got a sentence that had to be at least fifteen years long.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Most are longer. Yet ACCA allows no more than a ten-year sentence for a prisoner who had fewer than three such earlier criminal convictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\n   <em>\n    924(a)(2)\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Thus, the devil is in the details.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   required the federal courts to do the tedious work of examining the criminal histories of people who have been convicted of violating a seemingly endless list of state crimes, defined by many different states in many different ways. In many cases, this Court undertook this complicated review based merely on the prisoner's application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In so doing, this Court effectively reimposed sentences on these inmates here at the court of appeals level, without ever allowing more thorough District Court review. We turned away prisoners seeking District Court review by ruling that their criminal history that had qualified for a fifteen-year plus sentence still qualified them for the longer sentence under a part of ACCA that survived\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Hires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325365\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1297/#p1301\">\n    825 F.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301-02 (holding Florida robbery and Florida aggravated assault qualify as ACCA predicates under the elements clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   As it turned out, the language the Supreme Court invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   also appeared in other federal sentencing statutes, so our Court began to get filings from prisoners sentenced under those statutes as well. For example, prisoners like Ms. Ovalles also sought to challenge sentences imposed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the statute at issue in this case.

Maj. Op. at 1239. In some \u00a7 924(c) cases where the prisoner merely sought leave to present claims in District Court, this Court decided on the merits-sometimes as a matter of first impression-that a particular state crime still qualified as a \"crime of violence\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A), which does not contain the language found unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Saint Fleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323501\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1337/\">\n    824 F.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1340-41 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding, for the first time, that substantive Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Also as a result of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's holding that the language of ACCA was unconstitutional, it should have surprised no one\n   that our Court would begin to see challenges to sentences imposed under identical language in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Yet here again, where prisoners sought to challenge their sentences under this guideline, our Court denied them the chance to present their claims in District Court. In a direct appeal from a sentencing, with full adversarial testing, this Court said\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not apply because the sentences were imposed under a Guideline system that was advisory.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But once any panel published a decision holding an inmate's past conviction still counts as a predicate conviction under the ACCA, it became easier to dispose of new filings. A panel receiving a new application to file a second or successive petition could quickly cite to a published decision rejecting someone else's application based on its declaration that the two had identical predicate convictions that had been ruled a \"violent felony\" even after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Unfortunately, several of these published merits decisions were just plain wrong. That means not only did the mistaken decision deny relief for the inmate who brought the case, but it will continue to require denial of relief for others who would rightly be entitled to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   III. EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT MERITS DECISIONS ON SECOND OR SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   In the rush to conduct these merits reviews of applications to file a second or successive habeas petition within the 30-day statutory time frame, based only on a form filed by a usually uncounseled prisoner, it should come as no surprise that our Court made some mistaken rulings. I think it worthwhile to discuss three examples of such mistakes in more detail here, to aid in understanding the impact of this Court's\n   chosen method for responding to prisoners seeking relief after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Unless we overrule them en banc or the Supreme Court corrects our errors, the merits decisions we made under the constraints I have discussed will continue to bar relief for prisoners with meritorious claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   A.

Yet as set out above,\n   <em>\n    Hires\n   </em>\n   applied erroneous precedent, which was not binding on the panel because of intervening Supreme Court decisions.

In fact, Mr. Hires did file another application for leave to file a second or successive petition after\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   .

TODAY'S DECISION IN CONTEXT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   As this review shows, our Court has made many missteps after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . It all began, in my view, when we started conducting merits review of prisoners' cases when all they wanted was permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in District Court. We compounded that error when we started publishing those decisions, establishing them as precedent. Then we locked in our mistakes by adopting an interpretation of \u00a7 2255, not in keeping with the text of the statute, to prevent prisoners from filing more than one application to file a second or successive petition, even where we wrongly denied their first. And then we denied those prisoners who managed to get full District Court review of their sentences the ability to use current Supreme Court precedent to show they had been sentenced under the ACCA residual clause. At every turn, our rulings put obstacles in the paths of prisoners trying to have their sentences reviewed. These roadblocks mean some prisoners in our Circuit will serve unconstitutional sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Today's majority en banc opinion decides that the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause. Again, I fully join Judge Jill Pryor's dissent explaining why this is wrong. I note with regret that today's decision is but a piece of the precedent I reviewed here. This Court has mishandled the application of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to many people who should have benefitted from it, and we do so again today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   My final observation about the majority's en banc ruling against Ms. Ovalles is to note that the majority opinion makes much of the fact that the government has asked us to abandon the categorical approach in interpreting \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 1244-45. Judge Jill Pryor's dissent explains why this consideration should not factor into our analysis of the statute at issue. Jill Pryor Dissent at 1295-96. I would add that, when deciding whether\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was retroactive, we paid no\n   heed to the government's concession that it was.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1253-54.

The words in this clause were not incidental to the Supreme Court's decision; the decision was based on the Court's interpretation of the text. In my view, this should be the end of it. If \u00a7 16(b) is void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause, then so is the part of \u00a7 924(c) we analyze here. The majority agrees that if the method of statutory interpretation the Supreme Court used in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   must be used in this case, then the part of \u00a7 924(c) under which appellant Irma Ovalles was convicted and sentenced must be stricken as unconstitutional. But the majority denies that we must use this method of statutory interpretation, even though the Supreme Court has told us that the language of \u00a7 16-and, by extension, the language of \u00a7 924(c) -\"requires\" it.\n   <em>\n    Leocal v.

We courts are loath to strike down acts of Congress-and appropriately so. When a law passed by Congress may be read to have more than one plausible or \"fairly possible\" meaning, and one interpretation would cause the law to be upheld as constitutional while another would require it to be struck down, we are \"obligated to construe the statute\" so as to uphold it.\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

This is the canon of constitutional avoidance, or constitutional doubt, as the majority calls it. The Supreme Court recently clarified a significant limitation on the use of this rule of statutory construction, however: \"In the absence of more than one plausible construction, the canon simply has no application.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p836\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p836\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). Put differently, what courts may not do is assign a law a strained or unreasonable reading to save it from being declared unconstitutional. I disagree with the majority that the text of \u00a7 924(c) plausibly can be interpreted in a way other than how the Supreme Court interpreted the same language in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   .

The majority argues that we should employ the canon of constitutional avoidance to save \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) because the statute can plausibly be interpreted to incorporate a \"conduct-based approach\"-one that looks to the \"real-world facts of the defendant's offense\" instead of how the law defines the crime or what conduct is entailed in the ordinary case. Maj. Op. at 1233. The problem with the majority's approach is that its alternative way of reading \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) to permit a conduct-based approach is simply not plausible when we remain faithful to the text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   So how does the majority get there? Sifting through Supreme Court cases applying the categorical approach to ACCA and \u00a7 16, the majority identifies six factors that led the Supreme Court to apply the categorical approach in those instances. It then applies those factors to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) and-finding many of them missing or inapplicable-determines that this statute plausibly could be read differently. But only three of the majority's factors concern the text. And the majority's analysis of its factors, both textual and extra-textual, is in my view deeply flawed. If we follow what the Supreme Court said about the\n   <em>\n    text\n   </em>\n   of the other two statutes and apply it to \u00a7 924(c) as a whole and in context, we find that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) presents an even stronger case for applying the categorical\n   approach than the other statutes-so strong that no other reading is plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   To understand why the approach the Supreme Court used in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and other precedent interpreting similarly-worded legislation controls the outcome of this case, some background on that precedent and the other legislation is unavoidable. In this section I first discuss three statutes, all of which Congress enacted or revised as part of an overhaul of the criminal code in the mid-1980s: the statute at issue here,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), particularly its definition of \"crime of violence\"; a definition of \"crime of violence\" found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that is applied in numerous criminal and noncriminal contexts; and ACCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Next I review a line of Supreme Court and circuit decisions that have explained the necessity of construing these statutes using the categorical approach. Finally, I discuss the decisions striking as unconstitutionally vague similar language in ACCA and identical language in \u00a7 16, as well as decisions framing the limits of the canon of constitutional avoidance. These decisions bear directly on whether \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Op. at 1237, was struck down as unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Since passage of the CCCA, \u00a7 16's general \"crime of violence\" definition \"has ... been incorporated into a variety of statutory provisions, both criminal and noncriminal.\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 16's definition also was incorporated into provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), including a provision that permits deportation of a noncitizen convicted of an \"aggravated felony,\" which includes any \"crime of violence\" as defined in \u00a7 16.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). I discuss this provision, which was the subject of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   , in more detail later. But I pause briefly to note that the majority focuses solely on \u00a7 16's incorporation into the INA, qualifying as such its references to \u00a7 16(b) at least half a dozen times, and omitting reference to all of the other ways in which \u00a7 16 is incorporated into the federal code. The effect of this narrowing is that the majority focuses myopically on \u00a7 16 as applied to\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   crimes, rather than as it is incorporated into offenses with other contemporaneously occurring elements. The majority's distinction is an artificial one because we are required to \"interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context.\"\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    543 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   11 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In fact, for the vast majority of instances where \u00a7 16's definition is incorporated into the criminal code, the \"crime of violence\" element is committed at the same time as the offense's other elements. For example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2025\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   criminalizes and provides penalties for an adult \"who intentionally uses a minor to commit a crime of violence,\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 16. A person who violates \u00a7 25 commits the\n   \"crime of violence\" element at the same time as the offense's other elements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And so many incorporations of \u00a7 16 function very similarly to the incorporation of the \"crime of violence\" definition in \u00a7 924(c)(3) -the elements and residual clauses-into \u00a7 924(c)(1) -which contains the offense's other elements: using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during (at the same time as) and in relation to (to facilitate) the predicate crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Yet another (and for our purposes, the last) CCCA statute to address crimes of violence is ACCA. ACCA, enacted as part of the CCCA, imposes a mandatory 15-year term of imprisonment on a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who previously was convicted of three serious drug offenses, violent felonies, or both. ACCA defines \"violent felony\" like this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   [A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.0147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Like \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 16, ACCA has an elements clause, subsection (i), and it had-until the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutionally vague-a residual clause, which in subsection (ii) began with \"or otherwise ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The balance of subsection (ii) is known as the \"enumerated crimes clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Section 924(c), \u00a7 16, and ACCA, all either enacted or revised as part of one comprehensive piece of legislation, are notably similar in their text. All three statutes, until the majority's decision today, have been analyzed using the same \"categorical approach.\" I discuss this approach in the next subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Supreme Court gave effect to Congress's expressed intent when the Court interpreted ACCA, which, again, imposes enhanced sentences when a defendant has been convicted of prior crimes that meet ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\" The Court explained that ACCA \"\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   has embodied a categorical approach to the designation of predicate offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    495 U.S. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   To decide which prior crimes qualify as predicate offenses, the Supreme Court said, courts must look not to whether the defendant's actual conduct in committing the crime was violent, but rather to whether the statute creating the crime described a violent offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   When in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court first described the categorical approach, it did so in the context of ACCA's enumerated crimes clause. The Court based its holding-that a categorical, rather than a factual or conduct-based, approach must be used-primarily on ACCA's text as a whole, but also on ACCA's legislative history and because construing it with a conduct-based approach would lead to practical problems in criminal proceedings. The Court first explained that ACCA's text \"generally supports\" a categorical approach because it refers to \"convictions,\" not commissions of an offense, and because its elements clause refers to a statute's \"element[s],\" not to any particular facts or conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"441\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Read in this context,\" the Court said, the enumerated crimes clause should be read categorically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 600-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Court noted, \"the legislative history of [ACCA] shows that Congress generally took a categorical approach to predicate offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, for the residual clause, the Court emphasized that the \"offense\" was one that \"\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   \" involved a substantial risk that physical force may be used.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"461\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

Noting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's additional reasons for declining to adopt a conduct-based approach-including the government's concession that the categorical approach applied and potential practical problems with a conduct-based approach-the plurality explained that none of these things mattered because \" \u00a7 16(b)'s text creates no draw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

First, the categorical approach-which the Supreme Court said must be applied to text identical to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) -requires courts to imagine the ordinary case of an offense. And \"[n]othing [in the statute] helps courts to perform that task.\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1215 (majority opinion).

The majority acknowledges that the categorical approach must be applied to the definitions of drug trafficking crime and of crime of violence in \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   clause, but holds that a conduct-based approach at least plausibly applies to the definition of crime of violence in \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s residual clause. In adopting a conduct-based approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) -and thus overruling in part our decision in\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   -the majority contorts the plain text of the statute and reads similar structure and language differently within the same statute. The majority does so in disregard of the Supreme Court's unequivocal statement in\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   that language identical to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   a categorical approach-that is, it cannot plausibly be read another way. And the majority does so in disregard of the Supreme Court's admonition that in deciding whether to employ the canon of constitutional avoidance we must look to a statute's text alone. The majority effectively rewrites the statute to avoid having to strike it down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   To reach this result, the majority distills from\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and its progeny a multi-factor test for deciding whether we should apply the categorical approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Only three of the majority's six factors are text-based, and they appear seemingly on an even playing field with three other extra-textual \"considerations.\" Maj. Op. at 1243-44. Even if these extra-textual considerations mattered before\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , they do not matter now.

Below I explain why the majority's textual analysis, contained in three of its six factors, is incorrect and clearly in contravention of Supreme Court precedent.

If not, the inquiry ends, and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutional. The answer is that it cannot. Section 924(c)'s text, read as a whole, in its statutory context, and with the Supreme Court's guidance, cannot plausibly be read to permit a conduct-based approach to the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   First of all, the Supreme Court has already told us that a categorical approach is the only approach we can take to this text.

Section 924 also contains ACCA, \u00a7 924(e). The statutes are unique in establishing mandatory minimum sentences for federal firearms offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Sentencing Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System\n   </em>\n   2 (2018). The Supreme Court has, without exception, construed ACCA (including, when it was in effect, its residual clause) to require a categorical approach. Taking an even broader look at the statutory scheme, we know that \u00a7 924(c), ACCA, and \u00a7 16 all were created or amended as part of the same legislative action, the CCCA. The use of very similar residual clauses in these statutes is more evidence still that Congress intended the same categorical meaning for \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 845 (rejecting construction of an immigration statute that was \"incompatible with the rest of the statute\" and explaining that only one reading of the statute \"makes sense in the context of the statutory scheme as a whole\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   None of the majority's three text-based factors convinces me that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) plausibly can be read to support a conduct-based approach. Nor am I persuaded that we can divine the meaning of one clause of a statute by breaking it down word by word and isolating those words from their surrounding context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A.

Indeed, by separating the text of \u00a7 924(c) into three \"considerations\" that are hardly separate ideas, the majority performs a sleight of hand that, the Supreme Court has told us on numerous occasions, has no place in textual analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 845\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Even picked apart, though, the words do not support majority's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The majority's three textual considerations or factors are: \"the text of [ACCA's] operative provisions focused not on conduct, but rather on 'convictions'-and thus ... solely on formal legal elements\" (factor 2 of the majority's six-factor test); ACCA's and \u00a7 16's \"definitional provisions used terms and phrases like 'offense,' 'felony,' and 'by its nature,' which ... pointed toward a categorical (rather than conduct-based) inquiry\" (factor 3); and \"those statutes lacked any reference to the underlying crime's commission or circumstances\" (factor 4).

Rather, the majority says, \u00a7 924(c)(1)\"refers to\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   ,\" Maj. Op. at 1245-46 (emphasis in original), pointing to the language that \"any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"505\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) ). According to the majority, this language offers strong support for applying a conduct-based approach to the statute's residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   I find the majority's argument unpersuasive for at least two reasons. First, setting aside for now comparisons to other statutes, the language in \u00a7 924(c)(1) that the majority insists \"refer[s] exclusively to conduct,\" Maj. Op. at 1248, cannot bear the weight the majority places on it. Section 924(c)(1) makes it a federal crime to use, carry, or possess a firearm \"during and in relation to\" one of\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   categories of crimes: drug trafficking crimes, elements-clause crimes of violence, or residual-clause crimes of violence. If the \"during and in relation to\" language supported a conduct-based approach to the residual clause, it necessarily would do the same for the drug trafficking and elements-clause definitions. After all, the same words-\"during and in relation to\"-must be ascribed the same meaning for each category of crime listed in \u00a7 924(c), whether a drug trafficking crime, an elements-clause crime of violence, or a residual-clause crime of violence. \"To give these same words\"-[\"during and in relation to\"]-\"a different meaning for each category\"-[the elements- and residual-clause definitions of crime of violence and the drug trafficking crime definition]-\"would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

As the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   plurality noted, \u00a7 16's text, even \"more plainly\" than ACCA's, requires a categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1218 (plurality opinion);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1235-36 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (reaffirming\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   ). So to compare and contrast ACCA's language with \u00a7 924(c)'s is a bit disingenuous when a more similar statute exists. The majority does not look to \u00a7 16(b) when examining this textual factor, perhaps because the majority confines all discussion of \u00a7 16(b) to its incorporation into the INA, where it, like ACCA's residual clause, defined a prior conviction. But \u00a7 16(b) in its numerous other applications functioned just as \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) does, yet \u00a7 16(b)\"require[d]\" a categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 7, 11 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"509\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 380, 392,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442797\" index=\"510\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/371/#p381\">\n    125 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that when construing the same statutory language in one of a statute's many applications, \"[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern,\" such that any \"construction called for by one of the statute's applications\" must apply to all applications).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   A look at some examples of \u00a7 16's incorporation into the criminal code proves both points.

And we see just how similar \u00a7 16(b)'s incorporations are to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)'s incorporation into \u00a7 924(c)'s \"operative provision,\" and thus why \u00a7 16 is a better textual analogue for \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) than ACCA is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Let's take, for example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2025\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which, as I mentioned in Part I.A., criminalizes an adult's intentional use of a minor to commit a crime of violence.

Section 119(a) contains several conduct-based elements, including that the defendant must make restricted information public, have knowledge that the information is restricted and is being made public, and have the intent either to personally incite the commission of a crime of violence against a covered person or her family member or that the personal information be used to facilitate the commission of a crime of violence. These conduct-based elements appearing in crimes incorporating \u00a7 16's definition of crime of violence did not, to the Supreme Court, suggest a conduct-based approach for \u00a7 16(b), so they do not suggest a conduct-based approach for \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The Supreme Court explained that the second of these definitions has to refer to\n   the actual circumstances of the petitioner's offense because \"[t]here is no offense 'described in section 7201 of title 26' that has a specific loss amount as an element.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"522\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    557 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(M)(ii) ). Because the \"offense ...in which\" language\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   refers to the circumstances of the petitioner's actual conduct in subsection (a)(43)(M)(ii), the language must be read the same way for subsection (a)(43)(M)(i).

In\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   , it was \"offense\"-in the prefatory phrase-and \"in which\"-present in both subsections-that required interpreting both subsections to apply to conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   As I explained above, applying this same logic to \u00a7 924(c)(3) compels a categorical reading of the statute. Like subsection (a)(43)(M)'s \"offense ... in which\" language, the prefatory phrase \"offense that is a felony\" in \u00a7 924(c) is incorporated into the definitions for\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the elements clause\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the residual clause. If we start with the uncontroversial proposition that \"offense that is a felony\" is categorical in the elements clause and then apply the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   , we must conclude that Congress intended \"offense that is a felony\" to be categorical for both crime of violence definitions in \u00a7 924(c)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"527\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    557 U.S. at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"528\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p34\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Aside from its reading of \"offense,\" the majority appears to acknowledge that the phrase \"by its nature\" is best read to require a categorical approach. But, says the majority, Justice Thomas, in dissent in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , makes some good points about the meaning of the word \"nature\" that make a conduct-based reading possible. \"Nature,\" the majority says, might mean \"the essential character or constitution of something,\" and that \"something\" might be \"particular acts\" rather than the elements of a crime of conviction. Maj. Op. at 1247. The problem with the majority's argument is that the text of \u00a7 924(c) tells us precisely what that \"something\" is: when the statute says \"by\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   nature,\"\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   clearly refers to \"offense that is a felony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   And for the reasons I just explained, \"offense that is a felony\" must be read categorically. Isolating the word \"nature\" and claiming that it is amenable, out of context, to\n   more than one meaning does little to inform the meaning of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) when \u00a7 924(c) is read as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   The majority also credits Justice Thomas's suggestion that \"the words 'by its nature,' 'substantial risk,' and 'may' would mean only that an offender who engages in risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that physical force was not actually used during his offense.\" Maj. Op. at 1248 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1254 ). Taken separately, I agree that these words and phrases could mean that. But together? No way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   Again, the residual clause defines \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that is a felony and ... that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force ... may be used\" during commission of the offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B). The \"substantial risk\" requirement on its own means that an offender who engages in risky conduct cannot benefit from the fact that force was not actually used, so the addition of \"may\" would serve no purpose other than to abstract the defendant's actual conduct one step further. Of course, we cannot read words out of a statute in the name of constitutional avoidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gustafson v.

Maj. Op. at 1244. The majority argues that \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause \"is different\" from \u00a7 16(b) because \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) says \"in the course of committing the offense,\" which it deems to be \"conduct-based language.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1248. This is flat wrong-both statutes contain \"in the course of committing the offense.\" Therefore, the statutes are not different at all. And if this temporal language somehow suggested a conduct-based approach, it likewise would do so for the identically worded \u00a7 16(b), and we know from\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   that that is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   We also know from the Supreme Court's decisions applying the categorical approach to ACCA that the fact that the risk must arise in the course of committing the offense does not admit of a conduct-based approach. In\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the \"risk\" that triggered ACCA's residual clause must arise \"while the crime is in progress\"-that is, in the course of committing the offense.\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    550 U.S. at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although ACCA's residual clause \"lacked an express temporal limit,\" the limit was built into the case law such that \"the analyses under ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) coincide[d].\"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1219-20 (majority opinion). Because we know ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) require a categorical approach, we also know that the statutes' temporal limitations, explicit or implicit, do not plausibly suggest a conduct-based approach; otherwise, the majorities in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   would have had to accede to the dissenters' suggestions that they employ the canon of constitutional avoidance. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has explained that the categorical approach necessitates a temporal limitation because \"the riskiness of a crime in the ordinary case depends on the acts taken during [the crime's] commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1220. Section 924(c)(3)(B)'s \"in the course of committing the offense,\" then, is categorical language, not conduct-based language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   The majority's strained reading of \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause does not, in my view, even approach plausible. Under\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , we must end the analysis there. The statute cannot be construed to avoid a plain violation of due process. And yet, \"[u]nable to find sure footing in the statutory text, the [g]overnment and [the majority] pivot away from the plain language and raise a number of practical concerns.

To review, these three practical considerations are because: in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   the government \"never asked the Court to consider a conduct-based approach\" (factor 1); \"applying the categorical approach would avoid the impracticability of requiring sentencing courts to engage in after-the-fact reconstructions of the circumstances underlying prior convictions\" (factor 5); and \"applying the categorical approach would avoid the Sixth Amendment issues that could arise from sentencing courts making findings of fact that properly belong to juries\" (factor 6). Maj. Op. at 1243-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Before I get into the majority's factors, I pause to note that although the majority claims to have distilled its factors from\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, absent from the majority's consideration is one of\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   's three reasons for applying the categorical approach to ACCA: that \"the legislative history of the enhancement statute shows that Congress generally took a categorical approach to predicate offenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    495 U.S. at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is amenable to only one plausible reading, I would no more wade into legislative history than I would explore the majority's extra-textual factors. But if we were to peek at the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c), it-like ACCA's legislative history-supports a categorical approach only. As part of the CCCA, Congress \"completely revised\" \u00a7 924(c). S. Rep. 98-225, at 313 (1983). Before the revision, the Supreme Court had interpreted \u00a7 924(c) to exclude certain potential predicate criminal \"statutes,\" like the federal bank robbery statute and the assault-on-a-federal-officer statute, which contained penalty enhancements of their own.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress then amended \u00a7 924(c) to include these statutes. In so doing, the Senate expressly acknowledged the Supreme Court case law as the motivating factor for its revision. Even more importantly, as it acknowledged that case law the Senate itself referred to crimes in terms of categories: statutes, not conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   The Senate stated that the purpose of its revision was to \"ensure that all persons who commit federal crimes of violence, including those crimes\n   <em>\n    set forth in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    statutes\n   </em>\n   which already provide for enhanced sentences for their commission with a dangerous weapon, receive a mandatory sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Senate sought to do so in response to the Supreme Court's body of cases that had \"negated [ \u00a7 924(c) ]'s use in cases\n   <em>\n    involving statutes\n   </em>\n   , such as the bank robbery statute and assault on a federal officer statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 312 (emphasis added). Congress explained that \"[t]hese are precisely\n   <em>\n    the type of\n   </em>\n   extremely dangerous offenses for which a mandatory punishment for the use of a firearm is most appropriate,\" so it overrode the court decisions to ensure that certain\n   <em>\n    statutes\n   </em>\n   fell within the purview of\n   \u00a7 924(c).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Whether the Government Has Asked Us to Abandon the Categorical Approach Has No Relevance to the Constitutional Avoidance Analysis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   The first factor the majority considers is that here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the government has argued for a conduct-based approach: \"[T]he government has expressly (and at length) urged us to abandon the categorical approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) in favor of a conduct-based interpretation.\" Maj. Op. at 1245. First, this description strikes me as incomplete at best. For years, and even after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the government consistently has urged that we apply a categorical approach to \u00a7 924(c). It was only after our court invited the government to argue for abandonment of the categorical approach in supplemental panel briefing and en banc briefing in this case that the government changed course. And even then, in its en banc brief the government's primary argument was not that we should overrule\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   , but rather that we should affirm Ms. Ovalles's \u00a7 924(c) conviction on the ground that her predicate offense satisfies the elements clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   En Banc Br. of the Appellee USA at ii. The government argued only in the alternative that we should overrule\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   insofar as it held that a categorical approach must be applied to \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   Second, and more importantly, as the majority itself observes, this factor is not really \"interpretive,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1244; and so it is \"an odd place to start in interpreting a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   it is clear that the government's suggestion (or lack of it) that we should apply a conduct-based approach to a statute is irrelevant to\n   whether the text of the statute plausibly can be read to permit such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Majority's Practical Problems and Sixth Amendment Factors in Reality Constitute One Irrelevant Factor that Fails to Support the Majority's Position.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   The majority's fifth factor-the supposed lack of practical problems associated with a conduct-based approach-is yet another variety of extra-textual consideration that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   told us we cannot consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 843. In any event, the majority's fifth and sixth considerations (the need to avoid Sixth Amendment issues that could arise from sentencing courts making findings that juries are required to make) are not separate issues; instead they are two sides of the same coin. Here's why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   It certainly was possible to apply a conduct-based approach to ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) and still comply with the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W. Pryor Concurrence at 8-9. Take ACCA's residual clause, for example. Say a defendant convicted of burglary three times in 2013 was charged in 2014 with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"547\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). He elected to have his case tried to a jury. The government could secure an ACCA enhancement based on these burglary convictions so long as it proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's commission of the burglaries involved a serious potential risk of injury. (Maybe in each case the defendant was still inside a home when the homeowners returned, and the homeowner in each case could testify to that before the jury.) Securing the defendant's ACCA-enhanced sentence should be relatively straightforward (if somewhat time-consuming) because the prior convictions were close in time to the \u00a7 922(g) charge. Now assume those burglary convictions were 10 years old. Maybe the government could scrape together enough evidence to prove the risk element of those long-ago crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, maybe not. But this is not a Sixth Amendment problem. It is a practical problem for the prosecution that arises because of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right. Applying a conduct-based approach to ACCA would not have violated the Sixth Amendment; it merely would have led to fewer ACCA-enhanced sentences because the government's burden to prove old facts to a jury could turn out to be difficult to satisfy in practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   The same is true for \u00a7 16(b) as incorporated by the INA-a conduct-based approach would merely lead to fewer removals. If a factfinder was tasked with determining whether a noncitizen had committed a crime with conduct that involved a substantial risk that physical force may be used, the factfinder's ability to make this finding could well depend on how long ago the crime was committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The majority's fifth and sixth factors, then, amount to one concern: that given the Sixth Amendment's dictates there may be serious practical hurdles to proving prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   Turning to that concern, the majority distinguishes ACCA and \u00a7 16, on the one hand, from \u00a7 924(c), on the other, because by requiring the examination of prior convictions\n   the two former statutes pose these practical hurdles, while the latter does not. Yes, it may be difficult to reconstruct the facts underlying the predicate convictions because of the passage of time and possible loss of witnesses and records; conversely, because \u00a7 924(c) is always applied to a contemporaneous offense, there is no such practical difficulty. This is true for ACCA and \u00a7 16 as incorporated into the INA. But what of \u00a7 16 in its numerous other applications? Many other, primarily criminal, statutes incorporate the \"crime of violence\" definition in \u00a7 16 as an element that must satisfied at the same time as the statute's other elements. In those applications, no reconstruction of old facts is necessary because, as with \u00a7 924(c) -and I use the majority's words here-\"it's all one big ball of wax.\" Maj. Op. at 1249. As I emphasized above, \" \u00a7 16 is a criminal statute, and it has both criminal and noncriminal applications,\" so we cannot solely look to its applications in the INA when examining whether it is similar to or different from \u00a7 924(c).\n   <em>\n    Leocal\n   </em>\n   , 543 U.S. at 11 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"548\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the lack of practical problems with \u00a7 16(b)'s contemporaneous criminal applications, the Supreme Court did not invoke the canon of constitutional avoidance to save \u00a7 16(b). I see no reason why the same rationale would justify application of the canon here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   And, contrary to the majority's suggestion, practical problems do abound with a conduct-based approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), even if those problems are not completely coextensive with problems that might arise by using a conduct-based approach to ACCA's residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) as incorporated into the INA. As amici curiae the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and Families Against Mandatory Minimums explain: \"Under a fact-based approach, whether the charged predicate offense satisfies \u00a7 924(c)(3) would turn not on\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   the defendant committed the predicate offense, but\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   he committed it.\" Br. of Amici at 11. In some \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) cases (like my ACCA residual clause example above), proof of what made the defendant's conduct risky (that is, how he committed the predicate offense) will not be essential to satisfy the elements of the predicate offense. In those cases, will prosecutors know whether the offense ultimately will satisfy the residual clause, so as to facilitate informed charging decisions? Will defendants and defense counsel know whether the charged predicate will satisfy the residual clause, so as to enable informed plea bargaining decisions? I doubt it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   What's more, given the abstract nature of the residual clause inquiry I am not nearly as confident as the majority is that instructions can be fashioned to guide juries appropriately on-or that juries are well equipped to decide-what kind of conduct satisfies \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause. Under a conduct-based approach, which the majority concedes must be based on facts found by a jury looking at the defendant's conduct, the jury's inquiry is divorced, in at least four ways, from the conduct it is tasked with examining. First, the jury must ignore any conduct that forms the basis for other charged offenses and focus only on the conduct involved in committing the \u00a7 924(c) predicate offense. This could prove difficult if, to use as an example Ms. Ovalles's case-in which she and her codefendants robbed a store, carjacked three vehicles, and attempted to carjack a fourth-the predicate offense (the attempted carjacking) occurred alongside other criminal conduct. Then, the text of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) provides two additional abstractions: \"substantial risk\" that physical force \"may\" be used. The majority says no problem-juries routinely decide what kind of conduct satisfies a substantial risk standard or what constitutes physical force. But \"substantial risk\" is only one abstraction. How does a jury decide\n   whether conduct presents a substantial risk that physical force \"may\" be used? That is, how does a jury decide what conduct satisfies an abstraction (\"may\") of already abstract conduct (\"substantial risk\")? The majority has no answer for this.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, and further abstracting a jury's inquiry is that a defendant's use, carrying, or possession of a gun is insufficient, without more, to satisfy the risk standard in \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause-or else the crime of violence element would be meaningless. A jury therefore must decide whether a defendant's predicate offense conduct only, separate and independent from the defendant's possession of a gun, presented a substantial risk that physical force may be used, that doubly abstract standard. We presume that juries follow instructions, true, but we cannot presume that a jury will be able to make sense of an inquiry this abstracted from the facts of the case. Nor can we presume, given these realities, that a district court will be able to provide sufficiently concrete instructions to guide the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Finally, the majority's ultimate disposition of Ms. Ovalles's appeal proves my point about practical difficulties by highlighting another problem with a conduct-based approach: appeals. The majority, sitting as an appellate court, affirms Ms. Ovalles's \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) conviction even though Ms. Ovalles did not admit, and no fact-finder found, that her conduct created a substantial risk that physical force may have been used in the course of committing the predicate offense of attempted carjacking. The majority decides as a matter of law that the risk element has been satisfied by examining the elements of the predicate offense to which she pled guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 1252-53 (explaining that Ms. Ovalles's plea to the elements of attempted carjacking satisfy the elements clause and that \"the real-life details of [her] crime\" only \"confirm it\"). If \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is to have a new conduct-based \"substantial risk\" element, it often will not be the case that we can look to the defendant's admissions to the\n   <em>\n    elements\n   </em>\n   of the predicate offense to determine that this\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   element is satisfied. This case is a prime example.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   To \"confirm\" its conclusion that the elements of the attempted carjacking offense to which Ms. Ovalles pled guilty satisfied the conduct-based residual clause element, the majority considers the totality of Ms. Ovalles's and her co-conspirators' conduct. But under the majority's own holding, whether the defendant engaged in conduct that satisfies the \"substantial risk\" standard is an element of the \u00a7 924(c) offense that must be decided by a jury or admitted by the defendant. Again, Ms. Ovalles never\n   admitted that her attempted carjacking involved a substantial risk that the use of force might be used. Perhaps, without saying so, the majority is performing a harmless error analysis-an analysis the government never asked us to perform and on which the government bears the burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Will we uphold other convictions on appeal under this same flawed logic? Many defendants like Ms. Ovalles were convicted when\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   required use of the categorical approach. Under\n   <em>\n    McGuire\n   </em>\n   , the district court was tasked with deciding as a matter of law whether the defendant's charged predicate offense satisfied the residual clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048227,3661971\" index=\"549\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/1333/\">\n    706 F.3d at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So even if a defendant was tried by a jury on his predicate offense charge and his \u00a7 924(c) charge, the government was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury was not required to decide, whether his underlying conduct in fact met the risk standard. The same would hold true for a defendant who pled guilty. Under the majority's conduct-based approach, on appeal these defendants should be entitled under the Sixth Amendment to a remand or-at a minimum-the government would have to prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neder v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p9\">\n    527 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p9\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248184\" index=\"552\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/1/#p9\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). But under the majority's decision today, perhaps defendants will not be afforded these rights. Time will tell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   The majority claims to be avoiding one constitutional problem-the unconstitutional vagueness of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) -with a practical solution-abandoning the categorical approach as applied to that statute. The law does not permit the majority's approach, and the text of \u00a7 924(c) does not permit the majority's resolution. Even under the majority's flawed framework, neither the government's position, the dictates of the Sixth Amendment, nor practical considerations support application of a conduct-based approach over a categorical one. And there is every indication that the majority's practical solution will breed a host of new practical problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Our displeasure with the categorical approach and the results of its application to residual clauses does not permit us to jettison it. The categorical approach is dictated by the text of the statute and Congress's intent to impose increased penalties based on the violation of certain predicate statutes. If Congress wants to change course, or enact a residual clause that comports with the dictates of due process, it can readily do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarthan v.
