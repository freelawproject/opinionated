INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\" or \"Defendant\") operates a coal-fired electricity-generating plant, the Gallatin Fossil Plant (\"Gallatin plant\"), on a part of the Cumberland River known as Old Hickory Lake, a popular recreation spot. The Gallatin plant generates wanted electricity (which it supplies to approximately 565,000 households in the greater Nashville area), as well as unwanted waste byproducts, in particular coal combustion residuals (\"CCRs\") or coal ash. The plant disposes of the coal ash by \"sluicing\" (mixing with lots of water) and allowing the coal ash solids to settle in a series of unlined man-made coal ash ponds adjacent to the river. The Gallatin plant has a permit to discharge some of this coal combustion wastewater, which contains heavy metals and other pollutants, into the river through a pipe, known as Outfall 001. Other wastewater is allegedly discharged through leaks from the ponds through the groundwater into the Cumberland River, a waterway protected by the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The CWA indisputably regulates the first type of discharge. The issue on appeal is whether the CWA also regulates the latter type of discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a bench trial, the district court found that TVA violated the CWA because its coal ash ponds at the Gallatin plant leaks pollutants through groundwater that is \"hydrologically connected\" to the Cumberland River without a permit. This theory of liability has been labeled the \"hydrological connection theory\" by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). As explained in the companion decision also issued today,\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Waterways All., v. Kentucky Utilities Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-5115, --- F. 3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204559315\">\n    2018 WL 4559315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Waterways\n   </em>\n   \"), we find no support for this theory in either the text or the history of the CWA and related environmental laws.

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Kentucky Waterways,\n   </em>\n   Congress passed the CWA in 1972 with the stated purpose of \"restor[ing] and maintain[ing] the ... Nation's waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). To that end, the CWA requires a permit to \"discharge ... any pollutant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1342(a). The discharge of a pollutant is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12)(A). Navigable waters are broadly defined as \"the waters of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(7). And a point source is a \"discernible, confined and discrete conveyance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(14). These permits are issued pursuant to the CWA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1342. Therefore, in order to add a pollutant to the waters of the United States via a conveyance, an NPDES permit is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The CWA overhauled the 1948 Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Water Quality Act of 1965 by shifting the focal point of liability from measuring excess pollution levels in the receiving water to capping effluent limitations from a discharging source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 92-414 (1971),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1972 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3668, 3675 (\"Under [the CWA] the basis of pollution prevention and elimination will be the application of effluent limitations. Water quality will be a measure of program effectiveness and performance, not a means of elimination and enforcement.... With effluent limits, the [EPA] ... need not search for a precise link between pollution and water quality.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   With the CWA, Congress also sought to \"recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution [and] to plan the development and use ... of land and water resources.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The CWA accomplishes this by allowing the states to administer the CWA's NPDES permitting program themselves, provided their regulations are at least as stringent as the federal limitations,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1342(b)-(d), and most notably, by drawing a line between point-source pollution and nonpoint-source pollution,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12),(14). Point-source pollution is subject to the NPDES requirements, and thus, to federal regulation under the CWA.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As noted, the Gallatin plant is adjacent to the Cumberland River, a \"water[ ] of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7). TVA has two coal ash ponds or impoundments at the Gallatin plant: the Non-Registered Site (\"NRS\") and the Ash Pond Complex (\"Complex\"). The NRS is closed, and the Complex is in the process of being closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The NRS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From 1956 to 1970, the Gallatin plant sluiced CCRs to the NRS, an unlined 65-acre site along the western edge of the river. The NRS is situated atop alluvium (loose soil, silt, clay). By 1973, TVA had dewatered the NRS. TVA closed the NRS in 1998, pursuant to the State of Tennessee's solid waste program. For this reason the NRS does not have an NPDES permit. Instead, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (\"TDEC\") regulates the \"closed dry ash disposal area\" according to its solid waste landfill standards, which include ongoing groundwater monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-211\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Approximately 2.3 million cubic yards of coal ash are stored at the NRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Based on expert testimony from both sides, the district court found that \"it does\n   appear more likely than not that some portions of [the NRS as well as the Complex] penetrate the water table.\" The court concluded that the NRS is contaminated; that it leaked historically; that there was \"no evidence to suggest that the 'closure' of the site ... wholly stopped the leaking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Complex\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After 1970, TVA began treating its CCR in a series of unlined ponds, collectively known as the Complex. The ponds, which cover roughly 476 acres, treat sluiced wastewater by allowing CCRs to settle before releasing wastewater to the Cumberland River through Outfall 001. Approximately 11.5 million cubic yards of coal ash are stored at the Complex today. The parties agree that the Complex sits atop karst terrain, a landscape characterized by underground sinkholes, fissures, and caves caused by water-dissolving limestone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20257.53\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 257.53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Groundwater flows easily through the factures and other conduits created by the dissolved rock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Historically, the Complex leaked significant amounts of pollutants into the river. Between 1970 and 1978, approximately 27 billion gallons of coal ash wastewater flowed directly from the Complex into the karst aquifer and then into the Cumberland River. The district court found it \"beyond dispute that sinkholes have been recently discovered in the area[ ] of the Gallatin plant site\" and would likely continue to form, given the nature of karst terrain. Thus, the court concluded that \"[i]t is simply implausible, based on the evidence before the Court, that the Complex has not continued to, and will not continue to, suffer at least some leaking through karst features.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Permit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1976, the EPA issued an NPDES permit authorizing the Gallatin plant to discharge wastewater from the Complex to the Cumberland River through Outfall 001. Today, TDEC issues and oversees the federal permitting process for the Gallatin plant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TDEC issued the permit in question (\"Permit\") on June 26, 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   after a public comment period. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20124.8\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the EPA or state authority to issue a fact sheet for every draft permit setting forth \"the principal facts and the significant factual, legal, methodological and policy questions considered in preparing the draft permit\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Comp.%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%200400\">\n    Tenn.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs, two Tennessee conservation groups whose members use and enjoy Old Hickory Lake, saw the matter differently. Dissatisfied with the State of Tennessee's enforcement efforts, they brought this CWA citizen suit on April 14, 2015, under to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that TVA violated the CWA and the Permit based on flows from the NRS and the Complex through hydrologically connected groundwater to the Cumberland River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the district court entered judgment for Plaintiffs following a bench trial. First, the court ruled as a matter of law that the CWA applies to discharges of pollutants from a point source through hydrologically connected groundwater to navigable waters where the connection is \"direct, immediate, and can generally be traced.\" The district court held that the NRS is a point source because it \"channel[s] the flow of pollutants ... by forming a discrete, unlined concentration of coal ash,\" and that the Complex is also a point source because it is \"a series of discernible, confined, and discrete ponds that receive wastewater, treat that wastewater, and ultimately convey it to the Cumberland River.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court then found as a matter of fact that both the NRS and the Complex are hydrologically connected to the Cumberland River by groundwater. As to the NRS, the court held that \"[f]aced with an impoundment that has leaked in the past and no evidence of any reason that it would have stopped leaking, the Court has no choice but to conclude that the [NRS] has continued to and will continue to leak coal ash waste into the Cumberland River, through rainwater vertically penetrating the Site, groundwater laterally penetrating the Site, or both.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court similarly found that historical evidence established that the Complex leaked. The court stated that \"none of the science presented was capable of definitively identifying when the relevant pollutants entered the water,\" and that the record was \"silent with regard to detailed, credible evidence of whether the undisputed historical leakage is capable of justifying pollutant concentrations in the amounts observed today.\" However, the court decided that \"[o]n balance ... the evidence preponderates toward concluding that the discharges from the ... Complex are either ongoing or intermittent and recurring.\" The court therefore held that \"the unanimous expert testimony is that sinkholes and other drainage features in karst terrain are not mere relics of some past geological event. Rather, the physical properties of the terrain itself make such areas prone to the continued development of ever newer sinkholes or other karst features.\" Thus, based on the contaminants flowing from the NRS and the Complex, the court found TVA to be in violation of the CWA. The district court further concluded that karst-related leakage from the Complex violated the Permit's removed-substances and sanitary-sewer overflow provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As a remedy the court ordered TVA to \"fully excavate\" the coal ash in the Complex and the NRS (13.8 million cubic yards in total) and relocate it to a lined facility, rejecting TVA's proposal to dewater and put a cap on the unlined impoundments (\"closure-in-place\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although acknowledging that the burden of closure-by-removal \"may be great,\" the court felt that it was \"the only adequate resolution to an untenable situation that has gone on for far too long.\" Because of the costs associated with the injunctive remedy, the court did not assess civil penalties against TVA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TVA appeals, arguing that the district court (1) erred in holding that the CWA's prohibition of unpermitted point source discharges applies to pollutants that migrate through groundwater to navigable waters; (2) lacked authority to override the TDEC's regulatory decision not to impose NPDES liability for seepage and leakage of coal ash leachate through groundwater at the Gallatin plant in the Permit; and (3) abused its discretion in ordering complete excavation and relocation of the 13.8 million cubic yards of coal ash stored at the Gallatin plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Further, the Permit treats these types of pollutants differently.

Not only is this revealed by the definitional text of \"point source,\" but it is also manifested in the effluent limitation enforcement scheme that the Clean Water Act employs.

In turn, \u00a7 1311(a) prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The broad sweep of a defendant's potential CWA liability is limited in two ways. First, Congress included a list of exceptions in \u00a7 1311(a) itself: the discharge of a pollutant is unlawful \"[e]xcept in compliance with this section and sections 1312, 1316, 1317, 1328, 1342, and 1344 of this title.\" Second, Congress gave the phrase \"discharge of a pollutant\" a very specific definition: it means \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A). Taken together, Congress thus authorized citizen suits to prevent the \"addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1362(12)(A), but if a listed statutory exception applies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1311(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority argues that this standard cannot be satisfied when, as here, pollution travels briefly through groundwater before reaching a navigable water. Plaintiffs counter that such an exception has no statutory basis and would allow polluters to shirk their CWA obligations by placing their underground drainage pipes a few feet away from the shoreline. This case could have profound implications for those in this Circuit who would pollute our Nation's waters. And the issue is novel. This Court has never before considered whether the CWA applies in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have. Both courts determined that a short journey through groundwater does not defeat CWA liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Upstate Forever v.

In cases where, as here, a plaintiff alleges that a defendant is polluting navigable waters through a complex pathway, the court should require the plaintiff to prove the existence of pollutants in the navigable waters and to persuade the factfinder that the defendant's point source is to blame-that the defendant is unlawfully \"add[ing] ... any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

For its textual argument, the majority refers us to the term \"effluent limitations.\" This term, the majority says, is defined as \"restrictions on the amount of pollutants that may be 'discharged from point sources\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   navigable waters.' \" Maj.

The majority should heed this commonsense advice. Congress did not hide a massive regulatory loophole in its use of the word \"into.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But more importantly, the majority's quoted definition of \"effluent limitation\" from \u00a7 1362(11) -the supposed origin of the loophole-is not relevant to this case. The citizen-suit provision uses the term \"effluent standard or limitation\"-not the term \"effluent limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). As the majority itself argues, minor distinctions in statutory language sometimes matter. This one does. The phrase \"effluent standard or limitation\" is a term of art and is wholly distinct from the term \"effluent limitation.\" This conclusion is supported not by tea leaves or a carefully selected dictionary, but rather by the CWA itself. The citizen-suit provision of the CWA provides that \"effluent standard or limitation\" means, among other things, \"an unlawful act under subsection (a) of section 1311 of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Turning to \u00a7 1311(a), we find that, absent certain exceptions, \"the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful,\" \u00a7 1311(a), and the \"discharge of a pollutant\" means \"any addition of any pollutant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   navigable waters from any point source,\" \u00a7 1362(12)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, even assuming the majority correctly parses the definition of \"into\"-a dubious proposition at best-the word \"into\" is not contained in any of the statutory provisions at issue. Rather, we find the word \"to,\" which does not even arguably suggest a requirement of directness; the word \"to\" merely \"indicate[s] movement or an action or condition suggestive of movement toward a place, person, or thing reached.\"\n   <em>\n    To\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   It is therefore entirely unclear why the majority relies on the definition of \"effluent limitation.\" That definition is simply irrelevant to this lawsuit. As a result, the majority's criticisms of the approach taken by the Fourth and Ninth Circuits miss the mark. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit analyzed the correct statutory text when it rejected the argument that the citizen-suit provision requires directness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [t]he plain language of the CWA requires only that a discharge come \"from\" a \"point source.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

It is true that\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   dealt with different facts. But it is irrelevant that the pollution in\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   traveled through point sources before reaching a navigable water, whereas the pollution in this case traveled through groundwater, which, according to the majority, is not a point source. In both cases, the legal issue is the same: whether the CWA applies to pollution that travels from a point source to navigable waters through a complex pathway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    547 U.S. at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (asking whether \"the contaminant-laden waters ultimately reach covered waters\").

On this view, the states alone are responsible for regulating pollution of groundwater, even if that pollution later travels to a navigable water. Wrong again.

Instead, the district court was addressing pollution of a navigable water-specifically, the Cumberland River-via groundwater.

Maj. Op. at 445. The majority notes that if a polluter's conduct is regulated through a CWA permit, then RCRA does not also apply. The majority therefore suggests\n   that a straightforward reading of the CWA is incompatible with RCRA. The majority would gut the former statute to save the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   But the EPA has already dismissed the majority's concern. Indeed, the EPA issued federal regulations on this issue many decades ago. The EPA's interpretation is that the industrial discharge of waste such as CCR is subject to regulation under both RCRA and the CWA: RCRA regulates the way polluters store CCR, and the CWA kicks in the moment CCR enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The EPA first articulated this approach in a set of regulations from 1980, which provide that \"[i]ndustrial wastewater discharges that are point source discharges subject to regulation under section 402 of the Clean Water Act\" \"are not solid wastes for the purpose of\" the RCRA exclusion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). This exclusion, the regulation explains, \"applies only to the\n   <em>\n    actual point source discharge\n   </em>\n   . It does not exclude industrial wastewaters while they are being collected, stored or treated before discharge, nor does it exclude sludges that are generated by industrial wastewater treatment.\" \u00a7 261.4(a)(2) (comment) (emphasis added). Thus, under the EPA's reading, a polluter can be liable under RCRA for improperly storing CCR-even if the CCR never enters a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Conversely, a polluter can be liable under the CWA for adding CCR to a navigable waterway-even if the polluter's storage methods comport with RCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And of course, a polluter can be liable under both statutes if the polluter both improperly stores CCR and discharges it to a navigable waterway.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20261.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The EPA settled any doubts on this matter by publishing a detailed description of its rationale in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Fed.%20Reg.%2033098\">\n    45 Fed.

The EPA says that imposing CWA liability for the discharge of CCR to navigable waterways does not eliminate the possibility of RCRA liability for the storage and treatment of CCR. The majority suggests the exact opposite. Unfortunately for the majority, but fortunately for those who enjoy clean water, the majority lacks the authority to override longstanding EPA regulations on a whim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/#p980\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   For all these reasons, I believe the CWA clearly applies to the pollution in this case.

Under this standard, the unpermitted leaks from NRS and Complex are clearly unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Permit's Sanitary Sewer Overflow Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The permit prohibits \"Sanitary Sewer Overflows,\" which it defines as \"the discharge to land or water of wastes from any portion of the collection, transmission, or treatment system other than through permitted outfalls.\" (R. 1-2, permit, PageID# 79.) The district court found, and TVA no longer disputes, that the Complex discharges coal ash waste to groundwater through its unlined, leaking sides and bottoms. These discharges are not authorized by the permit. Therefore, Plaintiffs have proven a permit violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority avoids this result by overcomplicating the issue. Ignoring the plain text of the permit, the majority instead champions the EPA's standard definition of \"Sanitary Sewer Overflow,\" which is narrow and arguably saves TVA from liability. This reasoning is perplexing. The EPA's definition should play no role in the legal analysis here because the permit itself defines \"Sanitary Sewer Overflow.\" Indeed, TVA's permit expert conceded in the district court that the permit's definition is broader than the EPA's definition. Accordingly, this Court should apply the plain text of the permit's definition, as it would apply the plain text of any contract. This Court has no plausible authority or reason to substitute a definition provided in the permit with one drafted in a different context by a nonparty who has no relation to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Further, the EPA's standard definition makes little sense in this context. As the majority recognizes, that definition applies only to sewage from sanitary sewer systems. But a coal ash pond is not a \"sanitary sewer system.\" It does not contain \"sewage.\" Consequently, interpreting the Sanitary Sewer Overflow provision to regulate sewage alone would render the provision meaningless. This Court should avoid such an interpretation, especially when the permit itself provides a definition that does not trigger any such concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallo v.
