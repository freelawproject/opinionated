The returns contained accurate taxpayer identification information which Porter either stole or purchased from the taxpayer or a third party. However, the returns falsely reported the taxpayer to be self-employed\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as having disabled dependents in order for the taxpayer to be eligible for a refund. Although the IRS rejected many of the returns and requested refunds, it paid out $180,397 to Porter, which she promptly spent. For this conduct, she pled guilty to making a false statement to the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20287\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and was sentenced to 48 months imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. She completed her prison sentence but her release was short-lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a mere five weeks, she violated the conditions of supervised release by, among other things, stealing $2,964.92 worth of merchandise from various stores in a local\n   mall. The judge revoked her supervised release and sentenced her to 24 months imprisonment to be followed by a new 12-month term of supervised release. A month after her release from that prison term, she again violated the terms of her release, this time by stealing expensive sunglasses from a local optical store. The judge again revoked her supervised release and sentenced her to 24 months imprisonment; no new term of supervised release was imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To keep track of the various sentences for discussion purposes, a simple table is helpful:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-13\">Imprisonment Sentence Supervised Release Term Original Conviction 48 months 36 months<sup>*</sup> First Revocation 24 months 12 months<sup>**</sup> Second Revocation 24 months none <sup>*</sup> Served approximately 7 weeks before arrest <sup>**</sup> Served approximately 5 weeks before arrest</pre>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * Served approximately 7 weeks before arrest\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ** Served approximately 5 weeks before arrest\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Porter challenges her most recent sentence (24 months in prison, but no new term of supervised release).

Relevant here, Porter \"waive[d] the right to directly appeal the conviction and sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and/or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203742\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\" but reserved \"the right to appeal from a sentence which exceeds the statutory maximum.\" (R. Vol. 1 at 41.) The government seeks to enforce that waiver to this appeal-an appeal not from the original sentence but from the sentence imposed following the second revocation of supervised release. It tells us (1) Porter's appeal falls squarely within the scope of the waiver, (2) she knowingly and voluntarily waived her appellate rights, and (3) enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the plea agreement, Lonjose \"knowingly waive[d] the right to appeal any sentence within the statutory range applicable to the statute(s) of conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (quotation marks omitted). The judge sentenced him to 51 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Although the judgment listed various conditions of supervised release, it failed to include a condition prohibiting or limiting Lonjose's contact with minors.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1296. Before his release from prison, the probation officer moved to modify the conditions of supervised release to include a no-contact with minors provision.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The judge granted the motion; Lonjose appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1296-97. The government argued the appeal was foreclosed by the waiver of appellate rights in the plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1297.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We concluded Lonjose's appeal from the modification of the conditions of supervised release fell outside the scope of his appellate waiver.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1297. \"[The] waiver of the right to appeal 'any sentence' encompasses only the right to appeal the original sentence imposed at sentencing and memorialized in the judgment,\" and does not encompass the right to appeal a subsequent modification of the conditions of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1302. That is because \"there is a distinct 'right to appeal' which comes into existence when the judgment of conviction is filed and expires after 14 days (or up to 44 days if the government appeals). [And] it is this distinct right to appeal that a defendant would reasonably understand he is waiving with a generic appellate waiver such as the one in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1299. Moreover, although a modification of supervised release conditions \"create[s] a right of appeal that is separate from a defendant's right to appeal his original sentence,\" \"[t]he language of [Lonjose]'s appellate waiver ... does not include waiver of the separate right to appeal [from such modification].\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1300. We see no daylight between that case and this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Porter waived the right to directly appeal from \"the ... sentence,\" which is narrower than Lonjose's appellate waiver of \"any sentence.\" By doing so, Porter would have reasonably understood at the time of her guilty plea that she was waiving only discretely expressed rights, notably the right to directly appeal from the sentence imposed in accordance with that plea (the original sentence of 48 months). Like many appellate waivers, Porter's waiver included the right to collaterally attack her conviction and sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , except for ineffective assistance of counsel claims \"which challenge the validity of the guilty plea or [the] waiver.\" (R.

Importantly, Porter's waiver makes no mention of the right to appeal from a sentence imposed upon a future revocation of supervised release, even though a revocation of supervised release involves new factual findings by the judge and creates new procedural protections, including the separate right to appeal from the revocation sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) (requiring judge to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release before revoking that release); Fed.

According to her, \"to arrive at the allowable period of supervised release\" that could be imposed upon the second revocation, \u00a7 3583(h) required the district court to subtract the 24 months of imprisonment imposed upon the first revocation of supervised release from the maximum term of supervised release for making a false statement to the United States (a Class D felony)-three years (36 months). (Appellant's Op. Br. at 10.) As a result, she tells\n   us the judge \"was authorized to impose a new supervised release sentence of only approximately 12 months [36 months minus 24 months]\" upon the second revocation.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \"[The judge] exceeded [her] authority by imposing a 24-month term of supervised release.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

A 24-month\n   <em>\n    term of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   , however, was imposed.

Unfortunately, she has repeatedly blamed her extensive criminal behavior, at least in part, on intellectual disability (her words, \"mental retardation\"). (R. Vol. 1 at 125, 127, 150.) The district judge squarely addressed the matter, observing that her problem did not square with the level of intellect required to commit the underlying offense (tax fraud) or with the letter Porter sent to her. The judge said, \"There's nothing disabled or mentally slow or less than average about you.
