We are also called upon to consider the extent to which the Confrontation Clause entitles a defendant to cross-examine government witnesses who testify pursuant to cooperation agreements about the sentence reductions they expect to receive in exchange. Because we conclude that the Defendant's new trial motion did not make the requisite showing to warrant a hearing and that the District Court's limitation on cross-examination did not contravene the Confrontation Clause, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal arises from a drug trafficking conspiracy in which several personnel at a Virgin Islands airport smuggled cocaine onto commercial flights bound for the United States mainland. In August 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Appellant Isa Noel, a ground services supervisor at St. Thomas's Cyril E. King Airport, and three of his fellow airport personnel with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and related possession offenses. After a three-day trial, the jury convicted Noel on all charges, and the District Court sentenced him to 151 months' imprisonment. More than a year later, Noel filed a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence of juror misconduct, which the District Court denied without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Noel timely appealed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging numerous orders across various stages of the proceedings but focusing primarily on the sufficiency of the evidence, the District Court's rulings on cross-examination, and its denial of his motion for a new trial. Before turning to the merits, we recount the proceedings pertinent to the challenged orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    1. Jury Selection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the preliminary proceedings, the District Court conducted\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and, over Noel's objection, impaneled a security officer working on a contract basis for the U.S. Marshals Service. In response to the District Court's questioning, that officer-who later became Juror No. 11-denied having a relationship by \"blood, marriage[,] or business\" with Noel or having \"read or heard anything about th[e] case.\" App. 66-67. But when the District Court asked whether any juror was \"involved in the criminal justice system,\" Juror No. 11 indicated that he was, which led to the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. You raised your card.... Tell us why.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   JUROR MEMBER: I worked 26 years as a correction[s] officer and I [have] been involved in making the arrests and support and all that stuff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Were you involved in any arrest in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   JUROR MEMBER: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT: All right. You're currently employed by whom?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   JUROR MEMBER: I'm retired now but I have a contract with the U.S. [M]arshal[ ]s office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   App. 76-77. Although it elicited assurances that Juror No. 11 could follow its instructions and remain impartial, the District Court did not inquire further into the juror's specific duties with the U.S. Marshals Service, nor did Noel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Instead, citing the juror's involvement \"in law enforcement ... [p]roviding security,\" Noel moved to strike him from the jury. App. 78. After soliciting the Government's position-that the juror \"indicated he had no dealings with the[ ] particular defendants in th[e] case,\" App. 78-the District Court denied Noel's motion; Juror No. 11 was impaneled; and the parties proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Over the course of the trial, the Government presented the testimony of Noel's three former codefendants-Edisson Peguero Ortiz, Joelvis Acosta Liz (Acosta), and Kirsten Alexander-who had each since entered into plea agreements with the Government. The Government also offered the testimony of an additional cooperating witness and several law enforcement officers as well as phone records, airport surveillance footage, physical evidence, and a joint stipulation to the amount of cocaine seized by law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ortiz and Acosta testified that they were involved in a cocaine distribution venture with Noel and that, as many as nine times, they received cocaine from a third party, facilitated its transportation through the airport into the baggage of ticketed passengers, and split the profits. Noel's role, they testified, was critical: As a ground services supervisor, he had access to restricted doors, allowing them to bypass TSA checkpoints. Their testimony was corroborated by a confidential informant and his law enforcement handler. The informant testified that, during a meeting at Acosta's house, Acosta and Noel agreed to transport cocaine for him and that he twice gave them sham cocaine outside the airport, which was then returned to him inside the airport. The handler, who surveilled the meetings and provided the sham cocaine, confirmed these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to this evidence about the conspiracy's structure and purpose, the jury heard about the particular transactions underlying Noel's two possession charges. The first transaction, Ortiz and Acosta testified, involved a foiled attempt to transfer six kilos of cocaine to a courier. Ortiz gave the cocaine to Noel the night before, and Acosta and Noel transported it, concealed in their waistbands, from the employee locker room to the airport bathroom where they were met by the courier. A surveilling law enforcement officer testified that he \"pursued\" the courier to \"the handicap stall,\" \"climbed on the toilet next door and looked over,\" and ultimately discovered the courier \"standing in front of the toilet ... on the phone,\" with a \"black[ ] suitcase sitting on the toilet,\" \"unzipped but not open.\" Second Addendum to App. (Addendum) 373-74. Inside that suitcase the law enforcement officer found several brick-shaped packages, which the Government introduced as evidence and which the parties stipulated amounted to approximately seven kilos of cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government's evidence also included airport surveillance footage that showed Acosta, Noel, and the courier walking to\n   and from the bathroom in succession and phone records that reflected eighty-one calls made that day between Ortiz, Acosta, and a phone number that, although subscribed in a different name, the Government asked the jury to infer, \"us[ing] [its] common sense,\" was used by Noel. Addendum 510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The second transaction took a similar form but went a step further before also being thwarted. In that instance, according to the testimony of codefendant Alexander, Alexander was at work at the airport in the employee break room when Noel, his supervisor, called him on the phone. Noel then came to the break room, asked Alexander to \"take a package to one his friends ... in the bathroom\" inside the airport, and gave him access to do so through a restricted door. Addendum 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The \"friend,\" a courier who testified as a cooperating witness for the Government, explained that he received the cocaine from Alexander in a bathroom stall and then boarded a plane to Miami, and surveillance footage showed the pair walking to and from the bathroom. The transaction was also corroborated by phone records reflecting twelve calls made that day between Alexander and the same phone number used in the first transaction, as well as the testimony of a Homeland Security agent who described the courier as \"appear[ing] visibly nervous\" and \"sweating profusely\" after disembarking the plane in Miami. Addendum 147. Upon the courier's arrest, agents recovered from his luggage a brick-shaped package that the parties eventually stipulated amounted to about one kilo of cocaine and that was also introduced as a government exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3. Cross-Examination Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because codefendants Ortiz, Acosta, and Alexander each testified pursuant to cooperation agreements with the Government, Noel attempted to undermine their credibility by cross-examining them about the sentence reductions they hoped to receive in exchange. The District Court allowed some, but not all of the lines of questioning that Noel sought to pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the one hand, the District Court permitted each codefendant to confirm, in broad strokes, the benefits secured by their agreements. Noel was able to question the codefendants about the reduction of otherwise substantial sentences, the Government's agreement to drop or not pursue additional charges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the codefendants' release from federal custody pending sentencing, and the possibility of a greater sentence reduction, should their testimony be satisfactory. In addition, each of the codefendants disclosed that they had reviewed the Government's case against Noel prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the other hand, the District Court foreclosed inquiry as to the codefendants' precise sentencing exposure, explaining that this limitation was necessary to prevent the jury from inferring the sentence Noel himself was facing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Punishment is not ever something the jury is to have in their mind, so I'm not going to permit you to go into anything that gives some specific outline about what a sentence might be. The defendant is on trial for a drug conspiracy, and this defendant pled guilty to a drug conspiracy.... Now, if you want to suggest that he was ... exposed to ... a\n   considerable amount of time, and he is, by his performance today he is essentially singing for his supper, you can certainly explore that. But I'm not going to have you go into things like mandatory or specific sentences like 10 years or maximum of life.... Because if it's going into anything that deals with sentence or punishment, I don't want the jury to be connecting up the dots and say: Well, here's what Mr. Noel is facing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Addendum 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When it came time for closing arguments, Noel used the testimony he had elicited to impugn the codefendants' veracity and motivation for testifying. He described them, for example, as \"self-confessed crooks, liars, [and] convicts ... looking out for the best interests of only themselves,\" and urged the jury to discredit their testimony because they had \"one goal\"-to \"serve[ ] less jail time\"-and their eyes were on the \"golden trophy\": a recommendation from the Government \"to reduce their substantial sentence[s] even further.\" Addendum 485-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The jury deliberated for about four hours before reaching a guilty verdict on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The New Trial Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   More than eighteen months after his convictions, Noel, alleging that he had recently discovered evidence of \"significant juror misconduct,\" filed a motion for a new trial. App. 32. That motion explained that Noel had recently subpoenaed records from the U.S. Marshals Service, including a job description and time sheets that, according to Noel, cast doubt on the veracity of Juror 11's responses at\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . The job description revealed that Juror No. 11 served as a \"District Security Officer\" responsible for, among other tasks, guarding federal detainees and transporting them to and from court. App. 51. The time sheets also indicated, without any further detail, that Juror No. 11 worked \"in court with prisoners\" on the date of Noel's and two codefendants' preliminary appearances and that he provided \"support to the airlift\" the following day and on the day another codefendant was arraigned. App. 59, 61 (capitalization omitted). Based on those records, Noel hypothesized that Juror No. 11 attended and transported Noel and his codefendants to and from those appearances and may have provided their transportation to other court proceedings. Failing to disclose that information on\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , Noel asserted, reflected material dishonesty by Juror No. 11 and deprived Noel of the right to an impartial jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The District Court was unconvinced. Going so far as to \"[a]ssum[e] that Juror No. 11 interacted with Noel while Juror No. 11 worked as a contract employee with the United States Marshals,\" the District Court identified three pertinent\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions that Juror No. 11 may have answered incorrectly: (1) whether he had a prior relationship with the defendant; (2) whether he had read or heard anything about the case; and (3) whether he had been involved in any arrest in the case. Suppl. App. 34. It reasoned, however, that because the juror \"freely admitted\" that he worked for the Marshals Service and Noel did not recognize the juror at trial, Juror No. 11 likely \"did not recognize Noel either,\" rendering his answers \"even if incorrect,\" still \"honest[ ] respon[ses] to the Court's inquiries.\" Suppl. App. 33-34. The District Court therefore denied the new trial motion without a hearing, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Noel makes three principal arguments on appeal: (A) that the District Court's limitation on the cross-examination of his codefendants violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause; (B) that the District Court abused its discretion in denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his new trial motion; and (C) that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. We address these issues in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Cross-Examination Limitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Noel contends that the District Court, by precluding cross-examination on the specific details of his codefendants' sentencing exposure, violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. However, because the District Court did permit cross-examination in more general terms about the codefendants' sentencing reductions and other benefits of cooperation, and we are persuaded that this information was \"sufficient ..., without the excluded evidence, to make a discriminating appraisal of the possible biases and motivation of the witness[ ],\" we perceive no error, much less constitutional error, in the limitation on cross-examination in this case.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/210/#p219\">\n    326 F.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Amend. VI. Primary among those rights is \"the right of cross-examination,\" which may include questions \"directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Alaska\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/#p315\">\n    415 U.S. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/#p315\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174956\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/308/#p315\">\n    39 L.Ed.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) (citations omitted). Despite this guarantee, trial judges retain \"wide latitude ... to impose reasonable limits on ... cross examination,\" which a defendant may overcome by showing that, had the proposed line of inquiry been permitted, the jury\n   \"might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness's] credibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Delaware v. Van Arsdall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p679\">\n    475 U.S. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679-80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p679\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p679\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In light of these principles, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chandler\n   </em>\n   , we derived from\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdall\n   </em>\n   a two-part test to determine whether a particular limitation on cross-examination violated a defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311916\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/210/#p219\">\n    326 F.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, we determine whether the limitation \"significantly inhibited [the defendant's] effective exercise of her right to inquire into [the] witness's 'motivation in testifying.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9311916\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/210/#p219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p679\">\n    475 U.S. at 678-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p679\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

There, the trial court allowed a witness to testify that he pleaded guilty to carrying a smaller amount of drugs than he had actually carried and that he received only one month of house arrest plus probation even though the offense to which he pleaded guilty carried a possible twelve to eighteen-month sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221-22.
