The crash resulted from the criminally reckless driving of police officer Stephen Homanko. Sauers later brought this suit against Homanko and others pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and state law for, among other things, violating his and his wife's Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. Homanko moved to dismiss the \u00a7 1983 claim for failure to state a claim and, in the alternative, he sought qualified immunity. The District Court denied the motion and Homanko appealed. Because we conclude that it was not clearly established at the time of the crash that Homanko's conduct, as alleged in the complaint, could give rise to constitutional liability under the Fourteenth Amendment, we will vacate the District Court's denial of qualified immunity. We hope, however, to establish the law clearly now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 12, 2014, Sauers and his wife were driving southbound on Route 209 in the Borough of Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania. At the same time, Homanko was on patrol on Route 209 and traveling in the same direction when he observed the driver of a yellow Dodge Neon commit a summary traffic offense in the northbound lane. Based on that observation alone, he turned around and began to pursue the Dodge. At some point he took the time to radio ahead to the police in the neighboring borough to request that officers there pull the Dodge over when it reached their jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Homanko then decided that catching the Dodge himself was important enough to warrant a chase at speeds of over 100 miles-per-hour. Several members of the public observed him driving recklessly. During the pursuit, Homanko lost control of his police car while going around a curve. His car began to spin, crossed the center line into southbound traffic, and crashed into Sauers's car. The accident seriously injured Sauers and killed his wife. Homanko was subsequently charged and pled guilty to vehicular homicide, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of reckless or grossly negligent driving, and reckless endangerment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The criminal case was not the end of Homanko's legal trouble. Sauers - individually and as the administrator of his wife's estate - initiated the present lawsuit against him, setting forth federal and state law causes of action, including a claim under \u00a7 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sauers premised his \u00a7 1983 claim on a \"state-created danger\" theory of liability. Homanko moved to dismiss only that claim. He argued that the complaint\n   did not plausibly allege a state-created danger claim and, in the alternative, that he was entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established in May 2014 that negligent or reckless police driving could give rise to a constitutional cause of action. The District Court denied Homanko's motion as to both liability and qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to liability, the Court determined that the complaint adequately pled a state-created danger claim, a determination that Homanko does not now appeal. The Court further concluded that the law was clearly established in May 2014 that \"any reasonable officer would have known that pursuing a potential traffic offender in excess of 100 miles-per-hour under the[ ] circumstances [alleged in the complaint] gives rise to a state-created danger claim.\" (App. at 21.) That determination is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, courts assessing a claim of qualified immunity must answer two questions. One is whether the defendant's conduct violated a statutory or constitutional right. The other is whether the right at issue was clearly established when the conduct took place. We have discretion to address either inquiry first.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its recent decisions addressing qualified immunity, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela v.

The question in this case therefore cannot be framed simply in terms of recklessness generally. Homanko's request for qualified immunity must be assessed within the context of the case law that has developed from accidents caused by high-speed police pursuits that injure third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Sauers's Complaint Pleads a Plausible State-Created Danger Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Homanko has not appealed the District Court's determination that the complaint adequately describes a constitutional violation, and for good reason. The pleadings describe a police officer driving at speeds over 100 miles-per-hour on a two-way, undivided road to catch someone who had committed a minor traffic infraction. There was no emergency at all, and Homanko likely did the most that was warranted when he radioed the police in a neighboring jurisdiction to stop the offender. His hyper-aggressive decision to chase the Dodge cannot be justified. Nonetheless, to determine whether his conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right, we must take the time to define that right and explain why the conduct violated it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defining a right at the appropriate level of specificity is often the most critical aspect of a qualified immunity analysis. In undertaking that task, we are guided by the Supreme Court's repeated instructions\n   to do so in light of the particular facts of the case at hand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1152\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1152 ;\n   <em>\n    White v.

(App. at 16.) That places the fact-pattern in the second category of culpability, requiring inferences or allegations of a conscious disregard of a great risk of serious harm. That conclusion is supported by the allegation that Homanko, at some point, had time to call the neighboring police department as he was contemplating his actions. It is further supported by an obvious inference from the nature of the Dodge driver's mild provocation: there was no emergency arising from a simple traffic violation. The liability question thus becomes whether deciding to pursue a potential summary traffic offender at speeds of over 100 miles-per-hour, after radioing for assistance from the neighboring jurisdiction where the potential offender was headed, demonstrates a conscious disregard of a great risk of serious harm. We have no difficulty in concluding that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Engaging in a high-speed pursuit on public roadways at speeds of over 100 miles-per-hour threatens \"all those within ... range [of the pursuit], be they suspects, their passengers, other drivers, or bystanders.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    523 U.S. at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Responding to a true emergency may be a reasonable justification. Pursuing an actively fleeing suspect who is endangering the public welfare may also be a reasonable justification. But attempting to catch someone who has committed a minor traffic offense, especially when other law enforcement officials have been alerted to stop the offender, is not a reasonable justification for driving \"careless[ly]\" and at \"speed[s] in excess of 100 mph.\" (App. at 31-32.) Homanko did not have to make a split-second decision \"in haste\" and \"under pressure.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    523 U.S. at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). He could have let the officers in the neighboring jurisdiction handle the routine traffic stop as, in fact, they did. Instead, he chose to engage in a reckless and unjustifiable pursuit, with tragic consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, Sauers adequately pled that Homanko's conduct was conscience-shocking under our state-created danger framework. The complaint therefore contains a plausible claim that Homanko violated Sauers's and his wife's Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Right at Issue Was Not Clearly Established In May 2014.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The existence of a substantive due process claim having been established, we now turn to the central issue of this appeal, namely whether Homanko had fair warning that he could be subject to constitutional liability for actions taken in conscious disregard of a great risk of harm during the course of a police pursuit. We conclude that he did not. At the time of the crash in May 2014, the state of the law was such that police officers may have understood they could be exposed to constitutional liability for actions taken during a police pursuit only when they had an intent to harm. Thus, it was not at that time clearly established that Homanko's actions\n   could violate the substantive due process rights of Sauers and his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A right is clearly established when the law is \"sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <em>\n    Reichle v.

Concur./Dissent at 727-28. To the dissent, it is of high importance that the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   applied a deliberate difference standard to a police driving case that, as here, involved neither an emergency nor an actively fleeing suspect. But the dissent discounts the fact that no court of appeals (until now) has joined the Tenth Circuit in distinguishing between those police pursuit cases in which a true exigency exists and those in which less is at stake. As we have described above, at least two courts of appeals have explicitly questioned the sort of distinction drawn by the Tenth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We agree with the Tenth Circuit's application of a culpability standard below that of \"intent to harm\" in a non-emergency police pursuit case - indeed the entire panel here is in accord on that point. Where we part company with our dissenting colleague is at his rejection of the rest of the Tenth Circuit's decision. That court acknowledged that the law was not yet clearly established. We accept the accuracy of that assessment then and believe the law as of May 2014 still remained unsettled; our dissenting colleague disagrees. While he evidently views the legal conclusion about constitutional liability as obvious, we do not. Nor can we say that the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   alone amounts to the \" 'robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority' in the Court of Appeals\" that we have held necessary to clearly establish a right in the absence of controlling precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Mammaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144693\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/164/#p169\">\n    814 F.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589956\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2042/#p2044\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2044 ).

Establishing the Law in the Third Circuit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although the state of the law in May 2014 was unsettled as to whether police officers engaged in a police pursuit could be subject to constitutional liability for a level of culpability less than an intent to harm, our opinion today should resolve any ambiguity in that regard within this Circuit. Police officers now have fair warning that their conduct when engaged in a high-speed pursuit will be subject to the full body of our state-created danger case law. That law clearly establishes that the level of culpability required to shock the conscience exists on a spectrum tied to the amount of time a government official has to act. In the police pursuit context, it is also necessary to take into consideration the officer's justification for engaging in the pursuit. We recognize that most high-speed police pursuits arise when officers are responding to emergencies or when they must make split-second decisions to pursue fleeing suspects. Our holding today does nothing to alter the longstanding principle that, in such cases, constitutional liability cannot exist absent an intent to harm. But when there is no compelling justification for an officer to engage in a high-speed pursuit and an officer has time to consider whether to engage in such inherently risky behavior, constitutional liability can arise when the officer proceeds to operate his vehicle in a manner that demonstrates a conscious disregard of a great risk of serious harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

To endorse the majority's conclusion, one must accept the proposition that on May 12, 2014, a reasonable police officer-fully informed of the legal principles recited above-would not have considered it conscience-shocking to (1) execute a U-turn into oncoming traffic for the sole purpose of catching a potential traffic offender, and then (2) proceed in breakneck fashion to pursue the unmindful offender at speeds over 100 miles-per-hour, all while being fully aware that there are officers ahead better positioned to execute a stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Our case law does not compel such an implausible conclusion.

The majority in\n   <em>\n    Sitzes\n   </em>\n   relied upon the fact that the officer in question subjectively believed that he was responding to an emergency in holding that the \"intent to harm\" standard, and not a \"deliberate indifference\" or \"conscious disregard of a great risk of serious harm\" standard, applied to the officer's conduct. Significantly, the majority plainly indicated that the \"intent to harm\" standard would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   control where the officer did not subjectively believe that the situation presented a real emergency, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Although we are deeply troubled by Officer Wright's actions, we cannot say that the district court erred in applying the intent-to-harm standard in this case. First, we must reject plaintiffs' primary argument, which bases liability on the situation ... not being a \"true\" emergency.\n   <em>\n    Terrell [v. Larson],\n   </em>\n   forecloses inquiry into the objective nature of the emergency, as substantive due process liability turns on the intent of the government actor. 396 F.3d [975], 980 [ (8th Cir. 2005) ]. Thus, the fact that the situation ... was not as serious as those presented in\n   <em>\n    Helseth\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Terrell\n   </em>\n   , or that it might not qualify as an \"emergency\" under the [police department] Policy and Procedure manual, is not determinative of the appropriate level of scrutiny. Neither is the fact, emphasized by the dissent,\n   that Officer McDougal and others testified that they would never have driven in the manner that Officer Wright did, or that Officer McDougal responded to the situation ... differently than Officer Wright. This would all be more relevant if our question was whether the situation was an objectively \"true\" emergency. However, it bears little relevance to the question of what Officer Wright subjectively believed. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   We agree with the dissent that our opinion should not be read to establish a rule that an officer can insulate himself from substantive due process liability, no matter the circumstances, by simply averring that he subjectively believed the situation to which he was responding was an emergency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrell\n   </em>\n   , 396 F.3d at 980 n. 2. This could lead to the absurd results forecasted by the dissent. For example, the dissent fears that this case could be used to insulate from substantive due process liability an officer who drove \"100 miles per hour through a children's playground during recess time,\" or an officer who drove \"the wrong way down an interstate highway ... when responding to something as routine as a reported accident requiring traffic control[,]\" as long as the officer stated that he believed the situation to be an emergency. First, such cases are far beyond the factual scenarios of\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Helseth\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Terrell\n   </em>\n   , which involved officers using conventional emergency driving techniques to respond to perceived emergencies. Nothing in our opinion would countenance granting summary judgment in either of the two situations presented by the dissent. Second, we think it very likely that an officer who intentionally drove through a playground or the wrong way on an interstate highway could be held liable even under the intent-to-harm standard, regardless of the officer's avowed belief, at least absent some compelling exigency not described in the hypotheticals. In sum, we do not understand this case to establish a per se rule that an officer's self-serving affidavit will always insulate that officer from substantive due process liability. Instead, we simply hold that the plaintiffs have failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to Officer Wright's subjective belief and that this belief is not so preposterous as to reflect bad faith on the part of Officer Wright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 468, 469-70. Thus, far from rejecting application of a conscious disregard standard to police conduct that did not concern an emergency situation,\n   <em>\n    Sitzes\n   </em>\n   actually suggests that such a standard does apply when it is clear that the officer was not confronted with an emergency situation. And in our case, we are in full agreement that \"[t]here was no emergency at all, and Homanko likely did the most that was warranted when he radioed the police in a neighboring jurisdiction to stop the offender.\" Maj. Op. at 716. The reliance in\n   <em>\n    Sitzes\n   </em>\n   on the officer's belief in that case that he faced an emergency situation can be read as providing notice to law enforcement officers that they are not insulated from liability for engaging in egregiously reckless criminal conduct in a non-emergency context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   on the other hand-as the majority plainly recognized-\"arose in a non-emergency setting and did not involve a suspect fleeing the police in a dangerous manner.\" Maj.

Like the majority here, we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Kedra\n   </em>\n   that the allegations gave rise to the inference that the officer \"acted with actual knowledge of a substantial risk of lethal harm\" so as to shock the conscience under a then-clearly established theory of deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 448 (citations omitted).
