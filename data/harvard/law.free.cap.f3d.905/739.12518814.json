When he was sentenced, the District Court concluded that he was subject to sentencing enhancements for, among other things, being a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"U.S.S.G.\" or \"the guidelines\"). That conclusion was based in part on Abdullah's 2015 conviction for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon under \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(2) of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated (\"N.J.S.A.\"). Abdullah now appeals his sentence, arguing that the career-offender enhancement does not apply to him because his New Jersey conviction for third-degree aggravated assault is not a \"crime of violence\" under the guidelines. We disagree and, for the reasons that follow, will affirm the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Abdullah was involved in a drug-trafficking organization that distributed heroin in New Jersey. He was arrested by federal agents and charged in a two-count information with knowingly and intentionally conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and with illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). He pled guilty to both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In preparation for recommending how the guidelines should apply at sentencing, a probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"). The PSR reflected a base offense level of 28, after concluding that Abdullah had been supplied with, and was thus responsible for, at least 700 grams of heroin. The PSR then recited a number of enhancements and adjustments in calculating the total offense level. One enhancement was for Abdullah's career offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was determined on the basis of two earlier felony convictions, one of which was a 2015 conviction in New Jersey state court for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another adjustment was made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a) for Abdullah's role as an organizer or leader of a conspiracy that involved at least five participants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abdullah\n   objected to the attribution of at least 700 grams of heroin to him and to application of the organizer-or-leader and career-offender enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At sentencing, he reiterated those objections and the District Court overruled them. It concluded then and in a detailed post-hearing opinion that Abdullah was responsible for at least 700 grams of heroin and that application of the four-level organizer-or-leader enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(a) was appropriate. It also determined that Abdullah's conviction under N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(2) for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon categorically qualified as a \"crime of violence\" under the guidelines. Thus, the Court applied the career-offender enhancement as provided in \u00a7 4B1.1, which put Abdullah's offense level at 34. After other adjustments for acceptance of responsibility, the total offense level was 31, and his criminal history category was VI. The resulting recommended guidelines sentencing range was 188 to 235 months' imprisonment, two to five years of supervised release, and $30,000 to $5 million in fines. The Court ultimately sentenced Abdullah to 176 months' imprisonment and five years of supervised release on the controlled substance charge, and a concurrent 120 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release on the firearm charge. It waived any fine but ordered him to forfeit his firearm and associated ammunition, and it imposed special assessments totaling $200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Abdullah challenges his sentence on the same three grounds he pressed before the District Court: first, that he is not a career offender because his conviction under New Jersey law for third-degree aggravated assault does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under the guidelines; second, that the organizer-or-leader enhancement does not apply to him; and third, that it was factually erroneous to hold him responsible for 700 grams or more of heroin. None of those arguments is persuasive, but only the one regarding the career offender question needs consideration. Because Abdullah is a career offender, his other sentencing complaints are of no consequence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the guidelines, a defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he \"has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). In 2015, the guidelines defined a \"crime of violence\" as \"any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that[:]\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (2015).

He pled guilty to third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in violation of subsection (b)(2) of the statute, as stated in the PSR without objection, confirmed by the judgment of conviction, and admitted by Abdullah through counsel.

That explanation in\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   was enough for us to conclude in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   that \"aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which similarly requires proving the attempted, knowing, or intentional causation of bodily injury, is categorically a violent crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Abdullah makes several arguments aimed at avoiding that logical conclusion. First, he contends that, because the New Jersey legislature has distinguished between \"bodily injury\" and \"use of force\" in its criminal statutes, those two phrases must be understood as mutually exclusive. (Opening Br. at 10.) Specifically, because New Jersey makes a person \"guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he ... [i]nflicts bodily injury\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   uses force upon another[,]\" in Chapter 15 of its criminal code, its use of the words \"bodily injury\" in Chapter 12 was a purposeful attempt to exclude the use of force from the definition of third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. (Opening Br. at 10 (quoting N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:15-1(a)(1) ) ). That speculation about legislative intent, however, fails to undercut the force of our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   that the causation of bodily injury, or threat thereof, with a deadly weapon necessarily entails a use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force.\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517251\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/599/#p606\">\n    892 F.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Abdullah cites a number of non-precedential district court cases for the argument that \" 'bodily injury,' as compared to 'serious bodily injury' and 'significant bodily injury',\" is insufficient to satisfy the physical force required in the definition of \"crime of violence\" under the guidelines. (Opening Br. at 13.) Relying particularly on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Knight\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-004,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20223701\">\n    2016 WL 223701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Jan. 19, 2016), he contends that \"mere 'physical discomfort, or a sensation caused by a kick' is sufficient bodily injury for purposes of proving assault under the New Jersey statute[, but is insufficient] to qualify as 'serious bodily injury' under the federal generic definition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20223701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *6 n.6. Assuming without deciding that that were true, Abdullah ignores that the court in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   was analyzing aggravated assault under a different provision, \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(5)(a), and that the bodily injury referenced in \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(2), the provision that is at issue here, must have been caused or attempted \"with a deadly weapon[.]\" That kind of injury naturally involves the use, attempted use, or threat to use the type of violent physical force contemplated by the guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517251\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/599/#p606\">\n    892 F.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that it stretches the imagination to think \"a person could knowingly or intentionally injure, or attempt to injure, another person with a deadly weapon without engaging in at least some affirmative, forceful conduct\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Abdullah argues that the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   with respect to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) cannot be extended to the New Jersey statutory provision at issue here. He says that, \"whereas\n   Pennsylvania's definition of a deadly weapon is strictly\n   <em>\n    subjective to the perpetrator\n   </em>\n   ..., New Jersey's 'deadly weapon' can alternatively be\n   <em>\n    subjective to the victim\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Opening Br. at 15-16.) He points to no authority, though, and we can find none, suggesting that merely because one takes the perspective of the victim rather than of the defendant, the use of a deadly weapon to cause or attempt to cause bodily injury does not involve at least a threat of violent physical force.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Damaso-Mendoza v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822168\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/1245/#p1250\">\n    653 F.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (10th Cir. 2011) (\"There is a threatened use of physical force against the person ... of another whether the object used by the perpetrator is a true deadly weapon or just looks like one.\" (citation, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted) ). To the extent Abdullah argues that the New Jersey statute criminalizes conduct using a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement less than that necessary for generic aggravated assault because the focus is placed on the victim's state of mind rather than the defendant's state of mind with respect to the deadly weapon element, we disagree. Section 2C:12-1(b)(2) requires proving that the defendant purposely or knowingly used an instrument or substance in a way that \"would lead the victim reasonably to believe it to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   N.J.S.A. \u00a7 2C:11-1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the end of the day, \"it is [still] nearly impossible to conceive of a scenario in which a person could knowingly or intentionally injure, or attempt to injure, another person with a deadly weapon without engaging in at least some affirmative, forceful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517251\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/599/#p606\">\n    892 F.3d at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore hold that a conviction for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon under New Jersey law, \u00a7 2C:12-1(b)(2), is categorically a crime of violence under the elements clause of the guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   That means Abdullah's conviction under that statute qualifies as a crime of violence and the career-offender enhancement is applicable. We thus affirm the District Court's decision to apply it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Abdullah also argues that the District Court erred when it found by a preponderance of the evidence that at least 700 grams of heroin were attributable to him, which set his base offense level at 28, and that he was an organizer or leader of the drug-trafficking organization, which raised his offense level by four points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). Those issues are moot, however, because we have concluded that the career-offender enhancement applies. Even if four points were subtracted from his offense level due to an alleged error in calculating the drug quantity and another four were subtracted for misapplication\n   of the organizer-or-leader enhancement, Abdullah's final offense level would remain unaffected because the career-offender enhancement requires that his minimum offense level be 34.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b) (instructing that a career offender facing a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years or more must be given an offense level of at least 34).
