In 2001, Upper Arlington adopted a Master Plan to guide its zoning decisions. The Master Plan emphasizes the need to increase the City's revenue by attracting business development in the small portion of the City's land that is devoted to commercial use. To further the Master Plan's goals, Upper Arlington's Unified Development Ordinance (Development Ordinance) restricts the use of areas zoned as an office-and-research-center district (office district) to specific uses that are primarily commercial. The operation of schools, both secular and religious, is a prohibited use within the office district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Despite this prohibition, Tree of Life decided in 2010 to purchase a large office building on a 16-acre tract of land that is located within the office district (the Property) for the purpose of operating a pre-K through 12th-grade school. After failing to secure authorization from Upper Arlington to operate a school on the Property, Tree of Life filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, arguing, among other things, that the Development Ordinance violates the \"equal terms\" provision of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1), by treating the school less favorably than comparable nonreligious land uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After two prior appeals to this court, the parties filed cross-motions for final judgment. The district court granted Upper Arlington's motion and denied Tree of Life's, holding that the Development Ordinance is no more onerous to Tree of Life than it is to nonreligious entities that generate comparably small amounts of revenue for the City. Because Tree of Life has not established a prima facie case under RLUIPA's equal terms provision, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Upper Arlington's land-use policies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upper Arlington's Master Plan stresses the need for the City to create \"new revenue\" to \"meet its current capital needs and support its current level of services,\" noting that \"commercial office use provides significantly more revenue to the City than any other land use.\" Commercial office use is authorized on less than five percent of the City's land. And because Upper Arlington is landlocked and fully developed, the preservation of its office districts for commercial use is of utmost importance to the City. The Master Plan also singles out personal income taxes as \"an important source of Upper Arlington's revenues\" and emphasizes that \"every effort will be made to broaden and expand the City's employment base in order to increase these tax revenues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In keeping with the Master Plan's emphasis on commercial office use and the generation of income-tax revenue, the City's Development Ordinance specifies that office-district zones within the City are meant to \"provide job opportunities and services to residents and contribute to the City's economic stability.\" Upper Arlington, Ohio, Unified Dev. Ordinance \u00a7 5.03(A)(6), https://library.municode.com/oh/upper_arlington/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PT11UNDEOR. Permitted uses within the office district include \"business and professional offices, research and development, book and periodical publishing, insurance carriers, corporate data centers, survey research firms, bank finance and loan offices, outpatient surgery centers, [and] hospitals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As previously noted, both secular and religious schools are specifically prohibited uses. Places of worship are conditional uses, meaning that they are permitted in\n   the office district, but only with approval from the Board of Zoning and Planning (the Board).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 5, tbl. 5-C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Child daycare centers (hereinafter, \"daycares\") are also prohibited uses in the office district under the Development Ordinance as presently worded. Dev. Ordinance \u00a7 5.03(A)(6);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   art. 5, tbl. 5-C. But they were permitted prior to 2011, when the City Council amended the Ordinance to exclude them in response to this litigation. Upper Arlington, Ohio, Ordinance 52-2011 (Sept. 12, 2011). Chad Gibson, Upper Arlington's Senior Planning Officer, testified in a deposition that the City previously intended daycares to be an ancillary use in the office district, designed not to generate revenue but to \"facilitate the general office district\" by providing \"a place where workers in the office complex could drop off their children during work hours in a safe environment.\" Although Gibson noted that \"typically daycares are not massive in size,\" he acknowledged that the prior iteration of the Development Ordinance did not restrict their size, so a large daycare would have been a permitted use within the office district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Tree of Life purchased property within the office district.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tree of Life, a religious nonprofit corporation, operates a private Christian school that currently serves 532 students and has a workforce of 150 employees spread across three campuses throughout the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. The school believes that its lack of a unified campus inhibits its growth and limits its enrollment numbers. Accordingly, Tree of Life began searching in 2008 for a site where it could consolidate its campuses and serve a larger population of students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2009, AOL/Time Warner, a media company that is not a party to this litigation, vacated a 254,000-square-foot office building-the largest in Upper Arlington-located on the Property. AOL/Time Warner generated significant revenue for Upper Arlington during the time that it occupied the Property through a combination of property taxes and income taxes levied on both the company and its employees. In 2001, for example, AOL/Time Warner accounted for 29% of all income-tax revenue collected by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tree of Life signed a purchase agreement for the Property in October 2009, and the sale was finalized in August 2010. The purchase agreement contained a contingency clause that allowed Tree of Life to cancel the purchase if, prior to the closing, it was unable to obtain Upper Arlington's approval for the rezoning of the Property to allow for the operation of a school. During the allotted time, Upper Arlington made no commitment to rezone the Property or otherwise authorize the operation of a school on the premises. Tree of Life nevertheless decided to move forward with the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Upper Arlington declined to accommodate Tree of Life's desire to operate a school on the Property.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before acquiring the Property, Tree of Life filed a conditional-use application with Upper Arlington's Department of Development. The application stated that the property would be used as a church with an included school. The Board, however, rejected Tree of Life's characterization of its intended use of the Property, ruling that \"the proposed primary use of the property as a private school does not constitute a 'place of worship, church' as that term is used in [the Development Ordinance], and is therefore not a conditional use in the [office district].\" The City Council upheld the Board's decision. In a separate set of rulings, the Board and the City Council also rejected Tree of Life's argument that\n   a private school should be allowed as a permitted conditional use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the course of this litigation, Tree of Life submitted an application to the Department of Development to request that the Development Ordinance be amended to permit private religious schools to operate in the office district. Gibson, as Upper Arlington's Senior Planning Officer, prepared a staff report recommending that the City Council reject the amendment. Among other criticisms of the proposed amendment, the report concluded that allowing private religious schools \"within the City's extremely limited commercial areas is simply not necessary or beneficial to the City, and it is likely that negative long-term economic consequences will result.\" Based on this recommendation, the City Council denied the proposed amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Tree of Life next filed an application requesting that the Property be rezoned for residential use. Echoing the reasons for his opposition to Tree of Life's first proposed zoning amendment, Gibson issued a staff report urging the City Council to reject this second proposed amendment as well. The report noted that the northern boundary of the Property \"has the greatest opportunity for intense office use\" in Upper Arlington and that rezoning the Property for residential use would therefore \"be contrary to the City's long-term financial interests.\" Based on Gibson's recommendation, the City Council rejected Tree of Life's second proposed amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Tree of Life filed suit after Upper Arlington rejected its conditional-use application. The complaint alleged violations of (1) RLUIPA's substantial-burden and equal terms provisions; (2) the First Amendment's Free Speech, Assembly, Free Exercise, and Establishment Clauses; (3) the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and (4) Article 1, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution. Tree of Life seeks both equitable relief to allow it to operate on the Property and compensatory damages for the harm that it has allegedly suffered as a result of Upper Arlington's refusal to accommodate the proposed school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shortly after filing suit, Tree of Life moved for a preliminary injunction based on its equal protection and RLUIPA equal terms claims. Although the district court found that Tree of Life was likely to succeed on the merits of its RLUIPA claim (but not on its equal protection claim), it concluded that the other preliminary injunction factors favored Upper Arlington. The court, after balancing all the factors, denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Upper Arlington then filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the case was not ripe for adjudication because Tree of Life had not yet requested that the City rezone the Property to allow the school to operate there. The district court granted the motion,\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v. City of Upper Arlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4319691\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/888/883/#p897\">\n    888 F.Supp.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897 (S.D. Ohio 2012), and Tree of Life appealed to this court. While Tree of Life's appeal was pending, the school filed its first zoning-amendment application, prompting this court to remand the case to the district court.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v.

Tree of Life filed its second zoning-amendment application following the remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On remand, both parties sought summary judgment, and the district court granted Upper Arlington's motion and denied Tree of Life's.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v.

Ohio 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court held that because Upper Arlington excludes both secular and religious schools from the office district, the City's land-use regulations do not violate RLUIPA's equal terms provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n    at 899-900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to Tree of Life's other federal claims, the court held that they were all either abandoned or legally deficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 894 n.4, 900-04. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Tree of Life's state-law claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n    at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tree of Life then filed a second appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This court held on the second appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Upper Arlington on Tree of Life's RLUIPA equal terms claim.\n   <em>\n    Tree of LifeSch. v. City of Upper Arlington (Tree of Life II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    823 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (6th Cir. 2016). According to the court, Tree of Life created a genuine dispute of material fact by making unrebutted allegations that other entities permitted within the office district are \"similarly situated [to the school] with respect to maximizing revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case was therefore remanded for the purpose of answering two specific questions: (1) \"Are there nonreligious assemblies or institutions to which the court should compare Tree of Life Christian Schools because they would fail to maximize income-tax revenue,\" and (2) \"if so, would those assemblies or institutions be treated equally to [Tree of Life]?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On remand for the second time, the parties filed cross-motions for final judgment. Tree of Life argued, as it does in this third appeal, that daycares and partially used offices are similarly situated to the proposed school in terms of their minimal capacity to generate revenue for Upper Arlington.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v. City of Upper Arlington\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-cv-09,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204563897\">\n    2017 WL 4563897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 13, 2017). Noting that the current version of the Development Ordinance does not permit daycares within the office district, the district court implied that Tree of Life's claim is moot if based on daycares as a comparator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. To avoid any possibility of Upper Arlington reverting to the prior iteration of the Ordinance, the court issued an injunction preserving the Development Ordinance's current ban on daycares in the office district.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court alternatively held that daycares are not similarly situated to Tree of Life's proposed school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. In doing so, the court found that the analysis done by Upper Arlington's expert witness, Catherine Armstrong, was more persuasive than the analyses done by Tree of Life's expert witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Armstrong's report demonstrated that \"a daycare located at the Property would generate seven times more tax revenue for the City than Tree of Life\" would generate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court also held that \"full use of one assembly or institution compared to the full use of another type of assembly or institution\" is the proper lens through which to analyze RLUIPA equal terms claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. Any other approach would be improper, according to the court, because a \"city can set forth the regulatory purpose, but ... cannot demand full use of a property to realize that purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Having rejected both uses proposed by Tree of Life as comparators, the court entered final judgment for Upper Arlington.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the second remand, the parties agreed to file cross-motions for final judgment and waive any oral presentation of evidence. This effectively amounted to a bench trial based on (1) a waiver of a jury trial under\n   Rule 38(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and (2) a request that the court make findings of fact and conclusions of law based on a stipulated record pursuant to Rule (52)(a)(1). Our standard of review is thus controlled by\n   <em>\n    T. Marzetti Co. v.

Tree of Life's RLUIPA equal terms claim is the only one remaining.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to its RLUIPA equal terms claim, Tree of Life initially brought several other claims. This court upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Upper Arlington on Tree of Life's equal protection and free exercise claims and held that Tree of Life had abandoned its state-law claim.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    823 F.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prior to the second appeal, the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of Upper Arlington on Tree of Life's claims under the First Amendment's Establishment, Free Speech, and Assembly Clauses and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Schools v. City of Upper Arlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n    16 F.Supp.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902-04 (S.D.

It further concluded that Tree of Life had abandoned its RLUIPA substantial-burden claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4256011\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/16/883/#p904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 894 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This court did not address those rulings during the second appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    823 F.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did Tree of Life argue in its brief in support of its motion for final judgment or in its briefing for this appeal that any of those claims remain pending. Among those abandoned claims is any challenge to the City's determination that Tree of Life is neither a church nor a place of worship, so the dissent's sua sponte resurrection of that argument strikes us as unwarranted. Dissenting Op. at 384-86. Accordingly, the only remaining claim in this lawsuit is the RLUIPA equal terms claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Mootness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   During the second remand, the district court took the unusual step of sua sponte enjoining Upper Arlington from amending the Development Ordinance to once again permit daycares in the office district.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v. City of Upper Arlington\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:11-cv-09,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204563897\">\n    2017 WL 4563897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10, *16 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 13, 2017). Upper Arlington argues that the permanent injunction moots Tree of Life's claim insofar as it depends on daycares as a comparator. But Tree of Life persuasively answers that the injunction does not moot its claim because, in addition to equitable relief, the school also seeks compensatory damages for the harm that it has allegedly suffered on account of Upper Arlington's refusal to accommodate the proposed school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brandywine, Inc. v.

The litigation up to this point, however, has focused exclusively on the issue of liability. And this court's second remand directed the district court to focus solely on whether comparators exist that Upper Arlington treats more favorably than Tree of Life.\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917387\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/365/#p366\">\n    823 F.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tree of Life thus cannot be faulted for failing to introduce evidence and press its money-damages claim when the litigation agenda set by both this court and the district court has been directed entirely to\n   the issue of Upper Arlington's alleged liability under RLUIPA. Accordingly, Tree of Life has not abandoned its money-damages claim; nor did the district court's permanent injunction moot it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Whether Tree of Life has made out a prima facie case of a RLUIPA equal terms violation was not settled by the previous appeal.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Tree of Life in turn argues that this court has already held that the school has made out a prima facie case of an equal terms violation under RLUIPA.

Rather than evaluating whether a comparator is similarly situated to a religious entity by reference to the land-use regulation's purpose, the Tenth Circuit weighs whether the uses, despite not being \"identical,\" exhibit \"substantial similarities\" that would allow \"a reasonable jury to conclude that [the entities] were similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain Christian Church v.

The test therefore introduces significant subjectivity into the application of the equal terms provision.

Upper Arlington's assertion of revenue maximization as the purpose of the Development Ordinance is not pretextual.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Tree of Life next contends that revenue maximization is a pretextual explanation for the exclusion of schools from the office district because the Development Ordinance permits nonprofits in the district from which the city cannot collect property taxes or entity-level income taxes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5709.07, .12; Upper Arlington, Ohio, Revenue &amp; Fin.

But Upper Arlington need not tailor its zoning regulations to squeeze every last dollar out of the permitted uses within the office district to credibly claim that it has structured the Development Ordinance to generate more revenue than would be generated\n   without the restrictions. Moreover, Upper Arlington's 2001 Master Plan specifically identified the generation of personal-income-tax revenue as a zoning goal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Income taxes are an important source of Upper Arlington's revenues and every effort will be made to broaden and expand the City's employment base in order to increase these tax revenues. ... Encouraging development that helps attract well-paying jobs will enhance the income base. These jobs will in turn generate a higher level of income tax revenues, some of which can be targeted for regular maintenance of the City's infrastructure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because Upper Arlington is able to collect personal income taxes from a nonprofit's employees, the Development Ordinance's allowance for nonprofit entities in the office district does not contradict the asserted purpose of the regulation. Nor does Tree of Life argue that the Development Ordinance has been ineffective in generating revenue for the City. As previously noted, the prior occupant of the Property, AOL/Time Warner, accounted for 29% of all personal-income-tax revenue collected by the City in 2001. Accordingly, Tree of Life cannot credibly argue that the asserted purpose of the Development Ordinance is pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Daycares are the only potentially valid comparator put forward by Tree of Life.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Tree of Life put forward only daycares and partially used offices as comparators in its brief in support of its motion for final judgment. On appeal, the school also adds publishers as comparators and briefly mentions that outpatient-surgery centers are comparable. But the school's expert witnesses limited their analyses of potential comparators to daycares. Without any evidence that any other land uses generate less revenue for the City than would Tree of Life, they cannot be the foundation of a prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As for partially used offices, the district court persuasively explained why they are not an acceptable comparator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [I]f a partial use is accepted as a valid comparator, then there can never be a case in which a city with the goal of maximizing revenue could ever prevail. A city can set forth the regulatory purpose, but a city cannot demand full use of a property to realize that purpose. Therefore, for purposes of the analysis of similar comparators, the Court finds it should look to the comparison of the full use of one assembly or institution compared to the full use of another type of assembly or institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Tree of Life Christian Sch. v.

Ohio Oct. 13, 2017) (citations to the record and internal quotation marks omitted). Tree of Life argues that because the Development Ordinance does not set a floor for the number of workers that a user of land can employ, partially used offices are valid comparators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   But this argument could be used to undercut almost any regulatory purpose behind a land-use ordinance. All zoning decisions require the regulatory authority to project the effects that a particular land use will have on the municipality. A municipality seeking to maximize revenue must project the type of labor force that a particular land use will attract. Similarly, a municipality that is concerned about traffic congestion and noise pollution must project how each particular land use will impact those conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Irrespective of the regulatory goal, however, a municipality cannot guarantee that its predictions will be borne out once its policies go into effect. But municipalities\n   cannot be faulted for zoning decisions that utilize the best data available to make good-faith predictions in the face of such inherent uncertainties. The assumption that, as a general matter, entities within an office district will operate at full capacity strikes us as an appropriate good-faith prediction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, Tree of Life has offered no credible explanation for why an entity that requires only a small amount of square footage for its operation would choose to situate itself in (and pay for) a 254,000-square-foot building on a 16-acre tract of land. Tree of Life's only evidence that such a use might occur in the office district is that AOL/Time Warner used the Property at partial capacity as it wound down its operations there. But this short-term situation is clearly distinguishable from the City's long-term zoning goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We therefore conclude that the district court correctly assumed for the purpose of its analysis that regulators can reasonably contemplate full usage of property when making zoning decisions. Accordingly, daycares are the only potentially valid comparator that Tree of Life has put forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

Robert Siegel is an early-care and education consultant. Tree of Life asked him to estimate the number of employees required to operate a daycare located on the Property and the payroll that such a workforce would generate. The largest daycare with which Siegel was familiar serves 600 children. Accordingly, he based his estimates on the assumption that a daycare of that size would be housed at the office building on the Property. Siegel estimated that such a daycare would require 35,000 square feet of operating space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   He also determined that 170,000 square feet of the building on the Property is usable as a daycare. Thus, roughly 20% of the usable space on the Property would be devoted to the daycare that Siegel envisioned. Siegel noted, however, that the excess 135,000 square feet of usable space \"opens [up] all types of possibilities that would stabilize the [daycare], greatly improve program quality, and offer a marketplace advantage.\" He listed several of these ideas, including a \"gymnasium, indoor playground, several larger multi-purpose rooms, a nurses' office, parent lounge, cafeteria, teacher's only area, nursing room, additional conferencing space for parent meetings, or a training room.\" Siegel did not, however, offer any estimate for how much of the excess space those amenities might occupy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   According to Siegel, a workforce of 159 people would be needed to care for 600 children. And this estimate does not appear to account for staffing of any of the \"possibilities\" that Siegel envisioned for the excess 135,000 square feet of usable space because his budget chart does not list employees who would staff those areas. Siegel estimated that a workforce of 159 people would generate an annual payroll of $3,154,470.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Tree of Life retained its second expert witness, a business and financial consultant named Rebekah Smith, for the purpose of calculating the amount of income-tax revenue that various land uses on the Property would generate for Upper Arlington. Specifically, she estimated the amount of income-tax revenue that Tree of Life's proposed school and Siegel's hypothetical\n   daycare would generate. In doing so, she relied on the estimates of Tree of Life Superintendent Todd Marrah, who projected that the consolidated campus would serve 1,200 students with a workforce of 275 staff members, generating an annual payroll of $5,000,000, as well as Siegel's estimates noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Smith estimated, based on those numbers, that Tree of Life employees would pay $125,000 annually in income taxes to the City. By comparison, she estimated that Siegel's hypothetical daycare would yield $83,987 in annual personal-income-tax revenue if operated as a for-profit entity and $78,862 if operated as a nonprofit entity. Smith concluded, based on those figures, that \"Upper Arlington's tax benefit from the Tree of Life school operations would be better as compared\" to Siegel's hypothetical daycare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This analysis, however, is deeply flawed. It glosses over the partial use of the Property that Siegel's estimates reflect. Tree of Life paid AOL/Time Warner $26 per square foot for the 254,000-square-foot office building. One is hard-pressed to believe that a prudent operator of a daycare would pay approximately $5.7 million dollars for 219,000 square feet of excess space (254,000 square feet of total space minus 35,000 square feet for the hypothetical daycare) that would not be used as a daycare. (219,000 square feet of unused space x $26 per square foot \u02dc $5.7 million).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The far more likely scenario is that the vast remainder of the office building would not remain vacant, but would be utilized by the landowner for productive uses other than the daycare. This would result in the Property as a whole cumulatively generating far more revenue for the City than Tree of Life would generate by itself. So an accurate picture of relative revenue-generating capacities cannot be ascertained simply by comparing the absolute amount of income-tax revenue that Tree of Life's full use of the Property would generate to the amount that would be yielded by the 35,000 square feet contemplated for Siegel's hypothetical daycare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Upper Arlington's expert witness, Catherine Armstrong, provides a far superior basis for comparing the two entities. Armstrong, the City's former Director of Finance and Administrative Services, used actual data from the City to show how much tax revenue is yielded by various land uses that are permitted in the office district versus that produced by daycares. Rather than presenting this data in absolute terms, as Smith did, Armstrong calculated the amount of annual revenue per square foot generated by the various entities that she analyzed. This approach allows for an apples-to-apples comparison between entities of different sizes. Armstrong's data show that an existing for-profit daycare generates $4.77 in annual revenue per square foot for the City as compared to $0.62 per square foot that Tree of Life would generate. All other uses that she considered would generate revenue at even higher rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Not unreasonably, Tree of Life criticizes Armstrong's analysis because the daycare on which she based her calculations was a for-profit entity that paid property taxes and entity-level income taxes, whereas Tree of Life, as a nonprofit, would not pay either type of tax. But by combining the data in the reports generated by Siegel and Smith with the methodology used by Armstrong, an accurate comparison is possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As mentioned previously, Siegel's payroll estimate was based on 35,000 square feet of used space. Smith estimated that a payroll of the size estimated by Siegel would yield $78,862 in annual personal-income-tax revenue for the City from employees working at a nonprofit daycare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Those figures equate to $2.25 in annual revenue per square foot of used space, which is still more than three times the amount of revenue per square foot that Tree of Life would generate. That calculation is roughly the same as the amount of annual revenue per square foot that the daycare analyzed by Armstrong provides to Upper Arlington if one excludes the property taxes that the daycare pays ($9,300 in income taxes \u00f7 3,919 square feet = $2.37 per square foot).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In sum, Tree of Life has not established a prima facie case under RLUIPA's equal terms provision because it has failed to identify a permitted land use that would generate a comparably small amount of revenue for the City. Even the largest daycare with which Tree of Life's own expert witness is familiar would use only 35,000 square feet of the existing 254,000 square feet of available space in the office building on the Property. The application of Armstrong's methodology to Siegel's and Smith's data leads to the inexorable conclusion that daycares generate far more revenue on a per-square-foot basis than Tree of Life would. Accordingly, the school's equal terms claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

No. 106-219, at 23 (1999).

As they had done with racial minorities, municipalities clothed their objections to religious organizations with the same ordinary concerns: traffic, noise, and lost tax revenue. 146 Cong. Rec. 16,698 (2000) (joint statement of Senators Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy noting that \"often, discrimination lurks behind such vague and universally applicable reasons as traffic, aesthetics, or not consistent with the city's land use plan' \") (hereinafter Joint Statement). Instead of saying \"no Muslims allowed,\" city planners complained of the traffic on Fridays when Muslims gathered to pray.

Since the statutory terms do not make a distinction, courts have to look at whether the comparators actually received different treatment. Consider, for instance, an ordinance banning all assembly halls that can hold more than 500 members. A megachurch with over 500 members applies for a zoning exception,\n   and the city denies the request. But then an over-sized book club applies for an exception that the city grants. This time, the city has \"implemented\" the ordinance in a way that treats religious assemblies on \"less than equal terms\" than nonreligious assemblies.

Alternatively, the government might contend that the law does not treat the religious assembly or institution on \"less than equal terms.\" This would be a near-impossible task when it comes to facial inequality cases. But in either gerrymandered or as-applied/selective inequality cases, the government could provide evidence showing that the law in question does not actually treat religious assemblies differently. Maybe other buildings use steeples such that a ban does not \"almost only\" target religious uses. Or, in as-applied/selective inequality cases, the government might have evidence showing that the plaintiff did in fact receive equal treatment compared to other nonreligious assemblies or institutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centro Familiar Cristiano Buenas Nuevas v.

RLUIPA puts the burden on the government, not the plaintiff, to make that showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   One final point about the legal standard: because RLUIPA places the ultimate burden on the government, some courts have interpreted the text to include a strict scrutiny \"safe harbor.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-2(b) ;\n   <em>\n    Midrash Sephardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1229\">\n    366 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these courts, a zoning action that is a prima facie violation can be saved if the government can show that it satisfies strict scrutiny. But just as \"similarly situated\" does not appear anywhere in the Equal Terms provision, neither does \"strict scrutiny\" nor any other terms that might trigger a strict scrutiny analysis. And, again, when words do not appear in a statute, we should not add to what Congress\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   provided with what we think Congress\n   <em>\n    should have\n   </em>\n   provided. Congress could have told courts to apply strict scrutiny if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case. In fact, Congress did exactly that-in a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   provision in RLUIPA. Just a few lines above the Equal Terms subsection, Congress included a provision that prohibits governments from enacting land-use regulations that substantially burden religious exercise unless they have a \"compelling governmental interest\" and the regulation is the \"least restrictive means\" of furthering that interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(1). We thus know that Congress was aware of the strict scrutiny buzzwords and included\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of them in the Equal Terms provision.\n   <em>\n    Centro Familiar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754463\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1163/#p1173\">\n    651 F.3d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Constitutional phrases, 'substantial\n   burden,' 'compelling governmental interest,' and 'least restrictive means' are all included in the 'substantial burden' provision, not the 'equal terms' provision.\");\n   <em>\n    Lighthouse Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5639034\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/253/#p266\">\n    510 F.3d at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e find that Congress clearly signaled its intent that the operation of the Equal Terms provision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include strict scrutiny by the express language of [the Substantial Burden provision] ....\"). We must respect that decision and refrain from adding it in ourselves. And that means that if governments do not carry their burden once shifted, RLUIPA holds them liable without exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   That brings us to this case. In order to generate more revenue for municipal services, the City of Upper Arlington enacted a land-use ordinance that partitioned parts of the City into office-district zones. The ordinance divided land uses into three categories. Some land uses were permitted outright, such as banks, beauty parlors, business offices, daycares, hospitals, and outpatient surgery centers. Others were strictly prohibited, including schools. And some had to apply to the City for a conditional use permit, such as places of worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In 2010, Tree of Life Christian Schools purchased an office building in an office-district zone. Tree of Life wanted to consolidate its three separate campuses into one central location. But Tree of Life ran into a problem: the ordinance prohibited its intended use. And the city was unwilling to grant it a conditional permit as a place of worship. So Tree of Life filed a complaint in federal court alleging, among other things, that the City's ordinance violated the Equal Terms provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Nonreligious Assemblies or Institutions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In its complaint, Tree of Life presented at least two possible nonreligious assemblies or institutions as comparators: hospitals and daycares. The first option is easy. Hospitals are formal establishments that provide a public good-namely, health care. Moreover, dictionaries define a hospital as a \"charitable\n   <em>\n    institution\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   , https://merriamwebster.com/dictionary/hospital (2018) (emphasis added). So a hospital serves as a proper comparator under the Equal Terms provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Similarly, daycares are assemblies, and the parties do not argue otherwise. Parents drop their children off each day with the common purpose of leaving them with adult supervisors. And the daycare's activities center around a common purpose. From play time to nap time, everything in a daycare involves watching (and maybe even educating) the kids. As such, it's hard to escape the conclusion that a daycare counts as an assembly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    River of Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697875\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/367/\">\n    611 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes, J., dissenting). So a daycare also serves as a proper comparator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Even so, the City argues that daycares are not a proper comparator because its ordinance no longer allows daycares in that district. As it turns out, the City amended its ordinance to exclude daycares\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Tree of Life filed this lawsuit, and the district court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   issued an injunction prohibiting the City from adding them back in. Given these developments, the City now contends that the district court's injunction nullifies daycares as a proper comparator for purposes of this case. The City is wrong for two reasons. First, when Tree of Life applied for a conditional use permit, the ordinance allowed daycares without reservation while banning schools and requiring that \"places of worship, churches\" petition for approval. Tree of Life seeks compensatory damages\n   for the harm it suffered because of this unequal treatment. And when a plaintiff seeks damages, courts focus on that harmful moment rather than looking at subsequent government actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brandywine, Inc. v. City of Richmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286045\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/830/#p835\">\n    359 F.3d 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835-36 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that a subsequent zoning amendment did not moot claims for monetary damages). Otherwise, governments could always rewrite ordinances after-the-fact and avoid RLUIPA liability. Second, district courts cannot issue injunctions excising nonreligious assemblies from an ordinance to resolve an Equal Terms dispute. If they could, district courts could effectively nullify the Equal Terms provision by preventing plaintiffs from ever having valid comparators when bringing a claim. Plus, the proper remedy for Equal Terms violations is not to exclude the nonreligious but to include the religious.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    River of Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697875\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/367/\">\n    611 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes, J., dissenting) (\"The equal-terms provision is a remedy against exclusionary zoning; reading it to require equality of treatment with\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   secular assemblies ... gives religious assemblies no remedy at all.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    \"Less Than Equal Terms\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Tree of Life has also presented evidence showing that the ordinance treats it on \"less than equal terms\" than nonreligious assemblies or institutions under both the facial inequality theory and the as-applied/selective inequality theory. I address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Facial inequality.\n   </em>\n   As noted above, an ordinance treats a religious assembly on \"less than equal terms\" if it makes a distinction on its face. And the City's ordinance does just that. The ordinance allows daycares and hospitals to set up shop while requiring that \"places of worship, churches\" apply for a conditional use permit. The ordinance thus requires religious assemblies to take extra steps that nonreligious assemblies do not have to take. This express distinction establishes unequal treatment.\n   <em>\n    Elijah Grp., Inc. v. City of Leon Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647008\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/419/#p424\">\n    643 F.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (5th Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    Centro Familiar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754463\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/1163/#p1173\">\n    651 F.3d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The district court erred in holding otherwise. The district court thought that, because the ordinance treated all\n   <em>\n    schools\n   </em>\n   on equal terms, the ordinance did not facially violate RLUIPA. But that comparison is too narrow. The Equal Terms provision focuses on whether the ordinance treats religious assemblies and institutions on equal terms with all nonreligious assemblies and institutions. The comparators need not be of the same species.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any assembly or institution-here, church versus daycare or hospital-will do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   But the City advances another reason why the ordinance would survive a facial challenge. It contends that because Tree of Life's \"proposed primary use\" was to establish a private school, it does not qualify as a \"place of worship, church\" as that phrase is used in the ordinance. The ordinance, however, does not define \"place of worship, church\" or expressly exclude private religious schools from that category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Nevertheless, the City argues that customary dictionary definitions prove that a school is not a place of worship. But the City did not actually provide any definitions. And a closer look at dictionaries reveals that the City's customary definition is not so customary. Most dictionaries define a \"place of worship\" as \"a building where people gather to worship together.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Collins English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/place-of-worship (2018);\n   <em>\n    see also Merriam-Webster\n   </em>\n   , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/worship (2018) (defining \"worship\" as \"honor[ing] or rever[ing] ... a divine being\"). And Tree of Life's mission is to \"glorify God by educating students in His truth and discipling them in Christ.\" R. 2, Pg. ID 5. In doing so, Tree of Life \"puts the Bible at the center\" of its educational model and requires all students to evaluate their studies \"through the lens of God's Word.\" R. 2, Pg. ID 5. So students and teachers gather together to honor God through education. That looks a lot like a \"place of worship.\" In concluding otherwise, it appears that the City relied on its own subjective notions of worship-the exact unchecked discretion that RLUIPA prohibits. Campbell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1082 (\"[Z]oning laws are 'commonly administered through individualized processes not controlled by neutral and generally applicable rules.' \" (quoting H.R.

As such, the City's ordinance facially discriminates, and the City used the ordinance to discriminate against Tree of Life.

But the majority misses the bigger picture. Tree of Life brought one claim: under RLUIPA, the City's ordinance treated it on \"less than equal terms\" than nonreligious assemblies or institutions. And it advanced multiple arguments to support that claim. When the district court held that the ordinance did not violate the Equal Terms provision, that judgment subsumed all of those arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, on appeal, Tree of Life continues to press the same claim, supported (if not in the exact same words) by the same arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kamen v.

At oral argument, Tree of Life contended that it is a place of\n   worship and that it has not abandoned its facial argument. Oral Arg. at 1:27-3:45. And Tree of Life's brief contains everything necessary for that argument. In making its as-applied argument, Tree of Life also discussed all the necessary elements for the facial argument, just without the labels.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeal v. Kott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336809\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/590/566/#p569\">\n    590 F.

Plus, in its opposing brief, the City classifies \"Tree of Life [a]s a school, not a church\" to argue that its ordinance is nondiscriminatory. Appellee Br. 5, 44. Therefore, in the court's analysis of the ordinance, the City's proffered classification of Tree of Life-as a school and not a place of worship-should not be beyond judicial review just because Tree of Life did not use \"magic words\" in its own brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Campbell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1103 (criticizing Equal Terms jurisprudence that \"removes a government's regulatory objectives from judicial scrutiny\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    As-applied/selective inequality\n   </em>\n   . Tree of Life also demonstrated that the ordinance violates the Equal Terms provision under an as-applied/selective inequality theory. Even assuming Tree of Life does not qualify as a \"place of worship,\" it still faced a blanket ban, which other nonreligious assemblies and institutions did not. The ordinance bans schools, including Tree of Life. But the ordinance permits some nonreligious assemblies and institutions as of right-daycares and hospitals needed to do no more than set up shop in the district. So when the City denied Tree of Life's use-despite allowing daycares and hospitals without question-it treated Tree of Life on \"less than equal terms\" than nonreligious assemblies and institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Burden-Shifting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The City makes two arguments to rebut Tree of Life's prima facie case. Both are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    Tax Revenue.\n   </em>\n   First, the City argues that it did not treat Tree of Life unequally because every other comparator-daycares and hospitals included-produced far more tax revenue to the City than Tree of Life ever could. Thus, according to the City, it treated Tree of Life equally: revenue generation is what counts in zoning decisions under the ordinance, and Tree of Life produces less revenue. But that is only true if you let the City decide how to quantify revenue after the fact. For instance, one could measure revenue in total dollars. And under that metric, Tree of Life generates more tax dollars than the existing daycares in the district. But (at least in this case) the City does not want the courts to look at total dollars-only revenue\n   <em>\n    per square foot\n   </em>\n   . This tactic feels a lot like \"heads the City wins, tails Tree of Life loses.\" And if cities can take a vague regulatory purpose and define the parameters during the course of litigation, they can always avoid RLUIPA liability. All they have to do is find the parameters that make them win.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    River of Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697875\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/367/\">\n    611 F.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (criticizing the use of regulatory purpose as a \"guide to interpretation\" because such a use would make RLUIPA turn on the subjective notions of local officials). Of course, if the ordinance itself mandated a particular way of calculating revenue, the case might be different. But here, the City's formula is something of a liability-avoiding chameleon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Schools.\n   </em>\n   The City also argues that, irrespective of tax revenue, it did not treat Tree of Life differently\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   religion. Rather, the City prohibited Tree of Life because it was a\n   <em>\n    school\n   </em>\n   . And since the ordinance prohibits\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   schools, the City did not treat Tree of Life on \"less than\n   equal terms\" than any other school. That argument fails for two reasons. First, the City did not need to treat Tree of Life differently\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   religion to violate the Equal Terms provision. RLUIPA has an entirely separate section dealing with discrimination\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   religion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(2). The language of the Equal Terms provision, by contrast, requires no motive or bias.\n   <em>\n    River of Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697875\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/611/367/\">\n    611 F.3d at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sykes, J., dissenting). The plain language targets\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   unequal treatment. Reading intent into the Equal Terms provision would make the separate Antidiscrimination provision superfluous. And that is something that ordinary principles of statutory interpretation forbid us from doing.\n   <em>\n    Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    442 U.S. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531959\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/330/#p339\">\n    60 L.Ed.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979) (\"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect ... to every word Congress used.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Nor does pointing to a blanket ban on schools suffice to show that the City's treatment of Tree of Life was equal. Here again, the City's argument hinges on limiting the relevant inquiry to comparing schools. But the Equal Terms provision broadens the inquiry to all assemblies and institutions-after all, Tree of Life made out a prima facie case by showing that it had been treated differently from a daycare or a hospital. So rebutting Tree of Life's prima facie case is not as easy as labeling Tree of Life a school and a daycare not a school. The City must justify treating schools differently from daycares or hospitals. And it has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Accordingly, the City did not meet its burden of rebutting Tree of Life's prima facie case. It is liable under RLUIPA, and I would reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   There comes a time with every law when the Supreme Court must revisit what the circuits are doing. That time has come. Every circuit to address the issue has given its own gloss to the Equal Terms provision. Whether a religious plaintiff can succeed under the Equal Terms provision thus depends entirely on where it sues. And not only have the circuits split on the issue, but many of them have also neutralized the Equal Terms provision. By importing words into the text of the statute, the courts have usurped the legislative role and replaced their will for the will of the people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Federalist No. 47, at 325 (James Madison) (J.
