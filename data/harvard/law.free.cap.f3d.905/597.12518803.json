The district court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Freestream is a Bermudan full-service aircraft company in the business jet market. It participates in all aspects of aircraft transactions: brokerage, acquisition, marketing, sales, custom design services, import/export, and maintenance review. Freestream was founded in 1992 by Plaintiff Alireza Ittihadieh, a citizen of the United Kingdom who currently resides in Switzerland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   John Schmidt, a Washington resident, is an attorney at Aero. Aero is a Washington professional corporation that provides transactional legal services to airlines and aircraft owners and operators worldwide. Aero allegedly regularly solicits business in Nevada, including by participating in industry meetings and conventions in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Aero belongs to several trade groups, including the National Business Aviation Association (\"NBAA\"), and attends trade seminars and conferences around the world. The NBAA holds its annual conferences in various locations, and, in 2015, held a conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Freestream alleges that Schmidt has been attacking its reputation by falsely stating that a transaction structure used by Freestream-a \"back-to-back\" transaction\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is illegal and unethical and that Freestream only uses this type of transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2014, Schmidt allegedly interfered with Freestream's imminent sale of a Boeing Business Jet to a company named Blue City Holdings LLC by telling its representatives that Freestream was built entirely on illegal and unethical back-to-back transactions and urging them to discontinue all business with Freestream and Ittihadieh. After the transaction fell through, Freestream's counsel wrote to Aero demanding that Schmidt and his colleagues stop defaming Freestream. Aero's founder responded that, to his knowledge, nobody at Aero had ever stated or implied that Freestream's business was built entirely on back-to-back transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 25, 2015, at an aviation conference on the Isle of Man, Schmidt met with Masha Shvetsova, whom Schmidt understood to be an agent for potential buyers of a Boeing Business Jet. When Shvetsova told Schmidt that she was leaning towards using Freestream as a broker, Schmidt told her that she was \"going to be led\" to a back-to-back transaction. Shvetsova asked about the legality of back-to-back transactions. Schmidt responded, \"It's quite possibly illegal,\" adding that back-to-back transactions were \"ripe\" for criminal prosecution, \"but it has not happened yet.\" When Shvetsova asked why brokers use the back-to-back transaction if it is illegal or arguably illegal, Schmidt said, \"[I]t's extremely lucrative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Several months later, on November 18, 2015, Schmidt again met with Shvetsova at the NBAA Annual Meeting and Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. This time, they were joined by Marwan Khalek, CEO of Gama Aviation, a global business aviation services company. During this conversation,\n   Schmidt reiterated that back-to-back transactions are illegal under federal law and violate the ethical rules of the Washington State Bar. Schmidt said that Freestream would try to structure the sale to Shvetsova's buyer as a back-to-back transaction, and the buyer would be \"significantly disadvantaged by that.\" When Shvetsova reminded Schmidt that he had previously called back-to-back transactions \"illegal, essentially,\" Schmidt agreed. He said that a broker in these transactions is not \"a real, bona fide seller\" and called the transactions \"completely unethical.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking compensation for defamation and injunctive relief against further defamatory statements. Plaintiffs allege that Schmidt's statements at the NBAA meeting were false and defamatory because Freestream does not engage only in back-to-back transactions and those transactions are not illegal. Plaintiffs allege that the defamatory statements harmed their business because reputation is critically important in the private aviation industry, which enjoys a particularly tight-knit market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to change venue to the Western District of Washington. The district court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without addressing whether venue transfer would be appropriate. This appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review de novo the district court's dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    Data Disc, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , we reaffirmed the minimum contacts test for evaluating the \"nature and quality of the defendant's contacts in relation to the cause of action,\" and held that \"[t]he inducement of reliance [within the forum state] is a sufficient act ... to satisfy the requirement of minimum contacts where the cause of action arises out of that inducement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"951511\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/557/1280/#p1288\">\n    557 F.2d at 1287-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response, Plaintiffs note the significant time and resources invested in the litigation in Nevada thus far and the great inconvenience should they have to refile elsewhere. Plaintiffs also point out that their counsel is located in Nevada. This factor weighs slightly in favor of Plaintiffs, but we generally do not give it much weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dole Food Co.\n   </em>\n   , 303 F.3d at 1116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    (7) Existence of an alternative forum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants contend that there are alternative fora because, \"[a]ccording to the complaint, Aero allegedly made defamatory statements or interrupted Plaintiffs' business in two other instances in different locations.\" This argument directly undermines Defendants' main argument that allegedly making defamatory statements in a particular forum is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction in that forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants also renew their argument that Washington is the better forum.
