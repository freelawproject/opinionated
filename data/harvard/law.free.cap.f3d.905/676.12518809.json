Discerning no error in the District Court's finding that the officer's request was not a seizure, we will affirm the judgment of conviction entered on April 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the early evening hours of September 22, 2014, an anonymous source called 911 to report a Hispanic male pointing a gun at juveniles outside a vacant flower shop on the 1800 block of North 31st Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The suspect was reportedly wearing a gray shirt, gray pants, and a bucket hat. Philadelphia Police Officer John Mulqueeney, who had been assigned to that area for approximately thirteen years and knew about the drug and firearm activity prevalent there, was dispatched minutes after the call was placed. He stopped his cruiser approximately fifteen to twenty feet from De Castro and his neighbor, who were speaking outside of the vacant flower shop. De Castro was wearing a light gray bucket hat, a gray striped shirt, and gray camouflage pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Officer Mulqueeney exited his car and approached the men, De Castro turned toward Officer Mulqueeney. \"At a distance of approximately [five to ten] feet, Officer Mulqueeney used a polite, conversational, and non-threatening tone to ask De Castro if he would remove his hands from his pockets.\" (App. at 11.) De Castro complied, revealing a green pistol grip protruding from his pants pocket. Officer Mulqueeney asked De Castro to raise his hands higher, and removed a loaded firearm from De Castro's pocket. When asked if he had identification or a permit to carry the firearm, De Castro replied that he had neither, but that he had a passport from the Dominican Republic. Officer Mulqueeney handcuffed De Castro and frisked him, finding in De Castro's pocket a loaded magazine containing ammunition that matched the firearm. Additional officers arrived on-scene as Officer Mulqueeney placed De Castro under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a trial, De Castro was convicted of being an alien in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5)(A). The District Court, however, granted him a new trial \"due to [his] trial counsel's constitutionally deficient representation.\" (App. at 11.) Pending his new trial, De Castro filed a motion to suppress all statements and physical evidence obtained by Officer Mulqueeney during the September 22, 2014, encounter, contending that the stop was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the District Court determined that Officer Mulqueeney's request for De Castro to remove his hands from his pockets did not constitute a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The District Court opined that Officer Mulqueeney, who responded to the scene alone, \"neither ordered nor repeatedly asked De Castro to comply. Instead, he used a polite, conversational, and non-threatening tone to communicate his single request from a distance of at least five feet, with his weapon holstered and without any physical touching.\" (App. at 13.) The Court thus concluded that De Castro was not seized at that moment because \"a reasonable person would have felt free to decline Officer Mulqueeney's lone request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the request was a seizure, the District Court nonetheless found that it was supported by reasonable suspicion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the District Court denied De Castro's suppression motion, and De Castro subsequently pled guilty to the offense. He was sentenced to time served plus a two-year term of supervised release, and was then deported to the Dominican Republic. He timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

De Castro urges us to find that Officer Mulqueeney's request was a seizure, contending that Officer Mulqueeney made a show of authority by arriving in his patrol car, \"immediately focusing on [De Castro] and walking toward him, ... asking him to take his hands out of his pockets.\" (Appellant's Br. at 13.) While De Castro acknowledges Officer Mulqueeney's \"conversational tone,\" he nonetheless argues that \"even a polite request for someone to take his hands out of his pockets constitutes a show of authority if a reasonable person would not feel free to refuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) De Castro also makes a\n   public policy argument based on the recent history of police encounters resulting in death, arguing that \"[a] reasonable person in [his] shoes would have been well aware of the many tragic stories suggesting that failing to comply with a police officer's request - especially conveying a threat by refusing to show hands - can end in death.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We reject De Castro's arguments in light of the\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall\n   </em>\n   factors and\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   . Officer Mulqueeney was the only officer present during the initial encounter, and made a sole, polite, and conversational request for De Castro to remove his hands from his pockets, rather than an order for him to show his hands. No weapons were drawn, and no threats were made. Officer Mulqueeney did not communicate to De Castro-either through words or actions-that he was not free to leave. Rather, it was appropriate for Officer Mulqueeney to request that De Castro remove his hands from his pockets for the safety of himself and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

And finally, the totality of the circumstances indicates that a reasonable person in De Castro's position would have felt free to ignore the officer's request and end the encounter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendenhall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    446 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185389\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/544/#p553\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We thus hold that Officer Mulqueeney's request for De Castro to remove his hands from his pockets did not constitute a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Holdings of our sister circuits finding a seizure when officers made similar requests are distinguishable. For example, an officer's request for an individual to remove his hands from his pockets constituted a seizure where there were multiple officers present and the location was actively being searched for drugs when the individual arrived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, we have ruled similarly in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He was alone. He did not brandish a firearm. He spoke in a conversational tone.
