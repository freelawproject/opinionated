Because that reasoning supported the majority's decision to affirm the decision of the district court,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265824\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/570/\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the district court's decision should also be vacated, and I would have preferred to state as much expressly in our order. I observe, nonetheless, that even without any express statement by us, the reasoning and conclusions reached by the district court have been overruled. I join in the entry of the order with this understanding.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
