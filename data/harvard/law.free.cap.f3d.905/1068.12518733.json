In the district court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   long-distance carrier\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Qwest Communications Company LLC (Qwest) succeeded in showing that a free conference call provider, Free Conferencing Corporation (FC), intentionally interfered with its contract with a local carrier\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   called Tekstar. On appeal, FC claims that it is not liable for tortious\n   interference with Qwest's contractual relationship with Tekstar, and that the district court erred in calculating damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Qwest is a long-distance land-line telephone service carrier. When a person places a long-distance phone call, their long-distance carrier connects the call (also called \"traffic\") to the local carrier where the dialed number is located. The customer pays their long-distance carrier for the call, and the receiving local carrier in turn bills the long-distance carrier. The rate, terms, and conditions required to impose these charges on long-distance carriers are generally governed by tariffs filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Here, we refer to the contract between Qwest and Tekstar as a tariff.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Generally, tariffs authorize long-distance carriers like Qwest to route their customers' traffic through other long-distance carriers when doing so would be less expensive than transmitting the traffic through their own networks. This practice is called \"least cost routing.\" Whenever least cost routing occurs, the long-distance carrier through which the traffic is routed is entitled to reimbursement from the routing long-distance carrier. For instance, when Qwest least cost routes its traffic through AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T charges Qwest for transmitting that traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One of Qwest's tariffs was with a local carrier called Tekstar. Tekstar services certain rural parts of Minnesota and North Dakota. In rural areas, telecommunications infrastructure has to cover expansive territory despite fewer paying customers. Therefore, rural local carriers often charge long-distance carriers higher rates to complete calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Several years before this case began, a new type of company sought to leverage the relationship between long-distance and local carriers: free conferencing companies, of which FC is one. Free conferencing companies sought to increase long-distance traffic to rural local carriers (with their higher tariff rates), thereby making money for the local carriers and themselves. To do this, free conferencing companies would offer conference-calling services to the public-users would sign up (at no charge to the user) to host a conference call on the service. The free conferencing company would then provide the conference-call organizer a number hosted by a rural local carrier. When participants called the free conferencing number, their long-distance carrier would transmit each participant's call to the rural local carrier. The local carrier would then bill the long-distance carrier for all of the conference call traffic, ostensibly pursuant to its tariff. And, pursuant to its contract with the free conferencing company, it would pay the company a fee. Local carriers did not charge the free conferencing companies to place their numbers on their exchange. Tekstar signed its first contract with a free conferencing company (not FC) in 2005. FC began contracting with rural local carriers (not Tekstar) in 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The telecommunications industry is regulated by the FCC; the FCC approves and interprets the terms of tariffs between local and long distance carriers.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    All Am. Tel. Co., Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275204\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/81/#p84\">\n    867 F.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Many tariffs, including the one between Qwest and Tekstar, only allowed the local carrier to bill the long-distance carrier for calls delivered to \"end users.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After both Tekstar and\n   FC became involved in the free conferencing industry, long-distance carriers began to challenge the legality of the free conferencing business model. The basis for the challenge was this: If the free conferencing companies were not \"end users,\" local carriers could not charge long-distance carriers tariff rates for the free conferencing traffic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <em>\n    Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v.

The legal question was, therefore, whether free conferencing companies like FC were \"end users.\" The FCC answered this question twice: first it said yes, then it said no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2007, the FCC held, in a case we call\n   <em>\n    Farmers I\n   </em>\n   , that free conferencing companies\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   end users under a tariff with Qwest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v. Farmers &amp; Merchs. Mut. Tel. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 22 F.C.C. Rcd. 17973, 17987-88 (2007). That conclusion was based in substantial part on the free conferencing companies' assertions that they \"were billed the federal subscriber line charge as well as for local telephone service and rental of floor space in [the local carriers'] central office[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers &amp; Merchs. Mut. Tel. Co. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769090,3719195\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/714/\">\n    668 F.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the course of the\n   <em>\n    Farmers I\n   </em>\n   FCC proceeding, a\n   <em>\n    Farmers I\n   </em>\n   litigant asked FC to assist in falsifying documents that would show it was paying fees to the local carriers it worked with. FC declined to do so, but was aware that other free conferencing companies had agreed to provide falsified billing records. FC was also aware that, in January 2008, the FCC granted in part a motion to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Farmers\n   </em>\n   I, citing allegations \"that [the local carriers'] invoices to, and agreements with, the conference calling companies were backdated.\"\n   <em>\n    Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v. Farmers &amp; Merchs. Mut. Tel. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 23 F.C.C. Rcd. 1615, 1618 (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By early 2008, most long-distance carriers, including Qwest, were refusing to pay for free conferencing traffic. Some long-distance carriers, however, entered settlements\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with local carriers, whereby the long-distance carrier agreed to pay for free conferencing traffic, but at lower, below-tariff rates. Tekstar settled with AT&amp;T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2008, FC and Tekstar entered a contract. The contract provided that FC would pay nothing to Tekstar, and that Tekstar would pay FC a \"per minute\" fee for hosting conference calls on its exchange. When it entered into the contract, FC knew that Qwest was refusing to pay Tekstar for its free conferencing traffic, and that Tekstar's settlement with AT&amp;T meant that most or all of its free conferencing traffic would be least cost routed through AT&amp;T or another long-distance carrier that had settled at below-tariff rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Qwest sent Tekstar a Notice of Dispute, expressing the view that the terminating access charges Tekstar was billing it for free conference companies' traffic were invalid under the tariff. Qwest suspected that Tekstar had entered an impermissible agreement with FC (and other companies) for conferencing services. In response, Qwest implemented a new least cost routing protocol for Tekstar's traffic. Instead of least cost routing Tekstar's free conferencing traffic\n   <em>\n    any time\n   </em>\n   it was cheaper than transmitting through its own lines, Qwest only least cost routed the traffic when it was at least 50% cheaper to use another long-distance provider's network. Thus, Qwest continued to transmit some of Tekstar's free conferencing traffic (including FC's traffic) on its own network, but continued to refuse to pay Tekstar for it. This is what the parties call the 50 Percent Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After reconsideration, in November 2009, the FCC reversed course in an opinion we will call\n   <em>\n    Farmers II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v. Farmers &amp; Merchs. Mut. Tel. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 24 F.C.C. Rcd. 14801, 14806 (2009). The FCC found that free conferencing companies were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   end users based on \"new evidence ... previously withheld [that] contradict[ed]\" the claim that local carriers and free conferencing companies enjoyed \"a carrier/customer relationship under the terms of the tariff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769090,3719195\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/714/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, \"[t]oday, it is well-settled that a[ local carrier] cannot bill a[ long-distance carrier] under its tariff for calls 'terminated' at a conference call [number] when the conference calling company does not pay a fee for the [local carrier's] services.\"\n   <em>\n    Qwest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134856\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/889/#p893\">\n    837 F.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Farmers II\n   </em>\n   , Qwest initiated lawsuits against several local carriers and free conferencing companies. This is one of those suits. As relevant here, Qwest sued FC under Minnesota law for tortiously interfering with its contract (tariff) with Tekstar. After a bench trial, the district court found FC liable and awarded Qwest damages. In particular, the court determined that (1) FC knew of the existence of the Tekstar-Qwest tariff, (2) FC knew its free conferencing business model breached the Tekstar-Qwest tariff, (3) FC induced Tekstar to breach its tariff by pursuing the business relationship and negotiating terms that required Tekstar to bill Qwest for impermissible access charges, and (4) FC's interference was not justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court awarded Qwest only \"consequential\" damages. The court reasoned that direct damages were unavailable because, by the time FC contracted with Tekstar, Qwest was already refusing to pay for free conferencing traffic that Qwest itself delivered. The court did, however, award Qwest close to $1 million in damages, which it said represented the costs that Qwest incurred in least cost routing FC calls to other long-distance carriers. The court concluded that these costs were foreseeable. The court also awarded Qwest attorneys' fees. FC appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, FC challenges both the district court's liability finding and award of attorneys' fees. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties agree that Minnesota law governs this case. In Minnesota, \"[a] cause of action for tortious interference with contract has five elements: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer's knowledge of the contract; (3) intentional procurement of its breach; (4) without justification; and (5) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Sysdyne Corp. v. Rousslang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6884403,6884303\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/347/\">\n    860 N.W.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (Minn. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Furlev Sales &amp; Assocs., Inc., v.

FC argues that it is not liable for tortious interference because it did not induce or procure Tekstar's breach, and even if it had, Tekstar's breach was not material. FC also argues that its agreement with Tekstar was not motivated by an improper purpose, and that Qwest has not proven damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following a bench trial, we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Meecorp Capital Mks., LLC v.

In FC's view, these earlier breaches mean that no liability can attach to any subsequent breach of the same or a similar kind. But whether or not Tekstar had already breached the tariff with regard to other free conferencing companies does not answer whether FC's interference caused Tekstar to breach its tariff by billing Qwest tariff rates for\n   <em>\n    FC\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   non-tariff services. FC's approach would create perverse incentives whereby an initial act of tortious interference would absolve from liability anyone who induces a similar breach later in time. We see no support in Minnesota law for FC's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The district court did not err in finding that FC caused Tekstar to breach its tariff with Qwest. The court held that, \"[a]lthough [FC] was not the first [free conferencing company] to pursue its business model with Tekstar, in this litigation Qwest only seeks liability and compensation for the breaches by Tekstar with relation to the minutes ... for [FC's] traffic.\" The district court correctly applied the law to the facts; FC caused the breaches for which Qwest seeks compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, FC contends that it cannot be liable because Tekstar's breach was not material. FC says that, under Minnesota law, only breaches that amount to non-performance of contractual obligations are material, and it characterizes this case as a\n   relatively straightforward billing dispute. But under Minnesota law, a breach is material if it goes to \"one of the primary purposes\" of the contract.\n   <em>\n    BOB Acres, LLC v. Schumacher Farms, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079812,7079847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/723/\">\n    797 N.W.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (Minn. Ct. App. 2011) (\"A material breach 'goes to the root or essence of the contract.' \"). The Qwest-Tekstar tariff obliged Tekstar to bill Qwest tariff rates for traffic that qualified under the tariff. The district court did not err in finding that accurate, tariff-authorized billing was one of the primary purposes of the tariff. And FC does not dispute that Tekstar violated the terms of the tariff when it billed Qwest tariff rates for FC's traffic. Nor does it point to any facts from which we might infer that Qwest did not reasonably expect to be billed only for tariff-qualifying traffic. Thus, even if Minnesota law requires a showing of the type of materiality FC urges, we see no basis for reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FC argues that it cannot be liable for tortious interference because its actions were justified.

This case and the South Dakota case are undoubtedly similar, but we conclude that collateral estoppel did not bar the district court from reaching a different conclusion on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case involves different facts, different timing, and different state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ripplin Shoals Land Co. v.

In the South Dakota case, FC's contract with the local carrier, Sancom, predated\n   <em>\n    Farmers\n   </em>\n   I, and there was no allegation that fraud on the FCC had alerted FC to the probability that its business model was illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qwest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134856\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/889/#p893\">\n    837 F.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the district court expressly acknowledged our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Qwest\n   </em>\n   , and carefully distinguished it. We agree with the district court that our previous opinion did not preclude it from concluding that FC was aware of the illegality of its business model when it contracted with Tekstar in April 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FC claims that Qwest has suffered no damages. First, it asserts that Qwest cannot recover because the 50 Percent Rule was neither a mitigation strategy nor routine least cost routing, and was therefore unforeseeable. The district court found that FC \"knew, during the relevant time period, that it was possible that Qwest was least cost routing [its] calls\" because \"Tekstar would be billing Qwest tariff rates and other [long-distance carriers] less than tariff rates.\" On appeal, FC claims this determination was clearly erroneous because \"the only damage 'arising naturally from [Tekstar's] breach would be Qwest's payment of some or all of Tekstar's inflated bills\"-bills that Qwest did not pay. We disagree. \"[C]onsequential damages flow naturally from the breach\" and are recoverable if they were \"reasonably foreseeable to the parties at the time of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    DeRosier v. Util. Sys. of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7079369\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/780/1/#p4\">\n    780 N.W.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4-5 (Minn. Ct. App. 2010). In finding that Qwest's least cost routing costs were foreseeable, the district court reasoned that least cost routing was a common industry practice, and that FC suspected Qwest was least cost routing FC's calls to other long-distance carriers. The district court also found that FC knew Tekstar would be billing Qwest at tariff rates while charging other long-distance carriers below-tariff rates, and that FC's contract with Tekstar would likely cause Qwest to least cost route FC's free conferencing traffic to other carriers at below-tariff rates. The district court did not clearly err in determining that Qwest's damages arose naturally from the breach that FC induced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   FC next argues that Qwest has no damages because the nearly $1 million that Qwest paid other long-distance carriers to transmit FC's traffic is equal to the amount Qwest would have had to pay Tekstar for the same traffic,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the \"just and reasonable\" rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmers II\n   </em>\n   , 24 F.C.C. Rcd. at 14812 &amp; n.96 (clarifying that just because the local carrier breached the tariff does not mean that the local carrier \"is precluded from receiving any compensation at all for the services it has provided to Qwest\").\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    All Am. Tel. Co. v. AT&amp;T Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 26 F.C.C. Rcd. 723, 731 (2011) (noting that\n   <em>\n    Farmers II\n   </em>\n   \"does not hold that a carrier is always entitled to some compensation for a service rendered, even if the service is not specified in its tariff\"). But, as the district court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Tekstar's below-tariff agreements with other [long-distance carriers] contributed to Qwest routing calls to those [carriers] through [least cost routing], which, in turn caused Qwest to pay for [FC's] calls through [least cost routing] when Qwest should not have been required to pay for the calls at all. However, the breach that proximately caused the [least cost routing] damages in the first place was that Tekstar billed Qwest anything at all for the calls to [free conferencing\n   companies] when the tariffs established that the rate should have been zero.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court found that FC's \"interference with Tekstar's tariffs caused Qwest to [least cost route] traffic that, if Tekstar had not breached its tariffs, Qwest would have delivered directly to Tekstar with no payment to Tekstar.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We see no clear error in the district court's finding that the nearly $1 million Qwest paid to AT&amp;T and other long-distance carriers to route FC's traffic flowed directly from FC's tortious interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, FC contests the district court's award of attorneys' fees to Qwest. Minnesota follows the American rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   but provides a \"third-party litigation exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Kallok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11868759\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/573/356/#p362\">\n    573 N.W.2d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\"Free Conferencing\") where it did not induce the breach by Tekstar of its contract with Qwest Communications Company, LLC (\"Qwest\") and where Tekstar willingly participated in the breach, even preparing the contract and amended contract with Free Conferencing which Qwest now cites as constituting this tortious interference. For this reason, and taking the district court's factual findings as true, Qwest's claim for tortious interference with contractual relations fails, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under Minnesota law, a tortious interference claim requires five elements: \"(1) the existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer's knowledge of the contract; (3) intentional procurement of its breach; (4) without justification; and (5) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Sysdyne Corp. v.

Free Conferencing raises challenges across these elements. But I address only one. I conclude that the district\n   court's decision did not properly address the third element: an intentional procurement of the purported breach in this case. Instead, the district court, sanctioned by the majority, collapses the unique contours of Minnesota law into more general tort law principles, effectively fashioning Minnesota law instead of applying it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In reviewing a bench trial judgment on interference claims, courts \"review the district court's factual findings and credibility determinations for clear error, and its legal conclusions de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qwest Commc'ns Corp. v.

Historically, tortious interference in Minnesota (and elsewhere) was meant to guard against scheming and opprobrious commercial conduct.

But \"mere knowledge of [an] earlier contract\" has never been \"held to be the equivalent of inducement or persuasion or (still less) of fraudulent conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Radke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20N.W.%20314\">\n    204 N.W. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Realty Co. v.

According to the district court, Tekstar had experience with no less than eight free call service companies (\"FCSC\") by this time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, it had a form contract it routinely used with its FCSC partners. And it was hungry for more. Like many searching for greater fortune, Tekstar sent a representative, David Schornack, to Las Vegas. But, it believed he had better odds than most who visit: Schornack was there to attend a conference for FCSCs. As the district court explained, Schornack \"attend[ed], in part, to network with new conference calling companies.\" It was at\n   this conference in 2008 that Tekstar was introduced to Free Conferencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Fortuitous seating led to the meeting. In a break between panels, Schornack and Free Conferencing's David Erickson, seated next to each other, struck up a conversation. During that conversation, Schornack \"outlined ... the benefits of doing business with Tekstar.\" Tr. 582-83. Erickson was also eager to do business, as the district court notes. Pretty quickly after that conversation, Free Conferencing became the latest in Tekstar's stable of FCSC partners. In April 2008, Free Conferencing signed Tekstar's form contract with a per-minute rate owed on Free Conferencing traffic, along with contact information, simply written in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In December 2008, however, at Tekstar's behest, Free Conferencing signed an amended contract (also prepared by Tekstar). The amended contract was in response to the settlements Tekstar had reached with IXCs who had become wise to the FCSC model. The amended contract set a differentiated payment schedule based on these settlements. In addition, it ensured Tekstar was only obliged to pay Free Conferencing after it collected from the IXCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   These facts show that Tekstar was a willing participant in the breach. Start with Schornack's testimony. Recall he was the Tekstar representative who first engaged and negotiated with Free Conferencing. When asked specifically if \"Free Conferencing [did] anything to induce, persuade, or encourage Tekstar to do business with Free Conferencing,\" he replied: \"No.\" Tr. 585. And when asked if Free Conferencing did anything \"more than passively provide Tekstar with information about Free Conferencing's business,\" he, again, replied: \"No, I don't think they did anything other than that.\" Tr. 585.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Critically, nothing in the district court's findings of fact contradicts this testimony. As the district court recounts, the genesis of the Tekstar-Free Conferencing relationship was Tekstar's decision to seek out more FCSC relationships in Las Vegas. The FCSC model had already proven quite lucrative for Tekstar for approximately three years at that point. And when Free Conferencing was ultimately added to Tekstar's roster of FCSCs, as a sign of Tekstar's familiarity with the practice, it was Tekstar's form contract-which, as a standard term, provided that Tekstar would not charge for telecom services-that was signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, when the business dynamics changed-when IXCs began demanding below-tariff settlements-Tekstar modified the terms of the contract with Free Conferencing to be more favorable to Tekstar. Given Schornack's testimony and the findings of the district court, we cannot escape the conclusion that Tekstar was, at the least, a \"willing participant[ ]\" in its breach of the Qwest tariffs with Free Conferencing.\n   <em>\n    Furlev\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10671899\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/325/20/#p25\">\n    325 N.W.2d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In sum, the record is devoid of legally sufficient evidence that Free Conferencing induced Tekstar to enter into their initial contract. Qwest's claim, therefore, fails under Minnesota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Often, in diversity cases, federal courts are tasked with interpreting and applying state law in areas in which there is little instructive state case law to draw from. But that is not the case here. Minnesota's highest court has spoken about what Minnesota requires for an intentional procurement of a breach necessary to sustain a tortious interference claim. We are duty-bound\n   to follow the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mindful of the duty of a federal court sitting in diversity to apply the law of the state as it is, not as the court may wish it to be, I would reverse the district court's judgment against Free Conferencing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Contrary to the majority's contention, the argument that Tekstar was a \"willing participant\" in the breach is fairly included in Free Conferencing's appeal. In its briefing, Free Conferencing included an argument section asserting that \"FC Did Not Induce, Procure, Or Otherwise Cause Tekstar to Materially Breach Its Tariff.\" Br. of Appellant, p. 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The district court, citing the Restatement, found that \"intent is also established if 'the actor does not act for the purpose of interfering with the contract or desire it but knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.' \" D. Ct. Op. at 71 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. j (1979) ). But, for this to be true, the Restatement requires some malevolent inducement: \"[i]f the actor is not acting criminally nor with fraud or violence or other means wrongful in themselves but is endeavoring to advance some interest of his own, the fact that he is aware that he will cause interference\" is not sufficient for intent. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. j (1979). Regardless, the Restatement is not binding on us; the Minnesota Supreme Court is.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hazen v.
