But neither his post-sentencing lawyer nor his state-habeas lawyer challenged that denial of counsel. Now, on federal habeas, he seeks to challenge his post-sentencing lawyer's ineffectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   To do so, he has to overcome both lawyers' failures. He must attack his post-sentencing lawyer's failure to raise the denial of counsel as itself a denial of effective counsel. But he can do that only if he had a right to counsel at the post-sentencing stage. And, before attacking his post-sentencing counsel, he must attack his post-conviction-relief (state-habeas) lawyer's failure under\n   <em>\n    Martinez v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    566 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9, 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). But he can do that only if his post-sentencing lawyer was acting as trial counsel, rather than appellate counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We announce two holdings today: First, in Pennsylvania state court, the post-sentencing-motions stage is a critical stage at which a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel. Richardson was denied that right because his post-sentencing lawyer was ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, the line dividing trial from appeal falls naturally at the notice of appeal. Post-sentencing motions precede the notice of appeal, so they fall on the trial side of the line. Thus, when a state-habeas lawyer fails to raise a post-sentencing lawyer's ineffectiveness, the prisoner may raise that issue for the first time in his federal habeas petition. So Richardson's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is properly before us, and it is meritorious. We will thus remand for the District Court to grant the writ of habeas corpus and order a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pennsylvania State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2003, Richardson and his son burgled two empty homes and fled from police. During a high-speed car chase, he rammed into a police car and crashed into a utility pole. He was prosecuted in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania. A jury convicted him of burglary, criminal conspiracy, theft, aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and flight from a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mid-sentencing, Richardson decided that he was dissatisfied with his lawyer and sought to fire him. The sentencing judge treated Richardson's request as waiving his right to counsel. But the judge did not, as the Sixth Amendment requires, question Richardson to ensure that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. And Richardson's post-sentencing and state-habeas lawyers both overlooked this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Joseph Green, Jr. (Trial and First Day of Sentencing)\n   </em>\n   . Richardson hired Joseph Green, Jr., as his lawyer for trial and sentencing. His sentencing took two days. On the first day, Green asked the court to schedule a psychological evaluation and postpone the sentencing hearing. The judge agreed and they reconvened a month later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the start of the second day, Green told the court that Richardson had asked him to withdraw as counsel. The prosecution objected to Green's last-minute withdrawal. Richardson replied that he \"c[ould] represent [him]self\" and that he \"fe[lt] that Mr. Green d[id]n't have [his] best interests at heart.\" App. 305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge asked Richardson no questions about discharging Green. He simply observed: \"You have competent counsel, and you will be foolish to terminate his services when he's prepared to proceed.\" App. 310. The judge then gave an ambiguous instruction: \"I'm going to permit Mr. Green to leave, if he wants to leave, or to stay and stand by. But I'm going to proceed to sentence you today.\" App. 311. At the prosecution's suggestion, the judge purported to \"keep [Green] here for now to protect your appellate rights at least.\" App. 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Green later testified that he \"d[id]n't know if [the judge had] granted the motion for leave to withdraw or not. ... I was present, but I did not conduct [the second day of sentencing]. The extent to which someone or another concludes that I was representing Mr. Richardson is up to them to decide.\" App. 222. The sentencing transcript gives no hint that Green said or did anything further to protect Richardson's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Pro Se (Second Day of Sentencing)\n   </em>\n   . The sentencing continued without any more participation by Green. Richardson spoke at length to the court, submitted\n   letters and certificates from his employers, and called his fianc\u00e9e to testify. The judge reviewed this new information, as well as Green's earlier submissions, and sentenced Richardson to 17\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    /2\n   </sub>\n   to 39 years' imprisonment followed by 10 years' probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Christian Hoey (Post-Sentencing Motions and Direct Appeal)\n   </em>\n   . The state court then appointed Christian Hoey to represent Richardson. At that stage, Hoey could file a post-sentencing motion to reconsider Richardson's sentence and then an appeal. Pa. R. Crim. P. 720(A), (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hoey never challenged the sentencing judge's failure to conduct a colloquy before letting Richardson proceed pro se. He did move to reconsider Richardson's sentence on other grounds, but the sentencing judge denied that motion. Hoey then appealed the sentence, challenging it as excessive. But the Superior Court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Robert Brendza (State Habeas/PCRA)\n   </em>\n   . Richardson then filed a pro se state-habeas petition under Pennsylvania's Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA). Richardson's handwritten petition and typed amendment expressly raised two right-to-counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, \"[t]he trial Judge erred when he did not secure counsel for the defendant during his sentencing, [d]enying [d]efendant's sixth amendment right to [c]ounsel.\" App. 387. Richardson argued that, before letting a defendant represent himself, a \"judge must conduct a penetrating and comprehensive inquiry of the defendant to ascertain whether he understands the nature of the charges against him, the permissible range of sentences to which he is exposed, the possible defenses to the charges and all the circumstances.\" App. 399. But \"[t]here was never any inquiry into whether the defendant was knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188233\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Richardson asserted that both his trial and appellate counsel had been ineffective, the latter by not raising arguable claims. App. 387. Richardson did not list the claims that Hoey should have raised, including the denial of counsel at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The state-habeas court appointed Robert Brendza to represent Richardson. It also returned Richardson's original and amended petition to him, saying that \"whatever you needed to say needed to be raised by your attorney.\" App. 410. The court's instruction comported with Pennsylvania law, which tells courts not to consider\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings filed by parties who are represented by counsel (so-called \"hybrid representation\").\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775522\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/537/167/\">\n    537 Pa. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775522,7862821\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/642/453/\">\n    642 A.2d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462 (1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839641\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/534/176/\">\n    534 Pa. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839641\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/534/176/\">\n    626 A.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brendza abandoned Richardson's sentencing-counsel claim. Instead, he argued that Richardson's trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for not pursuing an evidentiary issue. But Richardson persisted, and at a hearing the state-habeas court let Richardson articulate his claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel and \"judicial improprieties during [his] sentencing.\" App. 412-13. At the court's request, Brendza submitted a letter explaining why he thought Richardson's sentencing-counsel claim was meritless. App. 457.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The state-habeas court denied the petition, rejecting Brendza's claim as meritless. In keeping with Pennsylvania's ban on hybrid representation, the court credited Brendza's letter rejecting Richardson's separate arguments, but did not discuss the sentencing court's failure to question Richardson or the related ineffective-assistance claim. The Superior Court affirmed, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Federal Habeas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Federal Habeas Petition.\n   </em>\n   Next, Richardson filed a habeas petition pro se in federal court. He claimed that \"Green was ineffective for abandoning [him] during the sentencing phase.\" App. 54 (Claim I). He also claimed that \"[t]he trial court erred by not performing an in depth on the record colloquy when petitioner released his retained counsel during sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839641\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/534/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Claim J). And he claimed that \"[a]ppellate counsel Hoey was ineffective for not performing an independent investigation into the trial record to identify meritable issues for appeal and not briefing them to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839641\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/534/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Claim M). He made the same claim against Brendza for not independently looking for and briefing meritorious issues on state habeas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1839641\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/534/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Claim N).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The magistrate judge recommended denying all claims. The District Court agreed and dismissed the habeas petition. We denied a certificate of appealability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Rule 60(b) Motion\n   </em>\n   . Richardson renewed these claims in a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). He argued that in Pennsylvania, defendants cannot raise ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims until state habeas, when there is no constitutional right to effective counsel. So he requested an evidentiary hearing to develop a record on his Sixth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The District Court again rejected Richardson's arguments, and we again denied his request for a certificate of appealability. But the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated, and remanded for further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On remand, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing. The three state-court lawyers relevant to this appeal all testified. As for sentencing, Green testified that he was unsure if the sentencing judge had granted his motion to withdraw from the case. As for post-sentencing motions, Hoey testified that he had reviewed the record and found no errors worthy of appeal. He also testified that he did not recall the issue of the sentencing court's discharging Green and letting Richardson proceed pro se. As for state habeas, Brendza testified that, apart from one evidentiary issue raised in the state-habeas petition, his review of the record had found no other issues that Hoey should have raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The District Court again denied Richardson's Rule 60(b) motion, and it is this opinion that we review here.\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Piazza\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07-cv-2065-PBT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209273135\">\n    2015 WL 9273135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. Dec. 21, 2015). First, the District Court declined to entertain Richardson's Sixth Amendment claim that the sentencing judge had failed to conduct a colloquy because it did not construe the colloquy claim as an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209273135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *3 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, it reasoned that Green could not have been constitutionally ineffective because Richardson could not prove that the lack of counsel prejudiced him. Because the prosecution presented no more evidence after Green withdrew, \"there was nothing left for the trial court to do but impose its sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, the District Court rejected the claim against Hoey because it reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   's equitable exception does not extend past trial-counsel ineffectiveness to appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, it rejected the claim against Brendza. It reasoned that there is no constitutional right to counsel, and so no right to effective counsel, on state habeas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We granted a certificate of appealability on one issue: On state habeas, Brendza failed to raise Hoey's post-sentencing ineffectiveness. Did Brendza's failure to raise this ground for relief excuse Richardson's procedural default? If so, Richardson may\n   now pursue his claim that Hoey was constitutionally ineffective because Hoey failed to argue, in his post-sentencing motion, that Richardson was denied his right to counsel at sentencing. If not, his counsel's procedural default bars this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To answer this claim, we must resolve two subsidiary questions: Did Richardson have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel for his post-sentencing motions? If so, does post-sentencing counsel qualify as trial counsel under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ? The answer to both questions is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FEDERAL HABEAS BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   These questions come to us by way of a federal habeas petition, and for the first time in this case, having gone un-addressed at each stage below. Generally, when a litigant has failed to present his claims to the state court, the procedural-default doctrine bars us from reviewing unpreserved claims. But there are exceptions to this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Federal habeas corpus is a backstop. It lets federal courts review the merits of federal claims in state criminal cases. But federal courts do not sit to review state law. So federal courts will not review federal claims when the state court's decisions are supported by a state-law reason, an \"independent and adequate state ground[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p729\">\n    501 U.S. 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p729\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p729\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   One such ground is a violation of the state's procedural rules. The federal habeas statute requires state prisoners to exhaust their state remedies before pursuing federal habeas relief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). So when the state court denies a claim because the prisoner failed to comply with a procedural rule, that procedural default normally bars federal courts from re-hearing the claim.\n   <em>\n    Harrington v. Richter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    178 L.Ed.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But a federal habeas court may excuse a prisoner's procedural default if the prisoner can show both cause for the default and resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Wainwright v.

When the state prosecutes, convicts, and imprisons a defendant, it must ensure that the defendant \"ha[s] the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. If the state provides no lawyer or an ineffective one, it violates that obligation.

But when a prisoner has multiple opportunities to challenge an error, each time he fails to do so is a procedural default. And each default must be excused before we will review the merits of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

Are these actions, after the trial or plea but before the appeal, better categorized as the province of trial counsel or appellate counsel? We hold that the boundary between trial and appellate counsel falls at the effective date of the notice of appeal. So\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   's equitable exception to procedural default extends to post-sentencing counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The notice of appeal marks the traditional line between trial and appellate review.

Counsel direct their arguments to the appellate court, not the trial court. Their goal is not to change the trial judge's mind, but to persuade the appellate panel to over-turn the lower court's decision. And counsel no longer build the record but parse it, crafting legal arguments that are limited by objections made below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Sentencing and post-sentencing proceedings also differ categorically from appeals. Counsel direct sentencing and post-sentencing arguments to the same trial court, usually to the same judge. Counsel may also develop the record by proffering new evidence, which the trial court may hear at an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

It argues that this is when the error-correcting stage begins. But it cites no authority for drawing the line then. And doing so would make little sense. To begin, the defendant's sentence is not yet fixed. \"[U]ntil the trial court disposes of the [post-sentencing] motion\" or the time for doing so passes, there is not yet a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

So the boundary between trial and appellate counsel naturally falls not at the oral sentence, but at the notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Drawing the line at the pronouncement of sentence would also prevent any court from reviewing meritorious claims like Richardson's. Many states do not entertain ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal. And since defendants do not have a right to effective assistance on habeas, the state's line would prevent state and federal courts from ever looking at meritorious ineffective-assistance-of-post-sentencing-counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   That is the same concern that animated\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   's equitable exception for trial counsel.

Indeed, even after Richard show prejudice resulting from the ineffectiveness on himself challenged Hoey's ineffectiveness in his pro se state-habeas filing, Brendza filed a letter arguing that Richardson's claim was meritless.

In a case with a less-developed factual record, a petitioner could qualify for the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   exception and possibly an evidentiary hearing even if he did not yet have enough evidence to prove prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, Richardson's underlying ineffective-assistance claim is substantial. It is more than arguable that he had a right to effective post-sentencing counsel. (In the next part, we conclude that he did indeed have that right.) And as explained above, the sentencing judge failed to conduct a conduct a colloquy to ensure that Richardson's waiver of counsel at sentencing was knowing and voluntary.

And his Rule 60(b) motion reiterated his layered-ineffectiveness claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The state's only response is that Richardson's pro se pleadings referred to Hoey as appellate counsel, not post-sentencing counsel. But that labeling is not dispositive. Regardless of the labeling, the District Court and the state were both on notice of Richardson's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. RICHARDSON LACKED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL POST-SENTENCING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To recap: Richardson qualifies for\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   's exception to procedural default. He had a right to counsel post-sentencing. And he has preserved his claim. All that remains is to consider the merits of Richardson's underlying claim that his post-sentencing counsel was ineffective. So now, Richardson must show that Hoey was ineffective for not raising the trial court's failure to conduct a colloquy before letting him proceed without counsel on the second day of his sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   He has done so. Hoey was ineffective, and Richardson suffered prejudice, because Hoey did not challenge the sentencing judge's failure to question Richardson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   At this stage, Richardson must satisfy the full\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, not the abridged version used at the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   stage. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, Richardson must show both that\n   Hoey performed deficiently and that, as a result, Richardson suffered prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both prongs are satisfied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deficient performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As explained in Part IV.C, Hoey's post-sentencing performance was deficient. The sentencing judge had failed to conduct a colloquy to ensure that Richardson had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel at sentencing. That error was apparent. Hoey should have raised the issue, but he never even saw it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Richardson must also prove that Hoey's deficient performance prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Richardson asserts that we may presume prejudice because the sentencing judge's error was structural. Structural errors include completely denying counsel to a defendant at a critical stage.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/#p659\">\n    466 U.S. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/#p659\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/#p659\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). \"[W]e have characterized defective waivers [of counsel] as structural errors.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, Richardson did not completely lack counsel throughout sentencing. He had Green's representation on the first day of sentencing, though not the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   We need not decide whether the error was structural. Regardless, it was prejudicial. The District Court disagreed, reasoning that the sentencing judge would have imposed the same sentence anyway.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209273135\">\n    2015 WL 9273135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15. It stressed that the prosecution adduced no more evidence or testimony on the second day of sentencing, so \"there was nothing left for the trial court to do but impose its sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209273135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But that is not the correct test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The test of prejudice is not whether the judge would have imposed a different sentence, but \"whether we would have likely reversed and ordered a remand had the issue been raised on direct appeal\" or post-sentencing motion.\n   <em>\n    Mannino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747541\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/835/#p844\">\n    212 F.3d at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had Hoey challenged the failure to conduct a colloquy, either on appeal or by post-sentencing motion, the proper remedy would have been to order a new sentencing hearing. So his failure prejudiced Richardson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. REMEDY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Richardson has navigated each twist of the habeas labyrinth. His ball of thread leads past\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   's equitable exception, past Brendza's rejection of his argument, past Hoey's oversight, to the sentencing judge's colloquy at the heart of the maze. So Richardson has overcome every hurdle and we may review the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bey v. Superintendent Greene SCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276690\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/230/#p244\">\n    856 F.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244 (3d Cir. 2017). Because the state court did not review the merits, we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276690\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/230/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276690\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/230/#p244\">\n    at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, Richardson had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel on the second day of sentencing. But the sentencing judge let him proceed pro se without first questioning him to ensure that he was intelligently and voluntarily waiving that right. And Hoey provided ineffective assistance by not challenging that error post-sentencing and preserving it for appeal and habeas corpus. Hoey's error prejudiced Richardson. So we will reverse and remand for the District Court to grant Richardson's writ of habeas corpus, limited to ordering a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
