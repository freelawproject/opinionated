We conclude that it does not and accordingly vacate and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, Leland Schneider pleaded guilty to felony aggravated assault in North Dakota state court. The conviction arose from a violent domestic dispute in which Schneider pinned down his then-girlfriend and placed his forearm over her throat. When she tried to flee to safety, he kicked the windshield of her car until it broke free, drove off with their two-year-old child, and used the child as a human shield after police officers caught up with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The events underlying this case began several years later, when a patrol officer stopped Schneider for a traffic violation and discovered a loaded shotgun in his truck. Not long after, Schneider reported a burglary of his home and listed five boxes of ammunition among the missing items. After these two incidents, the federal government charged him with possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2). Schneider pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Sentencing Guidelines set a higher base offense level for a felon-in-possession who has a previous conviction for a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). At the government's urging, the district court found that Schneider's aggravated-assault conviction qualified as a crime of violence, which increased his recommended Guidelines range. The court sentenced him to a thirty-month prison term. Schneider argued at sentencing that his conviction was not a crime of violence, and he raises the same argument on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Guidelines, a \" 'crime of violence' means any offense under federal or state law\" that is \"punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" and that either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205845\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) or explosive material as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We will refer to subparagraph (1) as the \"force clause\" and to subparagraph (2) as the \"enumerated-offenses clause.\" According to the government, Schneider's aggravated-assault conviction satisfies both clauses. Our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To carry out this task, we analyze the legal definition of Schneider's crime, not his actual acts. The inquiry is straightforward when the statute creates a single crime by listing a single set of elements-\"the things the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

First, the criminal complaint charged Schneider with one count of aggravated assault, but cited both subsections (a) and (c). Second, the trial court's judgment, entered after Schneider's guilty plea, stated only that he was guilty of felony aggravated assault.
