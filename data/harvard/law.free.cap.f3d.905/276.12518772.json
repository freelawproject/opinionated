For the reasons that follow, we hold that while a presumptive right of access under the First Amendment attaches to plea hearings and documents related to plea hearings, the District Court properly concluded that the compelling government interests of national security and safety would be substantially impaired by permitting full access to the plea document here. The proposed redactions on appeal to the remaining documents at issue, meanwhile, are more properly considered in the first instance by the District Court. Accordingly, we will affirm in part and vacate in part the District Court's order and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2015, Keonna Thomas was arrested on charges that she \"knowingly attempted to provide material support and resources ... to a designated foreign terrorist organization\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B. A39. After a federal grand jury returned an indictment, Thomas pled not guilty. She filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion for a bill of particulars and a motion to compel notice and discovery of surveillance, all of which the District Court ultimately denied. In September 2016, Thomas pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, and a sentencing hearing, although initially postponed, was ultimately held in September 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As of November 2016, access to several documents on the docket was restricted to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That month,\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   moved to intervene in the case and obtain access to: \"all records that [at that time] appear[ed] on the docket as sealed or inaccessible\"; transcripts of Thomas's plea hearing and her ex parte presentation to the court regarding the motion to compel notice and discovery of surveillance; and \"any search warrant materials pertaining to the investigation and prosecution of the Defendant.\" A81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   's motion, the Government agreed that certain records, such as the search warrant materials, should be fully or largely unsealed. The Government, however, maintained that, among other documents not at issue on appeal, the \"Plea Document\" that was docketed on the same day as the publicly-filed\n   guilty plea memorandum should remain under seal for reasons detailed in a sealed addendum. The Government also objected to unsealing a \"Grand Jury exhibit\" (\"Exhibit\") attached to Thomas's reply brief in support of her motion for a bill of particulars (\"Reply Brief\") and to unredacting \"any quotes thereof and citations thereto\" that appeared in the Reply Brief itself. A114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 8, 2017, after oral argument, the District Court granted in part and denied in part\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   's motion, permitting intervention and ordering that only the documents that the Government deemed appropriate to unseal should be unrestricted. In the same order, the lower court permitted the intervenors time to review the materials unsealed by the Government and file a supplemental memorandum if they believed any continued sealing was improper.\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   renewed its request to unseal the Plea Document, the Reply Brief and Exhibit, and another motion and order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a supplemental hearing, the District Court issued an opinion and order on June 29, 2017 denying the request on the basis that: (1) \"Intervenors have no right of access to grand jury material [contained in or referenced by the Reply Brief and Exhibit], and Thomas'[s] individual restrictions, with respect to Rule 6 [of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure] and pursuant to a protective order, do[ ] not change that fact,\" A8; and (2) concerning the remaining documents, including the Plea Document:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [T]he Government's pursuit of ongoing law enforcement activities outweighs the public's right of access to the [Plea Document and order and motion regarding courtroom security] under both federal and common law. The Government's investigation related to this case involves national security issues and its non-public nature is critical to its success. Additionally, unsealing these documents could jeopardize the safety of numerous individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Moreover, the Court now finds, as it has previously found (ECF 99), that the sealing of these records was narrowly tailored to protect the law enforcement interests at stake in this matter, and was the least restrictive means possible to safeguard the interests at issue. There is no reasonable alternative to keeping these documents under seal that would adequately protect the compelling interests of both Thomas and the Government. If these documents were to be made public, significant law enforcement activities could be thwarted and lives placed at risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A10 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal,\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   argues that the District Court's sealing decisions infringe upon its right of access to the judicial documents under the First Amendment and/or common law. First, Appellants claim that the continued sealing\n   of the Plea Document is improper given the absence of \"specific, individualized findings as to the necessity\" of that restriction by the District Court, in addition to the lower court's failure to \"adequately consider[ ] alternatives to wholesale sealing\" and \"provid[e]\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   with a meaningful opportunity to oppose sealing.\" Appellants' Br. 14. Second,\n   <em>\n    The Declaration\n   </em>\n   contends that the District Court erred in holding that Rule 6(e) bars the disclosure of the grand jury materials in the Reply Brief and Exhibit. In particular, the intervenors state not only that Rule 6(e) does not apply to the materials that had been provided to Thomas in discovery and developed outside of the grand jury process, but also that \"the substance of the sealed material already appears to have been disclosed in other public filings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their joint response brief, the Government and Thomas maintain that, while the \"press and public have a First Amendment presumptive right of access to plea documents generally,\" the District Court here properly sealed the Plea Document. Appellees' Br. 22-25. Appellees, though, concede that \"most of the sealed content [in the Reply Brief and Exhibit] is substantively already part of the public record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. They therefore \"agree to unseal the [Reply Brief] with only light redactions to [the Exhibit].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"We exercise plenary review over whether the First Amendment or the common law creates a presumptive right of access to judicial documents or proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11999169\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/140/#p145\">\n    123 F.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
