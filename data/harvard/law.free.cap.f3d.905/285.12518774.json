Among other arguments, Petitioners assert that, in issuing its verification, the Corps improperly imposed one condition-requiring use of a \"dry cut\" method for constructing four river crossings-\"in lieu of\" a special condition imposed by the State of West Virginia, J.A. 232-that \"[i]ndividual stream crossings must be completed in a continuous, progressive manner within 72 hours,\" J.A. 43-as part of its certification of NWP 12. Construction of each of the four river crossings using the \"dry cut\" method is expected to take four-to-six weeks to complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1), we conclude, for reasons to be more fully explained in a forthcoming opinion, that the Corps lacked authority to substitute the \"dry cut\" requirement \"in lieu of\" West Virginia's 72-hour temporal restriction. Accordingly, we VACATE, in its entirety, the Corps' verification of the Pipeline's compliance with NWP 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20330.6\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (explaining that if any part of a project requires an individual permit, then \"the NWP does not apply and all portions of the project must be evaluated as part of the individual permit process.\"). We reserve judgment on the parties' remaining arguments until our forthcoming opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
