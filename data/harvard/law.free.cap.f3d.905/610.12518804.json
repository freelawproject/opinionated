Hurwitz, Circuit Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PAEZ, Circuit Judge\n   Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") in 1938 in response to a national concern that the price of American development was the exploitation of an entire class of low-income workers. President Roosevelt, who pushed for fair labor legislation, famously declared: \"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\" S. Rep. No. 93-690, at 4 (1974). The FLSA thus safeguards workers from poverty by preventing employers from paying substandard wages in order to compete with one another on the market.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   And yet, the plaintiffs in these consolidated cases allege that the defendant employers have done exactly that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The FLSA permits employers to take a tip credit for employees in tipped occupations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m). The tip credit offsets an employer's obligation to pay the hourly minimum wage; employers may therefore pay as little as $2.13 per hour to tipped employees under federal law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.59\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the employee's tip credit wage and tips do not meet minimum wage, however, the employer must make up the difference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Alec Marsh and thirteen other former servers and bartenders\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   allege that their employers abused the tip credit provision by paying them the reduced tip credit wage and treating them as tipped employees when they were engaged in either (1) non-tipped tasks unrelated to serving or bartending, such as cleaning toilets; or (2) non-incidental tasks related to serving or bartending, such as hours spent cleaning and maintaining soft drink dispensers in excess of 20% of the workweek. Using the tip credit in such a manner effectively makes tips-intended as gifts to servers for their service-payments to employers instead, who use these tips to minimize their obligations to pay employees the full\n   minimum wage for time spent working in a non-tipped occupation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, by using servers as dishwashers, bussers, janitors, and cooks, employers can allegedly eliminate or significantly reduce their need to hire full-time janitors and cooks, who-as non-tipped workers-are entitled to the full minimum hourly wage and therefore cost more to employ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We conclude today that the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") foreclosed an employer's ability to engage in this practice by promulgating a dual jobs regulation in 1967,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and subsequently interpreting that regulation in its 1988 Field Operations Handbook. We agree with Marsh that both the regulation and the agency's interpretation are entitled to deference. Because Marsh has stated a claim under the FLSA for minimum wage violations, we reverse the district court's judgments and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Alec Marsh worked as a server at J. Alexander's, a chain restaurant with at least one location in Phoenix, Arizona, from November 2012 to April 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marsh typically worked around thirty-two hours per week, but spent almost half his time on tasks that did not produce tips, such as cutting and stocking fruit, cleaning the soft drink dispenser and nozzles, replacing soft drink syrups, stocking ice, taking out the trash, scrubbing the walls, and cleaning the restrooms. These tasks often took place out of customer view, either before the restaurant had opened or after it had closed. For example, Marsh was required to stock ice, brew tea, and cut and stock fruit every opening shift and to wipe down tables and collect and take out the trash every closing shift. In return for his labor, J. Alexander's paid Marsh an hourly tip credit wage of $4.65 per hour in 2012 and $4.80 per hour in 2013 pursuant to Arizona law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2023-363\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 23-363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Marsh filed suit, alleging that J. Alexander's use of the tip credit wage violated the FLSA's minimum wage requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Marsh's complaint alleged that, pursuant to the DOL's dual jobs regulation, he was a dual job employee\n   working in multiple occupations-one tipped, and the others not-because J. Alexander's required him to complete tasks unrelated to his tipped occupation, such as cleaning the restrooms, and to spend well over 20% of his time per week on tasks related to his occupation that did not in and of themselves produce tips, such as brewing coffee. Marsh alleged that although J. Alexander's was entitled to pay him a tip credit wage for the time he spent working in his tipped occupation as a server, it was not entitled to continue paying him the tip credit wage for time spent working in an untipped occupation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under this theory, J. Alexander's violated the FLSA's minimum wage requirements when it failed to pay Marsh the full hourly minimum wage for time spent working in an untipped occupation. Marsh requested compensation equal to the difference between the wages he was paid and Arizona's minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A few months after filing his complaint, Marsh moved for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed first amended complaint detailed how much time Marsh spent completing each untipped task in a given workweek and estimated his compensation for time engaged in a non-tipped second occupation at $3.00 per hour. As the original complaint, the amended complaint alleged two violations of the FLSA and the dual jobs regulation: the first for failing to pay Marsh the full minimum wage for time spent in excess of 20% of his workweek on non-tipped, related duties; and the second for failing to pay Marsh full minimum wage for time spent on unrelated duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   J. Alexander's moved to dismiss the original complaint. The district court granted the motion, denied Marsh's motion to file an amended complaint, and dismissed Marsh's suit with prejudice. The court concluded that Marsh failed to state an FLSA claim as a matter of law for three reasons: (1) Marsh could not state a minimum wage violation pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v. Klinghoffer Bros. Realty Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2003032\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/285/487/\">\n    285 F.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1960), as long as he was paid minimum wage per workweek, irrespective of how much he was actually paid per hour; (2) the dual jobs regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), is unambiguous and does not recognize that servers like Marsh work in different occupations when the non-tipped tasks are related to the tipped occupation; and (3) even if the dual jobs regulation\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   ambiguous, the DOL's interpretation of the regulation in its 1988 Field Operations Handbook (the \"Guidance\")-which treats the performance of related duties in excess of 20% of an employee's workweek as a different occupation-is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Marsh timely appealed. A divided panel of this court agreed with the district court that the DOL's interpretation of its dual jobs regulation was not entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v. J. Alexander's LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266985\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1108/\">\n    869 F.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017). The panel majority concluded that the Guidance's focus on duties and tasks was inconsistent with the dual jobs regulation's focus on jobs and characterized the Guidance as less an interpretation entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference than a de facto new regulation masquerading as an interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266985\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1108/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266985\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1108/\">\n    at 1121-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel majority, however, vacated the district court's dismissal of the suit and remanded to give Marsh an opportunity to file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266985\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1108/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266985\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1108/\">\n    at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A majority of the non-recused active judges voted to grant Marsh's petition for rehearing en banc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

Dissent at 638 n.2. But, the DOL was entitled to conclude otherwise. Congress has gradually increased the minimum wage over the years to \"eliminate[e] labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the\n    <em>\n     minimum\n    </em>\n    standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers.\" H.R. Rep. No. 89-1366, at 2 (1966) (emphasis added). The minimum wage is meant to be a floor, not a ceiling: it is the bare minimum necessary to secure \"the very lowest standards\" of living.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6. By crediting a server's tips towards their obligations to pay full minimum wage for time employees spend working in a non-tipped occupation, employers deprive servers the full value of their tips, which are the property of the employee,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.52\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and make it significantly more difficult for the server to earn a living beyond minimum wage. The dissent's protestations to the contrary miss the forest for the trees: the issue is not whether tipped employees are entitled to the full minimum wage plus their tips, the issue is whether employers may use an employee's tips to cover their own obligation to pay full minimum wage for time an employee spends in a non-tipped occupation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Marsh filed a motion in the district court for leave to file a first amended complaint, which the court denied on grounds of futility.

The DOL consequently issued several opinion letters in an attempt to delineate the boundaries of the dual jobs regulation. The DOL ultimately released a guidance addressing the dual jobs regulation in its Wage and Hour Division's Field Operations Handbook (\"FOH\") in 1988, which the DOL revised in 2012.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FOH \u00a7 30d00(e) (1988) (the \"Guidance\"). Judge Ikuta calls the Guidance a new rule promulgated by the DOL, but it is clearly an interpretation in line with that of the DOL's prior opinion letters. The most recent version of the Guidance states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    (1) When an individual is employed in a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation, for example, as a server and janitor (dual jobs), the tip credit is available only for the hours spent in the tipped occupation, provided such employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30.00 a month in tips.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    29 CFR 531.56(e).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    (2) 29 CFR 531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties related to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are not by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related duties are\n    <em>\n     incidental\n    </em>\n    to the regular duties of the tipped employees and are generally assigned to the tipped employee. For example, duties related to the tipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing activities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the restaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occasionally washes dishes or glasses.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    (3) However, where the facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , in excess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the workweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in those duties. All related duties count toward the 20 percent tolerance.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    (4) Likewise, an employer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends on work that is not related to the tipped occupation. For example, maintenance work (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , cleaning bathrooms and washing windows)\n    <em>\n     are not related\n    </em>\n    to the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped\n    occupations. In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual jobs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    FOH \u00a7 30d00(f) (2016) (emphases added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Guidance thus clearly contemplates that a server who performs unrelated tasks, such as cleaning restrooms, is a dual job employee entitled to the full minimum hourly wage for her unrelated work. The Guidance also clearly lays out that a server is a dual job employee if her related tasks occupy more than 20% of her hours in a workweek.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The dissent takes issue with the 2012 update to the Guidance\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    and asserts that this was the first time the agency \"provided that employers could not take a tip credit for any time employees spent on tasks that did not directly relate to serving customers.\" Dissent at 640. This presumes, of course, that prior to 2012, the DOL would have permitted employers to take a tip credit even for hours a server spent on tasks unrelated to their tipped occupation. As we discuss\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , the dual jobs regulation squarely forecloses that line of argument by distinguishing between a tipped employee who spends some time completing related, but untipped work, and a dual job employee who works as a maintenance man part of the time and a server the rest.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e).

One cannot define the former without some reference to the latter.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See Occupation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"occupation\" to mean \"an\n    <em>\n     activity\n    </em>\n    or pursuit in which a person engages\" (emphasis added) ). The tip credit regulation states that\n    \"[a]n employee who receives tips ... is a 'tipped employee' ... when, in the occupation in which he is\n    <em>\n     engaged\n    </em>\n    , the amounts he receives as tips [exceed the requisite amount].\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) (emphasis added). The dual jobs regulation-a sub-provision of the tip credit regulation-elaborates that a tipped employee who occasionally performs \"related\" but untipped \"duties\" is not employed in \"two occupations,\" but that a server who works as a maintenance man is.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 531.56(e).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The dual jobs regulation therefore contemplates a difference between tipped and untipped occupations,\n    <em>\n     as defined\n    </em>\n    by an employee's duties. The Guidance makes that distinction explicit by sorting the duties accordingly: (1) an employee who engages in duties \"directed toward producing tips\" or spends 20% of her workweek or less on duties related to \"the regular duties of the tipped employees\" works in a tipped occupation and may receive the reduced tip credit cash wage; (2) on the other hand, an employee who engages in untipped \"work that is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    related to the tipped occupation\"\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    spends more than 20% of her workweek on related duties that are not themselves directed toward producing tips must be treated as working in an untipped occupation and paid the full hourly minimum wage. FOH \u00a7 30d00(f) (emphasis added). The Guidance, far from creating a de facto new rule, closely hews to the framework suggested by the dual jobs regulation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We also reject Defendants' argument that\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    deference is inappropriate here because the DOL's position has changed throughout the years. Before adopting the Guidance in 1988, the DOL issued a number of opinion letters to employers elaborating on the dual jobs regulation. Those opinion letters consistently emphasized the temporal nature of the dual jobs regulation. For instance, although the DOL explained in a 1980 opinion letter\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    that servers who spent part of their time cleaning the salad bar and vacuuming the dining room carpet after closing time could be considered tipped employees, the agency was careful to note that it \"might have a different opinion if the facts indicated that specific employees were\n    <em>\n     routinely assigned\n    </em>\n    , for example, maintenance-type work such as floor vacuuming.\" U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div., Opinion Letter WH-502 (Mar. 28, 1980),\n    <em>\n     available at\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1980%20WL%20141336\">\n     1980 WL 141336\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). In a 1985 letter, the DOL reiterated that a server who spent \"\n    <em>\n     part of his or her time\n    </em>\n    \" on tasks such as toasting bread or making coffee could be treated as engaging in a single tipped occupation.

There are no rogue agencies or tales of intrigue to be found in this case. The reality is much less exciting: confronted with an undefined reference to \"tipped employees\" in the FLSA, the DOL promulgated the dual jobs regulation to clarify that dual job employees do not count as tipped employees in certain circumstances. Employers had six years to challenge this regulation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    28 U.S.C. 2401(a). They did not. Instead, they sought clarification on the dual\n    jobs regulation, which the DOL provided first through its opinion letters and then through the Guidance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Congress did not intend to give employers a blank check when it enacted the FLSA's tip credit provision. Recognizing this and foreseeing the possibility that employers could misuse this provision to withhold wages from dual job employees like Marsh, who are titled \"servers\" or \"bartenders,\" but who function in actuality as bussers, janitors, and chefs at least part of the time, the DOL promulgated the dual jobs regulation and issued an interpretative guidance. Together, these two provisions clarify the boundaries of acceptable tip credit use and ensure that a server's tips serve as a gift to the server, as opposed to a cost-saving benefit to the employer. Although the agency had a number of options available to resolve this issue, it is neither appropriate nor reasonable for us to override the DOL's dual jobs regulation and its Guidance where, as here, the latter is consistent with the former and both are consistent with the purpose of the FLSA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    We therefore conclude that Marsh has stated two claims for relief under the FLSA: first, that he is entitled to the full hourly minimum wage for the substantial time he spent completing related but untipped tasks, defined as more than 20% of his workweek; and second, that he is entitled to the same for time he spent on unrelated tasks.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    <strong>\n     REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Graber ; Dissent by Judge Ikuta\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-208\">\n     The district court granted motions to dismiss in six of the cases, judgment on the pleadings in two of the cases, and summary judgment in one case.

He is employed in two occupations, and no tip credit can be taken for his hours of employment in his occupation of maintenance man. Such a situation is distinguishable from that of a waitress who spends part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses. It is likewise distinguishable from the counterman who also prepares his own short orders or who, as part of a group of countermen, takes a turn as a short order cook for the group.

That is, the regulation has nothing to do with the\n    <em>\n     amount of time\n    </em>\n    that an employee spends engaged in non-tipped tasks\n    <em>\n     related\n    </em>\n    to the tipped occupation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The regulation's first example-on which the remainder of the regulation is premised-makes that focus clear. It describes a situation in which an employee performs two different functions: that of a \"maintenance man\" and that of \"waiter.\" The example says nothing about the amount of time that the employee spends doing each kind of work. That is, the given employee would qualify as having \"dual jobs\" (only one of which is a tipped occupation) no matter how he split his time between the two jobs. We know, then, that he qualifies as having \"dual jobs\" not because he spends a certain amount of time as a maintenance man and a certain amount of time as a waiter, but because he performs tasks that are unrelated to one another.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The other two examples-the \"counterman\" and the \"waitress\" examples-confirm the regulation's focus on that distinction. Importantly, the regulation presents those two examples as foils to the first example.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e) (explaining that the situation of the maintenance man/waiter \"\n    <em>\n     is distinguishable from\n    </em>\n    that of a waitress who spends part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses\" and that the same situation \"\n    <em>\n     is likewise\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     distinguishable\n    </em>\n    from the counterman who also prepares his own short orders or who, as part of a group of countermen, takes a turn as a short order cook for the group\" (emphases added) ). That is, they are not separate examples of instances in which a person works \"dual jobs.\" The examples, instead, merely illuminate when employees have \"dual jobs\" by describing instances in which an employee is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    engaged in \"dual jobs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Read in context, the waitress example does not permit the conclusion that a waitress might work \"dual jobs\" because she\n    spends a certain amount of time doing non-tipped tasks related to her work as a waitress. Rather, it stands for the notion that she is\n    <em>\n     not performing two jobs\n    </em>\n    , because her non-tipped work-unlike the waiter's work as a maintenance man-\n    <em>\n     relates\n    </em>\n    to her tipped occupation. So, too, with the counterman example. Accordingly, the majority opinion errs in arguing that the \"temporal\" words\n    <em>\n     found exclusively in those counterexamples\n    </em>\n    muddle the regulation's focus on unrelated work. Maj. op. at 623-25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The regulation's final sentence puts to rest any ambiguity. That sentence states, in reference to the counterexamples and in clear terms, that \"[s]uch\n    <em>\n     related duties\n    </em>\n    in an occupation that is a tipped occupation need not by themselves be directed toward producing tips.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e) (emphasis added). That final reference to \"related duties\" makes clear that the three examples exist to demonstrate the distinction between an employee who is engaged in duties\n    <em>\n     related\n    </em>\n    to an occupation that produces tips and an employee who is engaged in a job that is\n    <em>\n     unrelated\n    </em>\n    to a tipped occupation. The regulation's final sentence thus confirms that one cannot reasonably read the waitress and counterman examples as standing for the notion that a certain amount of related, non-tipped work constitutes a separate job.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    To defeat that reading, the majority opinion comes up with a hypothetical employee of its own. The majority opinion argues that, if one reads the regulation as focused exclusively on work unrelated to a tipped occupation, the regulation would wrongly categorize a \"server who spends 90% of her time wiping down tables ... and the remaining 10% of her time assisting customers\" as working in a single, tipped job. Maj. op. at 625 n.14. That hypothetical, even if it points out a poor policy choice, does not change the focus of the \"dual jobs\" regulation itself. Congress has set requirements that must be met before an employer may take the tip credit. The employee must be a \"tipped employee,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (m), must \"customarily and regularly receive[ ] more than $30 a month in tips,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 203(t), and must effectively make the minimum wage,\n    <em>\n     Cumbie v.

The DOL, by promulgating regulations like the one at issue in this case, has elaborated on those requirements. Those regulations might, or might not, prevent employers from taking advantage of the tip credit with respect to employees like the one in the hypothetical. But they are the regulations that the DOL has chosen. Should the DOL wish to avoid, with certainty, results like the one that the majority opinion describes, the agency is free to create, through notice and comment, a new regulation providing that a certain amount of related work becomes a new job. But the \"dual jobs\" regulation, in its current form, does not do so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    In conclusion, the regulation, in its current form, conflicts with the Guidance's interpretation with respect to work related to a tipped occupation, FOH \u00a7 30d00(f)(3). Accordingly, the Guidance does not warrant\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    deference on that point. Plaintiff thus cannot state a claim that Defendant wrongly denied him appropriate wages for the time that he spent doing work related to his role as a server, and the district court correctly dismissed that claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Guidance's interpretation focusing on unrelated work warrants\n    </em>\n    Auer\n    <em>\n     deference.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Because the DOL's other interpretation of what constitutes a \"dual job\" is entitled to deference, Plaintiff's other claim-that Defendant denied him wages for work unrelated to his job as a server-passes muster. The Guidance's interpretation that an\n    employee qualifies as working \"dual jobs\" if the employee engages in \"work that is not related to [the employee's] tipped occupation\" warrants deference for the following reasons. FOH \u00a7 30d00(f)(4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    At\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    's first step, the dual jobs regulation is ambiguous on the point that the Guidance attempts to address. The regulation, even with its clear focus on whether work is related or unrelated to tipped work, is unclear as to how \"unrelated\" an employee's duties must be to qualify the employee as working \"dual jobs.\" Must the employee perform entirely different functions? Or does performing any duty unrelated to a tipped occupation count as working a dual, non-tipped job? Must the employee perform the duties at different times of day-maintenance work in the morning, and waiter work in the afternoon-to qualify as having \"dual jobs\"? Or is it enough to perform unrelated duties at any time?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Guidance answers those questions by explaining that an employee who performs\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    \"work that is not related to [the employee's] tipped occupation ...\n    <em>\n     is effectively\n    </em>\n    employed in dual jobs.\" FOH \u00a7 30d00(f)(4) (emphasis added). Although that interpretation is not the only one that the regulation would permit, it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. The regulation's focus on whether an employee performs non-tipped \"related duties\" permits the DOL to determine at what point \"related duties\" rise to the level of unrelatedness to constitute a separate job.

This new rule strictly limited an employer's statutory right to take a tip credit by applying a specific numerical cap apparently pulled from thin air. It said: \"[W]here the facts indicate that specific employees are routinely assigned to maintenance, or that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (in excess of 20 percent) performing general preparation work or maintenance, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in such duties.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830197,3818886\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/1509/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This 20-percent cap was not made public until decades later, when the DOL included it in an amicus brief filed in the Eighth Circuit in 2010.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sec'y of Labor's Amicus Br.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Fast v.

The additional subsection was not made public until the DOL included it in the amicus brief filed in this very case. The current version of the DOL's instructions, which will be referred to here as the DOL Time-Tracking Rule (or the Rule), states in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    (1) When an individual is employed in a tipped occupation and a non-tipped occupation, for example, as a server and janitor (dual jobs), the tip credit is available only for the hours spent in the tipped occupation, provided such employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30.00 a month in tips.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    29 CFR 531.56(e).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    (2) 29 CFR 531.56(e) permits the employer to take a tip credit for time spent in duties related to the tipped occupation of an employee, even though such duties are not by themselves directed toward producing tips, provided such related\n    duties are incidental to the regular duties of the tipped employee and are generally assigned to the tipped employee. For example, duties related to the tipped occupation may include a server who does preparatory or closing activities, rolls silverware and fills salt and pepper shakers while the restaurant is open, cleans and sets tables, makes coffee, and occasionally washes dishes or glasses.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n    (3) However, where the facts indicate that tipped employees spend a substantial amount of time (i.e., in excess of 20 percent of the hours worked in the tipped occupation in the workweek) performing such related duties, no tip credit may be taken for the time spent in those duties. All related duties count toward the 20 percent tolerance.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    (4) Likewise, an employer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends on work that is not related to the tipped occupation. For example, maintenance work (e.g., cleaning bathrooms and washing windows) are not related to the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped occupations. In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual jobs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    FOH \u00a7 30d00(f) (Dec. 1, 2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    In a nutshell, rather than interpreting the dual jobs regulation, the DOL Time-Tracking Rule effectively replaces the concept of a tipped occupation with a new regulatory framework. The Rule requires the employer to count the number of minutes the employee spends on: (1) serving customers; (2) performing duties related to serving customers; and (3) performing duties not directly related to serving customers. The Rule then allows an employer to take a tip credit for the minutes an employee spends on tasks in the first category, but not for the tasks in the second category if they take more than 20 percent of the employee's time on the job, and never for tasks in the third category. Clearly, this guidance does not constitute an interpretation of the dual jobs regulation; it is a completely different approach to the tip credit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Given the undercover nature of the DOL's approach, we should first consider a threshold question: Is the Time-Tracking Rule actually an\n    <em>\n     interpretation\n    </em>\n    of the dual jobs regulation to which\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    deference applies?

In common usage, these constitute distinct jobs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Next, the regulation gives two examples of a person in a single tipped occupation: a waitress who \"spends part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses,\" and a counterman who \"as part of a group of countermen, takes a turn as a short order cook for the group.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The waitress and counterman examples are consistent with the everyday understanding that a job is comprised of a cluster of tasks typically associated with that job.

Instead, the Rule effectively disregards this example and takes a different approach, holding that an employee is engaged in dual jobs: (1) if the employee has spent any time at all on tasks not related to obtaining tips; or (2) if the employee has spent time on tasks related to obtaining tips (but not directly serving customers), and this time in the aggregate accounts for 20 percent or more of the hours worked. Obviously, this description of time spent in different tasks over the course of the day is not a description of distinct jobs. There is no job that can be described as more-than-20-percent-of-time-spent-on-untipped-related tasks, nor is there a job that can be described as the five or ten minutes spent here and there on unrelated tasks.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    The Rule also effectively disregards the regulation's examples of when an employee is engaged in a single job, despite being involved in a multitude of tasks. Under the dual jobs regulation, a waitress doing typical waitress duties remains a waitress, even if (in five-minute increments throughout her workweek) she spends 60 percent of her time waiting tables, 10 percent cleaning tables, 10 percent toasting bread, 10 percent making coffee, and 10 percent washing dishes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e). The dual jobs regulation - and common sense - tells us that the waitress is 100 percent engaged in the single tipped occupation of waitressing - she is not 60 percent a waitress, 10 percent a janitor, 10 percent a baker, 10 percent a barrista, and 10 percent a dishwasher. The Rule holds exactly the opposite: because such a waitress spends more than 20 percent of her time in tasks that are not themselves tipped, she is both engaged in the tipped occupation of waitress and engaged in the untipped occupation of ... something else?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    Similarly, the dual jobs regulation contemplates that an employee who has a job as a counterman, which may include both serving customers at the counter and working as a chef preparing short orders, is engaged in a single tipped occupation.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But because the Rule defines \"related duties\" to mean duties that \"are not by themselves directed toward producing tips\" and that meet certain other criteria, FOH \u00a7 30d00(f)(2), the time a counterman spends working as a chef preparing short orders (which is not a tip-generating task) is not part of the job of counterman if the cooking duty takes up more than 20 percent of the counterman's time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FOH \u00a7 30d00(f)(3). In other words, if the counterman spends more than 20 percent of his time preparing short orders, then under the Rule he has two jobs, even though the\n    dual jobs regulation says he has only one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.56\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    Despite this clear disjunction between the Rule and the regulation, the majority argues that the Rule must be upheld because the dual jobs regulation is ambiguous, and the Rule is not \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Maj.

Graber Conc. Diss. at 54-55. But even if subsection 4 is read by itself, it is not entitled to\n     <em>\n      Auer\n     </em>\n     deference. Subsection 4 provides:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n     Likewise, an employer may not take a tip credit for the time that a tipped employee spends on work that is not related to the tipped occupation. For example, maintenance work (e.g., cleaning bathrooms and washing windows) are not related to the tipped occupation of a server; such jobs are non-tipped occupations. In this case, the employee is effectively employed in dual jobs.\n    </blockquote>\n    <p id=\"p-250\">\n     This is not an interpretation of the dual jobs regulation because, like subsection (3), subsection (4) adopts a minute-by-minute approach that contradicts the regulation's occupation-based analysis. While the regulation applies only when an employee holds two distinct jobs, such as a maintenance man and a waiter, subsection (4) classifies the minutes an employee spends on tasks that are \"not related to the tipped occupation\" as a distinct job, regardless of the nature of the tasks or the amount of time spent performing them. The regulation's assurance that a waitress may perform multiple tasks (including washing dishes or glasses and cleaning tables) and still be employed in a single waitress job, is at odds with subsection (4)'s statement that a server who spends any time washing windows is \"effectively employed in dual jobs.\" Nor does subsection (4) clarify any ambiguous terms in the dual jobs regulation; rather, it adds to the confusion by failing to explain why time spent washing windows, but not time spent washing dishes, is \"not related\" to the tipped occupation. Because subsection (4) merely presents the agency's position, rather than an interpretation of the regulation, it is not entitled to deference.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-251\">\n     The majority's reliance on\n     <em>\n      Schaefer\n     </em>\n     , Maj.
