Russell filed suit and the District Court denied the motions of Richardson and the Superior Court to dismiss on various immunity grounds. In this interlocutory appeal, we consider, among other things, whether judicial immunity extends to protect an officer from a suit challenging the manner in which he executed a court order. Because we, like the District Court, conclude it does not, and the District Court's thorough and careful opinion properly disposed of the motions in almost all respects, we will affirm except as to Appellees' claim for gross negligence, for which the Virgin Islands has not waived sovereign immunity and which thus should be dismissed on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the conduct at issue in this case, L.T. was 15 years old and had been designated by the Virgin Islands Superior Court a \"Person in Need of Supervision\" (PINS), meaning a \"child\" who, among other things, \"habitually disobeys the reasonable demands of the person responsible for the child's care and is beyond their control.\" V.I. Code Ann. tit. 5, \u00a7 2502(23). That designation also subjected L.T. to a court order directing him to \"follow the reasonable rules of his mother while living with her.\" JA 18. Apparently, however, his mother continued to have problems with his behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One day, concluding she needed \"assistance\" with ensuring L.T.'s compliance, Russell contacted the Superior Court and \"requested that [L.T.] be brought before the judge to answer for his behavior.\" JA 18. According to the complaint, she also \"advised that her son was at home in his bed.\" JA 18. In response to her request, several Superior Court Marshals, including Deputy Marshal Christopher Richardson, arrived at Russell's home later that day. L.T. was at that point \"relaxing in his room, in his underwear and unarmed.\" JA 19. The precise sequence of events that unfolded is unclear at this stage, but, according to the complaint, \"Richardson shot [L.T.] under circumstances that were unjustified and an excessive use of force since [L.T.] was unarmed and did not threaten bodily harm to the marshals or third parties as he was attempting to run past the marshals.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   L.T. was airlifted to Puerto Rico for medical treatment, but the shooting rendered him a quadriplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Russell eventually filed this action on behalf of herself and L.T. (collectively, \"the Family\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the District Court of the Virgin Islands. The operative complaint included claims against Richardson under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for excessive force and under territorial law for negligence, gross negligence, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as claims against the Superior Court for negligence, negligent hiring and retention, and vicarious liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant to the claims at issue in this appeal, Richardson and the Superior Court (together, \"Appellants\") filed motions to dismiss under Federal Rules of Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), with Richardson arguing he enjoyed a form of absolute immunity known as \"quasi-judicial\" immunity and qualified immunity with respect to the \u00a7 1983 claim, and both parties arguing they enjoyed sovereign immunity with respect to the tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The District Court rejected those arguments. As to Richardson's claim of quasi-judicial immunity, the District Court acknowledged that many cases have granted such immunity to officers who have been sued for their role in enforcing court orders but determined that the reasoning behind those cases \"d[id]n't cover shooting somebody.\" JA 69. The Court therefore held that absolute immunity did not apply. And while the Court recognized that the qualified immunity issue should be decided \"at the earliest point possible in the case,\" JA 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Instead, it explained, Richardson would be permitted to renew the defense once a \"fuller factual record ha[d] been developed.\" JA 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the sovereign immunity asserted by both defendants, the District Court recognized that, to bring a tort claim against the Virgin Islands Government, its departments, or its employees in their official capacities, a plaintiff must comply with the terms of the Virgin Islands Tort Claims Act, V.I. Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7\u00a7 3401 - 3417, as a predicate to the courts' jurisdiction. But it rejected defendants' argument that the Family had failed to do so, either by filing an inadequate \"notice of intention to file a claim\" or by failing to file a \"claim.\" \"[S]ubstantial compliance with the statute is all that is required,\" JA 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brunn v. Dowdye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3588842\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/59/899/#p910\">\n    59 V.I. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (2013) ), the Court observed, and the Family had \"sufficiently complied,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the denial of their motions to dismiss, Appellants filed an omnibus motion for reconsideration, clarification, and a more definite statement, and asked the District Court to stay discovery until both that motion and the forthcoming appeal to this Court had been resolved. But they soon withdrew the omnibus motion, and the District Court declined to issue a stay, ordering discovery to proceed \"solely on the issue of ... qualified immunity,\" JA 14. Appellants then filed this timely appeal. Appellants also filed a motion to stay discovery pending appeal, which we denied. Discovery continued and, by the time of oral argument in this case, was nearly complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellants contend that the District Court erred in denying Richardson quasi-judicial immunity and qualified immunity and in denying them both sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address each of these three immunity doctrines below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Quasi-Judicial Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We start with Richardson's argument that he cannot be sued for using excessive force because, just as a judge enjoys absolute \"judicial immunity\" for an official act like issuing a PINS order, so too does Richardson enjoy \"quasi-judicial\" immunity\n   for his official acts in enforcing that order. We briefly review the history of this immunity doctrine before turning to its application to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Quasi-Judicial Immunity Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Quasi-judicial immunity, as one might guess, evolved out of its well-known namesake, judicial immunity. \"Few doctrines were more solidly established at common law than the immunity of judges from liability for damages for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Pierson v.

Reading two of our precedents and one from the Tenth Circuit as standing for a categorical rule that \"any public official acting pursuant to a court directive is immune from suit,\" regardless of the specific action challenged in that suit, Appellants argue that Richardson enjoys immunity from the excessive force claim here because at the time he shot L.T. he was acting \"at the direction of a judge.\" Appellants' Br. 21. And, according to Appellants, \"[t]here simply cannot be one rule for a deputy who is able to accomplish th[at] directive without incident and a different rule for a deputy who meets with resistance that results in an injury or death.\" Appellants' Br. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The problem with this argument is that it ignores the distinction between claims based on the actions actually authorized by court order, which are barred by quasi-judicial immunity, and those based on the manner in which a court order is enforced, which are not. As we explain below, that distinction dates to common law, has been consistently recognized by the Courts of Appeals, and is all but dictated by the \"functional\" approach to modern-day immunity. It also leads us to affirm the District Court's denial of absolute immunity to Richardson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We start with the common law, which informs our consideration of immunities available under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Rehberg v.

And because an arrestee was \"entitled to be treated with ordinary humanity, and any unnecessary severity could not be justified by the writ,\" Thomas M. Cooley,\n   <em>\n    A Treatise on the Law of Torts or the Wrongs Which Arise Independent of Contract\n   </em>\n   395 (Chicago, Callaghan &amp; Co. 1879), the common law provided that, \"though the process for the arrest of the defendant is valid, yet the officer may render himself liable to the defendant for abuses of his process, as where the officer ... uses excessive force,\" Mechem \u00a7 771, at 509.

And the following year, the Tenth Circuit even more clearly rejected the argument that officers enjoy quasi-judicial immunity for excessive force claims, explaining that, \"[w]hile the immunity granted in\n   <em>\n    Valdez\n   </em>\n   protects defendants from liability for the actual arrest, it does not empower them to execute the arrest with excessive force,\" nor does it provide \"absolute[ ] immun[ity] from liability for the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which [officers] carry out otherwise proper court orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

But Appellants do-eleven of them, to be precise. Yet none is even colorable. Appellants state, for example, that the notice \"does not provide a time or place where the alleged incident occurred,\" \"does not identify ... Russell as filing a claim on behalf of ... [L.T.],\" is \"not verified,\" and lacks a \"receipt ... confirming [its] filing\" with the Governor. Appellants' Br. 40-42. The Family's notice, however, plainly states that L.T. was shot \"[o]n July 11, 2013\" in his \"home\" (the \"time\" and \"place\" where the claim arose); it asserts that it is filed \"on behalf of Jamila Russell, individually and as next of kin to [L.T.], a minor, for personal injuries and civil rights violations\"; it is verified by a notary's stamp and signature;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is accompanied by certified mail receipts showing it was served on the Governor and Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Other alleged deficiencies are premised on \"requirements\" of Appellants' own invention-such as an alleged failure to mention specific tort theories by name, although the Virgin Islands Supreme Court has held it is \"not necessary\" for the notice to \"provide a precise legal theory upon which recovery is sought,\"\n   <em>\n    Brunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3588842\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/59/899/#p910\">\n    59 V.I. at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or an alleged error in Russell describing herself as her son's \"next of kin\" because he is not deceased, although Appellant offers no authority for the proposition that the use of the term is so limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Appellants also nitpick what are obviously typographical errors, such as recitation of Richardson's first name as \"Carl\" instead of \"Chris\" or of L.T.'s status as \"not a quadriplegic\" instead of \"now a quadriplegic.\" We will not deny jurisdiction on the basis of such quibbles when the Family's notice was \"sufficiently definite to inform the officers ... of the time and cause of claimant's injuries or damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3588842\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/59/899/#p910\">\n    59 V.I. at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Appellants fare no better with their contention that the District Court erred in finding that the Family filed a timely claim. The VITCA requires that a plaintiff, after filing her notice, file a \"claim\" within two years after the claim accrued, V.I. Code Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 3409(c), which must include, in addition to the information required by the notice, the \"items of damage of injuries claimed to have been sustained and the total sum claimed,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3588842\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/59/899/#p910\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3410. So what is the alleged deficiency in the Family's claim? According to Appellants, the Family did not file one, because \"a [c]omplaint is not the same thing as a 'claim' under the VITCA,\" Reply Br. 15, and \"[p]lenty of case law says that,\" Oral Arg. at 38.14-.24, http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/oralargument/audio/17-2255_Russellv.SuperiorCourtVI.mp3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This appears yet another misstatement to this Court.

We agree with them that it does not. In\n    <em>\n     Mireles\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court held that a judge maintained judicial immunity for expressly ordering the plaintiff brought to his courtroom \"forcibly and with excessive force.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n     at 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n     112 S.Ct. 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . While noting that \"[o]f course, a judge's direction ... to carry out a[n] ... order with excessive force\" is not a judicial act, the Court reasoned that the \"relevant inquiry is the 'nature' and 'function' of the act, not the 'act itself,' \" for \"if only the particular act in question were to be scrutinized, then any mistake of a judge in excess of his authority would become a 'nonjudicial' act, because an improper or erroneous act cannot be said to be normally performed by a judge.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n     at 12-13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216557\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/9/#p11\">\n     112 S.Ct. 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In other words,\n    <em>\n     Mireles\n    </em>\n    arose in the traditional judicial immunity context, as the plaintiff had \"challenged the judge's order directly ... by suing the judge,\" and, though the judge there had allegedly ordered the use of excessive force, the Court merely reaffirmed the basic principle that the \"applicability of absolute immunity cannot turn on the correctness of the judge's decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Richman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9463903\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/430/\">\n     270 F.3d at 436\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
