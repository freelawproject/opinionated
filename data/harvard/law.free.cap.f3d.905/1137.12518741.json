While agreeing that the minors are entitled to a hearing to contest the gang allegations, the government contends that the district court abused its discretion in entering the preliminary injunction because (1) the relief ordered conflicts with the TVPRA and the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   settlement and (2) existing procedures provide the minors an adequate opportunity to challenge the revocation of their placements. We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The TVPRA and\n    <em>\n     Flores\n    </em>\n    Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The TVPRA mandates that ORR place unaccompanied children in the \"least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). The preliminary injunction is entirely consistent with that statutory mandate. For each member of the plaintiff class, ORR has already determined that the \"least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child\" is placement with a sponsor. As the district court recognized, \"[i]f DHS could, the day after a minor was released to a parent or other sponsor, arrest the minor ... and restart the process, the TVPRA's instruction to place the minor in the least restrictive appropriate setting would mean little.\"\n   <em>\n    Saravia\n   </em>\n   , 280 F.Supp.3d at 1196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The preliminary injunction therefore orders the minor's release to the previous custodian if a neutral adjudicator determines, after a hearing, that the minor poses no danger to the community or himself and is not a flight risk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1176-77, 1197. The government first complains the injunction somehow conflicts with the TVPRA provision prohibiting the government from placing a minor \"with a person or entity unless [ORR] makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the child's physical and mental well-being.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A). But, the preliminary injunction calls for the minors to be released back to their\n   <em>\n    previous\n   </em>\n   sponsors; the government has already determined each of these sponsors is suitable. Nothing in the TVPRA requires the government to conduct this review a second time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the preliminary injunction requires a hearing within seven days of a minor's arrest, it provides the government significant flexibility in deciding whether and where to detain the minor in the interim. Contrary to the government's assertions on appeal, nothing in the order prohibits the government from transferring the minors to ORR custody within 72 hours, as required by the TVPRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1232(b)(3). Moreover, the government concedes that it can avoid the 72 hour rule when appropriate \"under the 'exceptional circumstances' exception to the TVPRA.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government argues in passing that the preliminary injunction's requirement to hold the hearing \"in the jurisdiction where the minor has been arrested or where the minor lives,\"\n   <em>\n    Saravia\n   </em>\n   , 280 F.Supp.3d at 1197, is burdensome, because the government only maintains juvenile immigration detention facilities in limited locations. But, at the preliminary injunction stage, the district court was well within its discretion to conclude that the cost of transporting minors to the hearing location was not likely to outweigh the benefits provided by its order, given that witnesses and evidence concerning the gang allegations that led to the minor's current predicament are most likely to be found where they lived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266713\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/976/#p981\">\n    872 F.3d at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"minimal costs to the government ... are greatly outweighed by the likely reduction it will effect in unnecessary deprivations of individuals' physical liberty\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

Adequacy of Existing Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The government next contends that the district court failed to consider two existing procedural protections allegedly available to the minors: (1) an internal review process mandated by the TVPRA and (2) the bond hearings required by the\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   settlement. To the contrary, the district court expressly considered \"current ORR procedures,\" including \"the right to challenge a finding of dangerousness in a\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   bond hearing ... and regular review by ORR to determine the appropriate security level\" and concluded that \"on the current record\" these procedures \"appear inadequate to protect against the risk of minors being erroneously taken away from their sponsors.\"\n   <em>\n    Saravia\n   </em>\n   , 280 F.Supp.3d at 1198-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding.
