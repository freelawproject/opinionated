Years after Wolfe's death, the trustee of the Randy Craig Wolfe Trust, Michael Skidmore, brought this suit for copyright infringement against Led Zeppelin, James Patrick Page, Robert Anthony Plant, John Paul Jones, Super Hype Publishing, and the Warner Music Group Corporation as parent of Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., Atlantic Recording Corporation, and Rhino Entertainment Co. (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The case proceeded to a jury trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Defendants. Skidmore appeals, raising a host of alleged trial errors and challenging the district court's determination that for unpublished works under the Copyright Act of 1909 (\"1909 Act\"), the scope of the copyright is defined by the deposit copy. We hold that several of the district court's jury instructions were erroneous and prejudicial. We therefore vacate the amended judgment in part and remand for a new trial. For the benefit of the parties and the district court on remand, we also address whether the scope of copyright protection for an unpublished work under the 1909 Act is defined by the deposit copy. We hold that it is. We also address several other evidentiary issues raised by Skidmore that are likely to arise again on remand. Finally, in light of our disposition, we vacate the denial of Defendants' motions for attorneys' fees and costs and remand those issues as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Randy Wolfe, nicknamed Randy California by Jimi Hendrix, was a musician and a member of the band Spirit. He wrote the\n   song \"Taurus\" in late 1966. Spirit signed a recording contract in August 1967, and its first album\n   <em>\n    Spirit\n   </em>\n   -which included \"Taurus\"-was released in late 1967 or early 1968. Hollenbeck Music (\"Hollenbeck\") filed the copyright for Taurus in December 1967 and listed Randy Wolfe as the author. As part of the copyright registration packet, \"Taurus\" was transcribed into sheet music that was deposited with the Copyright Office (\"Taurus deposit copy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The band Led Zeppelin, formed in 1968, consisted of Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. Spirit and Led Zeppelin's paths crossed several times in the late 1960s and early 1970s. On tour, Led Zeppelin would occasionally perform a cover of another Spirit song, \"Fresh Garbage.\" Spirit and Led Zeppelin both performed at a concert in Denver in 1968 and at the Atlanta International Pop Festival, the Seattle Pop Festival, and the Texas Pop Festival in 1969. There is no direct evidence that Led Zeppelin band members listened to Spirit's performances on any of these dates, although members of Spirit testified that they conversed with Led Zeppelin members, and one Spirit band member testified that Spirit had played \"Taurus\" the night both bands performed in Denver. Additionally, there was evidence at trial that Robert Plant attended a February 1970 Spirit performance. Jimmy Page testified that he currently owns a copy of the album\n   <em>\n    Spirit\n   </em>\n   , but he was unable to clarify when he had obtained that copy. In late 1971, Led Zeppelin released its fourth album, an untitled album known as \"Led Zeppelin IV.\" One of the tracks on the album is the timeless classic \"Stairway to Heaven,\" which was written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Randy Wolfe passed away in 1997, and his mother established the Randy Craig Wolfe Trust (the \"Trust\"). All of Wolfe's intellectual property rights were transferred to the Trust, including his ownership interest in \"Taurus.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His mother was the trustee or co-trustee until her death in 2009, after which time Skidmore became the trustee. Immediately after the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707003\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/663/\">\n    572 U.S. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707003,12580871\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1962/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1967-68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707003,12580871\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1962/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), which clarified that laches is not a defense where copyright infringement is ongoing, Skidmore filed this suit on behalf of the Trust alleging that \"Stairway to Heaven\" infringed the copyright in \"Taurus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Skidmore initially filed his complaint in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, but the case was subsequently transferred to the Central District of California.\n   <em>\n    Skidmore v. Led Zeppelin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360009\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/581/#p589\">\n    106 F.Supp.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 589-90 (E.D. Pa. 2015). Skidmore alleged direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement. He also alleged a claim titled \"Right of Attribution-Equitable Relief-Falsification of Rock n' Roll History.\" With regard to copyright infringement, Skidmore alleged that the opening notes of \"Stairway to Heaven\" are substantially similar to those in \"Taurus.\" The Defendants disputed ownership, substantial similarity, and access. They also alleged a number of affirmative defenses including unclean hands, laches, and independent creation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the district court granted summary judgment to John Paul Jones, Super Hype Publishing, and Warner Music\n   Group (\"summary judgment defendants\"), as they had not performed or distributed \"Stairway to Heaven\" in the three-year statute of limitations period preceding the filing of the complaint. Additionally, the district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on Skidmore's \"Right of Attribution-Equitable Relief-Falsification of Rock n' Roll History\" claim, as the district court \"had diligently searched but [was] unable to locate any cognizable claim to support this [Falsification of Rock n' Roll History] theory of liability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because the 1909 Act governed the scope of the copyright Wolfe obtained in \"Taurus,\" the district court further concluded that the protectable copyright was the musical composition transcribed in the deposit copy of \"Taurus\" and not the sound recordings. The district court therefore concluded that to prove substantial similarity between \"Taurus\" and \"Stairway to Heaven,\" Skidmore would have to rely on the \"Taurus\" deposit copy rather than a sound recording. The district court also found that there were triable issues of fact relating to ownership, access, substantial similarity, and damages that could only be resolved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At a pretrial conference in April 2016, after reviewing summaries of each witnesses' proposed testimony, the district court decided to allot each side ten hours to present its case. The district court also tentatively granted Defendants' motion in limine to exclude recordings of Spirit performing \"Taurus\" as well as expert testimony based on those recordings, again concluding that the 1967 deposit copy should be the baseline when considering substantial similarity. Before trial, the district court filed an order confirming its prior tentative rulings on the motions in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As part of expert discovery, Skidmore's attorney deposed Dr. Lawrence Ferrara, Defendants' expert musicologist. During the deposition it came to light that in 2013 Dr. Ferrara had done a comparison of the \"Taurus\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\" recordings for Rondor Music (\"Rondor\"), a subsidiary of Universal Music Publishing Group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Ferrara testified that when he was approached by Defendants' counsel, he informed them that he had already completed an analysis for Rondor. Defendants' counsel consulted with Rondor, which waived any conflict and consented to Dr. Ferrara being retained as an expert witness for Defendants. Throughout the deposition, Skidmore's counsel objected and requested copies of Dr. Ferrara's communications with Rondor and Universal. After the deposition, Skidmore filed a Motion for Sanctions and to Preclude Dr. Ferrara from testifying at trial. The district court denied Skidmore's motion because it was improperly noticed, over the page limit, and untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A five-day jury trial ensued. While questioning Jimmy Page, Skidmore's counsel requested that several sound recordings of Spirit performing \"Taurus\" be played so that he could ask Page whether he had ever heard any of the recordings. When Defendants objected, Skidmore's counsel explained that the recordings were offered to prove access, rather than substantial similarity. The district court determined that although the sound recordings were relevant to prove access, it would be too prejudicial for the jury to hear the recordings. To avoid any prejudice, the district court had Page listen to the recordings outside the presence of the jury and then allowed Skidmore's counsel to question him about them in the presence of the\n   jury. Page eventually testified that he presently had an album containing \"Taurus\" in his collection, but while testifying he did not admit to having heard any recordings of \"Taurus\" prior to composing \"Stairway to Heaven.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also of note, Kevin Hanson, Skidmore's master guitarist, performed the \"Taurus\" deposit copy as he interpreted it, and played recordings of his performances of the beginning notes of the \"Taurus\" deposit copy and \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The \"Taurus\" recording Hanson played for the jury during his testimony, however, only contained the bass clef and excluded the treble clef, which contained additional notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the cross-examination of Dr. Ferrara, Skidmore used up the last of his ten hours of allotted trial time. The district court found that Skidmore had not made effective use of his time for a variety of reasons, but granted Skidmore two additional minutes to finish cross-examining Dr. Ferrara and ten minutes to cross-examine each remaining witness. Skidmore was not allowed to call rebuttal witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During jury deliberations, the jury asked to hear Skidmore's recording of Hanson playing both \"Taurus\" and \"Stairway to Heaven.\" The district court asked if the jury would like to hear the deposit-copy version of \"Taurus\" or the version of \"Taurus\" with only the bass clef. One juror responded with \"bass clef\" but the jury foreperson responded with \"the full copy.\" The district court directed that the full deposit-copy version be played and asked if that answered the jury's question, to which the foreperson replied \"thank you.\" The other juror did not object to hearing the full copy rather than the bass clef version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The jury ultimately returned a verdict for Defendants. The jury found that Skidmore owned the copyright to \"Taurus,\" that Defendants had access to \"Taurus,\" but that the two songs were not substantially similar under the extrinsic test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the verdict, the district court entered an amended judgment in favor of all Defendants. Skidmore did not file any post-judgment motions challenging the verdict, but timely appealed from the amended judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this appeal, Skidmore challenges (1) various jury instructions, (2) the district court's ruling that substantial similarity must be proven using the copyright deposit copy, (3) the district court's ruling that sound recordings could not be played to prove access, (4) the district court's decision not to exclude or sanction Dr. Ferrara, (5) the fact that the full version of \"Taurus\" rather than the bass clef version was played in response to the jury's request, and (6) the imposition of strict time limits as a violation of due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following entry of the amended judgment, Warner/Chappell filed a motion for attorneys' fees and a motion for costs. The district court denied these motions. Warner/Chappell timely cross-appealed, and we consolidated the two appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We begin with a discussion of the elements that Skidmore must establish to prevail on his copyright infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In order to prove copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show \"(1) that he owns a valid copyright in his [work], and (2) that [the defendants] copied protected aspects of the [work's] expression.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rentmeester v.

Thus, there can be copyright protection on the basis of a sufficiently original combination of otherwise non-protectable music elements. The district court's failure to so instruct the jury was especially problematic in this case, because Skidmore's expert, Dr. Stewart, testified that there was extrinsic substantial similarity based on the combination of five elements-some of which were protectable and some of which were in the public domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although Defendants requested an instruction on selection and arrangement, they argue that the district court's failure to give such an instruction does not warrant reversal. First, Defendants argue that Skidmore waived any objection to the court's failure to give such an instruction, in part because Skidmore did not voice any objection when the district court was reading the final jury instructions to counsel. This argument is baseless. Although Skidmore's counsel transcribed and assembled the jury instructions as directed by the district court, the court specifically stated that it did not want any oral objections to its final jury instructions, as the parties\n   had already submitted separate instructions and written objections to the other side's proposed instructions. Skidmore proposed an instruction on selection and arrangement as did the Defendants and each side objected to the other side's proposed instruction as required by Local Rule 51-1, 5.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yamada v. Nobel Biocare Holding AG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323708\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/536/#p543\">\n    825 F.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (9th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, Defendants contend that Skidmore did not argue or present evidence of a copyrightable selection and arrangement of otherwise unprotectable elements. When objecting to one of Skidmore's jury instructions, however, Defendants expressly stated that Skidmore relied on a selection and arrangement theory in his argument for infringement. On appeal, Defendants maintain that Skidmore instead relied on the similarity of a \"combination\" of elements present in \"Taurus\" and \"Stairway to Heaven.\" Defendants' refined argument splits hairs and contradicts their earlier position. Whether or not the words \"selection and arrangement\" were used at trial is irrelevant because it is clear that this legal theory formed the basis of Skidmore's infringement claim. Indeed, the fact that Defendants recognized this argument at trial undermines their contrary argument here. Additionally, many selection and arrangement cases also refer to a \"combination\" of musical elements, further undermining Defendants' proffered distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swirsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376372\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/841/#p845\">\n    376 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   849 ;\n   <em>\n    Satava\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9347873\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/323/805/#p811\">\n    323 F.3d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As both sides recognized in their proposed jury instructions, a selection and arrangement instruction was appropriate and necessary given the basis for Skidmore's infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants also argue that any error is harmless, because the jury would likely have reached the same verdict even if it had been instructed on selection and arrangement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clem v. Lomeli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646674,5896019,3648285\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/1177/\">\n    566 F.3d 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1182 (9th Cir. 2009). We disagree. Without a selection and arrangement instruction, the jury instructions severely undermined Skidmore's argument for extrinsic similarity, which is exactly what the jury found lacking. Given that nothing else in the instructions alerted the jury that the selection and arrangement of unprotectable elements could be copyrightable, \"looking to the instructions as a whole, the substance of the applicable law was [not] fairly and correctly covered.\"\n   <em>\n    Swinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466968\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/794/#p802\">\n    270 F.3d at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quotations omitted). Indeed, as discussed further below, other instructions when considered in the absence of a selection and arrangement instruction imply that selection and arrangement of public domain material is not copyrightable. For instance, Jury Instruction No. 20, which instructed the jury that \"any elements from ... the public domain are not considered original parts and not protected by copyright,\" suggests that no combination of these elements can be protected by copyright precisely because the court omitted a selection and arrangement instruction. The district court's failure to instruct the jury on selection and arrangement was therefore prejudicial given Skidmore's theory of infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9466968\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/794/#p802\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Skidmore also argues that the district court erred in two ways in its formulation\n   of the jury instructions on originality.

Jury Instruction Nos. 16 and 20 in combination likely led the jury to believe that public domain elements-such as a chromatic scale or a series of three notes-were not protectable, even where there was a modification or selection and arrangement that may have rendered them original. Skidmore's expert testified that \"Taurus\" contained certain public domain elements-such as chromatic scales-that were modified in an original way, but the jury instructions as a whole likely would have led the jury to believe that such evidence could not establish the basis of a cognizable copyright claim.

Specifically, Skidmore relies on \u00a7 1(e), which extended copyright protection to \"any system of notation or any form of record in which the thought of an author may be recorded.\" \u00a7 1(e). But, as Defendants point out, this actually defines the forms an infringing copy can take, rather than the scope of what can be copyrighted. \u00a7 1(a), (e). Therefore, although the 1909 Act clearly extended copyright law to protect against infringement beyond mere reproduction of the sheet music-in contravention of\n   <em>\n    White-Smith\n   </em>\n   -it did not clearly state that copyrighted works could be anything other than published sheet music or the musical composition transcribed in the deposit copy.

Skidmore relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n    212 F.3d at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response, we observed that an expert had testified that the essential elements of the musical composition were intact in the deposit copy; therefore we\n   declined to overturn the jury's finding that the deposit copy was \"complete\" because there was no intent to defraud and any inaccuracies in the deposit copy were minor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n    at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   dealt with whether the deposit copy adequately satisfied the \"complete copy\" statutory requirement, it is not directly on point. Nonetheless, Skidmore argues that we should extrapolate from language in\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   that the expert \"even played the deposit copy\" to conclude that a recording was also played, and that the recording was used for purposes of evaluating substantial similarity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the evidentiary presentation in\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   may support Skidmore's claim that typically sound recordings have been used in infringement trials under the 1909 Act, our resolution of the \"complete copy\" issue did not create binding precedent that copyright protection extended to sound recordings under the 1909 Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Skidmore also relies on three other cases to support his argument that copyright protection under the 1909 Act extends beyond sheet music, none of which are helpful. One of the cases cited by Skidmore concludes that a copyright obtained via publication is not invalidated by failure to deposit promptly a copy.\n   <em>\n    Washingtonian Pub. Co. v.

The deposit copy carries less importance for published works, however, so this conclusion is not particularly instructive. 2\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7.17[A] (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) for the proposition that either the original or a copy of the deposit copy must be kept for unpublished works). Unlike for unpublished works, a deposit copy is not necessary to secure copyright in published works. 1909 Act \u00a7 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The other two cases both deal with copyright issues under the 1976 Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.

Neither of these cases help us determine whether the deposit copy for unpublished works defines the scope of copyright protection under the 1909 Act. The 1976 Act includes a provision providing that federal copyright protection attaches upon fixation of a work to any tangible medium, which can include a sound recording.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This provision, however, was not a part of the 1909 Act. As a result, although it makes sense in the context of the 1976 Act to look at a recording for evidence of what the composition includes because federal copyright protection attaches when the work is recorded, it makes significantly less sense to do so for the 1909 Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The cases Defendants offer in support of their argument are also not directly on point. Some do not pertain to the 1909 Act, which is problematic for the reasons discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    White-Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8287708\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/1/#p10\">\n    209 U.S. at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8287708\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/1/#p10\">\n    28 S.Ct. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Merrell v.

More persuasive are the cases that, in the context of discussing the current copyright scheme, opined that one of the purposes of the deposit requirement is to provide \"sufficient material to identify the work in which the registrant claims a copyright.\"\n   <em>\n    Data Gen.

These cases support Defendants' contention that the deposit copy defines the scope of the copyright, but as in\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   the ultimate holding in these cases was that minor errors in the deposit copy do not invalidate a copyright.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Data Gen.

The 1909 Act prohibits the destruction of the deposit copies of unpublished works without notice to the copyright owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1909 Act \u00a7\u00a7 59-60; Report of the Register on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law at 81 (1961). Additionally, the Register of Copyright's policy is to retain access to unpublished works for the full copyright term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of the Register on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law at 80-82 (1961).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We are persuaded that for unpublished musical works under the 1909 Act, the deposit copy defines the scope of the copyright. Overall, the structure of the 1909 Act demonstrates that the deposit copy encompasses the scope of the copyright for unpublished works, as the deposit copy must be filed not only to register the copyright, but for the copyright to even exist. The 1909 Act states that \"copyright may also be had of the works of an author of which copies are not reproduced for sale,\n   <em>\n    by the deposit\n   </em>\n   , with claim of copyright, of one complete copy of such work.\" 1909 Act \u00a7 11 (emphasis added). Because the 1909 Act makes the existence of copyright dependent on the deposit copy, it makes sense that the deposit copy also defines the scope of the copyright. It was not until the 1976 Act that common law copyright was federalized and copyright attached at the creation of the work. Recognizing the importance of deposit copies for unpublished works, Congress and the Register of Copyrights have taken care to ensure the preservation of deposit copies. 1909 Act \u00a7\u00a7 59-60; Report of the Register on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law at 80-82 (1961). Similarly, even under later versions of the Copyright Act, the purpose of deposit copies has been described as providing a way \"to identify the work in which the registrant claims a copyright.\"\n   <em>\n    Data Gen. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530360\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1147/#p1161\">\n    36 F.3d at 1161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that copyright protection under the 1909 Act did not attach until either publication or registration, we conclude that for unpublished works the deposit copy defines the scope of the copyright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Skidmore puts forth three policy arguments, but they do not alter our conclusion as they do not override the weight of the 1909 Act's statutory scheme and legislative history. First, Skidmore argues that it is challenging to compare a sound recording of the infringing work to a deposit copy of the infringed work. While many copyrighted works, such as books, can be easily formatted to satisfy the deposit copy requirement, musical works are not as well reflected in deposit copies. This makes the intrinsic test for substantial similarity especially challenging when comparing a deposit copy to a sound recording, as the intrinsic test is concerned with the general \"total concept and feel\" of a work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Three Boys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747547\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/477/#p485\">\n    212 F.3d at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Skidmore argues that our conclusion is biased against musicians who do not read music and could not possibly have written the deposit copies of their own songs. It is not uncommon for musicians who are composing songs to not know how to read music. Skidmore argues that for musicians who do not read music it would be overly time consuming and expensive to make accurate deposit copy sheet music going forward. For new works, however, sound recordings\n   can be deposited as the deposit copy, so we are not overly concerned with the costs of transcribing deposit copies for new compositions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20407\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408. Finally, Skidmore raises the question of whether a copyright claim would be provable if a deposit copy were lost or destroyed. These policy arguments do not undermine the statutory framework that leads us to conclude that the deposit copy defines the scope of a copyrighted work for unpublished musical works under the 1909 Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Skidmore argues that the district court erred by failing to allow recordings of \"Taurus\" to be played to prove access. This was an evidentiary ruling, which we review for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hinkson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480127\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/1247/#p1267\">\n    585 F.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1267 (9th Cir. 2009). Although Skidmore's counsel was permitted to play recordings for Page outside the presence of the jury, who was then questioned about them in front of the jury, Skidmore argues that the jury could not assess Page's credibility without observing him listening to the recordings and then answering questions about the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As the jury ultimately found that both Plant and Page had access to \"Taurus,\" any error in precluding the recordings was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175984\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/235/1173/#p1178\">\n    235 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178-79 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that an evidentiary ruling is reversed only if the error \"more likely than not affected the verdict\"). As this issue will likely arise again at retrial, we address whether the district court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The district court excluded the sound recordings under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, finding that \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, [or] misleading the jury ....\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. Here, the district court abused its discretion in finding that it would be unduly prejudicial for the jury to listen to the sound recordings in order to assess Page's access to \"Taurus.\" The district court acknowledged that the recordings were relevant to whether Page had access to \"Taurus,\" as Page would have heard and allegedly copied a recording of \"Taurus.\" The district court was concerned, however, that allowing the jury to hear the recordings would confuse them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Skidmore argues that by not allowing the jury to observe Page listening to the recordings of \"Taurus,\" the effect of the court's ruling was to decrease the probative value of Skidmore's questioning of Page. Although the jury could still draw conclusions and inferences from Page's demeanor during his testimony, allowing the jury to observe Page listening to the recordings would have enabled them to evaluate his demeanor while listening to the recordings, as well as when answering questions. Limiting the probative value of observation was not proper here, as the risk of unfair prejudice or jury confusion was relatively small and could have been reduced further with a proper admonition. For example, the district court could have instructed the jury that the recordings were limited to the issue of access and that they were not to be used to judge substantial similarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. W.R. Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951486\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/745/#p765\">\n    504 F.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765 (9th Cir. 2007) (providing that \"the court substantially underestimated the ... potential efficacy of a limiting instruction\"). Given the probative value of the information and the relatively low risk of unfair prejudice, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion\n   in excluding the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Skidmore also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to disqualify Defendants' expert Dr. Ferrara or to give a negative inference instruction to the jury because he previously had been hired by Rondor to compare \"Stairway to Heaven\" to the original recording of \"Taurus.\" District courts have \"broad discretion\" in making evidentiary rulings, including whether to allow expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    Campbell Indus. v. M/V Gemini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376526\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/619/24/#p27\">\n    619 F.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (9th Cir. 1980). We thus review for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to allow expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1376526\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/619/24/#p27\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Skidmore's request for sanctions against Dr. Ferrara and excluded his testimony. Skidmore's motion was rejected as untimely and improperly filed. Even if the motion had been timely filed, the district court did not err in denying the motion because there was no conflict that merited monetary sanctions or exclusion of Dr. Ferrara's testimony. Skidmore argues that Dr. Ferrara effectively switched sides in this case. We have held that when an expert switches sides, the party moving for disqualification must show that the expert in question has confidential information from the first client.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson v. Newmar Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"476\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/298/#p300\">\n    87 F.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (9th Cir. 1996). Here, even if Dr. Ferrara switched sides, there was no showing that Dr. Ferrara had confidential information. Rondor retained Dr. Ferrara to obtain his opinion on two publicly available songs, and he volunteered to share his conclusion with Skidmore. While he did not produce a report from this prior consultation, he did testify that he believed he communicated his opinion telephonically to Rondor rather than in a written report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Additionally, there is no evidence presented that Dr. Ferrara did switch sides. Rondor does not have an interest in this case, nor does Universal Music, and Rondor waived any potential conflict that might arise from having Dr. Ferrara testify as an expert for Defendants. Skidmore contends that Universal Music was working for Hollenbeck, which owed a fiduciary duty to Skidmore as a publisher of Spirit's music. He presents no evidence, however, that Hollenbeck owed a fiduciary duty to Skidmore.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cafferty v. Scotti Bros. Records, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"244331\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/969/193/#p205\">\n    969 F.Supp. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (\"In the absence of special circumstances, no fiduciary relationship exists between a music publisher and composers as a matter of law.\" (citation omitted) ). On remand, in light of the current record, there is no basis for excluding Dr. Ferrara's testimony, giving an adverse jury instruction, or imposing monetary sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants cross-appeal the district court's denial of their motions for attorneys' fees and costs. In light of our disposition, we vacate the district court's denial of attorneys' fees and costs under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the event Defendants' prevail on remand, they may renew their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Given our disposition, we need not address the remaining arguments raised by the parties. To be clear, we do not consider whether the district court abused its discretion in determining which version of \"Taurus\" to play in response to the jury's request during jury deliberations. And, we do not address whether the district court's imposition of time limits violated due process. We note, however, that strict time limits are generally disfavored at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monotype Corp. PLC v. Int'l Typeface Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306505\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/443/#p450\">\n    43 F.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (9th Cir. 1994). Given the complex nature of this case, we are troubled by the strict imposition of time limits and the relative inflexibility of the district court once Skidmore ran out of time. On remand, if the district court again imposes time limits for the retrial it should ensure that each side has adequate time to present its witnesses and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We vacate the amended judgment in part and remand for a new trial against Defendants because of the deficiencies in the jury instructions on originality and the district court's failure to include a selection and arrangement jury instruction. Additionally, although harmless in this instance, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing the sound recordings of \"Taurus\" to be played to prove access. Further, at any retrial, the district court should reconsider whether an inverse ratio jury instruction is warranted. The district court did not err, however, in limiting the copyright of \"Taurus\" to its deposit copy or in allowing Dr. Ferrara to testify. Finally, we vacate the order denying Defendants' motions for attorneys' fees and costs. Given our disposition, there is no need to address the remaining issues raised by Skidmore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED in part and REMANDED for a new trial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Appellant shall recover his costs on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Ownership of the Taurus copyright was one of the disputed issues at trial, but the jury found that Skidmore \"is the owner of a valid copyright in Taurus.\" The Defendants do not challenge that finding on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Skidmore presented evidence that Universal Music was working for Hollenbeck, the publisher of Spirit's music.
