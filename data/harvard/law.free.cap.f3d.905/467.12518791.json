Indeed, Congress also noted that \"the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure\n   <em>\n    equality of opportunity\n   </em>\n   , full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals,\" and it was concerned that \"the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an\n   <em>\n    equal basis\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)-(9) (emphasis added). But we cannot overlook that the statute also expressly provides that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures\n   of any Federal law or law of any State or political subdivision of any State or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012201\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This language is strong evidence that Congress\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   intend to preclude remedies under \u00a7 1983 for constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our conclusion based on the text is confirmed by the ADA's context and history. First, the legislative history sheds light on Congress's intent to leave intact other remedies, procedures, and rights available to disabled individuals under other state and federal laws. The Committee on Education and Labor's Report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   With respect to other laws, section 501(b) of the legislation specifies that nothing in this legislation should be construed to invalidate or limit any other federal law or law of any State or political subdivision of any State or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities that are afforded by this legislation. In other words, all of the rights, remedies and procedures that are available to people with disabilities under other federal laws or other state laws (including state common law) are not preempted by this Act. This approach is consistent with that taken in other civil rights laws. The basic principle underlying this provision is that Congress does not intend to displace any of the rights or remedies available under other federal or state laws (including state common law) which provide greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 101-485 (II) at 135 (1990). And the Committee on the Judiciary similarly stated in its report that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Under Section 501(b) of the ADA, all of the rights, remedies and procedures that are available to people with disabilities under other federal laws, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or other state laws (including state common law) are not preempted by this Act. This approach is consistent with that taken in other civil rights laws. The basic principle underlying this provision is that Congress does not intend to displace any of the rights or remedies provided by other federal or [sic] laws or other state laws (including state common law) which provide greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 101-485 (III) at 70 (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the ADA's relation to Title VII also suggests that Congress did not intend to preclude alternative remedies for disability discrimination. The ADA uses the procedures set forth in Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5, 12117. Indeed, the legislative history of the ADA shows that the protections for disabled persons were intended to be the same as those for other kinds of discrimination. For instance, one representative explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The employment protections use the same enforcement procedures and provide the same remedies as title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Under the ADA, persons with disabilities will have the same rights and remedies as minorities and women, no more and no less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   136 Cong. Rec.

We begin by noting that only \"[i]n those cases in which [a] \u00a7 1983 claim is based on a statutory right\" did the Supreme Court state that \"evidence of ... congressional intent [to preclude alternative remedies] may be found directly in the statute creating the right, or inferred from the statute's creation of a comprehensive enforcement scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/#p248\">\n    555 U.S. at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/#p248\">\n    129 S.Ct. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a statute's remedial scheme should be of only minimal relevance to deciding whether Congress, by enacting that statute, intended to preclude remedies for parallel constitutional violations.

And we conclude that the protections available under the ADA and the Fourteenth Amendment vary in material respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, the rights created by the ADA are strikingly different from those already protected by the Equal Protection Clause. The stated purpose of the ADA is \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities,\" \"to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,\" and \"to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(3). In these statements, Congress is pronouncing protections that were not already firmly established, which suggests that Congress was not simply codifying constitutional rights established in prior cases. Furthermore, in addition to invoking its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress also invoked its broad power under the Commerce Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12101(b)(4) (\"[T]o invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, the protections available under the ADA and the constitutional claim that Bullington alleges vary in material respects. Bullington must make a very different showing to prove her Fourteenth Amendment claim than she would have to make to pursue an ADA claim, and these claims require entirely different substantive analyses. To prove an ADA claim, Bullington would have to show (1) that she was in a class of persons protected by the ADA; (2) that she was otherwise qualified for the position, with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) that she suffered an adverse employment action; (4) that the employer knew or had reason to know of the her disability; and (5) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitfield v.

Given the different requirements for proving a claim under the ADA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   and the Equal Protection Clause, it makes sense that even if the comprehensive remedial scheme of the ADA precludes utilizing \u00a7 1983 to assert an ADA violation, a claimant would still be able to assert a violation of the Equal Protection Clause based on alleged disability discrimination through \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, the rights created by the ADA vary significantly from those provided by the Equal Protection Clause. And the elements required to prove her Equal Protection claim differ significantly from the standard of proof under the ADA, evidencing a lack of Congressional intent that the ADA precludes separate enforcement of disabled individuals' constitutional rights. Because of the divergence between the rights and protections created by the ADA and by the Equal Protection Clause, we cannot conclude that Congress intended for the ADA to be the exclusive mechanism for addressing disability discrimination, \"or a substitute for \u00a7 1983 suits as a means of enforcing constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/#p248\">\n    555 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679105\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/246/#p248\">\n    129 S.Ct. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, the Supreme Court has directed us not to \"lightly conclude that Congress intended to preclude reliance on \u00a7 1983 as a remedy for a substantial equal protection claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341405\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/992/#p1012\">\n    468 U.S. at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11341405\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/992/#p1012\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is reason enough to hold that such a claim is not precluded. The implication of the majority's foray into legislative history is that, if one of the committees in their reports, or Representative Edwards in his floor statement, had expressed some intention to the contrary, we would honor that intention and hold the constitutional claim precluded. But of course we would not do that: nothing in those reports or in Representative Edwards's floor statement is law, and thus nothing in those materials can support a holding contrary to what the statute itself supports.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const.
