BUSH, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Police officers obtained a warrant, searched defendants' home, and found over 2,000 grams of heroin, marijuana, drug-distribution paraphernalia, and a large amount of cash. Despite the search's having been conducted under a judge-issued warrant, the district court suppressed the evidence, holding that because the warrant application so failed to connect defendants' home with drug-trafficking activity, no reasonable officer could have relied on the warrant. The government appeals and argues that the police officers acted in good-faith reliance on the warrant, and so the evidence should be admissible against defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree with the government. The police officers' warrant application established enough of a basis to believe that at least one of the defendants was engaged in a continual, ongoing drug-trafficking operation and that therefore drug-related contraband was likely to be found in his home. Thus, we reverse the district court's order suppressing the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In fall 2016, officers of the Cincinnati Police Department began investigating a drug-trafficking lead. The lead came from a confidential informant's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   tip that defendants Erik McCoy and Derrick Heard (and their associate, Vincent Brown) were selling marijuana from two adjacent stores on Glenway Avenue. The informant reported that McCoy and Heard lived together in a home located at 10515 Hadley Road and that McCoy and Brown worked at the Glenway Avenue stores. The informant relayed having seen McCoy, Heard, and Brown in possession of marijuana and having observed marijuana and guns inside the 10515 Hadley Road home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the informant's information, Officer Longworth began surveilling the Glenway Avenue stores. Over several days, he watched McCoy, Heard, and Brown come and go. He noted a \"large amount of foot traffic [that he considered] consistent with drug trafficking.\" R.34-2, Affidavit for Search Warrant, Page ID# 135. And he discovered that McCoy and Brown had drug-trafficking criminal histories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 14, 2016, Officer Longworth's surveillance proved worthwhile. He was watching the stores when he saw Heard park illegally at a bus stop. As Heard and Brown exited the car, Officer Longworth's fellow officers arrested Brown for suspicion of his having been\n   involved in a robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Brown was being arrested, Officer Longworth entered the apparel store to question Heard about his parking violation. The officer spotted Heard walking out of an employee-only area of the store with a large bag of marijuana hanging from his pants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This bag, along with another (for a total of about two to three ounces of marijuana) and several hundred dollars were found on Heard upon his arrest. After arresting Heard, Officer Longworth confirmed that he had a drug-trafficking criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on Officer Longworth's investigation, the circumstances of Heard's arrest, and the information provided by the confidential informant, Officer Longworth obtained a search warrant for the Glenway Avenue stores (the \"Glenway Avenue Warrant\"). The search uncovered drug-distribution paraphernalia, gun accessories, and mail addressed to McCoy. Aside from finding the tools of the trade, however, law enforcement found no narcotics in the stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Longworth then applied for a second warrant, this time for permission to search the house that the informant identified as defendants', 10515 Hadley Road (the \"Hadley Road Warrant\"). The affidavit in support of the Hadley Road Warrant described Officer Longworth's qualifications, the place to be searched (the home), the evidence sought (evidence of drug trafficking), and the following factual support:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The confidential informant claimed to be \"familiar with\" the Glenway Avenue stores and to have had \"personal relationships\" with people associated with them. R.34-2, Page ID# 134-35. The informant reported that Heard, McCoy, and Brown sold marijuana from the stores. The informant also stated that McCoy and Brown worked at the stores. And the informant reported having seen Heard, McCoy, and Brown in possession of marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Officer Longworth surveilled the Glenway Avenue stores several times and watched McCoy, Heard, and Brown enter and exit the stores. He also observed heavy foot traffic that he considered consistent with drug trafficking. On the day of the warrant application, Officer Longworth observed Heard park in front of the Glenway Avenue stores. Officer Longworth followed Heard into the store and eventually arrested him after spotting him exiting an employees-only section of the store in possession of one large bag of marijuana. When Officer Longworth searched Heard, he found another bag of marijuana and several hundred dollars in cash. McCoy also was present in the store during Heard's arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Law enforcement searched the Glenway Avenue stores and recovered evidence of drug trafficking-electronic scales, drug packaging materials, a handgun box, handgun ammunition, a handgun magazine, and mail addressed to McCoy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The same confidential informant informed Officer Longworth that McCoy and Heard lived together at 10515 Hadley Road, and the informant reported having seen marijuana,\n   large amounts of money, and handguns inside the home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 On the day of the warrant application, law enforcement surveilled 10515 Hadley Road and observed a car parked in the driveway registered to Heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Officer Longworth confirmed that Heard and McCoy had drug-trafficking criminal histories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The same magistrate judge who signed the Glenway Avenue Warrant executed the Hadley Road Warrant. The search of the residence uncovered about 2,200 grams of heroin, marijuana, an electronic scale, drug-packaging accessories, about $38,000 in cash, a handgun, and ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Heard and McCoy were indicted on counts of conspiracy to distribute heroin and marijuana, operating a drug-involved premises, and possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. Defendants each moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the stores and the home. The district court upheld the warrant to search the stores as supported by probable cause. But the Hadley Road Warrant did not fare as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court determined that the affidavit in support of the Hadley Road Warrant failed to establish any connection between the alleged criminal activity and the home. The court then refused to apply the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), concluding that the lack of a nexus rendered the affidavit \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\" R.45, Order, Page ID# 445-53. The court suppressed all evidence found at 10515 Hadley Road. And the government appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The issue before us is whether the district court erred in suppressing evidence discovered during the search of 10515 Hadley Road. We apply a mixed standard of review. We defer to the district court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, but we review de novo its legal conclusions, including its decision about whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies.\n   <em>\n    United States v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264898\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/490/#p495\">\n    874 F.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (6th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fourth Amendment provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. This constitutional protection requires a government agent to support an application for a search warrant with a substantial basis linking the evidence to be seized and the place to be searched.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carpenter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164139\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/591/#p594\">\n    360 F.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (6th Cir. 2004) (en banc). When a government agent fails to support his application with this showing of probable cause, a judge should refuse to issue the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But judges sometimes make mistakes. When this happens, law enforcement may obtain a warrant that it shouldn't have obtained and search a place that it shouldn't have searched. The exclusionary rule usually prevents the government from using illegally obtained evidence in a criminal proceeding against the victim of the unlawful search and seizure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Krull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131469\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/340/#p347\">\n    480 U.S. 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131469\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/340/#p347\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131469\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/340/#p347\">\n    94 L.Ed.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). A magistrate judge's error in issuing a search warrant, however, does not always require suppression of reliable evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. McPhearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755519\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/469/518/#p526\">\n    469 F.3d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (6th Cir. 2006). In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court created an exception\n   to the exclusionary rule.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    468 U.S. at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that when an officer relies on a search warrant later invalidated, evidence obtained from the warrant-authorized search is admissible unless reasonable officers would not have believed the warrant constitutionally permissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court explained, the judge issuing a warrant-not the officer applying for one-has responsibility for determining whether probable cause exists, and the rule excluding unlawfully obtained evidence has little deterrent effect when applied to objectively reasonable law enforcement activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    at 919-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/#p923\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the Glenway Avenue stores were not where the drugs were created (as was the methamphetamine lab in\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   ), there\n   was evidence that those businesses were involved in drug distribution. An informant reported that Heard trafficked marijuana from the Glenway Avenue stores. The police arrested Heard at the Glenway Avenue stores shortly after he \"walk[ed] out of a rear employee area\" with two bags of marijuana on him. The police's search of the stores turned up hallmarks of drug trafficking: electronic scales, drug-packaging materials, and gun accessories. And based on the search of the stores, the police then applied for a warrant to search Heard's home. The affidavit in support of that search, like the affidavit that supported the search of Kenny's home, relayed the circumstances of the defendant's arrest, the fruitful results of an earlier search, and the informant's information identifying the defendant as a participant in the ongoing drug-related operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Given the result in\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   , we cannot fault law enforcement for relying on a similar affidavit.

And in both cases, officers relayed those facts in an affidavit in support of a warrant to search the arrested defendant's home. If the inference that a drug dealer keeps evidence of wrongdoing in his residence sufficed to sustain the magistrate's probable-cause finding in\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   , then the analogous facts here are enough to satisfy the \"less demanding\" good-faith standard.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264898\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/490/#p495\">\n    874 F.3d at 501-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying good-faith exception when a case with similar facts had upheld a probable-cause finding because \"no reasonable officer could have suspected that the affidavit in this case ... was beyond the constitutional pale\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The parties' disagreement about the classification of the informant-anonymous tipster or known confidential informant-does not affect our reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   .

The affidavit explained that just before his arrest, Heard was spotted walking out of an employee-only area of the store, the same store where officers later discovered hallmarks of drug trafficking: electronic scales, drug packaging\n   materials, and gun accessories. And finally, Officer Longworth learned that Heard had a drug-trafficking criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264898\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/490/#p495\">\n    874 F.3d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[Detective] discovered that defendant had 'numerous' drug convictions, lending further credence to the informant's tip that defendant's narcotics activity was ongoing and that the controlled buy was not an aberration.\").

Unsurprisingly, the items in the store did not contain any identifying marks linking them to defendants. And we acknowledge that the connection between the drug-distribution paraphernalia and defendants is more attenuated than the connection between the methamphetamine lab and the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862354\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/458/\">\n    505 F.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant and his son \"were the only individuals in the [barn] at the time and appeared to be in charge of the functioning of the lab\").

In fact, because the affidavit \"noted both that the marijuana was growing 'near' the residence and that 'there is a road connecting' the residence and the marijuana plants,\" we could not say that it was \"completely devoid of any nexus between the residence and the marijuana that the police observed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164139\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/591/#p594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164139\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/591/#p594\">\n    at 595-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A similar analysis applies here. Given the circumstances of Heard's arrest, a reasonably well-trained officer could infer a connection between Heard's marijuana possession and the drug-distribution paraphernalia that officers found in the store. The affidavit provided that Heard (who had a criminal drug-trafficking record) drove to the Glenway Avenue stores with Brown (an associate who had recently been indicted for felony possession of marijuana and an employee with access to the non-public portions of the stores). Officer Longworth observed Heard arrive at the apparel store, and when he next saw Heard walking out of a rear employee area of the apparel store, Heard had two bags of marijuana on him, one visible. And officers later searched the store and recovered electronic scales, drug packaging materials, and gun accessories. Considering all this, the inference that Heard was connected to the drug-trafficking paraphernalia is reasonable. This is especially so given\n   the informant's tip that Heard was dealing marijuana from the Glenway Avenue stores and that he lived with McCoy (another employee with access to the employee-only areas of the store). And based on the connection between Heard and the drug-trafficking paraphernalia, law enforcement's belief that the affidavit provided probable cause to search Heard's home was not unreasonable given the inference we applied in\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   -that when a drug dealer is engaging in continual and ongoing operations, drug contraband is likely to be found in the drug dealer's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, the Hadley Road affidavit was not so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, we REVERSE the district court's order to the extent that it granted defendants' motion to suppress evidence obtained in the Hadley Road search and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The record is ambiguous on whether the informant was anonymous.

But we see no reason why Heard's presence at a drug-distribution, as opposed to a drug-manufacturing, facility should not also support a reasonable inference of Heard's participation in continual and ongoing illegal drug operations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
