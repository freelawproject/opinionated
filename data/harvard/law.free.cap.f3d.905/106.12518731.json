(\"Hertz\" or \"the Company\") and several of its current and former executives for violating \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. The Funds appeal the District Court's dismissal of their fourth amended complaint (\"FAC\") for failure to plead a strong inference of scienter, as required by the PSLRA. We will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Allegations in the FAC\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Funds allege that Hertz, through its former Chief Executive Officer Mark Frissora, former Chief Financial Officer Elyse Douglas, and former Senior Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Jatindar Kapur (collectively, the\n   \"Individual Defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   violated the securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements concerning the Company's financial results, internal controls, and future earnings projections. The Funds' securities fraud allegations rely on a financial restatement Hertz issued with its fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K (\"the Restatement\"). In it the Company admitted that \"an inconsistent and sometimes inappropriate tone at the top was present under the then existing senior management\" and that the tone \"resulted in an environment which in some instances may have led to inappropriate accounting decisions and the failure to disclose information critical to ... effective review[.]\" (App. at 609.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Restatement corrected material errors to Hertz's 2011, 2012, and 2013 financial statements that, cumulatively, \"[overstated] its pre-tax income ... by $215 million and its net income ... by $132 million.\" (App. at 467.) Those errors stemmed from misstatements relating to fifteen distinct accounting categories, causing Hertz to make twenty separate accounting adjustments to its previous financial statements. Those accounting errors were, in turn, a result of \"four categories of material weaknesses in [Hertz's] internal control over financial reporting\": control environment, risk assessment, information and communication, and monitoring. (App. at 609.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the Individual Defendants were overseeing Hertz's accounting department, which was having to deal with the \"inappropriate tone\" they set, the Company continued to report \"record\" financial results and publish optimistic anticipated future earnings. That information was disseminated through press releases; public statements made by Frissora and Douglas to analysts and investors during phone calls and industry conferences; and SEC filings. Moreover, Hertz's SEC filings included Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\") certifications signed by Company executives - including the Individual Defendants - attesting to the accuracy of the information contained in the relevant filings and to the sufficiency of the Company's internal accounting controls. Throughout much of 2013 and early 2014, the defendants relied on Hertz's financial results from fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to tout the Company's healthy financial position and to project a rosy financial outlook for the future. As the Restatement made clear, however, those financial results were materially inaccurate; Hertz's projections of future earnings were misguided; and the Company's internal controls throughout the relevant period were deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The accounting problems permeating Hertz's accounting department began incrementally coming to public attention in late 2013, culminating in the Restatement issued on July 16, 2015. Hertz began revealing its problems in September 2013, when it walked back its projected earnings for fiscal year 2013. That announcement came just days after Hertz abruptly announced Douglas's resignation for \"personal reasons[.]\" (App. at 516.) Next, in March 2014, Hertz disclosed through an SEC filing that it would have to delay filing its fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K because \"it [had] identified certain adjustments relating to prior periods which ... require[d] the Company to revise certain of its previously issued financial statements.\" (App. at 550.) Nonetheless, later that same month, the defendants continued to tout Hertz's \"record results\" and to publish optimistic\n   anticipations of future earnings. As Hertz continued to emphasize its \"record results,\" it also began to disclose that it had identified tens of millions of dollars in accounting errors relating to its 2011 and 2012 financial statements. In March 2014, however, Hertz still publicly classified those errors as non-material misstatements. About one month after revealing those errors, Hertz announced Kapur's resignation for \"personal reasons.\" (App. at 517.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By June 2014, Hertz had again delayed required SEC filings, publicly announced that the Company would have to restate its financial statements for 2011, and disclosed that it would also need to correct errors in its 2012 and 2013 financial statements that could potentially result in the need to issue restatements for those years as well. Hertz also initiated two internal investigations that month, one to review the Company's \"financial records for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013,\" and the other to assess the internal controls the Company had in place during prior financial reporting periods. (App. at 608.) Hertz announced Frissora's resignation for \"personal reasons\" several months later, in September 2014. (App. at 518.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hertz slowly revealed the findings of its internal investigations to the public between August 2014 and July 2015 through periodic SEC filings. Those filings discussed Hertz's withdrawal of its previously announced projections for future earnings and disclosed that the cumulative effect of the identified accounting errors was material, requiring full restatements for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013. Each subsequent SEC filing revised upward the magnitude of the accounting errors on Hertz's prior financial statements. Based on Hertz's financial disclosures, the Funds allege that Hertz had overstated its net income and pre-tax income by, respectively, $28.7 million (17.19%) and $69.3 million (27.18%) in 2011; $59.1 million (32.12%) and $85.6 million (23.45%) in 2012; and $44.2 million (14.64%) and $60.1 million (9.97%) in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the allegations of financial reporting fraud, the Funds also allege that during the relevant class period - February 14, 2013, to July 16, 2015 - Douglas and Kapur sold large amounts of their Hertz stock holdings, that those trades were out of line with those individuals' prior trading practices, and that those trades resulted in Douglas and Kapur profiting in an amount in excess of their respective annual salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Funds filed the FAC in March 2016, approximately seven-and-a-half months after Hertz issued the Restatement and over twenty-seven months after they first initiated this lawsuit. The FAC contains numerous allegations based primarily on the admissions contained in the Restatement, which the District Court reviewed carefully. In the end, however, the Court concluded that the FAC failed to adequately plead a strong inference of scienter. The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Even giving [the Funds] every reasonable inference, their allegations amount to the following: Hertz discovered serious accounting problems, traced those problems back to a corporate mismanagement (and possibly even negligent conduct), publicly disclosed those problems, and updated the public every time it realized the problem was worse than previously disclosed. The FAC carefully explains how the accounting problems were caused by the Individual Defendants, but it never provides a cogent and compelling explanation how those defendants were aware that they caused those\n   problems before Hertz discovered them. For those reasons, their claims fail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (App. at 54.) That conclusion led to the dismissal of the FAC, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The District Court Applied\n    <em>\n     Tellabs\n    </em>\n    Appropriately.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Funds argue that the District Court erred when it concluded that the FAC's allegations did not give rise to a strong inference of scienter. They contend that the Court failed to adhere to the interpretive framework for assessing scienter set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd\n   </em>\n   , and that, when analyzed appropriately, the FAC's allegations give an inference of scienter that is \"at least as compelling as any opposing inference[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More particularly, the Funds argue that the Court deviated from the\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   framework in three material ways: by failing to draw inferences favorable to them, by requiring \"smoking-gun\" evidence to adequately plead scienter, and by failing to consider the FAC's allegations holistically. Those contentions do not persuade us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the District Court did not stray from the\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   framework by failing to make inferences only in the Funds' favor. Rather, it adhered to\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   's explicit instruction to conduct a comparative\n   analysis by considering both inferences favorable to the Funds as well as \"plausible, nonculpable explanations for the defendant's conduct[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That the District Court disagreed with the Funds' preferred inferences is not a violation of the\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the Court did not effectively require the Funds to submit \"smoking-gun\" evidence to survive the defendants' motions to dismiss. It simply emphasized that the FAC lacked allegations connecting the fact that Hertz had \"accounting problems ... caused by the Individual Defendants\" with an inference that \"those defendants were aware that they caused those problems[.]\" (App. at 54.) In other words, the Court only required the Funds to plead factual allegations supporting a cogent inference that the Individual Defendants knowingly made material misstatements, or that they made material misstatements with reckless disregard for the truth of those statements. That the Funds could not plead such allegations does not mean that the District Court effectively required them to submit \"smoking-gun\" evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the District Court conducted the holistic review of the FAC that\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   requires. Although the Court assessed each category of the Funds' scienter allegations independently, it concluded its analysis in a separately headed sub-section - \"Failure to Plead a Strong Inference of Scienter\" - that stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, [the Funds] have failed to plead a strong inference [of scienter.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The strongest inference of scienter comes from the Restatement. However, the Restatement is not enough by itself, so Plaintiffs had to tip the inferential scale with the four other categories of allegations. But, as explained, those categories do not strengthen the inference of knowledge or recklessness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (App. at 54.) We have explicitly approved of scienter analyses that assess individual categories of scienter allegations individually when it is clear, as it is here, that a district court ultimately considered the allegations as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OFI Asset Mgmt. v.

In fact, we have adopted that interpretive approach ourselves when conducting a scienter analysis pursuant to the PSLRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avaya, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238849\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/242/#p252\">\n    564 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although we have discussed each of the alleged facts bearing on defendants' scienter one at a time, we have heeded\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   's command to evaluate [the plaintiffs'] allegations collectively rather than individually.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The FAC Does Not Plead a Strong Inference of Scienter.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Funds argue that the Restatement's admission that Frissora and other Hertz senior management maintained an \"inappropriate tone at the top,\" when viewed in conjunction with the FAC's scienter allegations, provides an inference of scienter that is \"at least as compelling as any opposing [nonculpable] inference[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p324\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To make that argument, the Funds depend - as they did in the District Court - on five categories of scienter allegations: (1) the size and scope of the Restatement, (2) Hertz's admission of material weaknesses in its internal controls, (3) signed SOX certifications accompanying materially false SEC filings, (4) Hertz's replacement of upper management, and (5) insider trading activity by Douglas and Kapur. Like the District Court, we will assess each\n   category of allegations individually before analyzing the FAC's allegations as a whole. We ultimately agree with the District Court that the FAC's allegations do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Size and Scope of the Restatement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The size and scope of a company's restatement of prior financial statements is one factor that courts consider when conducting a scienter analysis.\n   <em>\n    PR Diamonds, Inc. v.

As the District Court observed, the FAC fails to sufficiently allege either that the Individual Defendants knowingly caused Hertz's accounting personnel to engage in accounting fraud or that the accounting improprieties were so obvious that the Individual Defendants must have known about them when reporting Hertz's financial results to the public. The Court logically concluded that, although the Restatement was substantial, any inference of scienter was \"circumscribed by\" the fact that the accounting errors were spread across myriad accounting categories.

The Restatement revealed that Hertz's financial statements from 2011 to 2013 cumulatively overstated its net income by $132 million (20.23%) and its pre-tax income by $215 million (17.58%). When broken down by year, the Restatement shows that Hertz overstated those income categories by between 9.97% and 32.12%.

Hertz's Admission of Material\n   <em>\n    Weaknesses in Its Internal Controls\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Funds argue that the District Court erred by interpreting the Restatement's admission of an \"inappropriate tone at the top\" to be an admission of \"mismanagement,\" as opposed to an admission of \"misconduct.\" (Opening Br. at 28.) We agree with the District Court that the Restatement's admissions are more plausibly interpreted as admissions of mismanagement, not of affirmative misconduct on the part of the Individual Defendants. We reach that conclusion for two reasons. First, the Restatement itself explicitly links the phrase \"inappropriate tone at the top\" to Frissora's management style. For example, after first introducing that phrase, the Restatement continues, \"[i]n particular, [Frissora's] management style and temperament created a pressurized operating environment at the Company, where challenging targets were set and achieving those targets was a key performance expectation.\" (App. at 609.) Second, the more plausible inference from the Restatement's use of the word \"tone\" is that the Restatement is referring to management style and not to misconduct. The word \"tone,\" after all, means a \"style or manner of expression in speaking or writing[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Tone\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 2002).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At most, then, the FAC has pleaded that the Individual Defendants presided over a poorly managed corporation and that the mismanagement created an environment in which improper accounting practices flourished.

Hertz freely acknowledged\n   that it replaced executive- and management-level employees as a remedial measure to \"change[ ] and enhance[ ] leadership in the business units associated with the restatement matters.\" (App. at 611.)

First, the FAC alleges that both Douglas's and Kapur's insider trading activities were unusual when compared to their trading history. For example, Douglas sold Hertz stock on four occasions during the class period but had not sold any Hertz stock in the three years prior to those trades. Similarly, Kapur sold Hertz stock on five occasions during the class period but had only traded in Hertz stock one other time in the three preceding years. Those allegations support an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996980\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/256/#p277\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996980\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/256/#p277\">\n    at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the FAC alleges that Douglas earned a net profit of approximately $4 million on her insider trades, which exceeded her 2013 salary of $3 million. Although the FAC does not identify Kapur's salary, it alleges that the approximately $3.1 million in profit he earned from his trading activities likely exceeded his annual compensation, given that he was Douglas's subordinate.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996980\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/256/#p277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (inferring scienter when profits from trading activities \"nearly doubled in one day the total amount of money\" a defendant had earned \"over the previous three years combined\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

First, the timing of the insider trades is not particularly suspicious. Douglas and Kapur sold their shares when Hertz stock was trading between $21.23 and $28.00, with the vast majority of sales occurring at a price at or below $26.14. The overall class period high, in contrast, was $31.56 on August 19, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greebel v.

Here, as described above, the considerations weighing against inferring scienter limit the strength of the scienter inference that can be made from the percentage of pre-class holdings sold by Douglas and Kapur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The FAC's insider-trading allegations thus add only minimal weight to the inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Holistic Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Funds urge us to conclude that a holistic review of the FAC's allegations leads only to one plausible string of inferences - that the Individual Defendants recklessly disregarded that their \"tone\" would lead lower-level employees to engage in inappropriate accounting to placate their demands, then recklessly disregarded that those irregularities would lead to overstated and inaccurate financial statements, and, consequently, recklessly disclosed materially false information through SEC filings, press releases, and public announcements. The problem the Funds face is that the inferences they propose are simply not as compelling as the opposing one drawn by the District Court: that corporate mismanagement resulted in accounting irregularities and, at most, negligent misstatements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The FAC and Restatement make clear that the problems plaguing Hertz and its accounting department were significant, that Frissora and other members of senior management created a pressurized environment that contributed to those problems, and that those problems resulted in material misstatements regarding the Company's financial condition. But the allegations that the Individual Defendants resigned as Hertz discovered those problems, and that Douglas and Kapur sold portions of their Hertz stock holdings while those problems were ongoing, do not necessarily suggest that Hertz or its senior management were engaged in a systemic fraud. More plausible is the suggestion that the Individual Defendants were just bad leaders. The FAC's allegations do not give rise to a cogent inference that the Individual Defendants were aware that their actions were improper, that they consciously disregarded that their \"tone\" was causing employees to engage in erroneous accounting, or that Hertz's accounting errors were so obvious that only an attitude of reckless disregard on the part of the Individual Defendants can explain what they said and did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
