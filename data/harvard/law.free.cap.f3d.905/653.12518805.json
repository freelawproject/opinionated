The court then adjusted the base level (for reasons not relevant here), concluding that Lawrence's adjusted offense level was 19. With a level III criminal history category, the guidelines sentencing range was 37-46 months of imprisonment, and the district court sentenced Lawrence to 46 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Robbery I conviction underlying the \"crime of violence\" finding arose from a multi-count information charging, based on a single incident, \"robbery in the first degree with a firearm\" (\"used and threatened the use of a firearm\") and acting with a codefendant to commit \"robbery in the first degree\" (\"armed with a deadly weapon, to wit: a handgun\"). For sentencing, the court merged the two convictions to robbery in the first degree with a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As such, the government argues Oregon law is clear that Robbery I is divisible because the jury must be unanimous in finding that the defendant committed a specific aggravating element of the statute (or more than one). The government reinforces its argument with Oregon's Uniform Criminal Jury Instructions for robbery, noting that while the instructions contain an intent element (element 4) that is formulated in the disjunctive (intent of preventing/overcoming resistance\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   compelling to deliver), the aggravating element (element 5), contains no such disjunctive. From this, the government concludes that a jury must find the chosen aggravating element unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus Robbery I is divisible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In our view,\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   leaves ambiguous the question of whether the robbery statute is divisible or indivisible.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   first refers to the enhancing conditions of Robbery II as separate \"elements\" but later determines that the two elevating conditions constitute \"a single crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667702\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/346/275/\">\n    211 P.3d at 254, 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boots\n   </em>\n   , and Oregon's Uniform Criminal Jury Instructions for robbery seemingly stand in conflict when considering whether Robbery I and Robbery II are divisible.
