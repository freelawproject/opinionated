The district court ruled plaintiff did not adequately plead a breach-of-fiduciary-duty cause of action. We agree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Arthur Vest worked nearly forty years for Resolute. During his employment, Resolute offered group life insurance benefits (\"the Plan\") to its employees in the form of base and optional life insurance coverage; Resolute provided coverage equal to an employee's annual salary and permitted employees to purchase additional optional coverage. Arthur purchased an additional $300,000 of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Due to complications arising from diabetes, Arthur ceased working in September 2015, and began drawing short- and then long-term disability benefits. Under the Plan, employees maintained base life insurance coverage when receiving long-term disability benefits, but lost optional coverage. However, employees had \"the right to port or convert\" the expiring additional group coverage to individual coverage within 31 days of ending active employment. Accordingly, Resolute ended Arthur's optional coverage on May 18, 2016. Resolute did not, however, provide him \"with any information concerning his right to port or convert the coverage that ended.\" He died in October 2016, and Resolute's life insurance carrier paid Vest's beneficiary, plaintiff here, only the base coverage amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mead Vest commenced this one-count ERISA action thereafter. She alleges Resolute breached its fiduciary duty by failing to inform Arthur of his right to port or convert the optional life insurance coverage and requests \"appropriate equitable relief\" under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).

Our subsequent case law applying\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   continues to require this question-and-response pattern.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gregg. v. Trans.

After all, the argument goes, Resolute should have known conversion rights were important to Arthur Vest because he purchased extra life insurance during his employment and had to go on long-term disability leave due to his diabetes, which \"mad[e] it more likely that he might, in fact, die.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's allegation that Resolute was required to disclose life insurance conversion information falls outside all three of\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   's conditions for fiduciary liability. Her claim plainly does not fall within\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   condition three (not receiving future forecasts required by ERISA or its implementing regulations). Nor does it satisfy, like the claim in\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   condition one-receiving a misleading or inaccurate answer in response to a question. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   dealt with an affirmative request for information, which was met with an affirmative omission. Here, plaintiff does not contend her breach of\n   fiduciary duty claim rests on a request to Resolute. In the district court's words, plaintiff's complaint lacks specific allegations concerning communications between the Vests and Resolute to show the Vests \"requested information regarding [Arthur's] benefits until after his death or that they communicated an interest in maintaining certain benefits prior to his death,\" or that Resolute \"knew of specific facts related to his health condition ... or that he would never return to work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That leaves us with the plan provider's own-initiative condition (\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   condition two) but the complaint fails to allege either a misrepresentation or inaccurate statement by Resolute regarding Arthur Vest's conversion rights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11388607\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/439/#p450\">\n    305 F.3d at 453-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After almost four decades of work at Resolute, Arthur Vest left employment due to disability in September 2015. Without any solicitation from the Vests, Resolute sent the Vests a notice, the May 23, 2016 Employee Benefit Summary Report (Benefits Summary), that contained information about a number of benefits, including the life insurance plan in question. This was not a document required by ERISA. The Benefits Summary omitted material information-namely, it failed to state that Mr. Vest needed to act within 31 days to convert his optional group life insurance policy to an individual life insurance policy. Mr. Vest carried $300,000 in optional life insurance but failed to convert the policy within 31 days. Upon his death, Mrs. Vest received only the basic life insurance benefit of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I conclude that Mrs. Vest has stated a plausible claim for breach of fiduciary duty under\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   's own-initiative condition because Resolute's omission rendered the Report misleading. The majority opinion states that Mrs. Vest's claim for breach of fiduciary duty cannot fall within the own-initiative category because she does not \"allege either a misrepresentation or inaccurate statement by Resolute regarding Arthur Vest's conversion rights.\" (Maj. Op. at 989) That is one way to violate\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   's second condition. But we have also explained that a material omission qualifies as misleading information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krohn v. Huron Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621100\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/542/#p548\">\n    173 F.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (6th Cir. 1999) (\"Furthermore, a fiduciary breaches its duties by materially misleading plan participants, regardless of whether the fiduciary's statements or omissions were made negligently or intentionally.\").\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   's holding that a material omission in response to a question (the first\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   condition) can be misleading is likewise applicable to a material omission in a document the plan provider chooses to send (the second\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   condition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The majority opinion also concludes that\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   's second condition does not apply because there was no requirement for Resolute to provide a conversion notice beyond what was set forth in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). (Maj. Op. at 989) But\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   's own-initiative condition is exactly that-an action of the employer's own initiative, not one required by ERISA. And nothing in\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   or its progeny indicates that the second condition applies only where there is a disclosure requirement. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    James v. Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp.\n   </em>\n   , our circuit's primary case on the own-initiative condition, says otherwise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning back to\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   , although we found that there was no breach of fiduciary duty where GM had issued booklets containing a reservation of rights clause,\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that a reservation of rights provision in a SPD necessarily insulates an employer from its fiduciary duty to provide \"complete and accurate information\" when that employer on its own initiative provides inaccurate and misleading information about the future benefits of a plan. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   explicitly allows for a breach of fiduciary duty claim under such a circumstance. Were it otherwise, an employer or plan administrator could provide, on its own initiative, false or inaccurate information about the future benefits of a plan without breaching its fiduciary duty under ERISA, simply because of the existence of a reservation of rights provision in the plan. However, this would be contrary to the basic concept of a fiduciary duty, which \"entails not only a negative duty not to misinform, but also an affirmative\n   duty to inform when the trustee knows that silence might be harmful.\"\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621100\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/542/#p548\">\n    173 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   548 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mullins v.

Just as the reservation of rights in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   did not control the own-initiative analysis, including a conversion notice in the SPD (which here is not a paragon of clarity) does not relieve Resolute of its duty to provide full and complete information when providing, on its own initiative, the Benefits Summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, the majority concludes that Mrs. Vest did not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   's requirements because her complaint does not include \"factual allegations showing Resolute knew 'that [its] silence might be harmful.' \" (Maj. Op. at 989 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Krohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11621100\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/542/#p548\">\n    173 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   548 ) ). But Resolute sent Mr. Vest a Benefits Summary stating that his additional life insurance coverage was no longer effective without mentioning his conversion rights.
