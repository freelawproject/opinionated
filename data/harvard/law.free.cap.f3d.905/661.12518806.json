They sued their insurance company for breach of contract when it refused to cover the damage. They also sued their cleaning-and-restoration company for failing to adequately remedy the damage and prevent mold. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance company based on the plain language of the Dahlgrens' insurance policy and transferred the claims against\n   the cleaning-and-restoration company to the district court in Delaware for lack of personal jurisdiction. We lack jurisdiction to review the transfer order but affirm the grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2000, the Dahlgrens, who reside in the District of Columbia, purchased a beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where they spend most of their weekends. At all times relevant to this litigation, the house was a second residence and remained fully furnished with the accessories of daily life, such as furniture, clothes, food, toiletries, and medicine. When not at their beach home, the Dahlgrens routinely left the heat on to prevent the pipes from freezing and asked a friend to check on the house and retrieve the mail. They did not, however, shut off the water supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2013, Ms. Dahlgren returned to the beach home to find two inches of standing water throughout the main level and additional water \"gushing\" from the ceiling overhead. The Dahlgrens had been away for ten days, and, in their absence, a pressurized hot water pipe in the upstairs bathroom had separated at the joint and flooded the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Dahlgrens notified their insurance company, Windsor-Mount Joy Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Windsor-Mount\"), about the flooding. They also contracted with R.W. Home Services, Inc., doing business as Gale Force Cleaning and Restoration (\"Gale Force\"), to remedy the damage and prevent mold. According to the Dahlgrens, Gale Force was negligent in its clean-up effort and mold spread through the house, so the Dahlgrens eventually decided to tear it down and build a new one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Dahlgrens timely filed an insurance claim with Windsor-Mount to cover the damage from the accident. The insurance company denied the claim because, while they were away, the Dahlgrens had failed to shut off the water where it entered the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Dahlgrens sued Windsor-Mount for breach of contract and alleged $800,000 in damages. They filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, but Windsor-Mount, a Pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of business in Pennsylvania, invoked federal diversity jurisdiction and removed the case to the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1441(a). Windsor-Mount impleaded Gale Force as a third-party defendant on the theory that if Windsor-Mount was liable to the Dahlgrens, the extent of its liability turned on Gale Force's conduct. The Dahlgrens amended their complaint to add claims against Gale Force as well for breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, 6 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2511 -27. The Dahlgrens and Windsor-Mount then filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and Gale Force moved to be dismissed from the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court determined that the Dahlgrens could not recover under the clear terms of their insurance policy and granted summary judgment against them on that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katopothis v.

The Dahlgrens filed their notice of appeal to this court on October 11, 2016. The Dahlgrens argue that the district court below misconstrued their insurance policy under Delaware law and erroneously transferred the claims against Gale Force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin, as every court must, by addressing the question of jurisdiction. Although it is clear that the district court had diversity jurisdiction over this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), there are questions about ours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Dahlgrens argue that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked personal jurisdiction to adjudicate their claims against Gale Force and transferring them to the district court in Delaware.

In\n   <em>\n    Briscoe\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida transferred Briscoe's criminal cases to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1426. The D.C. court retransferred \"one of the cases back to\" Florida and, after the file was sent to Florida, Briscoe appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1426-27.

So even though Briscoe did not file his appeal until after the court had transferred his file, in light of this \"substantial issue,\" we had jurisdiction to review the transfer order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1426-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We have also, in limited circumstances, informally requested that the transferee\n   court \"return the file\" and resolved the appeal \"after the file came back.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1427. For instance, we requested the return of the case file in\n   <em>\n    Fine v.

Cir. 1970) (per curiam).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Dahlgrens' case is altogether different. They have not raised any \"substantial issue\" concerning the district court's power to order the transfer of their case, which took place four days before they filed a notice of appeal. Nor have they identified any reason why we should ask the Delaware court to return the file. In fact, the Dahlgrens' opening brief barely mentions the transfer issue, and then only in passing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dahlgrens Br. 34 (stating only that the district court's decision to transfer the claims against Gale Force was \"inextricable\" from its decision to grant summary judgment to Windsor-Mount and should be reversed). Nothing in the record suggests that we have jurisdiction to review their appeal of the transfer order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We do have jurisdiction to review the Dahlgrens' appeal of the district court's grant of summary judgment to Windsor-Mount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In general, \"any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties\" is not \"final\" unless the district court certifies, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), that \"there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed.

Nor did the court certify, pursuant to Rule 54(b), that \"there [was] no just reason for delay[ing]\" a final judgment on the Dahlgrens' claims against Windsor-Mount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 54(b) would therefore seem to preclude our review of the Dahlgrens' appeal of the grant to summary judgment. And, indeed, where a court dismisses one claim and transfers the remaining claims to another forum, in the absence of a Rule 54(b) order, the non-transferred claims \"tag[ ] along\" with the transferred claim so that they may be resolved together on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

If their house remained unoccupied \"in excess of 72 hours,\" the Dahlgrens were required to \"[m]aintain heat in the residence and shut off the water supply where it enters the residence,\" or else the plain language of ML-508D excludes coverage for \"loss caused by ... discharge, leakage, or overflow from any plumbing ... system.\" There is no dispute the Dahlgrens were away from their beach home for ten days and failed to shut off the water supply where it entered the house. There is no question that the damage for which they now seek coverage was caused by flooding from the plumbing. It is a plain and simple matter that they cannot recover from Windsor-Mount for their loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nevertheless, the Dahlgrens offer several arguments for why we should disregard the straightforward application of ML-508D and grant them relief. None are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Dahlgrens first argue that the policy extends coverage to real and personal property for damage that results from plumbing accidents. They contend that this coverage cannot be limited by a subsequent endorsement because doing so would create conflicting contract terms or render the policy ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We disagree. By definition, endorsements amend the terms of an insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsement,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (\"An amendment to an insurance policy; a rider.\"). That's their very purpose. A policy is not ambiguous or contradictory just because an endorsement amends its provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Intel Corp. v. Am.

The Dahlgrens' argument neglects this basic proposition of how an insurance policy works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Dahlgrens also assert that the provisions in their policy extending coverage to real and personal property refer only to two sets of exclusions, neither of which include ML-508D. They reason that this means ML-508D does not apply to real or personal property coverage. At the very least, the Dahlgrens contend, it isn't clear that ML-508D applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This argument ignores that ML-508D is titled \"\n   <em>\n    Additional\n   </em>\n   Exclusions for Unoccupied Residences\" (emphasis added) and is listed on the cover page of the policy with other endorsements that amend the terms of the contract. It does not matter that other exclusions also apply to the Dahlgrens' house because ML-508D operates in addition to whatever other exclusions exist. By its terms, ML-508D expressly forecloses recovery for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   loss associated with plumbing accidents, including damage to real and personal property, unless certain requirements are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Next, the Dahlgrens claim their beach home was \"neither vacant nor unoccupied in any conventional sense\" because it remained furnished with the accessories of daily life. Dahlgrens Br. 14. In the alternative, they assert the terms \"vacant\" and \"unoccupied\" in ML-508D are ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Either way, they explain, ML-508D should not apply to their situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The policy, however, leaves no doubt what \"unoccupied\" means. ML-508D explicitly defines \"unoccupied\" as \"an absence in excess of 72 hours.\" We agree with the district court that this \"can only be reasonably read to refer to the absence of people.\"\n   <em>\n    Katopothis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272084\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/211/1/#p13\">\n    211 F.Supp.3d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Windsor-Mount Joy Mut.

There is no dispute the Dahlgrens were away from their beach home for over 72 hours, which under the clear terms of the policy means the flooding occurred while the house was \"unoccupied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Dahlgrens did ask a friend to periodically check on the house and retrieve the mail while they were away, and the parties dispute whether such neighborliness was enough to \"occupy\" the house under the policy. Like the district court, we need not resolve this question because the good neighbor had not been to the house in six days when Ms. Dahlgren discovered the flooding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katopothis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272084\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/211/1/#p13\">\n    211 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   16 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In any event, the Dahlgrens urge us to adopt the approach of the Supreme Court of Delaware and \"look to the reasonable expectations of the insured,\" not just when a policy is ambiguous, but also \"if the policy contains a hidden trap or pitfall, or if the fine print takes away that which has been given by the large print.\"\n   <em>\n    Hallowell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

ML-508D is just such a \"hidden trap\" or \"fine print,\" they argue, and such deception cannot be allowed to frustrate their reasonable expectation of coverage for accidental flooding. \"It is manifestly unfair to the insureds,\" they assert, \"to permit an insurance company to bury a conflicting Endorsement at the end of the policy, which purports [to] render express grants of coverage in the policy illusory.\" Dahlgrens Br. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We see nothing hidden or deceptive about ML-508D. It was written in plain language and listed on the cover page of the insurance policy as an applicable endorsement. And, to further draw attention to its terms, the endorsement was printed on blue paper to stand out from the rest of the policy. Windsor-Mount in no way disguised the endorsement or the conditions it imposed on coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor is there anything surprising about endorsements like ML-508D. They are designed to prevent extensive damage from plumbing accidents that might otherwise be avoided with early detection or simple preventative measures.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Windsor-Mount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203069695\">\n    2009 WL 3069695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 (\"Any reading of the contract results in the conclusion that the purpose of the provision in question is to protect the insurance company from the increased risk that accompanies insuring a house that does not have an occupant.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vushaj v.

An unoccupied house presents a significant\n   risk that leaking water will go unnoticed for some time, dramatically increasing the likelihood of extensive damage to property. What might be only a minor incident in an occupied house could escalate quickly into major damage if left unchecked, which is exactly what happened in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Dahlgrens essentially ask us to \"destroy or twist policy language under the guise of construing it.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457709\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/785/281/#p288\">\n    785 A.2d at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chems.

That we cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the Dahlgrens argue ML-508D is simply \"ineffective\" because it was printed below a notice that Windsor-Mount did not file with the Delaware Insurance Commissioner. Dahlgrens Br. 33-34;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   18 Del. Code \u00a7 2712 (requiring insurers to file insurance forms with the Delaware Insurance Commissioner). The Dahlgrens insist that the presence of unapproved language on the same page, even separate from ML-508D, voids the endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To the extent this argument has any merit, we would still apply ML-508D in this case because the endorsement is \"unambiguous and not contrary to public policy\" so \"there is little basis for invalidating\" it.\n   <em>\n    Hercules, Inc. v.

Indeed, no one disputes that the Delaware Insurance Commissioner approved ML-508D. And, ironically, the notice actually draws attention to the endorsement and the risks of water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   While the Dahlgrens suggest yet other reasons why they should prevail, they forfeited those arguments when they failed to raise them in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zevallos v.

We conclude, therefore, that the Dahlgrens cannot recover from Windsor-Mount under the clear terms of their insurance policy. And because we conclude the Dahlgrens' claim against Windsor-Mount fails under Delaware law, and the Dahlgrens do not appeal the judgment of the district court with regard to District of Columbia law, we do not need to consider the choice-of-law analysis further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USA Waste of Md.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180307\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/954/1027/#p1032\">\n    954 A.2d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The appeal of the transfer order is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
