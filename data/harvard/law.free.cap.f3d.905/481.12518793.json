Rodriguez-Penton, a lawful permanent resident from Cuba, appeals the district court's denial of his motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He argues that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to warn him of the adverse immigration consequences of pleading guilty and that he was prejudiced by this failure. The district court denied his motion, relying on the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/\">\n    474 U.S. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/\">\n    88 L.Ed.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). But the legal landscape for such claims has changed in material ways since\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , especially in the context of non-citizens faced with criminal charges. Because the district court applied the wrong analytical framework, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton, now twenty-nine years old, moved from Cuba to the United States with his parents when he was fifteen. He has lived in Louisville, Kentucky since his arrival and is a permanent resident in possession of a green card. In 2011, the Government indicted Rodriguez-Penton and his parents on a single count of conspiracy to distribute and possess Oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 841(b)(1)(C). The Government dismissed the charges against Rodriguez-Penton's parents approximately six months after indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton was detained pending trial and represented by retained counsel William M. Butler. Rodriguez-Penton cooperated with the Government at first, but eventually stopped, in large part because he feared for his family's safety. The Government offered Rodriguez-Penton at least two separate plea deals in the year after his arrest, including one verbal offer and one written offer for a six-year sentence. Rodriguez-Penton eventually moved for re-arraignment. At the re-arraignment hearing in October 2012, he entered an open guilty plea to the single charge in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton's Cuban citizenship arose at three points during the plea hearing. First, when Rodriguez-Penton mentioned his Cuban citizenship, the district court responded that there was no need to review the civil rights one forfeits by pleading guilty because they did not apply to non-citizens. Second, the district court inquired whether, due to Rodriguez-Penton's citizenship, there would be an early sentencing. The parties answered in the negative. Third, when asking about releasing Rodriguez-Penton from custody pending trial, the district court asked if \"there is any legal reason your client should be released from custody, or is there an [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detainer on him?\" Butler responded \"no,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   although it is not clear whether he was saying no legal reason existed or no detainer existed. At no point during the plea hearing did the district court advise Rodriguez-Penton that pleading guilty might have adverse immigration consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2013, the district court sentenced Rodriguez-Penton to a prison term of 121 months, to be followed by four years of supervised release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sentencing court mentioned that it did not know \"if this conviction would result in deportation\" when discussing the supervised release portion of Rodriguez-Penton's sentence. Rodriguez-Penton alleges that he was unaware of the risk of deportation until after sentencing. He learned of the risk when he had his \"first appointment\" with his prison counselor, who gave him \"a sheet of paper where it said that [he] could possibly be deported.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton filed a direct appeal while still represented by Butler in which he argued that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the district court failed to advise him of the risk of deportation. He also argued that the evidence did not support the drug quantities attributed to him at sentencing. This court rejected both arguments.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rodriguez-Penton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076986\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/547/738/\">\n    547 F. App'x 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton then filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court eventually appointed counsel and a magistrate judge scheduled an evidentiary hearing where Rodriguez-Penton and Butler both testified. Butler estimated that he met with Rodriguez-Penton fifteen times during the year between Rodriguez-Penton's arrest and plea, although Rodriguez-Penton said they met closer to ten times. Because Rodriguez-Penton does not speak English, a Spanish interpreter was present during the majority of these meetings. An interpreter was also present at all relevant hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the testimony and oral argument at the evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The magistrate judge described Butler's performance as follows: \"[H]e merely told Rodriguez-Penton that, based on Butler's own experience, and what several immigration attorneys had told Butler, [Rodriguez-]Penton did not have to worry about deportation because the Government would not return him to Cuba.\" The record confirms that Butler was not alone in reaching this conclusion-the Government also noted that Cuban defendants are rarely subject to deportation. Yet neither Butler nor the Government cited any authority in support of this position. The magistrate judge then noted that \"Butler conceded on cross-examination that he did not recall ever telling Rodriguez-Penton that deportation nonetheless was a possibility.\" This differed\n   from Rodriguez-Penton's testimony that Butler \"never discussed the subject of deportation, nor did they ever discuss the impact of his status as a Cuban national lawfully present in the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rather than reconcile the conflicting testimony, the magistrate judge presumed \"to the benefit of Rodriguez-Penton that attorney Butler's performance was deficient.\" He concluded that Rodriguez-Penton's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed on the prejudice prong because Rodriguez-Penton testified unequivocally that he \"would not have gone to trial, even if he could not have negotiated a better plea arrangement than the open plea of guilty that he previously chose to enter.\" Absent a showing of prejudice, the magistrate judge held, Rodriguez-Penton could not prevail on his \u00a7 2255 petition. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's findings over Rodriguez-Penton's objections, denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, and dismissed the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton filed a timely notice of appeal and moved this court for a Certificate of Appealability (COA). This court granted his request after finding that \"Rodriguez-Penton has arguably made a substantial showing that his attorney's performance was deficient and that he was actually prejudiced by counsel's alleged error.\" More specifically, the COA stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton has arguably shown that, had he been advised that he could be deported, he might have accepted a similar plea offer especially if it contained a non-deportation clause, particularly in light of the prosecutor's acknowledgement that citizens of Cuba are generally not deported following a guilty plea. Therefore, Rodriguez-Penton has made a substantial showing that counsel's error prejudiced him because, even though he insisted on not going to trial, the error may have affected the outcome of the plea process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With this background in mind, we turn to Rodriguez-Penton's arguments on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The de novo review standard also applies to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752207\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/553/#p558\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752207\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/553/#p558\">\n    at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In those cases, as in this one, the right at issue is the right to effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process. Of course, if the Government exercises its discretion not to bargain for a guilty plea, no constitutional question is presented. But when the Government chooses to enter into plea negotiations, the Constitution requires that defendants receive effective assistance in navigating that crucial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959535\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/387/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]hen a State opts to act in a field where its action has significant discretionary elements, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates of the Constitution.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Evitts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959535\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/387/\">\n    469 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959535\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/387/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ). And where counsel's assistance falls short, as here, at\n   issue is whether the defendant can show a reasonable probability that, with proper advice, the outcome of those negotiations would have been different. The purpose of remand is to answer that narrow question in light of the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, contrary to the Government's assertions in its supplemental brief, the lack of an obvious remedy (should Rodriguez-Penton satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   on remand) does not automatically equate to a failure to show prejudice. There is some analytical overlap between the two inquiries-if there were, in fact, no other options at the time of the guilty plea, then Rodriguez-Penton could not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different absent trial counsel's deficient performance. But what options were available to Rodriguez-Penton at the time of the plea is distinct from what options are available to the court in the present day. Rodriguez-Penton has asserted that his decisionmaking process would have been different if he had been properly advised, and the Government has not offered any countervailing evidence that Rodriguez-Penton could not have secured a more favorable plea. Thus, it remains possible that, on remand, he will show a reasonable probability of a different outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Now his client says he wishes he would have negotiated a better deal that took deportation off the table and claims that, but for his counsel's advice, he would have done so.

Rodriguez-Penton claims that he first learned he was deportable when he arrived at prison. So he wanted out of his guilty plea.

Thus, we have no power to provide the remedy Rodriguez-Penton seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rodriguez-Penton's proposed remedy also presents a practical problem. If the court vacates his conviction, the prosecutor may well reject the court's recommendation of clemency and adhere to Department of Justice policy that requires charging Rodriguez-Penton with \"the most serious, readily provable offense\"-likely that to which he already pled guilty in this case. Memorandum from the Office of the Att'y Gen. on Dep't Charging and Sentencing Policy 1 (May 10, 2017). The government could then insist on going to trial, and Rodriguez-Penton, who has already admitted his guilt, would likely lose. Even with credit for time served, Rodriguez-Penton could be sentenced to\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   time than under his initial plea and still\n   face the possibility of deportation. Counsel asserts that Rodriguez-Penton has been made adequately aware of the possible risks here, but there is no reason to expand the Sixth Amendment by judicial fiat and push courts out of their constitutional role, only to watch Rodriguez-Penton lose a game with long odds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nor is the solution to remand to the district court with the hope that more evidence and more briefs will reveal a non-existent answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. 489-90. Since courts have no power to provide the remedy Rodriguez-Penton seeks, remanding to the district court with instructions to sift through unavailable remedies is improper (not to mention unfair to the district court).\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667975\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/1086/#p1109\">\n    571 F.3d at 1108-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rodriguez-Penton claims that he should have received better advice about deportation. But the decision today speaks more broadly than immigration consequences, potentially encompassing any deficient advice that \"infected [a defendant's] decisionmaking process, and thus undermines confidence in the outcome of the plea process.\" Majority Op. 488. After today, any time an attorney fails to inform a defendant about\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   direct consequence of a plea agreement, a defendant may have a right to negotiate again. And so we should expect to see all manner of \u00a7 2255 motions by defendants claiming they got bad advice about their appellate waiver, or drug quantity, or applicable sentencing enhancements, or recommended sentencing range, to name a few.
