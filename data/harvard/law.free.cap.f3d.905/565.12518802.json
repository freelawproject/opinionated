Since we last heard an interlocutory appeal in this case, the district court dismissed Teck's divisibility defense to joint and several liability on summary judgment. At Phase I of the trifurcated bench trial, the court held that Teck was a liable party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"). At Phase II, the court found Teck liable for more than $8.25 million of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation's response costs. The district court then certified this appeal by entering partial judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). We conclude that we have jurisdiction, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Columbia River, the fourth-largest river in North America, begins its 1,200-mile journey to the sea from its headwaters in the Canadian Rockies. The River charts a northwest course in British Columbia before bending south toward Washington. It then widens and forms the Arrow Lakes reservoir until, thirty miles before the international border, it reaches the Hugh Keenleyside Dam. After passing through the dam's outlet, the River is free-flowing until south of the border near Northport, Washington. There it again starts to slow and pool at the uppermost reaches of Lake Roosevelt, the massive reservoir impounded behind the Grand\n   Coulee Dam. This case concerns the more than 150-mile stretch of river between the Canadian border and the Grand Coulee Dam, known as the Upper Columbia River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From time immemorial, the Upper Columbia River has held great significance to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. These tribes historically depended on the River's plentiful fish for their survival and gave the River a central role in their cultural traditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Colville Tribes continue to use the Upper Columbia River to this day for fishing and recreation. Under the applicable treaties, the Tribes retain fishing rights in the River up to the Canadian border.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Okanogan Highlands All. v.

During smelting, lead or zinc ore is heated to a molten state, during which the desired metal is separated from impurities in the raw ore. These impurities cool to form glassy, granular slag. Between 1930 and 1995, Teck discharged about 400 tons of slag daily-an estimated 9.97 million tons in total-directly into the free-flowing Columbia River. Teck washed this debris into the river using untold gallons of contaminated effluent. These solid and liquid wastes contained roughly 400,000 tons (800 million pounds) of the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc, in addition to lesser amounts of other hazardous substances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At least 8.7 million tons of the Trail smelter's slag and nearly all of the dissolved and particulate-bound metals in its effluent made the short trip downstream into the United States. Upon reaching the calmer waters of Lake Roosevelt, Teck's smelting byproducts came to rest on the riverbed and banks, with larger detritus settling upstream and smaller particles settling downstream near the Grand Coulee Dam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once settled, these wastes began\n   to break down and release hazardous substances into the River's waters and sediment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1999, the Colville Tribes petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess the threats posed by the contamination of the Upper Columbia River Site. Two years later the Tribes and EPA signed an intergovernmental agreement coordinating a site investigation and assessment. After completing its preliminary assessment, EPA issued a unilateral administrative order against Teck. The order directed Teck to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study (\"RI/FS\") of the Site under CERCLA. Teck disputed whether it was subject to CERCLA, however, and EPA decided not to enforce the order during negotiations with the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Colville Tribes then tried to enforce EPA's order by funding a CERCLA citizen suit by two of their tribal government officials in 2004. These plaintiffs were later joined by the State of Washington as a plaintiff-intervenor and eventually by the Colville Tribes as a co-plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Teck moved to dismiss the action. It primarily argued that CERCLA does not apply extraterritorially to its activities and that it cannot be held liable as a person who \"arranged for disposal\" of hazardous substances. The district court denied this motion to dismiss and certified the issues for immediate appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the appeal was pending, Teck and EPA entered a settlement agreement withdrawing EPA's order and committing Teck to fund and conduct an RI/FS modeled on CERCLA's requirements. The study aims to investigate the extent of contamination at the Site, to provide information for EPA's assessment of the risk to human health and the environment, and to evaluate potential remedial alternatives. But the settlement agreement is silent as to Teck's responsibility for cleaning up the Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We accepted Teck's interlocutory appeal and affirmed the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pakootas v.

We also held that the complaint had stated a claim for relief because the actual or threatened release of hazardous substances at the Site could subject Teck to \"arranger\" liability under CERCLA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1082 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On remand, the Tribes and the State each filed amended complaints seeking cost recovery, natural resource damages, and related declaratory relief under CERCLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Litigation was ultimately trifurcated into three phases to sequentially determine: (1) whether Teck is liable as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\"); (2) Teck's liability for response costs; and (3) Teck's liability for natural resource damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before the first bench trial, the Tribes and the State moved for partial summary judgment on Teck's divisibility defense. The district court granted the motions and dismissed the defense, concluding that\n   Teck did not present enough evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the environmental harm to the Upper Columbia River was theoretically capable of apportionment or whether there was a reasonable basis for apportioning Teck's share of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Phase I of trial, the district court concluded that Teck was liable as an arranger under CERCLA section 107(a)(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). In doing so, the court rejected Teck's argument that Washington courts lack personal jurisdiction over the company. The district court then held that without its divisibility defense, Teck was jointly and severally liable to the Tribes and the State under section 107(a)(4)(A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Phase II, the State settled its claim for past response costs while the Tribes proceeded to trial. The district court found in favor of the Tribes and awarded them $3,394,194.43 in investigative expenses incurred through December 31, 2013, $4,859,482.22 in attorney's fees up to that date, and $344,300.00 in prejudgment interest. The court then directed the entry of judgment on Teck's liability for these response costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Teck now appeals from the district court's summary judgment order and partial judgment on the first two phases of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We first consider whether we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Teck contends, as an initial matter, that Rule 54(b) did not authorize the district court to certify this appeal by entering partial final judgment. Rule 54(b) allows a district court in appropriate circumstances to enter judgment on one or more claims while others remain unadjudicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To do so, the district court first must render \"an ultimate disposition of an individual claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

The district court found ample evidence that Teck's leadership knew the Columbia River carried waste away from the smelter, and that much of this waste travelled downstream into Washington, yet Teck continued to discharge hundreds of tons of waste into the river every day. It is inconceivable that Teck did not know that its waste was aimed at the State of Washington when Teck deposited it into the powerful Columbia River just miles upstream of the border. As early as the 1930s, Teck knew that its slag had been found on the beaches of the Columbia River south of the United States border. By the 1980s, Teck's internal documents recognized that its waste was having negative effects on Washington's aquatic ecosystem. And by the early 1990s, Teck's management acknowledged that the company was \"in effect dumping waste into another country,\" using the Upper Columbia River as a \"free\" and \"convenient disposal facility.\" But still Teck, over and over again, on a daily basis for decades, dumped its waste into the river until it modernized its furnace in the mid-1990s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   It is no defense that Teck's wastewater outfalls were aimed only at the Columbia River, which in turn was aimed at Washington. Rivers are nature's conveyor belts. Teck simply made use of the river's natural transport system throughout the 1900s, much like lumberjacks of that period who would roll timber into a stream to start a log drive. Without this transport system, Teck would have soon been inundated by the massive quantities of waste it produced-which, it bears repeating, averaged some 400 tons per day.

To begin with, the Tribes hired an environmental consultant, Environment International, to plan and implement a study of the Upper Columbia River Site. This consultant collected multiple sediment and pore water samples and sent those samples to independent labs for testing. An environmental engineering firm, LimnoTech, then compiled the resulting data into a comprehensive database and analyzed the data. The Tribes also employed several subject-matter experts, such as a geochemist and a metallurgist, to review the data. Finally, the Tribes retained a hydrology firm, Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, to sample and analyze upstream sediment cores from the Canadian reach of the Columbia River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We agree with the district court that the Tribes' data collection and analysis efforts were not an unreasonable means of furthering at least three distinct purposes embraced by CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the expert consultants investigated the presence and movement of toxic wastes at the Site. We have held that\n   section 101(23) encompasses such studies into the location and migration of materials containing hazardous substances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wickland Oil Terminals v.

But this provision is irrelevant.

Adopting that standard here, we conclude that an enforcement activity falls outside of section 101(25) only if it has an inadequate connection with an existing or potential response action at a given site. Although some enforcement activities can be conducted only after a response action has begun, some can be conducted beforehand. For instance, a cash-strapped property owner may wish to locate solvent polluters to split the tab before incurring response costs, and EPA may well review and approve a party's cleanup plans before any response activities are conducted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Key Tronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146879\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/809/\">\n    511 U.S. at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146879\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/809/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (covering PRP searches) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

CERCLA provides that any court awarding response costs in a section 107(a) action \"shall enter a declaratory judgment on liability for response costs ... that will be binding on any subsequent action or actions to recover further response costs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). As a result, the declaration of Teck's liability for future response costs is simply an additional form of relief that the Tribes obtained through the same efforts underlying their successful response costs action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Colton v.

Teck responds that declaratory relief did not need to be granted to compel Teck to fund a response action, but this mandatory relief does not require a showing of necessity. Regardless of whether future response costs are speculative-or even, as Teck insists, affirmatively unlikely-CERCLA requires that a successful plaintiff in a section 107(a) action be awarded both response costs and declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209613\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Teck also challenges the reasonableness of the attorney's fees award under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

Teck contends that if we agree that the Tribes were not entitled to any costs of removal, then we should conclude that the district court misjudged the degree of the Tribes' success. But we do not agree with Teck's premise, so we reject its conclusion. The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the $4.86 million attorney's fees award to be reasonably proportionate to the properly awarded $3.39 million for investigation expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

In opposing the motions for summary judgment, Teck relied almost exclusively on the declaration and report prepared by its divisibility expert, Dr. Mark Johns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Dr. Johns's report set out to estimate the contributions from all of the sources of six heavy metals-arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc-that are found in the Upper Columbia River and that allegedly originated from Teck's smelter. The report began by cataloging many potential pollution sources dating back to the nineteenth century. These sources throughout the River's watershed include 487 mines, eight mills, six smelters, several municipal wastewater treatment plants and industrial operations, urban runoff from the City of Spokane, natural erosion, and landslides. The materials containing heavy metals could range from waste rock and tailings to particles carried by rainwater, mine water seepage, and liquid effluent; from finely eroded soils to large masses of clay and rock. The report concluded that Teck's slag is concentrated near the U.S.-Canada border and is not found more than 45 miles downriver. By contrast, one smelter dumped slag into the Upper Columbia River a few miles south of the border; other smelter slag, mine waste, and soil erosion could have reached the River at more than ten confluences with its tributaries; some wastewater treatment plants and industrial sources discharged liquid effluent to the River north of the international border; the Spokane River contributed waste from mining, smelting, wastewater treatment plants, industrial sources, and urban runoff about 100 miles south of the border; and landslides occurred on the banks of Lake Roosevelt as far as 150 miles downriver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The report then identified two methods for apportioning liability for the River's pollution, and Dr. Johns's declaration identified a third possible method not set forth in his report but identified at his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The primary apportionment method employed a \"metals loading approach.\" This approach was based on the premise that \"[t]he harm in this case is the extent of sediment contamination by hazardous substances released at the Site.\" To calculate the release of hazardous substances from Teck's wastes, Dr. Johns credited a study by another one of Teck's experts concluding that \"no verifiable amount of hazardous substances were measured leaching from Teck's slag\" and that no dissolved metals from Teck's effluent were even found at the Site. Dr. Johns then expressed his opinion that because he believed Teck's wastes are harmless, Teck should be apportioned 0% of the liability for the Upper Columbia River's contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As an alternative, Dr. Johns conducted a \"flux\" apportionment analysis. Unlike the primary apportionment method, this analysis assumed that the relevant harm is contamination of the River's \"surface water.\" Dr. Johns evaluated the six heavy metals' net flux from contaminated sediment into overlying water. This analysis assumed that the \"diffusion boundary layer to the sediment-water interface\" was limited to the top five centimeters of sediment. Dr. Johns then estimated the mass of Teck's slag present in this top portion of sediment in the northernmost 45 miles of the Site. Using a \"theoretical\" release rate for zinc-the only metal \"measured to even theoretically release from slag\"-Dr. Johns calculated a maximum daily release rate for Teck's slag. He compared this rate against the zinc flux rate for all remaining sediment in this area, as estimated by another one of Teck's experts, and concluded that Teck should be apportioned a 0.05% share of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, Dr. Johns testified about a potential mass-based approach to account for Teck's share of metals found at the Upper Columbia River Site. This approach assumed that any \"placement of hazardous substances\" into the Site is the relevant harm. Dr. Johns estimated the mass of metals found in Teck's slag and materials from other sources at the Site, but he ultimately did not use this method to determine Teck's portion of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The threshold issue on appeal is how to review divisibility evidence on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   CERCLA liability is ordinarily joint and several, except in the rare cases where the environmental harm to a site is shown to be divisible.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At Teck's direction, however, Dr. Johns expressly curtailed his divisibility analysis to the six hazardous substances allegedly \"attributable to Teck.\" But Teck did not claim that these were the only pollutants found at the Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Both the Tribes and the State pointed out this deficiency in their motions for summary judgment. The Tribes cited evidence of the Site containing the hazardous substances antimony, beryllium, chromium, nickel, radon, selenium, thallium, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (\"PAHs\"), polychlorinated biphenyls (\"PCBs\"), and DDTs. And one of the State's experts submitted\n   a declaration stating that EPA was evaluating the Site for around 199 contaminants of concern, including PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and furans, and pesticides. This declaration further showed that sediment samples found Teck's metals physically mixed with other hazardous substances in the northern stretches of the Site. Zinc, for example, \"was detected with other metals like antimony, arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, and lead, and also in several instances with up to 14 reported organic PAH chemicals present, as well as less frequently with pesticides like 2,4-DDT, 4,4 DDE, and 4,4-DDT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Despite this evidence, Teck's opposition to the motions for summary judgment continued to rely on Dr. Johns's limited analysis. Teck reiterated its assumption that the Site's harm was solely traceable to the specific metals that Teck discharged. While conceding that its slag was \"co-located\" with \"other slag and tailings,\" Teck made no mention of its pollutants being found alongside non-metal pollutants. And Teck relied on Dr. Johns's view that if Teck's slag \"is not leaching,\" as he believed, then \"the location of the slag in sediment is irrelevant to the apportionment analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   On these points Teck erred.

To that end, Dr. Johns opined that Teck's slag cannot chemically interact with other substances based on his understanding that the slag does not leach pollutants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We are not persuaded. Even if pollutants do not chemically interact, their physical aggregation can cause disproportionate harm that is not linearly correlated with the amount of pollution attributable to each source. In\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   , a key case addressing chemical commingling, the Fourth Circuit explained: \"Common sense counsels that a million gallons of certain substances could be mixed together without significant consequences, whereas a few pints of others improperly mixed could result in disastrous consequences.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524978\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/160/\">\n    858 F.2d at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And the Third Circuit has held that \"the fact that a single generator's waste would not in itself justify a response is irrelevant ..., as this would permit a generator to escape liability where the amount of harm it engendered to the environment was minimal, though it was significant when added to other generators' waste.\"\n   <em>\n    Alcan-Butler\n   </em>\n   , 964 F.2d at 264.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Without knowing more about the accumulation of Teck's wastes with unrelated pollutants, with like materials, and by themselves, a court could not tell whether \"their presence is harmful and the River must be cleaned.\"\n   <em>\n    NCR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497588\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/833/#p838\">\n    688 F.3d at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Teck did not carry its burden of showing that the harm is theoretically capable of apportionment by simply \"considering the effects of its waste in isolation from the other contaminants at a site.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Contrary to Dr. Johns's mistaken assumption, the buildup of Teck's slag with other metal-bearing slag or tailings and even on its own affects the extent of the harm. Disproportionate harm can occur whether or not the slag actively leaches pollutants because, as mentioned, the mere\n   <em>\n    threat\n   </em>\n   of leaching can prompt a response action, and the accumulation of materials that pose a potential risk makes a response action more likely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Chem-Nuclear Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9415003,3699349\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/254/\">\n    292 F.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Teck responds that Dr. Johns's declaration at least creates a disputed issue of fact on this point that precludes summary judgment, but in light of the statutory scheme, no rational trier of fact could believe this unsupported assumption that the distribution of the slag is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

And because Teck's slag itself contains a mixture of pollutants, Teck also had to proffer evidence that the clustering of these pollutants did not create disproportionate environmental harm. No reasonable factfinder could otherwise assume, as Dr. Johns's apportionment methods require, that rocks and sand from landslides and erosion, for example, are candidates for remediation on par with Teck's toxic slag.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, because the divisibility of the Upper Columbia River's contamination turns on the specific facts of that contamination, Teck is also mistaken in arguing that river pollution is categorically divisible under the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NCR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3497588\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/833/#p838\">\n    688 F.3d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All three of Dr. Johns's apportionment methods are variants of a volumetric approach in that they are premised on an estimate of the mass of pollutants at the Site. But as the Fourth Circuit has noted, \"[v]olumetric contributions provide a reasonable basis for apportioning liability only if it can be reasonably assumed, or it has been demonstrated, that independent factors had no substantial effect on the harm to the environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524978\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/160/\">\n    858 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   172 n.27. Teck \"presented no evidence, however, showing a relationship between waste volume ... and the harm at the site.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524978\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524978\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/160/\">\n    at 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the available record undercuts the reasonableness of Teck's assuming a proportional relationship between waste volume alone and the Site's contamination, for two main reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   First, as the Tribes point out, Teck's evidence shows that geographic factors clearly affected the river's contamination throughout this massive site. The Trail smelter's pollution entered the Upper Columbia River at the international border and, according to Dr. Johns, Teck's slag deposits extend only 45 river miles south. But Dr. Johns accounted for the potential contribution of metals from sources as far as 150 miles downriver, many of which were concentrated at more than ten different confluences between the River and its tributaries. Further, conditions varied greatly throughout the Site; the River is free flowing close to the Canadian border, causing less sediment to accumulate, but it eventually slows and forms Lake Roosevelt, preserving more sediment. As discussed above, these differences in pollution hotspots will doubtless entail varying remediation needs and injuries to the natural environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hercules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11109475\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/706/#p717\">\n    247 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even if the harm from those hotspots is capable of division, the fact that contamination strongly correlates with geography means that this is an independent factor that substantially affects the environmental harm at issue. Any proxy for the harm that did not account for geography thus could not be found reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Second, Teck's evidence also shows that the passage of time could have a substantial impact on the river's contamination given the long time period under consideration. Dr. Johns accounted for materials deposited into the Columbia River from the late 1800s through the present. He testified in his deposition that over time, the accumulation of new sediment could bury old contaminants, and in his declaration he said that remediation is not needed if contaminants are buried beneath at least five centimeters of sediment. Further, Dr. Johns acknowledged that over time, slag may slowly release-and thus lose-hazardous substances to the surrounding environment. The upshot is that older wastes may present less of a need for cleanup than more recently disposed wastes. On this record, no reasonable fact-finder could assume that the time at which wastes entered the River is irrelevant to determining the extent of harmful contamination at the Site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Other independent factors could also affect the environmental harm here, but were similarly ignored by Teck. To take a ready example, some pollutants in the Upper Columbia River may be more toxic than others, like lead compared to zinc. And pollutants may have different migratory potentials based on the media in which they are deposited, such as glassy slag, powdery tailings, or suspended particulates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524978\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/160/\">\n    858 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 n.26 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.
