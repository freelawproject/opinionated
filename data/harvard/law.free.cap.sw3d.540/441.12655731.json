In the underlying action, Plaintiff tried his claims against WMT under theories of strict liability product defect and negligent design, and Plaintiff tried his claims against Dr. Lux and The Orthopedic Center under a medical negligence theory. We find no error has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. We have, however, provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision.
