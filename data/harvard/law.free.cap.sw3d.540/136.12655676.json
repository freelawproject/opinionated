He obtained lawful permanent resident status on March 19, 2011. One-and-one-half years later, on September 30, 2012, Houston Police Officer K. Truong was dispatched to the home of V. Cruz, following a 9-1-1 call. Cruz reported to Officer Truong that she and Appellant had an altercation regarding Appellant's payment of child support to her. She stated that, during the altercation, Appellant had put his hands around her neck and choked her. Based on the incident, Appellant was arrested and charged with the third-degree felony offense of assault of a family member-impeding breathing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1), (b)(2)(B) (West Supp. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant entered into a plea bargain with the State. In exchange for Appellant's guilty plea, the State agreed to recommend a sentence of two years' deferred-adjudication community supervision and a $200 fine. Appellant was represented during the plea proceedings by attorney, R. Rodriguez. Although the record reflects that Appellant waived his right to have a court reporter transcribe the plea hearing, the record does reflect that, on October 8, 2012, in accordance with the State's recommendations, the trial court placed Appellant on two years deferred-adjudication community supervision and assessed a $200 fine against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2013, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated proceedings to remove Appellant from the United States. DHS issued a \"Notice to Appear,\" instructing Appellant to appear before an immigration judge. The notice stated that Appellant was a citizen of Honduras and that his \"status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident on March 19, 2012.\" It recognized that, on October 8, 2012, Appellant had been convicted of assault of a family member-impeding breathing, an offense for which a sentence of one year or more may be imposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further recognized that the offense was committed on September 30, 2012 against\n   V. Cruz, \"a person who is protected from [Appellant's] acts by domestic or family violence laws.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The notice informed Appellant that he was \"subject to removal from the United States\" because he had been \"convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude [third-degree felony assault of a family member] committed within five years after admission [to the United States] for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed\" and because he was \"an alien who at any time after entry has been convicted of a crime of domestic violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (a)(2)(E)(i) (2007). Appellant was not eligible to have his removal from the United States \"canceled\" by the Attorney General of the United States because he had not \"been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years,\" nor had he \"resided in the United States continuously for 7 years after having been admitted in any status.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the provisions in Code of Criminal Procedure Article 11.072, Appellant filed an application for a post-conviction writ of habeas corpus in which he asserted that his guilty plea had been involuntary because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during the plea proceedings. Appellant requested the habeas court \"[to] set aside his plea of guilty.\" Appellant alleged that his plea counsel had been ineffective because counsel had failed to advise him about the immigration consequences of his plea, as required by\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 1486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant offered his affidavit in support of the application. In his affidavit, Appellant averred that his plea counsel did not advise him that his removal from the United States was \"virtually mandatory\" as a result of his conviction. He stated that he had been \"put in removal proceedings in the immigration court as a result of this conviction.\" He averred that he \"found out during the removal proceedings in the immigration court that I was not eligible to apply for any realistic form of discretionary relief.\" Appellant testified that his plea counsel had \"not explain[ed] to me the legal implications that my conviction was going to have on the different forms of discretionary relief that are available in removal proceedings.\" He stated, \"[T]he immigration Judge ordered my removal on March 24th, 2014.\" Appellant concluded his affidavit by averring that, if he had known either that his guilty plea would make his deportation virtually mandatory or that he would not qualify for discretionary relief, he would not have pleaded guilty but instead would have insisted on going to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant also offered the affidavit from his plea counsel, R. Rodriguez, in support of his habeas application. In his affidavit, Rodriguez stated that, during the plea process, he did not inform Appellant that he was subject to \"automatic deportation\" if he pleaded guilty to assault of a family member-impeding breathing. Rodriguez averred that the reason he had not informed Appellant of this information was because he had not been aware at the time of the plea that assault of a family member-impeding breathing was considered a crime involving moral turpitude and that, if convicted, Appellant would be automatically deported. Rodriguez stated that he also had not known that a conviction for domestic violence would subject Appellant to automatic deportation. Rodriguez testified that he did not inform Appellant that a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude \"within the seven (7) year period after admission would prevent a 'Legal Permanent Resident' to apply for 'Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status' during removal proceedings\" because\n   he had also not been aware of that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The habeas court conducted a hearing on Appellant's habeas application. At the hearing, Appellant presented the testimony of an immigration law expert. The expert testified that, given the nature of his conviction and the period of time that he had been a permanent legal resident, the only avenue for Appellant to remain in the United States would be to prove \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardships to [Appellant] and [his] family,\" a \"virtually impossible\" standard to meet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellant also offered the testimony of his plea counsel, Rodriguez, at the hearing. Rodriguez stated that he had been appointed to represent Appellant in the underlying case. On the day of the plea proceedings, Rodriguez met with Appellant in the \"holdover cell\" next to the courtroom. Rodriguez testified that the meeting was \"fairly lengthy,\" lasting 30 minutes to one hour. During the meeting, Rodriguez reviewed the facts of the case with Appellant. After speaking with the prosecutor, Rodriguez informed Appellant that the State would recommend \"a two-year deferred adjudication probation if he were to decide to plea.\" Rodriguez told Appellant that he had \"an option to go to trial\" or he could plead guilty in exchange for the punishment the State was offering. Rodriguez stated, \"[Appellant] decided to go ahead and plead and accept the two-year deferred adjudication probation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rodriguez confirmed that he did not advise Appellant that \"the crime to which he was pleading guilty was considered for immigration purposes a crime involving moral turpitude\" because he was not aware of that information. Rodriguez also confirmed that, because he lacked knowledge about the issue, he did not inform Appellant that he would be placed into removal proceedings as a result of pleading guilty. Rodriguez testified that, if he had known that removal proceedings would be initiated against Appellant as a result of his guilty plea, he \"would have advised [Appellant] that he probably would consider going to trial on this case.... I would not have given him advice of taking a two-year deferred adjudication probation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rodriguez testified that his representation of Appellant was not \"ineffective in terms of my representation on the charge that he had\"; however, \"looking back, not informing [Appellant] of the specific consequences of his plea, because I was unaware of the crime being a crime of moral turpitude and that he would be put in automatic proceedings, that could be considered ineffective.\" On cross-examination, Rodriguez agreed that he had told Appellant that \"he could be deported.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During Rodriguez's testimony, the habeas judge recalled that during the plea proceedings she had inquired whether Appellant was a permanent resident and had then informed Appellant that he could be deported. Rodriguez confirmed that the judge had informed Appellant, during the plea proceedings, that he could be deported. The habeas judge further noted that she had written on Appellant's plea papers as follows: \"Per attorney, [defendant] is permanent resident. Defendant understands he could be deported.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellant also testified at the hearing through a Spanish interpreter. Appellant stated that he was residing in the county jail, and before being brought there, had been in an immigration detention facility. Appellant testified that he was 35 years old and had been in the United States for 17 years. He confirmed that, other than the offense involved in this case, he had never been convicted of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellant testified that he has a wife and four children. He asked the habeas court \"[to] allow me a second opportunity because my children are minors and they do need me because my wife does not work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On cross-examination, Appellant acknowledged that his plea counsel, Rodriguez, had informed him that, if he pleaded guilty, he could be deported. However, Appellant indicated that Rodriguez had not told him that immigration authorities would arrest him and initiate deportation procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State presented the testimony of the police officer, K. Truong, who responded to the 9-1-1 call made regarding Appellant's assault on the complainant, V. Cruz. Officer Truong testified that, when he arrived at the scene, he spoke to Cruz. He described her as being \"terrified.\" Cruz indicated to Officer Truong that she and Appellant had an altercation because Appellant wanted to stop paying child support. She reported that Appellant had choked her. She said that she tried to call 9-1-1, but Appellant had grabbed her phone. She was able to push Appellant away and leave the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Officer Truong also testified that Cruz's eight-year-old son was also at the scene. He stated that the child was crying, afraid, and clinging to his mother. The child corroborated his mother's story, telling Officer Truong that his father, Appellant, had put his hands around his mother's neck. He said that Appellant grabbed his mother's cell phone, but she was able to push him away, and run out of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Officer Truong also testified that he saw \"very visible\" markings on Cruz's neck. He stated that Appellant was \"upset\" and \"drunk\" when he arrested him that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State also offered the testimony of the assistant district attorney, T. Ballengee, the prosecutor at Appellant's plea proceedings. Ballengee testified that he reviewed the file and saw that he had written \"on the file that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   warnings were given.\" He stated, \"The only time that I would write\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   warnings were given [in the trial court] was if it was specifically stated in the plea that the defendant would, in fact, be deported, not that they may [be deported].\" Ballengee recalled that, at the time of the plea, he had thought it was odd for Appellant to take deferred adjudication when \"we were telling him that he was going to be deported.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Ballengee testified that the complainant, Cruz, was cooperative with the prosecution. And he stated that Cruz had \"requested probation for [Appellant] and treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the end of the hearing, the habeas court indicated that it was denying Appellant's requested habeas relief. The court later signed an order denying Appellant's \"application for writ of habeas corpus.\" The habeas court adopted the State's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, which included a statement that, in making the findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court had \"considered the application for writ of habeas corpus, the affidavits attached to the application, the evidence presented at the writ hearing, and official court records in the above-captioned cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The habeas court's findings of fact included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1.

More precisely, he claims that he could have negotiated a plea deal whereby he would have pleaded guilty to a lesser-included offense for which he would not have been subject to deportation. Appellant further asserts that he would not have agreed to deferred adjudication had he known it he would result in his deportation.

He points out that he met his attorney, Rodriguez, on the day he pleaded guilty in a holdover cell near the courtroom. The record shows that Appellant and Rodriguez met there for 30 minutes to one hour immediately before the plea proceedings. Appellant is correct in indicating that the record does not contain direct evidence showing whether Appellant knew the strength of the State's case at that time. And, if he did, the record does not show whether Appellant considered such information in entering into the plea bargain. However, at the habeas hearing, Rodriguez testified that he was \"given the file that the State had that contained the offense report of what [Appellant] was being charged with. I went over the facts of that with [Appellant]. I had a conversation with him about it.\" From this, the habeas court could have reasonably inferred that Rodriguez reviewed responding police officer Truong's offense report with Appellant before the plea proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At the habeas hearing, Officer Truong testified what he had observed when he arrived at the scene.

She reported that Appellant had choked her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Officer Truong also testified that Cruz's eight-year-old son was crying, afraid, and clinging to his mother. The child corroborated his mother's story. He told Officer Truong that his father, Appellant, had put his hands around his mother's neck.

These credibility findings are reconcilable because there was not great overlap between Appellant's and Rodriguez's testimony. However, we note one common area of testimony: whether Appellant was informed of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Appellant and Rodriguez each testified that Rodriguez informed Appellant that he\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be deported if he pleaded guilty but did not inform Appellant that his deportation was mandatory. At the habeas hearing, the judge indicated that she had also presided at the plea proceedings. She noted that she had written on the plea papers that Appellant had been informed that he may be deported. As Appellant and Rodriguez had testified, the judge acknowledged that Appellant had not been informed that his deportation would be mandatory following a guilty plea. Thus, it appears that the habeas court's findings regarding the respective credibility of Appellant and Rodriguez are pertinent to factual issues other than whether Appellant was informed of the immigration consequences of his plea, such as Appellant's claim that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known he would be deported, Appellant's testimony about when deportation proceedings were initiated against him, and Rodriguez's testimony regarding his meeting with Appellant before the guilty plea.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The habeas court expressly found that Appellant's \"assertion that he would not have pled guilty but for the alleged deficient conduct but would have insisted on going to trial is not credible.\" In addition to express findings, we must give deference to the habeas court's implied fact findings and conclusions supported by the record, including the habeas court's implicit finding that Appellant failed to prove that it would have been rational, under the circumstances, for him to have rejected the plea bargain and gone to trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Torres\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809032\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/35/\">\n     483 S.W.3d 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 46 (Tex.

The court observed that, in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court \"suggest[ed] that, in order to obtain relief on such a claim, an applicant who demonstrates deficient performance would not automatically be entitled to relief, but instead would be required to 'convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809032\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809032\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/35/\">\n    at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1473 ).

Thus, to establish prejudice, a habeas applicant must \"convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court noted that, in a prejudice inquiry, courts have considered the evidence supporting the applicant's assertions, the likelihood of the applicant's success at trial, the risks the applicant would have faced at trial, the benefits received from the plea bargain, and the trial court's admonishments to the applicant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court \"caution[ed] that, to show that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances, it is not dispositive that an applicant show that he would have received a more favorable disposition had he gone to trial,\" and it noted that \"an alien defendant might rationally be more concerned with removal than with a term of imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted). If \"the totality of the circumstances indicate that a defendant has placed a particular emphasis on the immigration consequences of a plea in deciding whether or not to accept it, this may constitute a circumstance that weighs in favor of a finding of prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   On original submission in this case, we affirmed the trial court's order denying appellant's requested habeas relief, concluding that he had not shown that \"but for the alleged deficient conduct by plea counsel, there was a reasonable probability that [appellant] would have gone to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Duque\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-15-00014-CR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205450530\">\n    2015 WL 5450530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (Tex.

On appellant's petition for discretionary review, the court of criminal appeals vacated our judgment and remanded the case to this Court \"to consider the effect of\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   , if any, on [our] reasoning and analysis\" because we had issued our opinion \"without the benefit of\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Torres.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Duque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201383854\">\n    2016 WL 1383854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In his sole issue after remand, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying his application for a writ of habeas corpus because his counsel did not provide him with \"accurate legal advice\" and advise him that \"his deportation was a virtual legal certainty\" under federal immigration\n   law. As to the prejudice prong, appellant asserts \"that a closer look to the totality of the circumstances surrounding his case, would show that it would have been rational for him to reject the State's plea bargain offer to either secure an immigration friendly plea bargain, or to take his case to trial.\" The majority concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Given the totality of the circumstances, and the habeas court's credibility assessments, the record supports the habeas court's\n   <em>\n    implied finding\n   </em>\n   that [a]ppellant failed to show that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances. The record further supports an\n   <em>\n    implied finding\n   </em>\n   that [a]ppellant had not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. That is, the record supports a determination that [a]ppellant was not prejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Internal quotations, footnote, and citations omitted.) The majority overrules appellant's issue and affirms the trial court's order denying the requested habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In doing so, the majority specifically notes that the trial court made an express finding that \"the [appellant's] assertion that he would not have pled guilty but for the alleged deficient conduct but would have insisted on going to trial is not credible.\" And, the majority notes the court of criminal appeals's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Torres\n   </em>\n   that \"the court of appeals erred by failing to defer to the habeas court's implicit fact findings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809032\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/483/35/\">\n    483 S.W.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, the court of criminal appeals expressly remanded the case to this Court to consider the effect of the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Torres\n   </em>\n   , if any, on our reasoning and analysis.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Duque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201383854\">\n    2016 WL 1383854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Although in reviewing a trial court's order denying habeas relief, we generally defer to implied findings and conclusions supported by the record, here remand is appropriate to allow the trial court to make any additional findings and conclusions necessary in light of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Torres.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.). In considering a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, the court of criminal appeals has held that when a trial court had made specific findings and conclusions sua sponte, the court \"assumed an obligation to make findings and conclusions that were adequate and complete, covering every potentially dispositive issue.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
