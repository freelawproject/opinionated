Keyes, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this accelerated appeal, appellants, M.G. (\"Mother\") and J.R.G. (\"Father\"), challenge the trial court's final decree, entered after a bench trial to a master, awarding the Department of Family and Protective Services (\"DFPS\") permanent managing conservatorship of their four children, J.J.G., L.K.G., H.A.G., and A.G.G. A panel of this Court reversed the trial court's decree and DFPS filed a motion for en banc reconsideration. We now grant DFPS's motion for en banc reconsideration, withdraw our opinion of August 4, 2016, vacate our judgment of the same date, and issue this en banc opinion and judgment in their stead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 49.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In challenging the trial court's decree naming DFPS as the children's managing conservator, Mother contends on appeal that the trial court erred: (1) by failing to appoint her as the children's managing conservator, or alternatively, as their possessory conservator; and (2) by failing to approve the master's recommended judgment without hearing more evidence and applying Government Code section 54.817 in such a way that it denied her due process protections. Father contends on appeal that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's determinations that (1) appointing him as the children's joint managing conservator\n   would significantly impair the children's physical health or emotional development; and (2) the best interest of the children was served by appointing DFPS as the children's managing conservator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's determination that naming either parent as managing conservator would significantly impair the children's physical health or emotional development and that naming DFPS as their managing conservator was in the children's best interest, we overrule Mother's first issue and Father's issues on appeal. We further conclude that Mother failed to preserve any complaint regarding the trial court's application of the rules governing the use of a master in cases such as this case, and, accordingly, we overrule Mother's second issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We affirm the final decree of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This case was filed by DFPS on February 5, 2014, after the youngest child, A.G.G., sustained life-threatening injuries attributable to abuse. DFPS removed all of the children from Mother's home. At that time, J.J.G. was three years old, L.K.G. was two years old, H.A.G. was less than two years old, and A.G.G., the injured child, was seven months old. DFPS created family service plans for both Mother and Father, and both parents participated in the services ordered as part of the family service plans and had visitation with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DFPS believed that both Mother and Father failed to make adequate progress to justify reunifying them with their children. Accordingly, on December 1, 2014, DFPS amended its petition to seek managing conservatorship of the children and termination of Mother's and Father's parental rights. The case was tried before a master on July 10 through 13, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the bench trial, DFPS presented evidence regarding the circumstances under which the children came to be in DFPS's care. DFPS received a referral that A.G.G., who was seven months old at the time, had been physically abused by an \"unknown perpetrator.\" A.G.G. had been under the care of several different caregivers, including Mother, at the time he sustained his injuries. Mother could not provide an explanation for A.G.G.'s injuries, which included brain bleeding, broken bones, and bruising. DFPS concluded that A.G.G.'s injuries constituted a \"non-accidental trauma\" and were \"consistent with abuse and/or neglect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Reena Isaac, a physician on the child protection medical team at Texas Children's Hospital, testified that she examined A.G.G. after Mother brought him to the hospital on January 23, 2014. Dr. Isaac diagnosed him as \"a victim of abusive head trauma,\" noting that he had several skeletal injuries, two subdural hematomas, a cerebral contusion on the left side of his head, significant retinal hemorrhages in both of his eyes, and scratches on his back. A.G.G. also had a recent subdural hematoma around the back of his head and a more remote one on the frontal area of his head, indicating that he had suffered head trauma on more than one occasion. The recent subdural hematoma had likely occurred within one to three days of his arrival at the hospital, and the more remote subdural hematoma had likely occurred at least several weeks prior to that. Dr. Isaac noted that the subdural hematomas were markers of head injuries caused by acceleration and deceleration forces applied to A.G.G. In other words, \"the child's head [was forced to] mov[e] very rapidly and then stop[ped] suddenly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Dr. Isaac's Physician's Statement, which was also admitted into evidence, Mother reported several different incidents as possible explanations for A.G.G.'s severe injuries. Mother recounted an incident that occurred several days before Dr. Isaac's examination in which A.G.G., who had been strapped into his car seat, fell when the car seat dislodged while Mother was driving her car. Mother also described an incident in which A.G.G. had fallen off a bed while at home with her. Dr. Isaac concluded that neither of the incidents described by Mother could have caused A.G.G.'s subdural hematomas because they could not have generated the rapid acceleration and deceleration forces necessary to cause the hematomas that had occurred in his brain. Nor could these incidents have caused the retinal hemorrhaging found in A.G.G.'s eyes. In short, Mother's story was inconsistent with the evidence of A.G.G.'s injuries at the hands of an unknown perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Isaac also testified that A.G.G. had suffered fractures to both of his distal tibias, i.e., \"the long bones of the legs near the ankles,\" sclerosis, or an injury to one of the bones within his left foot, and an impaction fracture on his right radius. The fractures to the tibias, approximately seven to ten days old, were likely to have occurred at the same time as the result of a direct application of force in a twisting motion. Dr. Isaac testified that the force that caused the fractures was greater than any force required for the normal care of a child. Although Mother reported to Dr. Isaac that A.G.G. \"may have gotten [his] legs caught in [his] crib,\" Dr. Isaac testified that such an occurrence would not have explained his leg injuries, which were more serious and intentional. She also stated that A.G.G.'s siblings were unlikely to have caused any of his injuries with the possible exception of some of the bruises or scratches on his back, which were superficial. A.G.G.'s injuries were serious, would have been caused by \"significant force,\" and were likely caused by an adult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The evidence at trial, including the testimony of both Mother and DFPS caseworker Nicole Franco, demonstrated that three people had cared for A.G.G. during the time he sustained his serious injuries: Mother, her sister-in-law Veronica, and her friend Nelly. Neither Dr. Isaac nor DFPS and police investigators were able to determine which of these three adults had abused A.G.G., and at the time of trial, two-and-one-half years later, the investigation was ongoing, with Mother remaining a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the time of trial, A.G.G. was legally blind and had trouble walking. A.G.G.'s siblings, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G., did not show signs of abuse or neglect at the time they were removed from Mother's care. The DFPS investigator described them as \"awake, alert[,] and very active,\" and concluded they \"appeared to be healthy and developmentally on target for their ages.\" At that time, the family had no prior history of drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness, domestic violence, or past or current involvement with law enforcement or DFPS. Dr. Isaac reported that A.G.G.'s siblings had been examined by the medical staff at the hospital and found to be healthy, although the children were anemic and at least one of them was underweight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Franco acknowledged that the issues with A.G.G.'s siblings were not severe enough by themselves for DFPS to have removed the children from Mother's care. However, she also testified that, at the time of trial, each child had his or her own \"unique special need.\" J.J.G. required speech therapy and participated in individual play therapy; L.K.G. required speech therapy and individual play therapy; H.A.G. required speech therapy, was not\n   potty-trained, and required \"PPCD,\" which is \"[s]upport services through ... school\"; and A.G.G. required continued treatment by an ophthalmologist, additional surgery \"around the age of five\" related to his eyes, and occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Franco also noted that J.J.G. and L.K.G., who were five years old and four years old respectively, did not want to go home to Mother or Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dianne Del Sol, the owner of the day-care facility the children were attending at the time of trial, testified that J.J.G. was almost four years old when DFPS removed him from Mother's custody and he started at the facility. At that time, he was very shy, \"not capable of having social interactions with the rest of the children,\" \"spoke very little English,\" \"did not know his shapes, colors, [or] numbers,\" \"did not know how to write his name,\" and was not \"potty trained.\" However, he could speak Spanish, was \"verbal in the Spanish language,\" and did not have a \"speech delay.\" J.J.G. was \"withdrawn to himself, doing his own activities,\" and, while there was nothing wrong with that, at his age, he should have been developing social connections with others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Del Sol further testified that, initially, L.K.G., who was almost three years old when she started at the day-care facility, had \"emotional outburst[s]\" and \"would cry for no reason.\" H.A.G., who was \"less than two years old\" when she started at the facility, was also difficult to deal with. She would \"sit there and just cry with her mouth hanging open and slobber dro[o]ling down,\" and she could not be consoled. Del Sol noted, however, that such behavior could have been occurring due to her missing her mother. A.G.G., who was less than one year old when he began at the day-care facility, did not have crying outbursts and easily interacted with the other children. However, he had a difficult time walking and his vision was impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Del Sol testified that, while in the care of DFPS, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G. had received speech therapy, and A.G.G. had received therapy for walking. At the time of trial, the children were no longer experiencing delays in development. J.J.G. was very outgoing, was speaking well, and knew his colors, shapes, and numbers. L.K.G. was also doing well, was doing her class work, and was interacting with her friends. H.A.G. \"still ha[d] a lot of ... emotional distress,\" but not nearly to the same extent. And A.G.G. was very well adjusted, although he struggled with his vision and his walking was \"a little uneven,\" which required him to be watched closely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mother testified that she met Father in November 2008 and became pregnant with J.J.G. in 2009. At that time, she was not aware that Father was married to another woman. While she was pregnant, she saw Father every once in a while, but he provided no support for Mother before or during her pregnancy with J.J.G. After J.J.G. was born on March 3, 2010, Mother saw Father \"more frequently\" and became pregnant with L.K.G., who was born on March 5, 2011. Although Father did not provide Mother with any financial assistance before or during her pregnancy with L.K.G., she continued to see him. After H.A.G. was born on June 7, 2012, Father \"started to help\" Mother because she \"told him he really needed to help\" as \"there were more children, more expenses, and more responsibility.\" She explained that she had not previously asked Father for financial assistance because she was working and things were not difficult financially. After the birth of H.A.G., Father gave Mother some money each month until March 2013, while she was pregnant with A.G.G., when he told her that he had to\n   move to Mexico. Mother next saw Father in January 2014, seven months after A.G.G. was born on May 31, 2013, and prior to A.G.G.'s being injured. After Father returned in January 2014, he again paid child support, pursuant to a court order, in the time leading up to the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mother opined that Father was a good father who loved the children and paid attention to them. However, she admitted that it was not responsible for him to disappear for long periods of time and that that indicated that he was not there for his children. When Father did visit the children, it was usually for two or three hours, once or twice a week. When he visited, he watched movies with the children, played with them, and devoted time to them. Mother testified that Father had visited J.J.G., specifically, many times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mother testified that she was employed as a cook at a restaurant, where she had worked for the past seven years. She worked in the mornings for thirty-five to forty hours per week and had previously worked at night from approximately 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. She stated that if the children were returned to her, she would continue to work \"[j]ust mornings.\" Although she had help from her family, namely her brothers and sisters-in-law and her friend Nelly, in caring for her children, she had raised her four children essentially by herself prior to their removal by DFPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Regarding her plans for caring for the children if they were returned to her, Mother testified that she had looked into day care for the children-specifically Sharpstown Day Care-which the children would attend while she worked. She stated that if the children were returned to her, she would be picking them up from school, bathing them, and helping them with their homework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regarding the events surrounding A.G.G.'s injuries, the evidence at trial demonstrated that Mother had sought medical care for A.G.G. as his symptoms worsened in the days leading up to his hospitalization. She originally noticed that he had a cough, and she took him to his regular doctor, who noted that A.G.G. seemed normal and was not in apparent distress. However, when A.G.G. became more ill and vomited several times, Mother took him to the hospital, where the extent of his injuries was discovered. Mother testified that she did not harm A.G.G. or any of her children. She also denied narcotics and alcohol abuse, a psychological history, a criminal history, and a DFPS history, and there was no evidence contradicting these assertions. Mother was also aware that A.G.G. now requires special care and will need additional surgery related to his eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At the time of trial, Mother testified that she had consistently attended her supervised visits with the children and had brought them food or gifts. The children were \"very loving\" towards her and would tell her, \"[M]ommy we love you. I love you.... We want to go with you.\" According to Mother, Franco-the DFPS caseworker who testified that J.J.G. and L.K.G. did not want to go home to Mother or Father-had never been present for any of her visits with the children. Mother acknowledged that, other than therapy sessions she had with the children, she had been allowed to see the children for only two hours per month after they were taken into custody by DFPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mother had completed many, but not all, requirements of her family service plan. She was required to participate in and successfully complete individual therapy. She was initially discharged from individual therapy sessions \"due to minimal progress.\" However, DFPS had referred her for more therapy to work on her parenting\n   skills, and she was still participating at the time of trial. Mother had completed her required psychosocial evaluation, had completed her required parenting classes, and had provided DFPS with certification of her completion of her classes. She continued to work on implementing the parenting skills that she had learned during her family therapy sessions with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mother's psychotherapist, Gabriela Morgan, testified that Mother had attended both individual counseling and family therapy with her, approximately once a week, for more than a year. Morgan opined that Mother's behavior in the sessions was cooperative and attentive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Morgan's therapy notes reflected that Mother denied injuring A.G.G. on numerous occasions and initially stated that she had no idea how her baby got hurt. Over time, as she progressed in therapy, Mother indicated that she believed that Veronica had hurt A.G.G. This concerned Morgan because, two or three months prior to these statements, Mother had indicated that her relationship with Veronica was close, they talked a lot, and Veronica was part of her support system. However, at trial, Mother contradicted this testimony. She stated that, although she thought that Veronica had hurt A.G.G., she could not say so for certain because she \"didn't see her harming him or injuring him.\" Mother also testified that she had a good relationship with Veronica, who was still married to Mother's brother. She saw Veronica and talked to her sometimes, but she did not see her on holidays because Mother did not go out on holidays; she just worked. Mother also testified that Veronica was not part of her support system any more, and that, after A.G.G. was injured, she quit turning to Veronica for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Morgan testified that Mother became overwhelmed and highly stressed when around the children. Morgan testified that Mother struggled because \"when she is with one [child] she can't seem to direct her attention to anything else and that's when the kids start roaming and moving around and doing other stuff.\" However, Mother cared for and loved her children, and her love for her children seemed genuine. Morgan testified that J.J.G. in particular was bonded with Mother, although she had not seen the other children cry for their mother. Furthermore, Mother was not homicidal, suicidal, or aggressive. Morgan characterized Mother's risk of violence to be \"very low or absent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Father had had much more limited interactions with the children. He had not engaged in regular visitation with the children and had not provided regular financial support. Father testified that he had seven children, three of whom were over eighteen and the youngest four of whom were the subjects of this case. He explained that, although he had been in a relationship with Mother for approximately seven years, he was married to another woman. He testified that until two years before trial he had been a loving father, but he had not assumed responsibility for the children. However, within the last two years, while the DFPS case was pending, he had become \"a little closer\" to the children and had taken responsibility for the expenses Mother incurred because of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Father stated that he had no concerns about any physical danger to the children if they were returned to Mother. He had never seen any indication that the older children, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G., were not well provided for when they lived with Mother. However, he also testified that he had concerns at one point regarding Veronica's care for A.G.G. that arose after he observed some small bruises or other minor injuries on A.G.G. He stated that, following A.G.G.'s hospitalization, he was not\n   initially involved in the DFPS case because he did not think that it involved him, and he had been told that he had nothing to do there. Father testified that he loved the children; he was concerned when he heard that A.G.G. was in the hospital; J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G. were all bonded with him; and A.G.G. was beginning to bond with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the time of trial, Father was living with his wife, a woman other than Mother. Father's wife had said that the children could not live in their home, but she had also stated that she would be willing to have two of the children live there. However, Father testified that he would move with the children somewhere alone, get an apartment, and provide them with stable housing if they were returned to him. He also testified that, during the pendency of this case, he had moved out of the home he shared with his wife, but he had subsequently moved back for financial reasons and because one of his older daughters was having problems. He testified that his oldest daughter's three children and his other two older children all lived in the home that he shared with his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These facts concerned DFPS. Franco cited Father's lack of active participation and lack of a \"desire to care for all four of his children,\" She also observed that Father did not \"have a place to go with all four children,\" so DFPS was concerned that he would simply return the children to Mother. DFPS was further concerned because Father did not attend a required permanency hearing on May 19, 2015. And he had attended only three out of approximately twenty-two scheduled visits with the children since he had been served in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, despite the fact that Franco had discussed his family service plan with him, Father failed to complete it. He did not provide verification to DFPS about his employment or housing. Father also failed to provide DFPS with certification of his participation in parenting classes, although he had indicated to Franco that \"he had done some of the classes ... [and] only had a few more of them to do.\" Father participated in the required psychosocial assessment, but he had not participated in family therapy. Morgan, the therapist, noted that Father attended several sessions with her and that Father was forthcoming and clear, and it appeared to Morgan that he \"wanted to work on a plan for the kids and [to] be clear about where he stood.\" Morgan opined that it was not possible for Father to parent all four children and \"he would be able to take [only] two.\" And she noted that he did not participate in any therapy with the children through Morgan's services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Regarding other potential caregivers or conservators for the children, Franco opined that both Veronica and another woman, Norma, whom Mother had identified as a placement for the children after A.G.G. was injured, were inappropriate caregivers for the children. DFPS had never been provided with appropriate contact information to speak with Veronica. And, although DFPS had placed A.G.G. with Norma for four months after he was injured, placement with Norma in the future would be inappropriate because there was an individual in Norma's home who had had a recent DWI arrest. No other potential caregivers for the children were identified. Franco opined that it was in the best interests of the children for parental rights to be terminated or for the children to remain in the custody of DFPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The master found that DFPS did not establish the grounds for termination of Mother's or Father's parental rights to the children. The master further found that DFPS did not meet its burden to obtain\n   permanent managing conservatorship of the children. The master ordered that Mother and Father be named joint managing conservators of the children and Mother be designated the primary joint managing conservator. And the master ordered that the children be immediately returned to their parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   DFPS then filed with the trial court a Motion to Stay the Return of the Children and a Motion for Reconsideration of the Master's Ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   By a final decree rendered on January 21, 2016, the trial court appointed DFPS as the permanent managing conservator of the children and denied Mother and Father possessory conservatorship, without terminating the parental rights of either Mother or Father. Specifically, the trial court held that DFPS \"did not prove a ground for termination and/or that termination is in the best interest of the subject children by clear and convincing evidence.\" However, it also found that (1) \"appointment of a parent or both parents as managing conservator would not be in the best interest of the children [J.J.G., L.K.G., H.A.G., and A.G.G.], because the appointment would significantly impair the children's physical health or emotional development\"; and (2) \"it would not be in the best interest of the children to appoint a relative of the children or another person as managing conservator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court refused to appoint either Mother or Father as a possessory conservator of the children because it found that \"such appointment would not be in the best interest of the children.\" The trial court entered additional orders with respect to Mother. It required her to \"complete a psychological evaluation and follow any and all recommendations\"; to \"maintain legal and verifiable employment\"; to \"refrain from engaging in any illegal criminal activities\"; to \"remain in contact or meet with caseworker at least one time per month to provide an update on services, child well-being, etc.\" throughout the time DFPS remained permanent managing conservator of the children; if available, to \"complete a special needs parenting class in Spanish that is at least six to eight weeks in length,\" or to \"identify and participate in a volunteer program through a nonprofit organization and/or medical facility aimed at assisting and/or caring for special needs children,\" and to complete twenty-five hours of volunteer service with that organization, with either program to be completed by July 15, 2016; to \"attend all non-emergency medical visits for her children,\" including \"medical appointments with any specialists and routine doctor visits\"; to \"obtain, pay for and maintain appropriate housing\" and to provide all pertinent information necessary to assess its appropriateness to her caseworker as provided in the order; to \"continue participating in family therapy sessions until successfully discharged by her therapist\"; to \"attend any and all scheduled visitations with the subject children\"; to \"develop a support system of at least three individuals\"; to \"contact the children at least one time per week on the phone number provided by the foster parents\"; and to \"provide minimum wage child support according to the guidelines set forth in the Texas Family Code to the children.\" Each of these provisions contained detailed instructions for its performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court entered similar additional orders with respect to Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court appointed DFPS as \"Sole Managing Conservator\" and ordered that DFPS have the rights of a sole managing conservator as stated in the final decree. It further ordered that the children \"continue in care\" and that \"this Court will continue to review the placement, progress and welfare of the children.\" Accordingly, it ordered\n   that the appointed attorney and guardian ad litem for the children be continued in that relationship \"for the purposes of representing the child[ren] at the Review Placement hearings that may be held after the final disposition of this suit as authorized by \u00a7 107.016, Texas Family Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Both parents timely appealed the trial court's final decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial Court's Conservatorship Determination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mother and Father both challenge the trial court's conservatorship determination, asserting that it erred in failing to name either parent as managing or possessory conservator and instead naming DFPS as the children's managing conservator.

The DFPS investigator averred that, at the time he was injured, A.G.G. had been under the care of several different caregivers including Mother, and Mother could not provide an explanation for A.G.G.'s injuries, which included brain bleeding, broken bones, and bruising. The DFPS investigator concluded that A.G.G.'s injuries constituted a \"non-accidental trauma\" and were \"consistent with abuse and/or neglect.\" Dr. Isaac diagnosed A.G.G. as \"a victim of abusive head trauma,\" noting that he had several skeletal injuries, two subdural hematomas,\n   a cerebral contusion on the left side of his head, significant retinal hemorrhages in both of his eyes, and scratches on his back. Dr. Isaac also testified that A.G.G. had suffered fractures to both legs, an injury to one of the bones within his left foot, and an impaction fracture on his right radius. The medical professionals and social workers who saw A.G.G. testified that his injuries could only have been intentionally inflicted by an adult, and the evidence demonstrated that the abuse occurred either while he was in Mother's care or in the care of a person with whom Mother left him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Furthermore, Mother failed to adequately explain the cause of A.G.G.'s repeated abuse. Mother identified several incidents as possible explanations for A.G.G.'s serious injuries. Mother told Dr. Isaac that, five days prior to his arrival at the hospital A.G.G., who had been strapped into his car seat, fell when the car seat dislodged while Mother was driving her car. According to Mother, A.G.G. had remained strapped in his car seat, was fine, and ate and drank properly afterwards. Mother also stated that, four days before he arrived at the hospital, A.G.G. had fallen off a bed while at home with Mother. Mother stated that she had consoled him after the fall and did not see any obvious changes to him at that time. Dr. Isaac concluded that neither of the incidents described by Mother could have caused A.G.G.'s subdural hematomas because they could not have generated the rapid acceleration and deceleration forces necessary to cause the hematomas that had occurred in his brain. Nor could these incidents have caused the retinal hemorrhaging found in A.G.G.'s eyes. Regarding A.G.G.'s leg fractures, Mother reported to Dr. Isaac that A.G.G. \"may have gotten [his] legs caught in [his] crib,\" but Dr. Isaac testified that such an occurrence would not have explained his leg injuries, which were more serious and intentional. In short, Mother's story was inconsistent with the evidence of A.G.G.'s injuries, which had occurred over a time that he was in her care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Regarding the other children, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G., the evidence demonstrated that, although they were all active and showed no signs of physical abuse at the time they were removed from Mother's care, they all had anemia and J.J.G. was underweight. Each child had his or her own \"unique special need.\" J.J.G. required speech therapy and participated in individual play therapy; L.K.G. required speech therapy and individual play therapy; H.A.G. required speech therapy, was not potty-trained, and required support services through school; and A.G.G. required continued treatment by an ophthalmologist, additional future surgery related to his eyes, and occupational, physical, and speech therapy. All of these needs were being met in the children's current placement, but Mother did not provide any evidence, beyond her mere assertions, that she could continue to meet these needs if the children were returned to her or Father. Thus, evidence of the emotional and physical needs of the children and of the emotional or physical danger to them if returned to the parents supports the trial court's determination here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Regarding Father, he and Mother both testified that he had not consistently been a part of the children's lives, had not provided them with regular financial support, and had not consistently visited with them or formed a bond with them. Father explained that, although he had been in a relationship with Mother for approximately seven years, he was married to another woman. At the time of trial, Father was living with his wife. She had said that the children could not live in their home, but she had also stated that she would be\n   willing to have two of the children live there. Father admitted that he left while Mother was pregnant with her first child, J.J.G., and that, after a brief reconciliation, he again left Mother after the second child, L.K.G., was born. Likewise, when Mother was three months pregnant with A.G.G.-i.e., in October 2012, when H.A.G. was four months old-he \"stayed away from her about three or four months,\" which would mean that he saw her in February 2013, a month before he moved to Mexico in March 2013. The record indicates that Father did not see Mother or the children between March 2013, two months before A.G.G. was born, and January 2014, two weeks before A.G.G. was injured. Finally, Father testified that had seen the children only six or seven times after they were taken into the custody of DFPS. This constitutes at least some evidence supporting the trial court's determination that he had neglected his children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Although the children in this case are quite young, it was also proper for the trial court to consider their desires and any evidence regarding their bond with their parents. Franco testified that J.J.G. and L.K.G., who were five years old and four years old respectively, did not want to go home to Mother or Father. Morgan likewise testified that only J.J.G. was bonded with his mother and that Father had not participated in any therapy with the children through her. The only testimony that the children desired to be removed from their placement in their foster home and returned to Mother came from Mother's own testimony and was directly contrary to Franco's testimony. And there was no evidence that any of the children desired to live with Father, who had had almost no contact with them, missed numerous scheduled visits with them, and testified he had no home to which to take them or could take only two, at most.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, no evidence indicates that Mother and Father had developed the parental abilities necessary to care for their special-needs children or that they had otherwise demonstrated an ability to provide the care and stability necessary for the children's wellbeing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9936354\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/544/367/#p371\">\n    544 S.W.2d at 371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mother and the two caregivers with whom she had left A.G.G. during the time that he endured life-threatening abuse remained suspects in an open criminal investigation at the time of trial. Although there was expert testimony that Mother's own aggressiveness and likelihood of hurting the children was low, she had made up stories to explain away each injury and identified the other suspect-caretakers as part of her support group. Moreover, there was limited evidence that she had any other support group or that she would not return the children to the same caregivers while she worked. Father showed up once at the hospital after A.G.G. was injured, but he stayed away afterwards and also failed to involve himself in the court proceedings that were initiated to investigate the children's circumstances on the ground that he was not involved with their care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It is also significant in this regard that Mother admitted that, apart from family therapy sessions, she had had only supervised contact with the children for two hours a month since their removal from her home more than two years before trial. Morgan, Mother's therapist, testified that Mother became overwhelmed and highly stressed when around all four children. Also, Mother struggled because \"when she is with one [child] she can't seem to direct her attention to anything else and that's when the kids start roaming and moving around and doing other stuff,\" even though she cared for and loved her children, and her love for her children seemed genuine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   At the time of trial, Mother had not moved to housing suitable for the children, although she testified she had put down a deposit on a two-bedroom apartment. She worked full-time, previously at night and, at that time, \"mornings.\" She had made no day care arrangements for the children beyond visiting one near her home, although she intended to place them in day care. Mother did not identify an adequate support system, and Franco testified DFPS was concerned that she had none, other than the previous caregivers she had used, who were likewise suspects in the investigation into A.G.G.'s injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Franco stated that DFPS was concerned about Mother's judgment in terms of the children's care, including Mother's decision to leave the children with inappropriate caregivers and Mother's excuses for A.G.G.'s injuries as being due to his falling in his car seat or falling off the bed. Franco also testified that DFPS was likewise concerned about awarding possession of the children to Father because of fears that he would simply return the children to Mother and because he had not actively participated in the children's lives, lacked a desire to care for all four of his children, and did not have a place to go with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Franco also testified that Mother and Father had not completed their family service plans. Mother was required to participate in and successfully complete individual therapy. Franco had referred Mother for more therapy to work on her parenting skills, and Mother was still participating in that therapy at the time of trial. Although Mother had completed her required psychosocial evaluation and required parenting classes, she continued to work on implementing the parenting skills she had learned.

DFPS then filed an Emergency Motion to Stay the Return Home of the Children and a Motion for Reconsideration of the Master's Ruling with the trial court, which then appointed DFPS as the permanent managing conservator of the children and denied M.G. and J.R.G. possessory conservatorship.

Isaac noted that the subdural hematomas were \"markers of [a] head injury,\" caused by \"acceleration/decelerations forces\" applied to A.G.G., i.e., \"the child's head [was] mov[ed] very rapidly and then stop[ped] suddenly.\" In other words, someone could have \"shak[en]\" him or \"shak[en]\" and \"throw[n] [him] onto a bed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Dr. Isaac noted that M.G. indicated that on January 18, 2014, five days prior to his arrival at the hospital, A.G.G., who had been \"strapped\" into his car seat, \"fell\" when the car seat \"dislodged\" while M.G. was driving her car (the \"car seat incident\"). A.G.G., however, remained safely \"strapped within the car seat\" during the incident, was \"fine,\" and properly ate and drank afterwards. M.G. also stated that on January 19, 2014, four days prior to his arrival at the hospital, A.G.G. fell off of a bed while at home with M.G. M.G. had \"consoled\" him after the fall and did not see any \"obvious changes\" to him at that time. Isaac explained that neither of these incidents would have caused A.G.G.'s subdural hematomas because they could not have generated \"the rapid acceleration and deceleration\" forces necessary \"to cause the hematomas that [had] occurred in his brain.\" Likewise, these incidents could not have caused the \"retinal hemorrhaging\" found in A.G.G.'s eyes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Isaac, it would have been impossible for a parent, such as M.G. or J.R.G., to have been able to detect the \"retinal hemorrhaging.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   M.G. also told Dr. Isaac that on January 21, 2014, two days prior to his arrival at the hospital, A.G.G., after he had \"returned home\" from the care of a \"babysitter,\" cried for \"prolonged periods of time and [was] irritable.\" Although irritability could be \"consistent with a head injury,\" Isaac explained that A.G.G. also had, at the time, a cough, which could have been the source of his \"irritability.\" However, when A.G.G. \"started vomiting\" two days later, on January 23, 2014, M.G. took him to a hospital, which Isaac opined was an \"appropriate\" action for a parent, like M.G., to take at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Dr. Isaac further testified that A.G.G. had suffered \"fractures\" to both of his \"distal tibias,\" namely, \"the long bones of the legs near the ankles,\" \"sclerosis or an injury to one of the bones within his ... left foot,\" and \"an impaction fracture on his right radius.\" The fractures to the tibias, approximately \"7 to 10 days old,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   likely occurred at the same time, as the result of \"a direct ... application of force in a twisting motion.\" Isaac opined that the force that caused the fractures was greater than the force required for the \"normal care of a child.\" Although M.G. reported to Isaac that A.G.G. had \"gotten [his] legs caught in [his] crib,\" Isaac explained that such an occurrence would not have caused A.G.G.'s leg injuries, which were more \"serious\" and \"[i]ntentionally done.\" And Isaac noted that A.G.G. had been seen by his primary care physician a week prior to his arrival at the hospital and that physician was not able to identify the tibia fractures. Accordingly, Isaac would not have expected \"a layperson,\" such as a parent, to have discovered the fractures either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Finally, Dr. Isaac opined that A.G.G.'s siblings likely did not cause any of his injuries, with the possible exception of \"some of the bruises\" or \"scratches on [his] back,\" which were \"superficial\" in nature. A.G.G.'s injuries were \"serious,\" would have been caused by \"significant force,\" and were likely caused by an adult. Isaac could not say \"who\" had specifically injured A.G.G., but she opined that it was likely \"a caregiver.\" M.G. reported to Isaac that in addition to herself, her sister-in-law, Veronica, and her friend, Nelly, had cared for A.G.G. during the five days prior to his arrival at the hospital. Ultimately, Isaac opined that A.G.G. had suffered from a \"non-accidental trauma\" and \"child abuse,\" and A.G.G. \"could have died,\" had M.G. not sought treatment for her son. She further noted that A.G.G.'s siblings were examined by the medical staff at the hospital and found to be healthy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   DFPS caseworker Nicole Franco, who was assigned to the children's case in January 2015, testified that she had seen the children seven times prior to trial. And M.G. had indicated to Franco that \"three individuals,\" herself, Veronica, and Nelly, had had access to A.G.G. during the time that he was likely injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In regard to the children, Franco explained that each child has his or her own \"needs.\" For instance, J.J.G. currently \"requires speech therapy\" and \"participates in individual play therapy\"; L.K.G. requires \"[s]peech therapy and individual play therapy\"; H.A.G. \"requires speech therapy,\" is not \"potty trained,\" and requires \"PPCD,\" which is a \"[s]upport service[ ] through ... school\"; and A.G.G. requires \"continue[d] treatment\" by an ophthalmologist, additional surgery \"around the age of five\" related to his\n   eyes, and \"occupational, physical, and speech therapy.\" Franco noted that J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G., when they entered into the care of DFPS, showed no \"sign[s]\" of physical abuse. Although the older children were later \"diagnosed with anemia\" and J.J.G. was considered to be \"under weight,\" Franco explained that such issues were not \"severe\" and would not have served as grounds to remove the children from M.G.'s care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franco further noted that J.J.G. and L.K.G., who were five years old and four years old at the time, respectively, did not \"want to go home to\" M.G. or J.R.G. And she opined that it is in the best interest of the children for \"parental rights to be terminated\" or \"[f]or the children to remain in the custody\" of DFPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In regard to J.R.G., Franco noted that she had discussed his Family Service Plan (\"FSP\") with him, but he had not provided \"verification\" to DFPS about his employment or housing. Franco had actually visited J.R.G.'s home though, noting that the \"structure of the home\" that J.R.G. shares with his wife, a woman other than M.G., satisfies DFPS. However, according to Franco, J.R.G.'s \"wife does not want the children there\" and \"doesn't want to take the responsibility of caring for [the] children.\" Franco further noted that J.R.G. did not attend a required \"permanency hearing on May 19, 2015.\" And he had attended only three out of approximately twenty-two scheduled visits with the children since the time that he was served in the instant case. J.R.G. also failed to provide DFPS with certification of his participation in parenting classes, although he had indicated to Franco that \"he had done some of the classes ... [and] only had a few more of them to do.\" Moreover, although J.R.G. did \"participate[ ] in [the required] psychosocial assessment,\" he had not yet \"participated in family therapy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Franco cited J.R.G.'s lack of \"active[ ] participat[ion]\" and a lack of \"a desire to care for all four of his children\" as the reason DFPS did not want the children returned to him. And Franco expressed concern that J.R.G. had not \"consistently been a part of the children's lives,\" had not \"provided them with financial support,\" and had not \"consistently visited with them or formed a bond with them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Franco further testified, in regard to M.G., that she, under her FSP, was required to \"participa[te] in and successfully complete individual therapy.\" M.G., who was initially \"discharged\" from \"individual therapy sessions,\" was, at the time of trial, still participating in therapy at the request of DFPS. M.G. had also completed her required \"psychosocial evaluation,\" completed her required parenting classes, and provided DFPS with certification of her completion of her classes. And M.G. continued to work on implementing the parenting \"skills\" she learned during her \"family therapy sessions\" with the children. When Franco last visited with M.G., approximately one month before trial, M.G. indicated that she would soon be \"transition[ing]\" into a two-bedroom apartment. And she noted that if the children were returned to her, she \"intended to use a day care center\" while she was at work. Franco also noted that M.G. had \"consistently\" attended her visits with the children and had \"no CPS or criminal history.\" Further, M.G. had provided DFPS with \"pay stubs\" to verify her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Franco, who admittedly had\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   observed any of M.G.'s scheduled visits with the children nor attended any of the family's therapy sessions, cited M.G.'s judgment in terms of \"the children's care,\" including her decision to \"[l]eav[e] the[ ] [children] with inappropriate caregivers,\" the car seat incident, and the \"falling off the bed\" incident involving A.G.G., as the reason why DFPS did not want to the children returned to M.G. And Franco noted the there was still an \"open\" law enforcement investigation related to the injuries to A.G.G. However, Franco admitted that M.G. has willingly spoken with law enforcement officers about A.G.G.'s injuries and willingly spoken with \"the social worker at the hospital\" and other DFPS investigators regarding A.G.G. And Franco noted that M.G. has\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   \"been charged ... for [a] crime\" related to A.G.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Finally, Franco opined that both Veronica, M.G.'s sister-in-law, and another woman, Norma, were \"inappropriate\" caregivers for the children. It appears from the record that M.G. had suggested Norma as a possible placement for the children after A.G.G. was injured, but Franco asserted at trial that M.G.'s suggestion was not \"appropriate\" because \"[t]here was an individual in [Norma's] home who had a [recent] DWI.\" On cross-examination, however, Franco admitted that DFPS, while acting as temporary managing conservator of the children, had\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   \"placed\" A.G.G. with Norma for \"[f]our months\" after he was injured. And while placed with Norma, A.G.G. had not been \"injured\" and his needs had been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In regard to Veronica, Franco's concerns, as expressed at trial, seem to center on her possible role in injuring A.G.G., that DFPS \"has never been provided with appropriate contact information to speak with [her],\" and that M.G. has not expressed \"concern[ ]\" about previously leaving the children in Veronica's care. On cross-examination, however, Franco admitted that a \"CPS investigator\" had actually \"spoke[n] to Veronica\" and DFPS had \"actually approved placement of the children\" with Veronica after A.G.G. was injured. In fact, after a visit to Veronica's home, DFPS had \"no safety concerns\" about Veronica, and Franco noted that Veronica has \"no criminal or CPS history,\" has her own children, and DFPS had gone so far as to complete \"[a] background check\" on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Dianne Del Sol, the owner of the day-care facility that the children currently attend, testified that when J.J.G., who was almost four years old at the time, began attending the facility, he was \"very shy,\" \"not capable of having social interactions with the rest of the children,\" \"spoke very little English,\" \"did not know his shapes, colors, [or] numbers,\" \"did not know how to write his name,\" and was not \"potty trained.\" However, he \"could speak Spanish,\" was \"verbal in the Spanish language,\" and did not have a \"speech delay.\" Del Sol also opined that there was \"nothing wrong\" with the fact that J.J.G. was \"withdrawn to himself\" and that he liked to \"do[ ] his own activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Del Sol further testified that, initially, L.K.G., who was almost three years old at the time, had \"emotional outburst[s]\" and \"would cry for no reason.\" And H.A.G., who was \"less than two years old\" when she started at the day-care facility, was \"difficult to deal with.\" She would \"sit there and just cry with her mouth hanging open and slobber dro[o]ling down,\" and she could not be consoled. Del Sol noted, however, that such behavior could have been occurring because H.A.G. missed her mother. Del Sol opined that it would have been \"stressful\" on the children at the time to have been taken away from M.G., the \"only mother\" that they had ever known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In regard to A.G.G., who was less than one year old when he began attending the day-care facility, he did not have crying \"outbursts\" and \"easily interact[ed] with the other children.\" However, he \"had a very difficult time walking and his vision is impaired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Del Sol explained that, while in the care of DFPS, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G. have received speech therapy and A.G.G. has received therapy for \"walking.\" And the children, at the time of trial, were no longer experiencing any delays in development. J.J.G. is \"very outgoing,\" \"[s]peaks well,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"knows his colors, shapes, [and] numbers.\" L.K.G. is \"doing well,\" \"does her class work,\" and \"interacts with her friends.\" H.A.G. \"still has a lot of ... emotional distress,\" but \"[n]ot nearly to the [same] extent.\" And A.G.G. is \"very well adjusted,\" although he \"struggles with [his] vision\" and \"his walking is a little uneven,\" which requires him to be watched \"very closely.\" Del Sol acknowledged, however, that A.G.G. is also a \"small toddler\" who is simply \"not steady on his feet.\" And the children, in general, are not \"difficult to keep up with.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Gabriela Morgan, a psychotherapist with Valentia Bilingual Therapy Services, PLLC, testified that M.G., while this case was pending, had attended both individual counseling and family therapy sessions with her, approximately once a week, for more than a year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some of M.G.'s scheduled visits with the children had also taken place \"through [Morgan's] service.\" And, at the time of trial, she was still conducting family therapy sessions with M.G. and the children. Morgan opined that J.J.G. was \"bonded\" with M.G., although she had not seen the other children \"cry for\" their mother. And she explained that M.G. has \"consistent[ly]\" and \"time[ly]\" attended all of her therapy sessions and her \"behavior in the session[s] [is] cooperative and attentive.\" In fact, in her therapy notes, Morgan describes M.G. as \"very active and responsive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   M.G. initially told Morgan that she had \"[n]o idea\" \"how [A.G.G.] got hurt\" and A.G.G. had \"just woke[n] up crying, which was unlike him and [she] took him to the doctor.\" However, over time, as M.G. progressed in therapy, she indicated to Morgan that she believes that Veronica hurt A.G.G.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   This concerned Morgan because M.G., two or three months prior to trial, had also indicated that her relationship with Veronica was \"close,\" \"they talk[ed] a lot,\" and Veronica was \"one of her support systems.\" Notably though, Morgan contradicted this testimony, stating at trial that she would not be concerned if \"Veronica was identified as the prim[ary] support for [M.G.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Morgan further testified that M.G. \"has not said anything\" or done \"anything\" that has \"caused [her] to believe\" that M.G. caused A.G.G.'s injuries. In fact, M.G. had repeatedly denied injuring A.G.G., and Morgan noted that \"the possibility of [M.G.] having been the one to hurt her\n   child [ ] is\n   <em>\n    low.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) And in her therapy notes, Morgan indicates that M.G. had denied \"any kind of domestic violence in the home\" and \"ha[d] no history of assaultive behavior\" or \"self[-]injurious behavior.\" Morgan further opined that M.G. is \"not homicidal,\" \"suicidal,\" or \"aggressive.\" And her \"risk of VIOLENCE\" to be \"VERY LOW or absent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In regard to M.G.'s ability to care for the children, Morgan testified that she does become \"overwhelmed\" and \"highly stressed\" when around the children. And \"when [M.G.] is with one [child] she can't seem to direct her attention to anything else and that's when the kids start roaming and moving around and doing other stuff.\" However, M.G. \"cares [for] and loves\" her children, and her \"love for her children seems genuine.\" And M.G. was \"devastated\" by A.G.G.'s injuries. On cross-examination, Morgan admitted that although she feels that M.G. \"become[s] very overwhelmed when she has all four [children],\" caring for four young children would be difficult for \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   mother.\" (Emphasis added.) And there are no \"clinical reasons\" that would impair M.G. from being able to parent the children. Further, when Morgan discussed with M.G. the possibility of changing her work schedule in order to accommodate the children's schedules better, M.G. \"stated that she would be able to do that so she could have a day care provider during the day,\" rather than working at night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Morgan also explained that she initially \"discharged\" M.G. from individual therapy on July 28, 2014, noting that the \"discharge\" was \"regular,\" and M.G. was \"done\" with therapy. In other words, Morgan \"had set some [therapy] goals\" for M.G., and M.G. \"had achieved those goals\" and \"made progress.\" And at the time of M.G.'s initial discharge, Morgan did not \"see any[thing] prohibit[ing]\" M.G. from \"parenting her children.\" However, when DFPS subsequently referred M.G. back to her for \"more therapy,\" M.G. willingly complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In January 2015, Morgan noted that M.G. had \"progressed with communicating and asserting herself\" and M.G. believed that it is \"her responsibility to take care of her children.\" Further, M.G. had \"identif[ied] changes needed in her routine structure and support system in order to show that she's able to manage taking care of her children[ ].\" And M.G. has \"made progress\" while working with Morgan. Morgan's main \"concern\" for M.G. was her lack of a \"support system.\" However, she noted that her concerns would be alleviated if M.G. secured a day-care program for the children or if M.G. secured \"responsible adults\" to \"take care of the children\" while she is at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In regard to J.R.G., Morgan noted that she began seeing him, both individually and with M.G. for \"joint session[s],\" in 2014. Morgan could not recall how many times that J.R.G. had seen her individually, but she estimated that he had attended more than five joint sessions with M.G. and her notes reflect that he was \"consistent in attending all sessions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   During their joint sessions, J.R.G. was \"forthcoming\" and \"clear,\" and it appeared to Morgan that he \"wanted to work on a plan for the kids and [to] be clear about where he stood.\" Morgan opined that it is not possible for J.R.G. to \"parent\" \"all four\" children, but \"he would be able to take two.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   M.G. testified that she met J.R.G. in November 2008 and became pregnant with J.J.G. in 2009. At that time, she was not aware that J.R.G. was married to another woman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   While she was pregnant, she saw J.R.G. \"every now and then,\" and she \"stopped seeing him\" for a period of time because \"he left\" \"[t]o work.\" He provided no support for M.G. before or during her pregnancy with J.J.G. After J.J.G. was born on March 3, 2010, M.G. saw J.R.G. \"more frequently\" and she became pregnant with L.K.G., who was born on March 5, 2011. Although J.R.G. did not provide M.G. with any financial assistance before or during her pregnancy with L.K.G., she continued to see him. After H.A.G. was born on June 7, 2012, J.R.G. \"started to help\" M.G. because she \"told him he really needed to help\" as \"there were more children, more expenses, and more responsibility.\" She explained that she had not previously asked J.R.G. for financial assistance because she had been working and was not having financial difficulty. After the birth of H.A.G., J.R.G. gave M.G. approximately $400 to $500 every month, \"to pay [her] rent or [for] things that [she] needed,\" and he has \"continued to pay [her] rent\" since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   M.G. explained that while she was pregnant with A.G.G., J.R.G., in March 2013, told her that he had to \"move[ ] to Mexico,\" but he continued to send her money \"[s]ometimes,\" \"[l]ike [for] about five months.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, after A.G.G. was born on May 31, 2013, M.G. saw J.R.G. in January 2014, prior to A.G.G. being injured. Although she and the children did not \"see\" J.R.G. from March 2013 to January 2014, she spoke to him by telephone \"every three days.\" When J.R.G. returned in January 2014, he \"support[ed]\" her again with $400 to $450 per month continuously. Further, M.G. noted that since she and J.R.G. signed an \"Irrevocable Children's Protective Services Mediated Settlement Agreement\" in February 2015, J.R.G. has been providing her with $1,500 a month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   M.G. opined that J.R.G. is a \"good father,\" who \"loves the children\" and \"pays attention to them.\" However, she admitted that it was not \"responsible\" for him to \"disappear for long periods of time,\" which indicates that he is not \"there for his children.\" And when J.R.G. does visit the children, it is usually for \"two or three hours,\" once or twice a week. During his visits, he watches movies with the children, plays with them, and devotes time to them. In regard to J.J.G. specifically, J.R.G. had visited him \"[m]any\" times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   M.G. noted that she is employed as a cook at a restaurant, where she has worked for the past seven years. Earning between $550 and $600 every two weeks, she works in the mornings thirty-five to forty hours per week. M.G. had previously worked at night from approximately 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. However, if the children are returned to her, she will continue to work \"[j]ust mornings.\" During the week prior to trial, she had worked thirty-nine hours, and she had Friday and Sunday \"off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   M.G. further testified that her monthly expenses include $435 for rent, $120 for\n   food, $200 for a car payment, $80 for electricity, $80 for gas, and $60 for her telephone. She has also put down a deposit for a two-bedroom apartment and is \"getting ready to move.\" And she had \"looked into day care\" for the children, specifically, Sharpstown Day Care, which the children would attend while she works. M.G. also noted that if the children are returned to her, she will be \"pick[ing] them up from school, bath[ing] them, [and] help [ing] them on their home work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Prior to the children entering into the care of DFPS, either M.G.'s sister-in-law, Veronica, her friend, Nelly, or another woman, Ramona, took care of the children while M.G. worked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   And M.G. cared for the children when she was not at work. In the two weeks prior to A.G.G. being injured, both Veronica and Nelly, in addition to M.G., had cared for A.G.G., and J.R.G. had also seen the children during those two weeks. And although J.R.G. likely saw the children \"a week before\" A.G.G. was injured, he was \"[a]lmost never\" alone with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moreover, in the beginning of January, M.G., noticing that A.G.G. had returned from Veronica's care with a bruise and a scrape, \"thought [that] he might have fallen.\" The bruise on his forehead was the size of \"a dime,\" and Veronica had told her that the scrape had come from \"the carpet.\" The master admitted into evidence medical records that show that A.G.G.'s primary care physician saw him a week before M.G. took him to the hospital, and the physician noted in his report that A.G.G. was not in \"apparent distress\" and was \"well nourished\" and \"well developed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   M.G. agreed that A.G.G. had suffered serious injuries in this case, \"whoever caused those injuries ... should be punished,\" and A.G.G. had been in the care of Veronica, Nelly, and herself during the relevant time period. Thus, she concluded that \"one of the three\" of them had injured A.G.G. However, M.G. denied \"shak[ing]\" A.G.G. and \"twist[ing] his ankles,\" noting that she had \"never harmed any of [her] children.\" She spoke \"tw[o] or three times\" to law enforcement officers about A.G.G.'s injuries, and she \"think[s]\" that Veronica hurt A.G.G. M.G. is also aware that A.G.G. \"has to have very special care now\" and will require additional surgery related to his eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   M.G. noted that she had a \"[g]ood\" relationship with Veronica, who was still married to M.G.'s brother. However, M.G. stated that Veronica is not part of her support system \"anymore,\" and since A.G.G. was injured, she does not \"turn [ ] to Veronica for help,\" rather, she \"just talk[s] to her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Before the children entered into the care of DFPS, a typical day with them, when M.G. was not working, consisted of her making the children breakfast, \"go [ing] to the store to run ... errands\" with them, and \"visit[ing] with [her] little\n   cousins where [the] children like[d] to go to visit so they could play.\" M.G. cooked for the children, bathed them, \"watch[ed] movies with them,\" \"play[ed] and dance[d] with them,\" and \"sang with them.\" She described the children as \"very active and very happy with [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   When M.G. sees the children now during scheduled visits, she brings them food or gifts, and the children display affection towards her. \"They are very loving\" towards her and tell her, \"[M]ommy we love you. I love you.... We want to go with you.\" According to M.G., Franco, the DFPS caseworker, has never been present for any of her visits with the children. And M.G., in addition to any therapy sessions she has with the children, has only been allowed, at the behest of DFPS, to see the children for two hours per month since they entered into the care of DFPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In regard to M.G., the master admitted into evidence a \"2054 Psychological Evaluation\" report, dated October 22, 2014, stating that M.G. \"denie[d] any current alcohol or drug use\" and \"denied all criterion depression symptoms except for sadness because of [the removal of] her children.\" The report also states that M.G. has \"no report[ed] ... psychiatric history,\" \"no suicidal or self-injurious ideation and no intent or plan,\" \"[n]o criterion symptoms of bipolar manic phase,\" \"no generalized anxiety,\" no reported \"[p]anic [d]isorder,\" no reported obsessive compulsive disorder, \"[n]o criterion symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder,\" \"[n]o criteri[on] symptoms\" of \"[t]hought [d]isorder/[p]sychosis,\" and no reported \"[h]allucinosis.\" M.G.'s \"hygiene appeared reasonably tended to,\" and throughout the evaluation, she maintained \"good\" eye contact, her \"[a]ttitude was open and cooperative,\" and her \"effort level during [the] interview and mental status testing was good.\" The report also notes that M.G.'s \"[t]hought [p]rocess\" is \"logical,\" \"coherent,\" and \"goal-directed.\" And she had a \"positive interaction\" with the examiner. M.G.'s \"[p]rognosis\" was determined to be \"GOOD\"; she did not \"demonstrate any signs or symptoms of a psychological condition\"; she had \"no serious levels of depression, anxiety, or hopelessness\"; her \"results, when matched against non-patient female norms, indicated no significant psychological distress in any domain\"; and she was not diagnosed with a \"psychiatric illness\" or a \"personality disorder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   J.R.G. testified that he has seven children, the youngest four of which are the subject of the instant case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that although he has been in a relationship with M.G. for approximately seven years, he is married to another woman. Until two years ago, J.R.G. was \"a loving father,\" but he did not assume responsibility for the children. However, before the children entered into DFPS's care, he was \"becoming more involved\" in their lives because he \"wanted\" to \"take care\" of them. Within the last two years, J.R.G. has become \"a little closer\" to the children and has taken \"responsib [ility] for the expenses [that M.G.] incurs because of the children.\" For instance, for the last two years, he has been \"giving [M.G.] ... money for [her] rent\" and $1,500 for the four months prior to trial in accordance with an Irrevocable Children's Protective Services Mediated Settlement Agreement, which he signed. J.R.G. noted that he began providing M.G. with financial assistance after she requested it, and he has no concerns about \"any physical danger\" to the children if they are returned to M.G. He has never seen any indication that the older children, J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G., were not \"well provided for\" when they lived with M.G. And\n   J.R.G. indicated that he would continue to stay involved in the children's lives and support them if they are returned to M.G. He is currently employed, installing wood flooring, and he is paid $2,400 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   J.R.G. admitted that he left while M.G. was pregnant with J.J.G. However, he now does not \"know what was going on in [his] head\" at the time. He also admitted to leaving M.G. after L.K.G. was born. J.R.G. explained that when M.G. was \"three months pregnant\" with A.G.G., he \"stayed away from her [for] about three or four months.\" However, he began seeing her again in November 2013 and onward, although \"not frequently.\" And while he was \"away,\" he continued to send her money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   J.R.G. was aware that both Veronica and Nelly cared for the children while M.G. was at work. He explained that he became concerned about A.G.G. in \"early\" January when he saw on A.G.G.'s face a bruise, \"[s]maller than a dime,\" and a \"small\" \"scratch\" or \"scrape\" about \"the size of a dime.\" J.R.G. thought that the bruise and scratch could have happened by \"accident\" because the children \"jump around\" A.G.G., and he has told them in the past to be careful. And neither the bruise nor the scratch caused J.R.G. to \"fear that [A.G.G.'s] physical and emotional well being were in danger.\" He did, however, tell M.G. to ask Veronica to be more careful when she cared for A.G.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   After M.G. took A.G.G. to a hospital on January 23, 2014, J.R.G. arrived \"the following day,\" but he did not learn of DFPS's involvement until \"two or three days later,\" when M.G. told him that \"she was going to be investigated.\" He told \"[e]verybody\" at the hospital that he was A.G.G.'s father. And although he had \"tried to talk to someone\" to \"tell them or let them know that [he] could pick up [the] children,\" whomever he spoke with informed him that he \"couldn't do anything.\" Further, DFPS has never interviewed him about A.G.G.'s injuries. J.R.G. explained that he was not initially involved in the instant case because he did not \"think\" it pertained to him and he had been told that he \"had nothing to do.\" He has seen the children \"six or seven times\" since they have entered into the care of DFPS, and DFPS and the foster parents have \"canceled\" appointments with him on certain occasions. J.R.G. stated that he loves the children, he was \"concerned\" when he heard that A.G.G. was in the hospital, and J.J.G., L.K.G., and H.A.G. are \"bonded\" with him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Currently, J.R.G. lives with his wife, who has said that all of the children cannot live in their home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, J.R.G. \"would move with [the] children\" somewhere \"alone,\" \"get an apartment,\" and provide them with \"stable housing\" if they are returned to him. J.R.G. explained that although, during the pendency of this case, he had \"moved\" out of the home that he shared with his wife, he subsequently moved back into the home for financial reasons and because one of his daughters was having \"problems.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.R.G. agreed that it was not \"a good situation to bring four children into th[e] world when [he was] married to somebody else,\" but stated that the children are \"here\" now and he has \"to take care of them.\" Further, he had provided his three oldest children with food, shelter, and education, does not have a criminal record, and has \"[a]lways\" worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In regard to A.G.G., J.R.G. does not know who \"broke [A.G.G.'s] ankles\" or who \"shook [A.G.G.] so hard [that] he got multiple brain bleeds.\" He is very \"concern[ed]\" about what happened to A.G.G., noting that his since birth, M.G. had been taking A.G.G. to a doctor \"regularly,\" including the week before she took him to the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   And J.R.G. visited M.G. \"three times\" in January prior to A.G.G. being injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   J.R.G. further testified that he attended therapy sessions and has seen Morgan \"[a]bout six times,\" including four individual sessions and two joint sessions with M.G. He also completed the required psychosocial evaluation, and J.R.G. noted that he has had only one \"face-to-face\" meeting with Franco, the DFPS caseworker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The standard of review for the appointment of a non-parent as sole managing conservator is less stringent than the standard of review for the termination of parental rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.A.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8397777\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/243/611/#p616\">\n    243 S.W.3d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616 (Tex. 2007) ;\n   <em>\n    In re A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094825\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/394/633/#p644\">\n    394 S.W.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (Tex.

And Dr. Isaac again testified that the car seat incident would not have caused any of the injuries for which A.G.G. was evaluated at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   DFPS also expressed concern at trial about M.G.'s past judgment in leaving the children with individuals whom DFPS characterized as \"inappropriate caregivers,\" specifically Norma and Veronica. Although Franco characterized Norma as an \"[in]appropriate\" selection for a caregiver, DFPS\n   <em>\n    actually placed\n   </em>\n   A.G.G. with Norma\n   for a period of \"[f]our months\" after he was injured, and the record reflects that his needs were met by Norma and he sustained no additional injuries in her care. This significantly undermines Franco's assertion that M.G. acted inappropriately in her selection of Norma as a potential caregiver for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In regard to Veronica, DFPS's concern is not unjustified, given that she is one of three individuals, other than M.G. and her friend, Nelly, who had an opportunity to injure A.G.G. However, M.G.'s original decision to have Veronica care for the children while she was at work was not necessarily inappropriate, given that Veronica is her sister-in-law, has children of her own, and has \"no criminal or CPS history.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, DFPS \"\n   <em>\n    actually approved\n   </em>\n   placement of the children\" with Veronica after A.G.G. had been injured, completed \"[a] background check\" on her, and had \"no safety concerns\" after a visit to her home. (Emphasis added.) All which indicate that at least on the surface, Veronica does not appear to be an inappropriate caregiver selection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   It is imperative to note that the en banc majority criticizes M.G.'s decision to leave A.G.G. in the care of either her friend, Nelly, or her sister-in-law, Veronica, and it considers such a decision to be a \"specific act [ ] or omission[ ]\" that demonstrates an award of custody to the M.G. would result in physical or emotional harm to the children. However, there is no evidence that M.G. was aware, prior to A.G.G. sustaining injuries, that there was a risk that A.G.G. would have been harmed in the care of either Nelly or Veronica-a woman with children of her own, with \"\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   criminal or CPS history,\" who DFPS \"\n   <em>\n    actually approved\n   </em>\n   placement of the children\" with after A.G.G. was injured. (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Further, although some witnesses testified regarding their concerns about Veronica's current and future role in M.G.'s life as a \"support system[ ],\" the record reveals that M.G. has accepted the fact that Veronica likely injured A.G.G. And she testified that Veronica is not a part of her support system \"anymore,\" she does not \"turn[ ] to Veronica for help\" since A.G.G. was injured, and although Veronica is still married to M.G.'s brother, she does not see her on holidays.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re S.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12371584\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/508/482/#p489\">\n    508 S.W.3d at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The material time to consider is the\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9975304\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/829/373/#p376\">\n    829 S.W.2d at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (link between parent's conduct and harm to child \"may not be based on evidence which raises a mere surmise or speculation of possible harm\").

M.G. repeatedly told Morgan, her therapist of more than a year, that \"she did not hurt\" A.G.G., and M.G. \"has not said anything\" or done \"anything\" that has \"caused [Morgan] to believe\" that M.G. caused A.G.G.'s injuries. In her therapy notes, Morgan opines that \"the possibility of [M.G.] having been the one to hurt her child[ ] is\n   <em>\n    low.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Morgan further characterized M.G. as being \"devastated\" by what happened to A.G.G., and she noted that M.G. \"cares [for] and loves\" the children. At trial, M.G. specifically denied \"shak[ing]\" A.G.G. and \"twist[ing] his ankles,\" and she testified that she has \"never harmed any of [her] children.\" M.G. has willingly spoken with law enforcement officers, \"the social worker at the hospital,\" and other DFPS investigators about A.G.G.'s injuries. And M.G. has never \"been charged\" with \"[a] crime\" related to A.G.G.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Dr. Isaac noted that M.G. acted \"appropriate[ly]\" in seeking medical treatment for A.G.G. once his symptoms moved beyond \"irritability,\" which could have been related to nothing more than his cough. And since A.G.G.'s birth, M.G. has consistently taken him to doctor's appointments for \"[w]ell child check[s],\" for immunizations, and when he was experiencing coughing and \"[w]heezing.\" In fact, A.G.G. was seen by his primary care physician a week prior to his arrival at the hospital, and the physician did not detect any signs of abuse on the child.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re R.D.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497622\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/51/314/#p321\">\n    51 S.W.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (Tex.
