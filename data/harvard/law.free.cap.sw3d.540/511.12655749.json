It presents five points on appeal arguing that the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict and in granting Thomas's motion for a new trial after jury verdict. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
