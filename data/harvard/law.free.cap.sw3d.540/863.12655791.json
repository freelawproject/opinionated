Nickell raised only one point on appeal that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the admission of the transcripts of his online conversations because the transcripts violated the best evidence rule. Specifically, Nickell contends that the transcripts admitted into evidence were copied from Facebook messages\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   the emojis and thus were not an exact or true reflection of the conversation. For reasons explained more fully in a memorandum\n   provided to the parties, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
