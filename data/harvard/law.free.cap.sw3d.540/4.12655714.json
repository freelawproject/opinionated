Steven Stafford, P.J., W.S.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After the death of the original plaintiff while this case was pending, a timely motion for substitution was filed to substitute the original plaintiff's parents as the real party in interest pursuant to Rule 25.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion indicated that the original plaintiff's parents were her only heirs and that no estate was to be opened for the original plaintiff in her home state of Missouri. The defendant filed an objection to the substitution asserting that the original plaintiff's heirs were not the proper parties, but the trial court eventually allowed parents to be substituted as plaintiffs. After the parties became aware that an estate had been opened for the original plaintiff in Missouri, defendant filed a motion to dismiss based upon non-compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104, which requires a showing that no person is willing to administer the estate of a deceased party before his or her heirs may revive a claim. Parents filed a response in opposition and, in the alternative, a motion for enlargement of time to file a motion to substitute the original plaintiff's personal representative. The trial court denied the motion for enlargement of time and granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. Because parents have shown excusable neglect sufficient to justify an enlargement of time under Rule 6.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 19, 2012, Plaintiff Katherine C. Dubis filed a complaint against Defendant/Appellee Yolanda E. Loyd related to an automobile accident. Ms. Dubis alleged that Ms. Loyd rear-ended her car while she was travelling through Tennessee from Missouri, her home state. Ms. Dubis sought $185,000.00 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 23, 2013, Amica Mutual Insurance Company (\"Amica Mutual\"), Ms. Dubis's uninsured motorist insurance carrier, filed an answer denying that Ms. Loyd was underinsured or uninsured and asserting other defenses. Amica Mutual also filed a motion asking that all insurance issues be severed from the underlying personal injury action. On January 10, 2014, Ms. Loyd filed her answer to the complaint, denying the material allegations contained therein. The parties thereafter engaged in contentious discovery litigation. At one point in time, the trial court threatened to dismiss the lawsuit if Ms. Dubis did not timely comply with discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A trial was set for May 18, 2015. On March 9, 2015, however, Amica Mutual filed a suggestion of death pursuant to Rule 25.01 indicating that Ms. Dubis had passed away on February 3, 2015. Approximately forty days later, on April 17, 2015, counsel for Ms. Dubis filed a motion to substitute Ms. Dubis's parents Plaintiff/Appellants Maureen Dubis and Chris Dubis (together with Maureen Dubis, \"Appellants\"). According to the motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. [Ms.] Dubis died in a tragic death on February 3, 2015 when struck by an automobile in St. Louis, Missouri. That death was unrelated [ ] to the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. That counsel for [Ms. Dubis] timely notified counsel for the [Ms. Loyd] of this death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. At the time of her death, [Ms.] Dubis was not married and had never had any children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. She is survived by her father Chris T. Dubis, mother Maureen T. Dubis, and brother, Thomas Nicholas Dubis. Counsel seeks to have Maureen T. Dubis and Chris T. Dubis substituted in place of [Ms.] Dubis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. At this time no estate has been opened for [Ms.] Dubis and therefore pursuant to T.C.A. 20-5-104 counsel for [Ms. Dubis] seeks permission of the Court to allow the natural parents to proceed in this action on [ ] behalf of the deceased, [Ms.] Dubis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 21, 2015, Ms. Loyd filed an objection to the motion for substitution, denying \"that the substitution of heirs as outlined in the present motion is proper.\" Ms. Loyd also argued that substitution would delay the case. On the same day, Amica Mutual filed its own objection to the substitution, adopting verbatim Ms. Loyd's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court did not immediately rule on the motion for substitution, but instead entered several orders resetting the trial date. In the meantime, on June 22, 2015, an estate was opened for Ms. Dubis in Missouri.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, on July 24, 2015, the trial court in this case entered an order granting the motion for substitution of parties. On the same day, an amended complaint was filed naming Appellants, both individually and as next friend of Ms. Dubis, as plaintiffs. Both Ms. Loyd and Amica Mutual again answered the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 1, 2015, Ms. Loyd filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that both the motion for substitution and amended complaint were deficient because Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104 only allows the heirs of the decedent to revive a complaint, \"[i]f no person will administer on the estate of the deceased plaintiff.\" Ms. Loyd asserted that the above statute required an affirmative showing that no person was willing to administer the estate of Ms. Dubis, which had not been met in the motion to substitute parties. Furthermore, because an estate had indeed been opened for Ms. Dubis, Ms. Loyd argued that no showing could be made that no one was willing to administer Ms. Dubis's estate. Ms. Loyd also argued that the time for filing a motion to substitute parties had now expired and that the complaint should not therefore be amended a second time to allow for the substitution of the administrator of Ms. Dubis's estate. Amica Mutual filed a similar motion on September 4, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellants filed a response to the motions to dismiss on September 8, 2015. In the motion, Appellants alleged that counsel was unaware that an estate had been opened for Ms. Dubis, as counsel had no contact with Appellants until after the suggestion of death was filed. According to the motion, Appellants never discussed with counsel the possibility that an estate may be opened in Missouri. The motion asserted that counsel only learned of the estate at the June 22, 2015 depositions of Appellants. According to Appellants, however, the fact that an estate had been opened in Missouri was not relevant, citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Campbell v. Hubbard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8537264\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/79/6/#p8\">\n    79 Tenn. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (Tenn. 1883). Also on September 8, 2015, Appellants filed a motion to extend the time for filing a motion for substitution. Appellants filed a supplemental response on September 22, 2015, more fully articulating the legal basis for their opposition to the motions to dismiss and asking that if\n   Appellants were not proper parties to this lawsuit, that Ms. Dubis's personal representative be substituted as plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 26, 2015, the trial court granted Ms. Loyd's and Amica Mutual's motions to dismiss Appellants' lawsuit. The trial court ruled that Appellants \"did not file a motion to substitute the proper party within 90 days of the filing of the Suggestion of Death of [Ms.] Dubis.\" The trial court also found that Appellants \"did not demonstrate excusable neglect justifying additional time in which to file a motion to substitute the proper parties.\" The trial court therefore dismissed Appellants' complaint with prejudice. Appellants timely appealed to this Court. While this appeal was pending, however, Amica Mutual was voluntarily dismissed from this lawsuit. Accordingly, Ms. Loyd is the only appellee in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellants raise two issues in this appeal, namely:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Whether the trial court erred in granting Ms. Loyd's motion to dismiss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Whether the trial court erred in denying Appellants' motion for extension of time to move for substitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This appeal follows the trial court's dismissal of Appellant's lawsuit upon a motion to dismiss arguing that the Appellants were not the proper parties to prosecute this lawsuit and, therefore, lacked standing. \"Lack of standing may be raised as a defense in a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6) motion to dismiss.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Ava B.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , No. M2014-02408-COA-R10-PT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201730661\">\n    2016 WL 1730661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2016),\n   <em>\n    perm. app. denied\n   </em>\n   (July 1, 2016). A motion under Rule 12.02(6) of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, also known as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, \"challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the strength of the plaintiff's proof or evidence.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Webb v.

Therefore, \"[t]he resolution of a 12.02(6) motion to dismiss is determined by an examination of the pleadings alone.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318228\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/346/422/#p426\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In considering a 12.02(6) motion, we \"construe the complaint liberally, presuming all factual allegations to be true and giving the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trau-Med of Am., Inc. v.

The complaint should not be dismissed unless it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would warrant relief.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Doe v.

Rule 25.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure governs the procedure for substitution after the death of party. Pursuant to Rule 25.01 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors\n   or representatives of the deceased party and, together with the notice of hearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service of process. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 25.01(1). Thus, in order to revive a claim after the death of a party, a motion for substitution must be made within ninety days of the filing of a suggestion of death. The Tennessee Supreme Court has previously held, however, that the ninety day time period may be extended in the event of excusable neglect pursuant to Rule 6.02 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure, discussed in detail\n   <em>\n    infra.\n    <strong>\n     Douglas v.

As our supreme court explained over fifty years ago, \"The common law rule is that the right of action of a person for injuries received perishes with the death of that person. This rule has been abolished by statute in perhaps all of the States.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     McDaniel v.

There is no dispute in this case that the type of claim asserted by Ms. Dubis did not abate at her death, but was instead preserved by statute. Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-102 clearly provides that claims \"founded on wrongs or contracts, except actions for wrongs affecting the character of the plaintiff ... may be revived\" and \"the right of action shall pass in like manner as the right of action described in \u00a7 20-5-106.\" The question of who was entitled to revive the claim, however, is squarely at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Appellants assert that they were correctly named as plaintiffs pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-106 because they are the next of kin of Ms. Dubis. In contrast, Ms. Loyd argues that Appellants were not entitled to be substituted as plaintiffs in this case because they made no showing that no person was willing to administer Ms. Dubis's estate, as is purportedly required by Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104 provides: \"If no person will administer on the estate of a deceased plaintiff or defendant, the suit may be revived by or against the heirs of the decedent.\" According to Appellees, our courts have interpreted this statute as requiring an affirmative showing that no person is willing or available to administer the estate of the deceased litigant before his or her heirs may be substituted as a party. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Several cases have considered the question of who is entitled to revive a claim or who a claim may be revived against. First,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Preston v. Golde\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n    80 Tenn. 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1883), involved a claim against a defendant to rescind a contract. After the defendant died, a suggestion of death was entered on the record and the plaintiff filed a motion to revive the suit against the defendant's heirs.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n    at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the predecessor to\n   Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104, however, an individual seeking to revive a claim against a party's heirs was required to show that \"no one would administer on the estate [.]\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (citing Act of 1809, section 2849 of Code). The plaintiff eventually obtained a judgment against the defendant's heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On appeal, the Tennessee Supreme Court framed the issue as \"There having been no revivor against an administrator, nor any suggestion or assumption in the record that no one would administer, the main and only question in this case is, whether the decree against the heirs could be had without these facts appearing?\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court ultimately held that the judgment against the heirs could not stand because the claim had not been properly revived against them.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11264363\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn/80/267/\">\n    at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As Justice Turney explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The statute, by its terms, puts upon complainant the burden of showing that no one can be found who will administer. The law will not presume that no one will administer. The complainant proposing to proceed under the statute must, by proof satisfactory to the court, bring himself within its provisions and show the fact made absolutely necessary by that statute to his procedure without an administrator.

Here, Appellants reasons for failing to meet the deadline are somewhat tenuous, especially given that parties in different states can easily communicate in this day and age. However, there is nothing in this case to suggest that Appellants' failure to timely substitute the proper party was willful or egregious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     McBride v.

First, we note that Ms. Loyd does not assert anywhere in her brief that she would be prejudiced by allowing the proper plaintiff to be substituted beyond the ninety day time period\n   allowed in Rule 25.01. Indeed, other than a few months of delay, it appears that allowing the proper party to be substituted will have little effect on this litigation. In addition, there is no allegation that Appellants or their counsel acted in bad faith relative to these proceedings. Instead, it appears that the issue in this case simply resulted from a misunderstanding regarding who the proper party was to be substituted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Although involving a wrongful death action rather than revivor, a similar situation was presented in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley v.

Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2012). In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , plaintiff husband filed a wrongful death healthcare liability action on behalf of his deceased wife.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *1. While the cause was pending, husband died and the defendant filed a suggestion of death on the record.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Exactly ninety days later, husband's counsel filed a motion to substitute husband's minor child as the real party in interest, with the child's aunt to serve as next friend.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Defendant objected, alleging that aunt never agreed to serve as next friend of the child and, therefore, the motion for substitution was a nullity.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Counsel for the plaintiff child filed an amended substitution motion asking the trial court to appoint a guardian ad litem to serve as the child's next friend.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Eventually, the trial court entered an order dismissing the case on the basis that no proper substitution motion was filed within ninety days and that the failure to do so was not the result of excusable neglect.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and reinstated the plaintiff child's claim. First, we noted that the motion to substitute the child as the real party in interest was made within the ninety day time period allowed by Rule 25.01.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4. The substitution was not entirely proper, however, because the individual named as next friend had not consented to serving in that role. We noted, however, that the 25.01 time period could be extended based upon excusable neglect, and therefore was not jurisdictional. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court referenced two considerations that supported reinstating the claim in that case. First, the Court noted Tennessee's policy \" 'to insure that cases and controversies be determined upon their merits and not upon legal technicalities or procedural niceties.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jones v.

Next, the Court observed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"[T]he Tennessee Supreme Court has indicated a willingness to give plaintiffs more leeway when attempting to determine the proper party to file a wrongful death suit,\" as plaintiffs often encounter \" 'considerable difficulty in determining the proper party to file and prosecute the action.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Foster v.

Given these policy considerations and the fact that \" 'the cause of action is not changed by the substitution of the proper party plaintiff for the improper plaintiff and that such a substitution does not prejudice the defendant who has had notice from the beginning of the suit,' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4 (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9016887\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/158/418/#p423\">\n    158 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   424 ), the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the wrongful death claim.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204799053\">\n    2012 WL 4799053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The same is generally true in this case. First, like in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Appellant's initial motion for substitution was filed within the appropriate ninety day time period. In both cases, however, the timely motion for substitution was not fully compliant with all applicable law. In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Court of\n   Appeals found excusable neglect to support enlargement of the time period under Rule 25.01, even though there was a suggestion that plaintiff's counsel had acted in a \"particularly disturbing\" way with regard to preserving the child's recovery.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *3 (\"[W]e find it particularly disturbing that Attorney Thomas intended to contractually \"bypass\" the minor child by arranging for her recovery to go to others. However, we do not believe that it is appropriate for this Court to decide whether such behavior violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.\"). In this case, there is no implication that counsel for Appellants acted in any untoward fashion in filing the motion for substitution. Furthermore, like in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Holley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , there has been no suggestion that allowing substitution of Ms. Dubis's personal representative will prejudice Ms. Loyd, \"who has had notice from the beginning of the suit\" regarding the claim against her.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *4. Under these circumstances, we likewise conclude that the trial court erred in denying Appellants' motion for an enlargement of time under Rule 25.01 to file a motion for substitution fully compliant with Tennessee Code Annotated Section 20-5-104 and thereafter dismissing this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The judgment of the Shelby County Circuit Court is reversed and this cause is remanded to the trial court for all further proceedings as are consistent with this Opinion. Costs of this appeal are taxed one-half to Appellants Maureen T. Dubis and Chris T. Dubis, and their surety, and one-half to Appellee Yolanda Loyd, for all of which execution may issue if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Crist Thomas Dubis was named as personal representative of Ms. Dubis's estate. It is not clear in the record how this individual is related to Ms. Dubis or if Crist Thomas Dubis and Appellant Chris T. Dubis are, in fact, the same person.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The September 4, 2015 motion and accompanying memorandum specifically state that they were filed on behalf of Ms. Loyd. The pleadings, however, were filed by Amica Mutual's counsel. Accordingly, we believe that these pleadings were intended to be filed on behalf of Amica Mutual.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In their brief, Appellants raise an argument that the estate in Missouri has no relevance to the instant case because \"a foreign executor can neither sue nor be sued as such in this state.\"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      Campbell v.
