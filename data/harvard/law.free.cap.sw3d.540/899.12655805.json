Appellant contracted with Karrenbrock Construction, Inc., and Karrenbrock Excavating, LLC (collectively \"Respondents\"), to complete work on property owned by Appellant. Appellant's sole point on appeal is that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to enforce the mechanic's liens because Respondents were original contractors and neither pleaded nor provided evidence that the original contractor notice required by \u00a7 429.012\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was ever provided. We hold that, because the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, Appellant's sole point is denied. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 8, 2013, Respondents contracted with Appellant to perform work on property owned by Appellant. The parties agreed within the contracts that Respondents were subcontractors. On January 20, 2014, Respondents sent Appellant the subcontractor lien notices required by \u00a7 429.100. On February 10, 2014, Respondents filed mechanic's liens against Appellant's property to secure payment for their work under the contracts. On July 25, 2014, Respondents filed suit to enforce those liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondents pleaded they were subcontractors but also that Appellant owned the property being worked upon at the time the contract was created. Appellant answered and admitted the same. Respondents further pleaded they followed all conditions precedent to enforcing a mechanic's lien. Appellant answered by stating it was without sufficient information to admit or deny and therefore denied that allegation. At the bench trial, the only witness in the case testified, without objection, that the contracts between Respondents and Appellant were subcontracts. Appellant's ownership of the property being worked upon was evidenced by a deed. Respondents also introduced into evidence, with Appellants stipulating to admissibility, the subcontractor notices Respondents provided to Appellant in accordance with \u00a7 429.100. Respondents did not produce any evidence the original contractor notice\n   required under \u00a7 429.012 was provided to Appellant. Appellant presented no evidence at trial. Appellant made no assertion Respondents were original contractors (as opposed to subcontractors), or that Respondents were required to provide notice of their mechanic's liens under \u00a7 429.012 (as opposed to \u00a7 429.100), until Appellant's motion to amend the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the bench trial, the trial court entered judgment on October 5, 2016, declaring the mechanic's liens to be valid and enforceable against Appellant's property. This judgment was interlocutory until the dismissal of the remaining claims on June 7, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court amended its judgment on August 9, 2017. The amended judgment mirrored the original judgment in declaring Respondents' mechanic's liens valid and enforceable against Appellant's property. Appellant timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court's judgment will be affirmed \"unless there is no substantial evidence to support it, unless it is against the weight of the evidence, unless it erroneously declares the law, or unless it erroneously applies the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

App. E.D. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Appellant's sole point on appeal, it argues Respondents' failure to plead and prove they provided proper notice of the mechanic's liens under \u00a7 429.012 removes the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant argues Respondents were original contractors because Appellant owned the property on which Respondents were working. See\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Village Center, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10168993\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/362/588/#p593\">\n    362 S.W.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (Mo. 1962) (stating \"[o]ne who makes a contract to perform labor or furnish materials with the then owner of the property is an original contractor\"). Thus, Appellant argues, Respondents were required to plead and prove they provided notice under \u00a7 429.012-not \u00a7 429.100. Respondents assert they were only required to provide the notice under \u00a7 429.100 because they were subcontractors under their contract with Appellant. Respondents further argue that even if they were original contractors, Appellant waived its right to appellate relief because it did not plead the trial court lacked statutory authority due to the failure to provide notice under \u00a7 429.012, and because Appellant did not lodge any objections regarding the status of the parties at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The central question presented by Appellant's only point relied on is whether Respondents' alleged failure to plead and provide evidence of their mechanic's lien notices removes a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant's point relied on states: \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    trial court erred\n   </em>\n   in denying [Appellant's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Motion to Amend the Mechanic's Lien portions of the Judgments\n   <em>\n    because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to impose the mechanic's liens\n   </em>\n   in favor of [Respondents], in that [Respondents] failed to plead and prove compliance with RSMo Section 429.012\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Apart from questions of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter, allegations of error not briefed or not properly briefed shall not be considered in any civil appeal[.]\" Rule 84.13(a). A brief \"shall contain ... [t]he points relied on[.]\" Rule 84.04(a). The points relied on must \"[s]tate concisely the legal reasons for the appellant's claim of reversible error[.]\" Rule 84.04(d). \"[A]n argument not set out in the point relied on ... does not comply with the requirements of Rule 84.04(d) and the point is considered abandoned[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brizendine v. Conrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442437\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/71/587/#p593\">\n    71 S.W.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (Mo. banc 2002). Therefore, we review only Appellant's argument set forth in its point relied on. See\n   <em>\n    United Missouri Bank, N.A. v. City of Grandview\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8996526\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/179/362/#p366\">\n    179 S.W.3d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (Mo. App. W.D. 2005) (disregarding an argument in the appellant's brief that was not in its points relied on and considering only the points relied on).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the Missouri Supreme Court's discussion of a trial court's jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    J.C.W. ex rel. Webb v. Wyciskalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/\">\n    275 S.W.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2009), is determinative to Appellant's allegation of error, we need not address Appellant's and Respondents' dispute over whether the mechanic's lien notices were required under \u00a7 429.012 or under \u00a7 429.100. Further, we need not address Respondents' arguments that Appellant waived its right to appellate review by failing to raise this issue in responsive pleadings or at trial. We will confine our discussion to Appellant's allegation of error: the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose the mechanic's liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Missouri Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wyciskalla\n   </em>\n   instructs us that, in Missouri, subject matter jurisdiction is the court's authority to render a judgment in a particular category of case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court further instructs us there are cases that, in dicta, recognize a third concept, \"jurisdictional competence,\" which often is confused with subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208536\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/249/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
