The State charged Movant with a total of seven counts: two counts of the class A felony of robbery in the first degree, two counts of the unclassified felony of armed criminal action, one count of the class B felony of burglary in the first degree, and two counts of the class D felony of unlawful use of a weapon. Movant agreed to plead guilty to all counts. The trial court sentenced Movant to concurrent sentences of thirteen years for robbery, armed criminal action, burglary, and unlawful use of a weapon, and four years for unlawful use of a weapon. The motion court denied Movant's motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing. We affirm the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
