He contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the grounds for termination and the best interest findings. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have\n   provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   AFFIRMED.
