For reversal, the City argues that the circuit court erred in its ruling that (1) a public office of trust includes an appointed municipal chief of police; (2) Herweg is ineligible to hold the appointed position of Jacksonville police chief because of his 2002 Texas conviction; and (3) article 5, section 9 of the Arkansas Constitution applies to both elected and appointed public offices. The City also generally asserts that the circuit court erred in granting the preliminary injunction. Alternatively, the City contends that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Smith did not exhaust her administrative remedies. Pursuant to Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 1-2(a)(1) (2017), we have jurisdiction of this appeal because it involves the interpretation or construction of the Arkansas Constitution. We affirm.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2000, Herweg served as a police officer with the Taylor Police Department in Williamson County, Texas. On Christmas Eve 2000, Herweg drove his patrol vehicle and became involved in an accident that damaged a house and a car. Herweg left the vehicle at the scene and told police that it had been stolen. Herweg was arrested after he wrecked and abandoned the vehicle and knowingly lied to the police officers who investigated the accident. He claimed that he gave a false statement to one officer while he was off duty. On March 4, 2002, Herweg pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, the offense of giving a false report to a police officer, a Class B misdemeanor, in the Williamson County Court in Texas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Herweg was sentenced to three days in jail; he paid a $2,000 fine and permanently surrendered his Texas law-enforcement certification as a term of his guilty plea. Herweg subsequently moved to Arkansas. He claimed to have been \"in and out of law enforcement for over thirty years, also with security work and such.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 1, 2017, Kenny Boyd retired as the City's chief of police. Before Boyd's retirement, Mayor Fletcher identified Herweg as the leading candidate to replace Boyd. On April 8, 2017, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published an article stating that Herweg had pleaded guilty in 2002 to giving a false statement to a police officer in Texas. Mayor Fletcher, with knowledge of this prior conviction, appointed Herweg as the City's new police chief on April 14, 2017. Treasurer Davit made payments toward Herweg's salary and other\n   expenses, and Herweg received these payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 26, 2017, Smith, individually and on behalf of similarly situated Arkansas taxpayers, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, illegal exaction, and emergency temporary restraining order. In her complaint, she alleged that Herweg had been convicted of knowingly lying to a police officer, that he was ineligible to hold the office of police chief, that Herweg's appointment to an office of public trust violated Arkansas law, and that he must be removed from office. Specifically, in her prayer for relief she sought the entry of (1) a declaratory judgment that Herweg be prohibited from holding the office of chief of police; (2) a declaration that the City was illegally and improperly making payments to Herweg that constituted an illegal exaction; (3) an accounting; (4) the establishment of a trust or an escrow account into which these funds could be reimbursed and deposited; (5) an order that the City pay into this account the amount of funds determined to have been illegally exacted; (6) an emergency temporary restraining order immediately removing Herweg from the office of chief of police; and (7) reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and all other relief. On May 18, 2017, the City filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure. The circuit court held a hearing on Smith's petition and on the City's motion to dismiss; after arguments from counsel, the circuit court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the circuit court entered an order granting a preliminary injunction in Smith's favor. Specifically, the circuit court denied the City's motion to dismiss, finding that the office of chief of police is a public office and an \"office of trust or profit\" as contemplated by article 5, section 9 of the Arkansas Constitution. The court also found that Herweg's 2002 Texas conviction rendered him incapable of holding the office because his guilty plea involved an \"infamous crime\" under article 5, section 9 of the Arkansas Constitution. Accordingly, the circuit court granted a preliminary injunction and found that Smith had met her burden of establishing both a likelihood of success on the merits and the existence of irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. After the City's motion for stay was deemed denied by the circuit court, the City filed a timely notice of appeal. From the June 29, 2017 order, the City now brings its appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The City's first three points on appeal involve this court's interpretation of the Arkansas Constitution. The City argues that the circuit court erred in ruling that (1) article 5, section 9 applied to an appointed municipal chief of police; (2) Herweg was incapable of holding his appointed position as the City's chief of police because of his 2002 Texas misdemeanor conviction; and (3) article 5, section 9 applies to both elected and appointed public offices. For its fourth point on appeal, the City makes a general allegation that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction. And for its fifth point, the City alternatively argues that the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Smith failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Herweg violated Texas Penal Code \u00a7 37.08, False Report to a Police Officer, which provides,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    (a) A person commits an offense if, with intent to deceive, he knowingly makes a false statement that is material to a criminal investigation and makes the statement to:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    (1) a peace officer or federal special investigator conducting the investigation; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    (2) any employee of a law enforcement agency that is authorized by the agency to conduct the investigation and that the actor knows is conducting the investigation.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    Rule 65 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure governs the issuance of preliminary injunctions. In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65, the circuit court must consider two issues: (1) whether irreparable harm will result in the absence of an injunction or restraining order and (2) whether the moving party has demonstrated\n    a likelihood of success on the merits.\n    <em>\n     Ark.

When an appeal reaches an appellate court via an order granting a preliminary injunction, the appellate court will not delve into the merits of the case further than is necessary to determine whether the circuit court exceeded its discretion in granting the injunction.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285259\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/365/115/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285259\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/365/115/\">\n     226 S.W.3d 800\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The sole question before the appellate court is whether the circuit court departed from the rules and principles of equity in making the order and not whether the appellate court would have made the order.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285259\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/365/115/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285259\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/365/115/\">\n     at 121-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3285259\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/365/115/\">\n     226 S.W.3d at 806-07\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    A. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    We first address the alternative argument raised by the City. The City contends that the circuit court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction because Smith failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Specifically, the City asserts that because Smith failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, and this court must dismiss the appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The City's argument is actually an argument involving a plaintiff's standing to bring an illegal-exaction lawsuit. Article 16, section 13 of the Arkansas Constitution provides that \"[a]ny citizen of the county, city or town may institute suit, in behalf of himself and all others interested, to protect the inhabitants thereof against the enforcement of any illegal exactions whatever.\" An illegal exaction is defined as any exaction that either is not authorized by law or is contrary to law.\n    <em>\n     Wilson v.

In a \"public funds\" illegal-exaction case, such as the one before us, the plaintiff contends that public funds generated from tax dollars are being misapplied or illegally spent.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386709\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/709/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386709\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/709/\">\n     527 S.W.3d 709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

We have not required the plaintiff to trace his or her individual tax contribution to the tax money that is allegedly being spent in an illegal manner, nor have we required the plaintiff to establish a significant tax contribution to the state treasury. Hence, in public-funds cases we have given the word \"interested\" as used in article 16, section 13, a very broad construction.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386709\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/709/\">\n     2017 Ark. 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at 5-6,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386709\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/709/\">\n     527 S.W.3d at 713\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Bowerman v.

Justiciability\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The City also makes a general justiciability argument and states that the \"Declaratory Judgement Act ... was not intended to allow any question to be presented by any person, for the matter must first be justiciable.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Our declaratory-judgment statute provides that \"[a]ny person ... whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute ... may have determined any question of construction or validity arising\n    under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-111-102\">\n     Ark.

In its order granting preliminary injunction, the circuit court found that Smith had met her burden of establishing both a likelihood of success on the merits of her claims and the existence of irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. This court has stated that \"[a] party thus is not required to prove his [or her] case in full at a preliminary-injunction hearing.\"\n    <em>\n     Ledgerwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386525\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/336/\">\n     2017 Ark. 308\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at 9,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386525\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/336/\">\n     530 S.W.3d at 342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Univ. of Tex. v.

Thus, we hold that the circuit court properly found that the 2002 Texas conviction disqualifies Herweg from holding the office of the City's police chief.

First, it would be inappropriate for Herweg to carry out the duties and responsibilities of a police chief while illegally holding that office. Second, Smith and the other taxpayers would bear the burden of replenishing the funds paid to Herweg if he continued to serve as police chief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Based on the foregoing precedent, we agree with the circuit court's rulings on irreparable harm. We conclude that the circuit court properly ruled that Smith and the other taxpayers would bear the burden of replenishing any funds paid to Herweg. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court properly found that irreparable harm would result if Herweg were to remain in office in violation of article 5, section 9 of the Arkansas Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting Smith's motion for preliminary injunction and affirm the order of the circuit court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Hart, J., dissents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Josephine Linker Hart, Justice, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The majority has erred in stretching article 5, section 9 of the Arkansas Constitution to apply to a department head in a municipal corporation. This error is directly attributable to the majority's failure to follow the well-established principles of construction and constitutional interpretation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Inexplicably, while the majority correctly notes that this court has not defined what is meant by \"any office of trust or profit,\" it declines to do so. Instead, the majority's analysis focuses on the meaning of only a single word in section 9 : \"any.\" \"Any\" has a well-known meaning in contemporary usage. Not so with the phrase \"office of trust or profit,\" or even the word \"office.\" The phrase \"office of trust or profit\" is a term of art, present in Arkansas Constitutions since 1836.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ark. Const. 1836, art. IV, \u00a7 13. It is also found in the U.S. Constitution. In Article I, section 9, it is part of a clause that prohibits \"Persons holding any Office of Profit or Trust\" from receiving without consent of Congress \"any present, Emolument, Office or Title of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\" In Article II, section 1, \"Office or Profit or Trust\" defines a class of people, along with senators and congressmen, who are not allowed to serve as electors in electoral college. In the context of the U.S. Constitution, the phrase \"of profit or trust,\" while not definitively defined, must logically refer to a more restrictive class than mere office holders, or else the words would be mere surplusage. Certainly, an office of profit or trust must be more than mere public employment.

In determining the distinction between public employment and public office, the\n    <em>\n     Lucas\n    </em>\n    court eschewed a \"hard and fast rule\" in favor of recognizing \"controlling principles,\" that are to be applied to \"individual cases as they arise.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20S.W.%20667\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Lucas\n    </em>\n    court cited several factors to be considered such as whether a duty is a \"continuing one,\" defined by \"rules prescribed by the government and not by contract,\" and whether the duties continue if the person is changed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20S.W.%20667\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    However, rather than applying the\n    <em>\n     Lucas\n    </em>\n    factors to resolve the pivotal question of whether the position of chief of police in Jacksonville is \"an office of profit or trust,\" the majority simply assumes that it is an \"office\" and relies on dicta in\n    <em>\n     Allen v.

Thus, it is not proper to simply pluck a phrase or a clause out of the constitution and treat it as though it is a stand-alone provision.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059631\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/50/288/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    A municipal corporation is defined as \"[a] city, town or other local political entity formed by charter from the state and having the autonomous authority to administer the state's local affairs.\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    1175 (10th ed. 1995). Proper construction of article 5, section 9 requires this court to consider and harmonize this section with the part of the Arkansas Constitution that deals specifically with municipal corporations: article 12, entitled \"Municipal and Private Corporations.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    A study of article 12 reveals that incorporated cities and towns are not direct arms of the state; they are entities that are chartered in accordance with laws passed\n    by the General Assembly. Ark. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 3. It states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    The General Assembly shall provide, by general laws, for the organization of cities (which may be classified) and incorporated towns; and restrict their power of taxation, assessment, borrowing money and contracting debts, so as to prevent the abuse of such power.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Accordingly, municipal corporations have more in common with business corporations-they are also authorized by article 12-than any of the three branches of government. By way of analogy, applying article 5, section 9 to enjoin the municipal corporation known as the City of Jacksonville from hiring a police chief is akin to enjoining Walmart from hiring a director of marketing. It therefore does not directly follow that every position of public employment in a municipal corporation would be subject to the same qualifications as the constitutional officers identified in the text of the Arkansas Constitution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Municipal corporations are purely creatures of statute and stand on an independent footing as compared to the three branches of statewide government. In accordance with the constitutional mandate of article 12, the General Assembly enacted statutes that govern everything from the process of incorporation to the selection of city department heads, the latter being of pivotal concern in the case before us. Arkansas Code Annotated section 14-42-110 (Repl. 2013), entitled, \"Removal and appointment power,\" gives the mayor of Jacksonville exclusive authority to hire and fire department heads, in this case, the chief of police. Section 14-42-110 states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    (a)(1) Mayors in cities of the first class and second class and incorporated towns shall have the power to appoint and remove all department heads, including city and town marshals when an ordinance has been passed making city and town marshals appointed, unless the city or town council shall vote by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the council to override the mayor's action.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    (2) Provided, however, that in cities of the first class and second class with civil service commissions, the governing body of the city may delegate by ordinance the authority to appoint and remove the heads of the police and fire departments to the city's civil service commission.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    (b) City managers in cities having a city manager form of government shall have the power to appoint and remove all department heads. In cities with a city manager form of government and with civil service commissions, the civil service commission shall have the power to override the city manager's appointment or removal of the police or fire chief by a majority vote of the total membership of the commission.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to department heads not under the control of the governing body of the city and shall not apply to cities having a city administrator form of government.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    This statute sets forth with specificity the means of selecting department heads that are separate and distinct from the processes required for state officers found in article 6 and elsewhere in the Arkansas Constitution. I therefore cannot conclude that a position that wields only municipal authority should be considered the same as one that wields statewide authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Pursuant to the foregoing analysis, the circuit court's conclusion that Ms. Smith is likely to succeed on the merits of her petition is clearly erroneous. I would reverse\n    and dismiss the preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
