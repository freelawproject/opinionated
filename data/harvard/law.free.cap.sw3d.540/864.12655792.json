Fullers filed a petition against Ronald Partee (\"Partee\") and Byron Fox (\"Fox\") which alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and legal malpractice. Partee and Fox filed a motion to dismiss the action, which was granted by the trial court. The Fullers raise six points on appeal alleging error. We find that the circuit court erred in dismissing George's claim for breach of contract against Partee. We reverse and remand for further proceedings on this point.

He\n   was convicted following a jury trial in 1990 and is serving a prison term of life without the possibility of parole. George's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal as were his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motions for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v.

On December 12, 2010, George contracted with Partee for Partee to represent George in his appeal from the denial of his motion to reopen his Rule 29.15 proceeding. Pursuant to the terms of the contract, Partee specifically agreed to perform certain services including: (a) prepare and file appellate brief; (b) oral argument; and (c) reply brief \"if we decide that one was necessary.\" George's sister, Clara, delivered to Partee the agreed upon attorney fee of $6,000 and Partee filed an Appellant's Brief appealing the motion court's judgment denying the motion to reopen his Rule 29.15 proceeding. The Fullers allege that once Partee received payment of the $6,000 retainer fee, he ceased communication with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court docketed the case for \"no argument\" and sent a letter to Partee instructing him that he had ten days within which to request the case be moved to the oral argument docket. Partee sent a letter to George acknowledging that George's case had been placed on the \"no argument\" docket and stated he would make inquiries as to why argument had not been scheduled. The Fullers attempted to contact Partee to instruct him that he could and should request oral argument. Partee did not timely request oral argument nor did he discuss this decision with George. This Court ultimately affirmed the judgment of the motion court.\n   <em>\n    Fuller v.

We begin with Point Relied On VI which alleges that the trial court erred in finding that there was no partnership between Partee and Fox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Fullers allege that Fox was law partners with Partee at the time Partee and George contracted for legal representation. Because of the partnership Fullers argue, Fox would have shared in any proceeds from the contract and should be liable for any damages. Although the Fullers further admit that they joined \"Defendant Fox because they had no other means to recoup the damages they suffered as a result of the breach of contract.\" The circuit court found that the petition failed to properly plead facts to establish that a partnership existed between Partee and Fox. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to an affidavit provided by Fox, he has not practiced law in fifteen years and has not occupied an office with Partee in as much time. The Fullers allege that they hired Partee to represent George because, after attempting to contact Fox, they were told by an unknown person that Fox no longer practiced law and were given the name of Partee. The alleged \"referral\" does not provide evidence of a partnership. If it is indicative of anything, it supports Fox's contention that he was not practicing law at the time George hired Partee and therefore could not have been in a legal partnership with Partee at the time of the contract. The only additional evidence that the Fullers have to suggest that Fox and Partee were partners is that Partee used letterhead titled \"Fox &amp; Partee.\" The letterhead, did not identify Fox as an attorney with the firm and the engagement letter was signed solely by Partee and made no mention of Fox. Additionally, directly below the firm name, it is clearly indicated that the letter is coming from \"Ronald E. Partee, P.C.\" This is further support for the finding that Partee\n   was practicing law as a professional corporation and not as a law partner with Fox. The Fullers' brief identifies no response to the lack of evidence supporting a partnership other than noting that Fox does not explain why old letterhead was used nor affirmatively show that he did not share in profits. This was not his burden. The Fullers needed to plead facts, not mere conclusions, establishing that Fox was in a legal partnership with Partee.\n   <em>\n    Pulitzer Publ'g v. Transit Cas.

The use of letterhead bearing the name \"Fox &amp; Partee\" and the fact that many years before George retained Partee, Fox acted as Partee's business partner are not sufficient facts to survive a motion summary judgment. As such, the court did not err in dismissing Fox from the action in its entirety. Because we find no error in the dismissal of Fox, the remainder of our discussion shall be related solely to Partee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We next address the Fullers' claim that the court erred in finding that Clara was not a third-party beneficiary to the contract and thus had no standing to bring a claim against Partee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For ease of discussion, we also address the Fullers' claim argued throughout their brief that Clara otherwise had standing to bring claims for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, it is clear that Clara cannot bring a claim for legal malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[T]he existence of an attorney-client relationship between the plaintiff and the attorney\" is a required element of any legal malpractice case.\n   <em>\n    Rose v.

Although the freeing of her brother would have \"benefited\" Clara, the contract was for the representation of George and not intended to confer a benefit onto Clara. Thus, Clara is unable to maintain an action against Partee for any of the claims brought in the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The trial court did not err in finding Clara had no standing to bring the claims for breach of contract, malpractice, or breach of fiduciary relationship because she was not a party to the contract between Partee and George, was not a third party beneficiary to that contract, and neither did she have an attorney-client relationship with Partee.

As previously stated, a plaintiff seeking to recover for legal malpractice must establish \"(1) an attorney-client relationship; (2) negligence or breach of contract by the defendant; (3) proximate causation of plaintiff's damages; (4) damages to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox,\n   </em>\n   at 260. \"A breach of fiduciary obligation is constructive fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Klemme\n   </em>\n   , 941 S.W.2d at 495. \"Whether characterized as breach of fiduciary duty or constructive fraud, the elements of such a claim are: (1) an attorney-client relationship; (2) breach of a fiduciary obligation by the attorney; (3) proximate causation; (4) damages to the client; (5) no other recognized tort encompasses the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 496. It is the second and fifth elements that distinguish a breach of fiduciary claim from a legal malpractice action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is a claim for constructive fraud rather than one of negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The brief, however, fails to address that, when the claims are asserted in the context of post-conviction relief, the petition must also allege that the plaintiff is actually innocent of the underlying crime charged.\n   <em>\n    Kuehne v.

Therefore, Kuehne's innocence of the criminal charges for which he was convicted is essential to satisfy the causation element of his claim. Although Kuehne asserted in his petition that he is an innocent man, his allegation is merely a bare conclusion without factual support. The fact of his guilt was previously determined when he was convicted of the criminal charges, and Kuehne is therefore barred from asserting a collateral civil claim where actual innocence is an essential element.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Kuehne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7322037\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/321/337/\">\n    321 S.W.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Personal Injury and Torts s. 11:10;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jarnagin v. Terry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9991955\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/807/190/\">\n    807 S.W.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. W.D. 1991). \"The essential elements of a breach of contract action include: (1) the existence and terms of a contract; (2) that plaintiff performed or tendered performance pursuant to the contract; (3) breach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages suffered by the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Martha's Hands, LLC v. Rothman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321517\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/328/474/#p479\">\n    328 S.W.3d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The engagement letter outlining the terms of the agreement were included by the Fullers in their original petition. Additionally, in his own Motion to Dismiss, Partee admits that he entered into a contract with George for \"among other things,\n   all research and preparation of Mr. Fuller's Brief,\n   <em>\n    and oral argument\n   </em>\n   in the Western District.\" (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Clara delivered $6,000 to Partee on George's behalf, thus satisfying George's obligations under the contract. It is further undisputed that Partee did not request or present oral argument to this Court although oral argument was a service contracted for under the agreement and a request affirmed by the Fullers. Although George cannot obtain damages as a direct result of his crimes, as discussed fully above, we believe he can obtain damages for amount paid for a service that he did not receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Missouri has yet to address when a criminal defendant can obtain damages for a specifically contracted for service which was not rendered by his defense counsel under a claim for breach of contract. Other states have faced this question. In California, the court found that, as with a malpractice claim, a criminal defendant cannot bring a claim for breach of contract against their attorney unless they can show actual innocence.\n   <em>\n    Lynch v. Warwick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1021196\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/95/267/#p275\">\n    95 Cal.

Ct. App. 2002). We are, however, more persuaded by the dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , the convicted defendant in his breach of contract claim sought only to recover the money he had paid to retain counsel for services not rendered in the criminal matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 277-78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20391\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus the focus is not on the unfavorable outcome of trial but specifically for services contracted for but not rendered. Further, there are a number of policy reasons for not allowing a criminal defendant to recover for malpractice including: (1) not allowing a criminal to profit from his or her crime; (2) preventing the shifting of blame for guilt; (3) undermining the system of justice; and (4) avoiding a retrial of the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20391\">\n    115 Cal.Rptr.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
