Russell, Judge\n   Keith Meiners (\"Meiners\") appeals the motion court's overruling of his Rule 29.15 motion for postconviction relief. Meiners was convicted of second-degree murder for the death of James Willman (\"Victim\"). At trial, Meiners requested the jury also be instructed on both voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. The trial court rejected both instructions, and, on direct appeal, appellate counsel did not raise these refused instructions as points of error. In his Rule 29.15 motion, Meiners argued his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these issues. The motion court denied postconviction relief, finding his appellate counsel was not ineffective. Because appellate counsel did not fail to exercise the customary level of skill and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney, her performance was not constitutionally deficient. The motion court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A jury convicted Meiners of second-degree murder for the death of James Willman (\"Victim\"). The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated on the night of the murder, Meiners invited Victim and a number of other individuals over to his home to drink. Also in attendance was Justice Brickey (\"Witness\"), who was present at the scene of the crime and became one of the State's key witnesses. Meiners and Victim were not strangers, as Victim had previously been romantically involved with Meiners's then-girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After some time, Meiners, Victim, and Witness left to go to a second party in Victim's car. As Victim drove the other two men from the party, Witness asked Victim to pull the car over because he was feeling nauseous. After the car stopped, Witness saw Meiners, who had been sitting behind Victim in the backseat, strangling Victim with duct tape. Witness testified Meiners then pulled Victim out of the driver's seat and onto the road. According to Meiners, Victim then pulled a switchblade on Meiners and attempted to stab him, but Meiners knocked the knife away. Meiners, continuing his attack, stood over Victim and punched him repeatedly as Victim screamed for him to stop. Witness briefly attempted to pull Meiners off of Victim but was unsuccessful; Witness described Meiners as \"out of control\" and \"filled with rage.\" When Meiners finally stopped punching Victim, he was no longer moving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meiners and Witness dragged Victim to the side of the road. Witness saw Meiners standing on Victim's chest and neck. Additional trial testimony demonstrated Meiners told another witness he stood on Victim's neck until he could no longer feel a pulse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meiners admitted to killing Victim at trial. The jury was instructed on both first-and second-degree murder. Meiners's attorney asked the court for additional instructions on voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. The trial court rejected both instructions, and the jury found Meiners guilty of second-degree murder. Meiners's motion for new trial, which argued the trial court erred by not submitting these instructions, was overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On direct appeal, appellate counsel did not raise either refused instruction. In his amended Rule 29.15 motion for postconviction relief, Meiners argued appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these points of error on appeal because, according to Meiners, there was evidentiary support for both instructions. At the evidentiary hearing, appellate counsel testified she had flagged both refused instructions as potential issues to raise on appeal but ultimately concluded there was insufficient evidence of sudden passion to argue the jury should have been instructed on voluntary manslaughter. She did acknowledge, however, that a person pulling a knife on\n   another could cause sudden passion. As to the refused involuntary manslaughter instruction, appellate counsel stated she did not believe the evidence adduced at trial fit any scenario in which recklessness could be found, and it was for this reason she did not raise the issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion court denied postconviction relief, finding that Meiners's counsel on appeal had performed competently. It determined the record demonstrated no evidence of sudden passion, rejecting each of Meiners's arguments. The motion court held Meiners's knowledge of his girlfriend's relationship with Victim would not cause sudden passion due to the attenuated connection between this knowledge and Meiners's attack; further, the motion court rejected Meiners's contention that sudden passion arose after Victim attacked Meiners with a knife because sudden passion is not an applicable defense when the defendant is the initial aggressor. Due to the lack of evidence, the motion court determined appellate counsel was not ineffective in declining to raise this issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Similarly, the motion court held appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise on appeal the trial court's refusal to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. Because the evidence demonstrated Meiners repeatedly kicked, punched, and strangled Victim before dragging him to a field to die, the motion court found appellate counsel was not ineffective for declining to raise the refused instruction as error on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meiners argues the motion court clearly erred in overruling his Rule 29.15 motion for postconviction relief because appellate counsel was allegedly ineffective for failing to raise the refused instructions on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court reviews a motion court's judgment denying postconviction relief to determine whether its findings and conclusions are clearly erroneous.

The motion court denied these claims after finding neither rejected jury instruction was supported by the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Instructing on Lesser-Included Offenses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A trial court must instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense when there is a basis in the evidence for acquitting the defendant of the higher offense and convicting the defendant of the lower offense. Sec. 556.046.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Meiners argues there was clearly a basis in the evidence for acquittal for first-degree murder because the jury did indeed acquit him of that offense. In addition, he asserts there are bases in the evidence for convictions of either voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, which are lesser-included offenses of first-degree murder. Sec. 565.029.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. The Refused Voluntary Manslaughter Instruction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Meiners argues his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on appeal the rejected voluntary manslaughter instruction because there was a basis in the evidence to convict him or her of that lesser offense. A person is guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he or she \"[c]auses the death of another person ... [while] under the influence of sudden passion arising from adequate cause.\" Sec. 565.023. Sudden passion arises out of \"provocation by the victim or another acting with the victim which ... arises at the time of the offense and is not solely the result of former provocation.\" Sec. 565.002(15) (RSMo 2014 ). Adequate cause is of a type \"that would reasonably produce a degree of passion in a person of ordinary temperament sufficient to substantially impair an ordinary person's capacity for self-control.\" Sec. 565.002(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To support his claim of sudden passion, Meiners points to evidence that his girlfriend had dated Victim previously, he had gotten into an argument with Victim during their drive, and Victim pulled a knife on Meiners in his attack, during which Witness described Meiners as \"filled with rage\" and \"out of control.\" Because this evidence fails to provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for finding sudden passion, the motion court did not err in overruling Meiners's Rule 29.15 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sudden passion must arise at the time of the offense and there must not have been a cooling-off period.\n   <em>\n    State v. Redmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306154\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/937/205/#p208\">\n    937 S.W.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208 (Mo. banc 1996). Meiners had been aware of his girlfriend's romantic history with Victim for some time prior to the crime. He was aware of the relationship when he invited Victim to his home to socialize and when he attended a second party with Victim. Meiners cannot argue this past relationship was a legitimate source of sudden passion when he had an abundance of time to process this information and there was no evidence this knowledge somehow sparked sudden ire on the night of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, to prove sudden passion, the defendant must show the victim took some action to provoke the defendant and the defendant was not the initial aggressor.\n   <em>\n    State v. Stidman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8165418\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/259/96/#p103\">\n    259 S.W.3d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103 (Mo. App. 2008). Words alone are not sufficient to show provocation that arises to adequate cause.\n   <em>\n    Redmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306154\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/937/205/#p208\">\n    937 S.W.2d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An argument with Victim would not produce such passion as to cause a person of ordinary temperament to physically attack the other and is inadequate to find\n   sudden passion here. And though there was testimony alleging Victim had pulled out a switchblade and attempted to stab Meiners, this occurred only after Meiners first strangled Victim with duct tape and dragged him from the vehicle. As such, Meiners was the initial aggressor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Likewise, there was no basis in the evidence to support Meiners's argument he acted out of sudden passion because he was described by witnesses as \"filled with rage\" and \"out of control.\" Though these descriptions could potentially\n   <em>\n    corroborate\n   </em>\n   a claim of sudden passion, Meiners presents no evidence Victim was the source of this anger. A heated temperament alone is insufficient to prove an individual was overcome with sudden passion arising out of adequate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellate counsel found this same lack of evidence in preparing the direct appeal. Counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that, after reviewing the legal file, she saw no grounds for asserting sudden passion. An appellate counsel does not have a duty to raise every appealable issue; counsel may strategically decide to forgo certain arguments in favor of others.\n   <em>\n    Storey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8896883\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/175/116/#p148\">\n    175 S.W.3d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (Mo. banc 2005). Appellate counsel's decision to not address the refused voluntary manslaughter instruction on appeal was a considered, intentional decision. It was not unreasonable, and the motion court did not err in denying Meiners's claim of ineffective assistance based on counsel's decision to not raise on appeal the trial court's refusal to instruct on voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. The Refused Involuntary Manslaughter Instruction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Meiners also argues appellate counsel was ineffective for not appealing the trial court's refusal to instruct on involuntary manslaughter. A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter if he or she recklessly causes the death of another person. Sec. 565.024. Involuntary manslaughter is considered a \"nested\" lesser-included offense of second-degree murder because the only differential element between these two crimes is the heightened\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement.\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n    433 S.W.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (Mo. banc 2014). Involuntary manslaughter requires a showing of recklessness, while second-degree murder requires a higher showing of knowledge. Because the greater offense will always encompass the requisite elements of the lesser offense, involuntary manslaughter is \"nested\" in second-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A jury's right to believe or disbelieve evidence is a sufficient basis in the evidence to acquit of the higher offense and convict of the lower offense, as the jury can always find the state failed to meet its burden on the differential element.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n    at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , trial courts are effectively required to instruct on nested lesser-included offenses if asked to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   was decided shortly after Meiners's conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal, and appellate counsel consequently did not have the benefit of its guidance. Meiners argues appellate counsel was nevertheless ineffective in not raising this issue on appeal because\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   simply held what was already implied in the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938942\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/390/#p404\">\n    at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This holding was implied (at least) in [\n   <em>\n    State v.

Meiners contends these instructions were always implicitly required to be given if requested. By not raising this issue on appeal, Meiners asserts that appellate counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Beyond\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , Meiners also argues that because he did not bring a weapon to the scene, but instead used his fists and duct tape to kill\n   Victim, the jury could find his conduct was reckless rather than knowing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Whether counsel's performance fell below the standard expected of a competent attorney turns on the state of the law at the time of the appeal. Though\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   explains it was simply making explicit what had long been implicit, this Court must determine whether the legal principles emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   had previously been so unmistakably obvious as to render appellate counsel's performance objectively unreasonable.

But a rose by any other name is still a rose. This Court's pre-\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    cases make clear that, at the time of Meiners' appeal, a reasonably competent attorney would have understood the idea captured by this phrase and, therefore, would have known Meiners could not commit second-degree murder without committing involuntary manslaughter.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

In\n    <em>\n     McNeal\n    </em>\n    , the defendant was convicted of second-degree burglary and sought post-conviction relief on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on the nested lesser-included offense of trespassing. Under\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    , which was decided after the defendant's trial, the defendant would have been entitled to the instruction had the request been made. This Court affirmed the motion court's denial of the defendant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction on a nested lesser-included offense. In affirming, however, the Court did not rely on the fact that the defendant's trial occurred before\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    . Instead, the Court merely held it was not clearly erroneous to conclude counsel's failure to request the instruction was a matter of trial strategy rather than incompetence.\n    <em>\n     McNeal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187167\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/500/841/\">\n     500 S.W.3d at 844-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    At the time of Meiners' appeal,\n    <em>\n     Pond\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    gave a reasonably competent attorney a sufficient basis to attack the trial court's refusal to give the requested involuntary manslaughter instruction in this case.\n    <em>\n     Jackson\n    </em>\n    did not create this argument; it merely confirmed it.
