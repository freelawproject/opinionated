Beckett raises one claim on appeal; he argues that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding defense counsel from questioning the venire panel to discern whether they could consider all the evidence once they heard that \"two shots\" were fired. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 23, 2013, Beckett called 911 to report that he had shot his wife (Victim) a couple of times. Police responding to the call found Victim lying on the bed in the master bedroom with her head in a pool of blood. The police also found a Smith and Wesson handgun (containing a live cartridge) and two more cartridges (one live and one spent) on the bed near Victim's head. Emergency response personnel initiated life-saving procedures at the scene, but Victim was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beckett was indicted on two charges-murder in the first degree (Count 1) and armed criminal action (Count 2). During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You are going to hear that there were two shots in this case, and I have got to know right now if that fact, that fact alone does it for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, can we approach?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (The following proceedings were had at the Bench.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: We're getting into what the evidence is going to show. The same reason he wanted to cut me off. I'm making the exact same objection is to him giving the two shots. We're not going to get into trigger pull since we're going to have somebody talk about that.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   We're going to have somebody talk about one or two shots, he doesn't need to talk about that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I am not arguing evidence, I am making sure that these jurors will look at all the evidence and consider it all. That is an operative fact in this case, and if they are not going to listen to anything else, I am entitled to know it. I am not going beyond anything else. You know well enough if somebody starts talking about-or asking me questions, I am going to tell them that's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Here's the problem I'm seeing. Is that going to be the evidence in the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: There are two shots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: So what is the point of the question that you are asking I guess?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The point is that they are going to listen to all the evidence as it comes in and not make their mind up based on that fact alone, and that is it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: You are not asking them that. You are asking if there are two shots, is that enough to convict him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No. I just went through out there that they have to wait until the end of all the evidence and consider all of the evidence. My question to them is if you hear evidence that there's two shots, is that all? Is that it? Do you not need to hear anymore?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: That is critical in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: That's what my concern is. [Defense Counsel], I chastised the prosecution for and so fair is fair. I have asked them never to do what they did to me the last trial we had which is getting commitments from jurors. What we are here to do is to determine whether they can be fair and can listen to all the evidence. If you ask that question I've got no problem, but you're asking them to parse out individual pieces of evidence which is exactly why you got a mistrial the last time, and [the Prosecutor] was the one standing there right next to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That is not what I am doing here, Judge, I am asking them if they will follow the instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: Sustained. You ask questions of what their biases are. That's what this voir dire part is about, it's not to take certain pieces of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you are excluding me from talking about anything that may be part of my defense?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: No, I didn't say that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Or that they would even be open to my defense?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: [Defense Counsel], I did not say that. This is why we have gone down this path of bad voir dire here recently is because everybody is wanting to argue their case in front of the jury panel and not the jury. So what I am telling you is I'm sustaining your objection and we're not to ask the question about certain pieces of evidence. You have to ask some questions about their ability to follow the instructions and their biases here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And that is what I am asking them, Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: You did not ask that question. You asked a particular piece of evidence, if that is enough to convict. You are trying to get them to commit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, no, no. I didn't ask that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Then ask the question properly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (The proceedings returned to open court.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We have discussed the fact that the Judge will instruct you that you are to consider all of the evidence in the case, correct? Is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   So if you hear evidence that there were two shots in this case, will you still be able to do that? Will you still be able to wait until the very end-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, can we approach again?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (The following proceedings were had at the Bench.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: He's asking for a commitment-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: Here's what we're going to do. Everybody, please you all are doing it and I know why you are all doing it. We have already been through this once before in a previous case with regard to asking questions about if they can follow the instructions, can they wait to make a decision. Why do you keep injecting that two shots were fired? That's what I am trying to figure out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Because that's a huge-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Gun violence is the issue. Gun shooting and gun violence are the issues, the theme. It's not the specifics of the one or two or three or four, five shots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That's your theme, that's not mine. My theme is that there is one big fact in this case and they are going to have to keep their minds open throughout the entire case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Ask that question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE COURT: If you ask that question you're not going to have any problem. You are prefacing everything based upon the two shots being fired as opposed to what you just said-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So I will say it just like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: If you get out there and you start with there is one big fact right on the [heels] of just mentioning the two shots, the inference will be in the juror's mind that the two shots is the critical issue. I think we have kind of spoiled this issue with the mention of two shots, then go straight into the big fact-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I will ask a question in between.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, here we go.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (The proceedings returned to open court.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So you are not going to make up your mind until you get back in that room and you talk about it, right? That's the Court's instruction, right? You are to consider everything prior to making up your mind and you are going to go back there and you are going to talk it out with your other jurors. Anybody going to have a problem with that, waiting to get there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (No response.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At trial, Beckett testified that he routinely carried his handgun with him around the house and that the gun was always within his or Victim's reach. In the early morning hours of February 23, 2013, after a conflict with Victim that ended in their bedroom, Beckett went to clear and secure the handgun, which Victim had dropped on the bed, but when Beckett jerked the gun off the bed, it fired in his hand. He grabbed the handgun again, and it kicked and fired again. Beckett called 911 and stayed with Victim until the police arrived and Beckett was taken into custody. He testified that he did not mean to shoot Victim and that it was an accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Victim testified at Beckett's trial on behalf of the State. The medical examiner found two gunshot entrance wounds-one on Victim's right forehead and the other on the left side of her neck-and one exit wound on her back from the bullet that entered her neck. Both shots were fired from fewer than three feet away from Victim. The shot to Victim's forehead caused extensive damage to her brain and was fatal. The medical examiner declared the cause of death to be multiple gunshot wounds and the manner of death to be homicide. He testified that, in cases involving accidental shootings, there is usually a single gunshot wound ; after performing more than 4,000 autopsies, he could not recall ever \"call[ing] a multiple gunshot wound an accidental matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A firearm forensic expert, called to testify by the State, said she tested the handgun involved in the shooting and determined that it was functioning properly. She indicated that the gun was equipped with both a trigger safety to prevent the gun from firing accidentally and a firing pin safety. She also testified that, during testing, the gun fired only once per trigger squeeze, and the trigger pull,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the pounds of pressure needed to move the trigger rearward, was eleven pounds. She concluded that, even if picked up by the trigger, the gun would not fire accidentally because the heavy trigger pull acted as a third safety feature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition to eliciting evidence throughout the trial about the two shots, the State emphasized the issue during its closing argument. The prosecutor argued that the fact that Victim was shot twice proved the shooting was intentional. He said, \"[t]he truth is two shots equals homicide. Now, two shots is important here. Two shots.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to Count 1 of the indictment, the jury received instructions on crimes ranging from murder in the first degree to involuntary manslaughter in the second degree. The jury found Beckett guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Beckett filed a timely Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict of the Jury or, in the Alternative, for a New Trial, in which he argued that the trial court erred when it sustained the State's objections to defense counsel asking venire panel members whether they could consider all the evidence once they learned that two shots were fired. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced Beckett to concurrent terms of life without parole and thirty years' imprisonment.

App. E.D. 2008) (distinguishing cases like\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Finch\n   </em>\n   where the victims belonged to particular groups of people who may engender bias for or against defendants). Furthermore, Beckett presented evidence to support his defense that the shooting was accidental. Had the jury believed that evidence, they could have determined that Beckett was not guilty of first-degree murder, despite two shots being fired, but the jury did not believe that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defense counsel asked, \"You are going to hear that there were two shots in this case, and I have got to know right now if that fact, that fact alone does it for you?\" After the State objected and the court sustained the objection, defense counsel tried again, asking, \"So if you hear evidence that there were two shots in this case, will you still be able to do that? Will you still be able to wait until the very end?\" The phrasing of these questions reveals\n   that they were \"an attempt to elicit a commitment from jurors as to how they were going to react to the evidence and [the] defense theory at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865116\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/32/#p39\">\n    461 S.W.3d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The aim of these questions was to get a commitment from the venire panel as to its willingness to accept Beckett's defense. Defense counsel's questions \"were not designed to uncover bias, but rather were argumentative in that they were intended to inject [his] argument into the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   examination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6865116\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/461/32/#p39\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Argument during voir dire is inappropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. E.D. 2009). Because defense counsel's questions were not designed to seek information about a critical fact but, instead, were intended to precondition the jury to the defense theory, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in curtailing the questioning. Having found no abuse of discretion, we need not consider the issue of prejudice. Point denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the prosecution's objection to defense counsel's\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questioning of the venire panel members about their ability to consider all the evidence once they heard that two shots were fired.
