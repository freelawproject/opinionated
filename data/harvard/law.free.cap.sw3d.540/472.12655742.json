Since that time until around June 6, 2017, the parties had no contact. On or around June 6, 2017, L.M.D. became lost and turned around in D.W.D.'s driveway, at which time D.W.D. flipped her off. On June 8, 2017, L.M.D. was at a local restaurant with a friend. D.W.D. entered the restaurant with his minor son and approached L.M.D. D.W.D. told her to never pull into his driveway again and L.M.D. told him never to flip her off again. D.W.D. responded not to worry because next time he would blow her head off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 9, 2017, L.M.D. filed a petition for an ex parte order of protection in Vernon County Circuit Court under section 455.020, which was granted. A hearing regarding a Full Order of Protection was held on June 16, 2017. On June 19, 2017, the trial court granted L.M.D. a full order of protection against D.W.D.

In his sole point on appeal, D.W.D. argues that the trial court erred in issuing a full order of protection in favor of L.M.D. because L.M.D. failed to prove that she was stalked as defined under section 455.010(14). D.W.D. argues that L.M.D. provided no evidence that D.W.D. engaged in an unwanted course of conduct because D.W.D. only initiated one unwanted contact with L.M.D., which is insufficient to establish a course of conduct as defined under section 455.010(14)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Any adult who has been subject to domestic violence by a present or former adult family or household member, or who has been the victim of stalking, may seek relief under section 455.010 to 455.085 by filing a verified petition alleging such domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault by the respondent.\" Section 455.020. \"As such, a full adult protection order may be entered only upon proof that the petitioner was: (1) subjected to abuse by a present or former adult family or household member or (2) subjected to stalking.\"\n   <em>\n    H.K.R. v.

App. W.D. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Because there is real harm that can result in abusing the Adult Abuse Act and its provisions, including the stigma that may attach to a respondent who is ultimately labeled a 'stalker,' trial courts must exercise great care to ensure that sufficient evidence exists to support all elements of the statute before entering a full order of protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    McGrath v.

The initial contact between the parties giving rise to this action was on June 6, 2017-when D.W.D. flipped off L.M.D. in his driveway, was initiated by L.M.D.-as she was the one to pull into the driveway of his home. L.M.D. testified regarding the driveway incident, \"I couldn't see that far away because it's way [sic] far away. It could have been him, it could have been someone else, but it was as tall as him. It could have been him.\" Even if it was in fact D.W.D. who extended his middle finger to her in the driveway, one incident of extending one's middle finger at another person who is turning around in a driveway from a distance where the person is difficult to even recognize does not qualify as an act which should reasonably cause alarm to another person. Further, because this interaction was initiated by L.M.D. by going onto D.W.D.'s property and the very limited nature of the interaction it does not qualify as part of an 'unwanted course of conduct'.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fowler v.

While the actions of D.W.D. toward L.M.D. at the restaurant are reprehensible, this one act fails to meet the requirements of the Adult Abuse Act. Therefore, one confrontation at the local restaurant is insufficient to support the issuance of a full order of protection against D.W.D. for stalking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fowler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091035,7090996\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/412/917/\">\n    412 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   922-23 ;\n   <em>\n    H.K.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299011\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/220/#p223\">\n    295 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   224 ;\n   <em>\n    Overstreet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050888\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/120/257/#p258\">\n    120 S.W.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
