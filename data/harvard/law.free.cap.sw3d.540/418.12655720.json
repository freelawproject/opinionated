We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2013, the State charged McIntosh with first-degree statutory sodomy\n   and first-degree statutory rape based on allegations that he had licked his nine-year-old cousin's vagina and anus. McIntosh waived his right to a jury trial in exchange for the State's agreement that he would not be sentenced to more than twenty years' incarceration if found guilty. The case proceeded to a bench trial in January 2016. Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the evidence at trial showed the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 12, 2013, the victim in this case (whom we refer to as \"TJ\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was staying at her grandmother's house while her mother was in the hospital. TJ's twenty-year-old cousin, Miguel McIntosh, lived at their grandmother's house. TJ testified that, at around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. that night, McIntosh came into her bedroom. McIntosh first told her \"not to worry\" about him, but then he grabbed her arm, flipped her onto her hands and knees, and held her down. He removed her pajama bottoms and underwear and then licked her anus and her vagina. McIntosh let TJ go when she said that she had to go to the bathroom. TJ instead ran to Grandmother's bedroom and told her what had happened. Grandmother confronted McIntosh with what TJ had told her and told him that he had to leave. McIntosh did not respond but gathered his belongings and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TJ was first interviewed at school by an investigator with the Children's Division. She then was referred to the Child Protection Center for a forensic interview. Kristin Gilgour testified that she interviewed TJ for the Child Protection Center, and the State introduced a video recording and transcript of that interview into evidence. The State also introduced a video recording of McIntosh's interrogation by the police and played that for the court. During the interrogation, McIntosh acknowledged that he had engaged in the acts that TJ had alleged. A letter of apology that McIntosh had written to TJ also was admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State also presented the testimony of Grandmother and of TJ's mother. Grandmother confirmed that, while McIntosh and TJ were staying with her in March 2013, TJ came to her one night and reported that McIntosh had done something sexual to her. Mother testified that Grandmother was caring for TJ while Mother was having a baby and that TJ told her McIntosh had attempted to sexually abuse her at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the close of the State's evidence, defense counsel announced that she had no evidence to present and submitted a motion for acquittal at the close of all the evidence. Both sides made brief arguments on the motion focusing on whether the State had to prove penetration on the statutory sodomy charge. The court overruled the motion and then announced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Okay, so considering the evidence in the case and the information in lieu of indictment on Count I ..., the Court finds that the defendant is guilty and that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the crimes charged, and, therefore, finds the defendant guilty on Count I of Statutory Sodomy in the First Degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On Count II, the Class B felony of Child Molestation in the First Degree, the Court finds the defendant guilty and finds that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the [crime], in that the defendant\n   knowingly subjected [TJ] who was then under 14 years of age to sexual contact by putting his tongue on her anus for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his own sexual desire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   And the Court having made those findings will request a Sentencing Assessment Report, and we can set a sentencing hearing now or we can wait until we receive that, the SAR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The prosecutor agreed to set a date for sentencing, but defense counsel objected to the lack of closing argument, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Your Honor, I am not trying to cause any problems; however, I think I'm going to, I think so that the record is clear, I'm going to object to the fact that we were not allowed to make a closing argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court acknowledged its mistake in issuing a verdict without hearing closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: I'm sorry. You're right. That was my fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Do you wish to make a closing argument now? And if you would like to, you can do it in the morning if you want to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I can-I just don't know. I've never been in a situation where you've already made a ruling. I'm not sure how to proceed since-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And I apologize for this. I am-you know, I have really been fixed on looking at the clock here because I have a commitment this evening. And so I will-you know, totally retract what I have just done. That was really my fault. And so, you know, if you would like to proceed with closing arguments tomorrow morning, we can do that at 9 o'clock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. I think that would probably be in the best interests of Mr. McIntosh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Okay. We'll return then tomorrow morning. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When the trial resumed the next morning, the court stated that it had \"made a great misstep by announcing a verdict which I believe I set aside upon the objection of the defense counsel and for which I-again, I'm sorry for my complete mental glip.\" The court then asked defense counsel if she wanted to make any further record. Counsel declined to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties then presented their closing arguments. Defense counsel argued that certain inconsistencies between TJ's trial testimony and her deposition proved that, although McIntosh had attempted the charged acts, he did not complete them. Defense counsel conceded that the State had proven that McIntosh committed first-degree child molestation as to both counts and asked the court to find McIntosh guilty of that lesser-included offense on Count I. Following the State's rebuttal argument, the court took a recess. Upon reconvening, the court announced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In reviewing the State's Exhibit 15, the redacted copy of the statement made by [TJ] on March 29-actually, I think it was March 20th, it appears to me that in both cases this child victim describes licking in the hole. And I just for the record want to reference that. On page 9 of the CPC statement when she is describing the defendant's acts regarding her anus, at that point she said in response to the question she was asked, that it was like, in the hole. And I don't think there is any question about that in terms of the anus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition, on page 10 of that same statement, the child again describes the action that was taken towards her and the defendant's licking her near and around her vagina. And again, she specifically answered again at the bottom\n   on page 10 of that CPC statement that it was in the hole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court again having considered all of the evidence in this case finds that the defendant is guilty on Count I of Statutory Sodomy in the First Degree. And also finds the defendant guilty on Count II of Child Molestation, the Class B felony with which he is charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defense counsel made no further record, and the discussion turned to the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the court heard arguments from counsel and then sentenced McIntosh to concurrent prison sentences of twenty years for first-degree statutory sodomy and fifteen years for first-degree child molestation. Defense counsel made no further request for relief regarding the court's initial denial of closing argument. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When a party objects, and the objection is sustained, but the party does not request relief beyond what is given, the trial court's failure to provide additional relief is reviewable, if at all, for plain error only.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hartmann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995463\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/781/251/#p252\">\n    781 S.W.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (Mo. App. 1989). McIntosh concedes that he failed to properly preserve this claim by not making further objection or requesting any additional relief after the court set aside its initial finding of guilt and heard closing arguments. He, therefore, requests plain error review of his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 30.20 authorizes this Court to review, in its discretion, \"plain errors affecting substantial rights ... when the court finds that manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted therefrom.\" Our Supreme Court has established a threshold review to determine if a court should exercise its discretion to entertain a Rule 30.20 review of a claimed plain error. First, we determine whether or not the claimed error \"facially establishes substantial grounds for believing that 'manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice has resulted[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

If not, we should not exercise our discretion to conduct a Rule 30.20 plain error review. If, however, we conclude that we have passed this threshold, we may proceed to review the claim under a two-step process pursuant to Rule 30.20. In the first step, we decide whether plain error has, in fact, occurred.\n   <em>\n    State v.

If, however, we find plain error, we must continue to the second step to consider whether or not a miscarriage of justice or manifest injustice will occur if the error is left uncorrected.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6948130\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/600/#p607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6948130\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/600/#p607\">\n    at 607-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   McIntosh contends that the trial court plainly erred by not recusing or declaring a mistrial after it issued a judgment without first hearing closing arguments, and the error was not cured by withdrawing the judgment, hearing closing arguments, and then issuing the same judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A criminal defendant \"has an unfettered right under the Sixth Amendment ... to present a closing argument.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The circumstances of this case show that reversal is not warranted. Here, the trial court's statements and actions demonstrate that it was open to hearing and considering counsel's arguments. The court repeatedly noted that it had made a mistake in announcing\n   a decision before hearing argument and granted counsel an overnight recess to give counsel more time to prepare an argument. The court also took a recess after arguments were completed. When court reconvened, the judge discussed the evidence that she had considered, specifically, certain statements that TJ made during her interview at the Child Protection Center. In announcing its finding of guilt, the court stated that it had \"again\" considered all of the evidence in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596172\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/61/#p64\">\n    795 F.2d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   We accept the view that a trial judge, under these circumstances, is capable of keeping an open mind.

We conclude, therefore, that defense counsel was permitted to make his closing argument to an attentive, open-minded trier of fact[, and] Price was not denied effective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The same is true here. There was \"neither an explicit statement nor an implicit suggestion\" that McIntosh's closing argument did not receive open-minded consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1596172\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/795/61/#p64\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although the court had expressed an opinion about the evidence before closing argument, \"equating [that] with an absolute refusal to hear or consider closing arguments\" is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westenfelder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Appx.%20302\">\n    70 Fed.

Rather, McIntosh was permitted to make a closing argument to an attentive, open-minded trier of fact and was not denied effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   McIntosh also claims that the trial judge was obligated to recuse herself because her premature finding of guilt raised questions about her impartiality. As expressed by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Here, the trial judge did not render an opinion based on information from a source outside her participation in the case, nor did she consider \"evidence properly in the case for an illegitimate purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091793\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/402/86/#p92\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, she went to great lengths to allow McIntosh a closing argument and to show that she received that argument with an open mind.

The court cured its error by setting aside that finding and allowing counsel to make arguments to an attentive, open-minded finder of fact before rendering a final judgment.
