At all times relevant to the case, the plaintiff, Rodney Rollins, a resident of New York, maintained a savings and a checking account with the defendant, People\u2019s Bank Corporation, a Connecticut state chartered bank. Sometime prior to October, 2000, the plaintiff was released on parole after serving a term of imprisonment for a crime that he had committed in the state of New York. Between October, 2000, and January, 2003, officers of the New York state division of parole (division of parole) issued subpoenas to the defendant directing it to disclose certain information about the plaintiffs bank accounts. In response to the subpoenas, the defendant provided the division of parole with information about the plaintiffs accounts, including the plaintiffs application information, bank statements and canceled checks. According to the plaintiff, he did not receive notice of the subpoenas as required by \u00a7 36a-43. In reliance on the financial information that the defendant had disclosed pursuant to the subpoenas, the division of parole sought to revoke the plaintiffs parole, and the plaintiff was incarcerated immediately.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>mately, however, the division of parole was unable to meet its burden of establishing that the plaintiff had. violated his parole, and the plaintiff was released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The plaintiff subsequently commenced a diversity action against the defendant in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking compensatory and punitive damages for, inter alia, the defendant\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 36a-43. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had violated \u00a7 36a-43 (a) by complying with the subpoenas without first ascertaining that the plaintiff had been served notice of those subpoenas at least ten days prior to the disclosure of the information requested therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the parties filed a joint petition for certification to this court, which the District Court granted. We then accepted the following three questions of law certified by the District Court: (1) \u201cIs a private right of action implied under Connecticut law in favor of a customer and against a financial institution for disclosure of a customer\u2019s financial records in violation of ...[\u00a7] 36a-42 or [\u00a7] 36a-43?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) \u201cDoes the exception contained in [General Statutes] \u00a7 36a-44 (7)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for \u2018disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>sure to appropriate officials of federal, state, or local governments upon suspected violations of the criminal law\u2019 apply when such suspicion originated in the law enforcement agency, as opposed to the [financial [ijnstitution?\u201d (3) \u201cIf questions [1 and 2] are both answered in the affirmative, do the requirements of ...[\u00a7] 36a-43 still apply?\u201d Our negative answer to the first question renders it unnecessary for us to consider the second and third certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Whether a statute creates an implied private right of action is a matter of statutory construction. When, as in the present case, a statutory provision is silent with respect to whether it creates a private remedy, our analysis is not limited by General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z, which provides that the meaning of statutes shall be ascertained from only their text and their relationship to other statutes if those sources reveal an unambiguous meaning that is not absurd or unworkable. Cf. <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>277 Conn. 238, 246-48, 890 A.2d 522 (2006). In addition to the words of the statute itself, \u201cwe look to . . . the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d <em>Eder Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>275 Conn. 363, 372, 880 A.2d 138 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201c[A]s the party seeking to invoke an implied right of action, the [plaintiff bears] the burden of demonstrating that such an action is created implicitly in the statute.\u201d <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 246. \u201cIn determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class for whose . . . benefit the statute was enacted . . . ? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 249, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997). Furthermore, the plaintiff also \u201cmust demonstrate ... in applying [this] three part test . . . [that] no factor weighs against affording an implied right of action and [that] the balance of factors weighs in [his] favor.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201cIn examining these three factors, each is not necessarily entitled to equal weight. Clearly, these factors overlap to some extent with each other, in that the ultimate question is whether there is sufficient evidence that the legislature intended to authorize [the plaintiff] to bring a private cause of action despite having failed expressly to provide for one. . . . Therefore, although the [plaintiff] must meet a threshold showing that none of the three factors weighs against recognizing a private right of action, stronger evidence in favor of one factor may form the lens through which we determine whether the [plaintiff] satisfies] the other factors. Thus, the amount and persuasiveness of evidence supporting each factor may vary, and the court must consider all evidence that could bear on each factor. It bears repeating, however, that the [plaintiff] must meet the threshold showing that none of the three factors weighs against recognizing a private right of action.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>With these principles in mind, we begin our analysis with the language of General Statutes \u00a7 36a-42, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA financial institution may not disclose to any person, except to the customer or the customer\u2019s duly authorized agent, any financial records relating to such customer unless the customer has authorized disclosure to such person or the financial records are disclosed in response to ... (2) a lawful subpoena, summons, warrant or court order as provided in section 36a-43 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-43 (a), in turn, provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in section 36a-44, a financial institution shall disclose financial records pursuant to a lawful subpoena, summons, warrant or court order served upon it if the party seeking the records causes such subpoena, summons, warrant or court order or a certified copy thereof to be served upon the customer whose records are being sought, at least ten days prior to the date on which the records are to be disclosed . . . .\u201d Subsection (b) of General Statutes \u00a7 36a-43 provides: \u201cA customer of a financial institution shall have standing to challenge a subpoena of the customer\u2019s financial records, by filing an application or motion to quash in a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the filing of such application or motion by the customer, and service of such application or motion upon the financial institution and the person issuing the subpoena, production of the records shall be stayed, without liability to the financial institution, until the court holds a hearing on the motion or application and an order is entered sustaining, modifying or quashing the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">There is no question that the plaintiff, as a customer of the defendant, belongs to the class of persons for whose benefit \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43 were enacted. As former Justice Ellen A. Peters explained in her concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>179 Conn. 102, 425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>A.2d 588 (1979), \u201c[t]he legislative history of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1979)] \u00a7 36-9Z [which subsequently was transferred to \u00a7 36a-43]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> indicates that the statute was intended to provide bank customers an opportunity to challenge, in court, the propriety of disclosure of their bank records. The statute was passed after and, at least in part, in response to . . . <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 444-45, 96 S. Ct. 1619, 48 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1976), in which the United States Supreme Court held that a bank customer has no constitutional right to contest the issuance of a subpoena directing a bank to disclose information pertaining to his or her bank accounts]. ... At the [legislative] hearings concerning [the proposed legislation that is now codified at \u00a7 36a-43], the . . . chief sponsor [of the legislation] testified that the . . . provision requiring ten days\u2019 notice before the disclosure of bank records was purposely designed to enable a customer to contest a subpoena in court, if he so chose. [20] H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1977 Sess., p. 2635.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 108 <em>(Peters, J., </em>concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also 31 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1977 Sess., pp. 2225-26, remarks of Senator Steven C. Casey (\u201c[\u00a7 36a-43] simply gives a bank customer legal standing to challenge a subpoena of his bank records in certain instances\u201d); 20 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2636, remarks of Representative William J. Scully, Jr. (\u201c[Section 36a-42] is purely and simply a consumer protection measure. . . . [I]t affords customers confidentiality [in] the treatment of their records by financial institutions.\u201d). Accordingly, the plaintiff has satisfied the first prong of the three part <em>Napoletano </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We turn, therefore, to the second prong of that test, which requires us to determine whether the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>statutory provisions indicate a legislative intent either to create or to deny a private right of action under \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43. This is not the first time we have considered whether a private remedy is implied under \u00a7 36a-43. In <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 106-107, we held that the legislature did not intend to confer standing on a bank customer to contest the legal sufficiency of a subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 36-9Z (now codified as amended at \u00a7 36a-43). That case, however, was decided pursuant to a previous version of the statute that, unlike the present statute, did not expressly confer standing on a bank customer to challenge a subpoena of his bank records. Instead, the original statute provided in relevant part: \u201cA financial institution shall disclose financial records pursuant to a lawful subpoena, summons, warrant or court order served upon it if such subpoena, summons, warrant or court order ... is also served upon the customer whose records are being sought, at least ten days prior to the date on which the records are to be disclosed . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 36-9Z.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In a short per curiam decision, the majority rejected the bank customer\u2019s contention that, in enacting General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 36-9Z, the legislature had intended to afford a bank customer a statutory right to challenge the legal sufficiency of a subpoena. The court concluded, rather, that \u201c[h]ad the legislature, which acted after the United States Supreme Court decisions [in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 425 U.S. 444-45, and <em>California Bankers Assn. </em>v. <em>Shultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 53, 94 S. Ct. 1494, 39 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1974)], intended to create such a right, it would have specifically written it into the statute.\u201d <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 106. As we indicated previously, Justice Peters disagreed with the majority on this point. In her concurring and dissenting opinion, she stated that \u201c[t]he text of [the statute] is clear and explicit that a customer is entitled to notice ten days prior to disclosure of his financial records by a financial institution. While the statute does not expressly authorize the right to participate in a hearing concerning the records to be subpoenaed, such a right is a logical and necessary inference from the right to notice.\u201d Id., 109 <em>(Peters, J., </em>concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Several years later, in response to this court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>the legislature enacted Public Acts 1988, No. 88-251 (P.A. 88-251), which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 36-9Z by affording a bank customer standing to challenge a subpoena issued pursuant to the statute. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>219 Conn. 204, 210-11, 592 A.2d 925 (1991) (\u201c[P.A. 88-251] was intended to overturn the ruling on standing in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Elinois </em>and to spell out the procedural rights that had been judicially viewed to have been lacking earlier\u201d). Attorney Todd R. Bainer, who had brought <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Elinois, </em>to the attention of the legislature, was the sole witness to testify regarding the proposed amendment. Bainer explained that, \u201c[f]rom Justice [Peters\u2019] dissent in [the case], it seems clear that the legislature intended that the customer have standing to contest any subpoena directed at [his or her] bank. Yet, because the statute doesn\u2019t spell that out, the courts are holding such a right not to exist and are denying customer\u2019s motions to quash subpoenas of their bank records on the basis of <em>[In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201cI suggest . . . some minor amendment to [General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 36-9? (a)], specifically stating that the customer has the right under the statute to [move] the court to quash the subpoena of [his or her] bank [records] . . . .\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1988 Sess., p. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Thereafter, in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 204, this court was required to determine whether P.A. 88-251 \u201cconfers standing [on] a bank customer to challenge alleged procedural deficiencies in the manner in which investigative subpoenas for his bank records were served [on] his bank.\u201d Id., 205. We concluded that it does not. Id., 209, 211-12. The plaintiff bank customers in <em>Morgan </em>had filed applications to quash four administrative subpoenas duces tecum that the banking commissioner had directed to be served on several banks in which the bank customers maintained accounts. Id., 205-206. \u201cThe trial court granted the applications to quash, in some instances because of the state\u2019s failure to pay witness fees to the banks, and in others because of the sheriffs choice of an inappropriate person to serve within the bank.\u201d Id., 206. On appeal, the commissioner claimed, inter alia, that the bank customers lacked standing to raise the issues on which the trial court had relied in quashing the subpoenas. Id., 208-209. We agreed. In reaching our conclusion, we explained that \u201c\u00a7 36-9? (b) was enacted to afford a bank customer the opportunity to contest the validity of those inquiries about his bank records for which he had been entitled to receive notice under \u00a7 36-9? (a) as originally enacted. Armed with notice under \u00a7 36-9? (a) and a right to a hearing under \u00a7 36-9? (b), a customer has standing to challenge the substantive propriety of the disclosure of his records, on grounds such as those at issue in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, </em>Illinois: that there is no authority for the issuance of the subpoena; or that the customer\u2019s financial records are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>immaterial to the investigation. To protect access to these substantive rights, a customer undoubtedly also has standing to challenge the timeliness and the manner of service of his own \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(a) notice. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u201cNothing in the text of \u00a7 36-9l (b) or in its legislative history suggests, however, that the legislature intended also to confer standing on a bank customer to challenge procedural irregularities in the manner in which an administrative subpoena has been served on the financial institution in which he has his account. To the contrary, Senator Casey\u2019s statement that the statute confers [on] a bank customer \u2018legal standing to challenge a subpoena of his bank records <em>in certain </em>instances\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> . . . confirms a construction that such standing is not unlimited.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 211-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Thus, in both <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>this court construed \u00a7 36-<em>91 </em>narrowly as giving rise only to such remedies as were clearly indicated in the text and legislative history of the statute. See id., 212; <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 106-107. Moreover, although both cases were decided prior to <em>Napoletano, </em>the analysis and outcome in each case are consistent with the analytic framework adopted in <em>Napoletano, </em>which, as we have explained, imposes on the plaintiff the considerable burden of demonstrating that, notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s failure expressly to authorize a private right of action, the legislature nevertheless intended to create one. See <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 246-48. With this background in mind, we turn to our examination of the second <em>Napoletano </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In the brief legislative history surrounding the statutes, we find no indication \u2014 nor has the plaintiff pointed to any \u2014 that the legislature intended to confer standing on a bank customer to bring a private action for a violation of either \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43. Indeed, to the extent that there is evidence of legislative intent with respect to civil enforcement of \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43, it indicates that the legislature intended to vest jurisdiction over their enforcement in the commissioner of banking (commissioner). See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50 (a) (1) and (2)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (authorizing commissioner to investigate, prosecute and impose fines of up to $100,000 per violation for violations of state banking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>laws); General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50 (b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (authorizing commissioner to bring action in court to enjoin any act or practice that violates state banking laws); General Statutes \u00a7 36a-51 (a) (authorizing commissioner to \u201csuspend, revoke or refuse to renew any license issued by the commissioner\u201d for violation of state banking laws). In fact, the only exception to what appears to be the commissioner\u2019s otherwise exclusive jurisdiction over civil enforcement of the state\u2019s banking laws is General Statutes \u00a7 36a-58, which establishes a private right of action in a financial institution to recover damages from its officers or directors who are found by the commissioner to have violated any provision of the banking laws.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This court previously has considered the exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tence of such alternative remedies and procedures for the enforcement of a statute as strong, if not conclusive, evidence of legislative intent <em>not </em>to create additional implied remedies under the statute. See, e.g., <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 257-59 (no implied private right of action under state fair housing law, General Statutes \u00a7 8~37cc [b], when statutory scheme vests oversight and enforcement in legislative and executive branches); <em>Eder Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wine Merchants of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 373-78 (no implied private right of action under Liquor Control Act when, with only one exception, statutory scheme vests enforcement of act in department of consumer protection); cf. <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 250-53 (recognizing implied private right of action under state managed care law when legislature did not expressly vest administrative agency with responsibility for enforcement). This is so because the existence of express remedies within a statute indicates that the legislature knows how to create remedies under the statute and, more importantly, that the legislature would have provided the remedy sought by the plaintiff if it had intended to do so. See, e.g., <em>Fedus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>278 Conn. 751, 770-71 n.17, 900 A.2d 1 (2006) (legislature knows how to enact legislation consistent with its intent); <em>Stitzer </em>v. <em>Rinaldi\u2019s Restaurant, </em>211 Conn. 116, 119, 557 A.2d 1256 (1989) (legislature knows how to use limiting terms when it chooses to do so); see also <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 295, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(applying \u201ctenet of statutory construction known as expressio unius est exclusio alterius, translated as the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Bridgeport Hospitals. Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995) (\u201c[u]nless there is evidence to the contrary, statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended the list to be exclusive\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, in the present case, we must assume that if the legislature had intended to create a private right of action under \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43, it would have done so explicitly, as it did in establishing the authority of the commissioner to investigate and seek redress under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-50 through 36a-53 for alleged violations of the banking laws, or as it did in establishing criminal penalties under \u00a7 36a-45 for violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-41 through 36a-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that the legislature must have intended to create a private right of action under \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43 because certain of the statutes\u2019 provisions are patterned after the federal Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (RFPA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401 et seq., which, unlike our own statutes, expressly authorizes a private action for damages. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3417 (2000).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are not persuaded. The RFPA was enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>after </em>the enactment of what is now \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43, and, therefore, it is highly unlikely that the federal statute served as a model for the state statutes. Moreover, even if the state statutes had been modeled after the RFPA, the fact that they do not contain an enforcement provision similar to that contained in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3417 is, in our view, more probative of a legislative intent to <em>omit </em>such a provision than to provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We also reject the plaintiffs contention that a legislative intent to create a private right of action can be inferred from General Statutes \u00a7 36a-44a, which requires all state financial institutions to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (GBLA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6801 et seq. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that because the GBLA requires all financial institutions to comply with the RFPA, and because the RFPA permits private enforcement actions, the legislature must have intended to create a private right of action under \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43. After carefully reviewing the GBLA, however, we find nothing in it to support the plaintiffs contention that it incorporates by reference the provisions of the RFPA. Moreover, even if it did, we highly doubt that the legislature would have taken such an attenuated path in creating a private cause of action under \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Finally, we also reject the plaintiffs contention that a private right of action may be inferred from General Statutes \u00a7 36a-43 (d), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o . . . financial institution shall be held civilly or criminally responsible for disclosure of financial records pursuant to a certificate, subpoena, summons, warrant or court order which on its face appears to have been issued upon lawful authority.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that \u201c[a] finding that a private right of action exists is especially appropriate . . . [because \u00a7 36a-43] itself refers to \u2018civil responsibility\u2019 for violation of the statute.\u201d As we have explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>however, in addition to the criminal penalties established under \u00a7 36a-45, the legislature also has vested the commissioner with the authority to impose various civil penalties for violations of \u00a7 36a-43. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-50 through 36a-53. The plaintiff has pointed to no evidence in the legislative histoiy of \u00a7 36a-43 (d) to suggest that the legislature was referring to anything other than the civil responsibility that might be imposed on a bank by virtue of these other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We turn, therefore, to the third and final <em>Napoletano </em>factor, which requires a determination of whether recognition of an implied private right of action under \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43 is consistent with the underlying purposes of the statutory scheme. The plaintiff argues that it is because recognizing such a right is \u201cthe most effective way to guarantee the confidentiality of a customer\u2019s records\u201d and because \u201cit is the aggrieved party, not the banking commissioner, who has the most at stake and is the most likely to seek redress\u201d for alleged violations of the statutes. We reject the plaintiffs contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Indeed, we rejected a similar argument in <em>Asylum Hill Problem Solving Revitalization Assn. </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 277 Conn. 238, in which the plaintiffs, a low income resident of a certain neighborhood in the city of Hartford and an association that represents the interests of such residents, had contended that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislature had vested enforcement of General Statutes \u00a7 8-37cc (b)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in the legislative and executive branches, an implied private right of action also should be inferred because the remedies provided under the statute were inadequate and because the legislative history surrounding the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>clearly indicated that the plaintiffs were its intended beneficiaries. Id., 241-42, 258. In rejecting this argument, we explained that, although it might further the goals of \u00a7 8-37cc (b) to permit the plaintiffs to bring an enforcement action, the plaintiffs had \u201cmisconstrue [d] the court\u2019s role in applying the <em>Napoletano </em>test. We do not decide whether the legislature should have supplied a private right of action; rather, we consider whether and how remedies <em>were </em>provided as an indication of the legislature\u2019s intent to confer a private right of action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 258. We further stated that, \u201c[i]n determining whether it would be consistent with the purpose of the statute to permit such an action, [which was the question presented under the third prong of <em>Napoletano, </em>the court] must look not only to the broad purpose of the . . . [statute], but also to the more specific purpose evidenced by the choices made by the legislature as to how the particular provision would ensure enforcement of its . . . goals.\u201d Id., 258-59. Thus, we concluded that, because the legislature had vested enforcement of \u00a7 8-37cc (b) in the legislative and executive branches, it was not our place to override that express intent by engrafting additional remedies onto it. See id., 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The same reasoning applies in the present case. Even if we were to conclude that it would further the goals of \u00a7\u00a7 36a-42 and 36a-43 to permit bank customers to bring a private action to enforce either or both statutes, it is not our province to override the clear preferences of the legislature regarding how the statutes are to be enforced, as evidenced by the remedies that were adopted. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot meet his burden of establishing that none of the three <em>Napoletano </em>factors militates against the recognition of a private right of action under \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Accordingly, the answer to the first certified question is: No. Because we conclude that there is no implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>private right of action under \u00a7 36a-42 or \u00a7 36a-43, we need not answer the second and third certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"ADB\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States ... if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-42 provides: \u201cA financial institution may not disclose to any person, except to the customer or the customer\u2019s duly authorized agent, any financial records relating to such customer unless the customer has authorized disclosure to such person or the financial records are disclosed in response to (1) a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Administrative Services or the Commissioner of Social Services pursuant to the provisions of section 17b-137, (2) a lawful subpoena, summons, warrant or court order as provided in section 36a-43, (3) interrogatories by a judgment creditor or a demand by a levying officer as provided in sections 52-351b and 52-356a, (4) a certificate issued by a medical provider or its attorney under subsection (b) of section 17b-124, provided nothing in this subsection shall require the provider or its attorney to furnish to the financial institution any application for medical assistance filed pursuant to an agreement with the IV-D agency under subsection (c) of section 17b-137, (5) a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Veterans\u2019 Affairs pursuant to section 27-117, or (6) the consent of an elderly person or the representative of such elderly person provided to a person, department, agency or commission pursuant to section 17b-454, provided the financial institution shall have no obligation to determine the capacity of such elderly person or the representative of such elderly person to provide such consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Although \u00a7 36a-42 was amended in 2001 and 2003; see Public Acts, Spec.
