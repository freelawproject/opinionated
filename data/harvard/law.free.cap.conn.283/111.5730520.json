The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s claim, reversing the judgment of the trial court and ordering a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>93 Conn. App. 671, 672, 890 A.2d 586 (2006). Thereafter, we granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding proof beyond a reasonable doubt was constitutionally infirm?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>278 Conn. 902, 896 A.2d 105 (2006). We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>determination that the instruction on reasonable doubt impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof was improper, and, accordingly, we reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \u201cOn May 3, 2002, while incarcerated at the New Haven correctional center, the defendant underwent two strip searches after a correctional officer received information from informants that the defendant was in possession of narcotics. A correctional officer, while searching the defendant a second time, found a substance in his sock that later tested positive for cocaine. At trial, the court instructed the jury regarding reasonable doubt as follows: \u2018The state has the burden of proving each and every element necessary to constitute . . . the crime charged. And I\u2019ll instruct on those elements later in my charge. The defendant does not have to prove his innocence in any way or present any evidence to disprove the charge against him. The state has the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of you may be aware that in civil cases jurors are told that it\u2019s only necessary to prove that a fact is more likely true than not true. In criminal cases, the state\u2019s proof must be more powerful than that: It must be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u201c \u2018Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There are very few things in the world that we know with absolute certainty, and in criminal law cases, the law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt. If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you must find him guilty. If, on the other hand, based on the evidence or lack of evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, you must give him the benefit of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>doubt and find him not guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts and procedural history. After the trial court\u2019s instruction, the defendant took exception to the reasonable doubt charge on the ground that it \u201cdiffer[ed] from the standard reasonable doubt charge that is routinely given by the court\u201d because it did not describe a reasonable doubt as a \u201cdoubt which would cause you as reasonable and prudent men and women to hesitate to act in the more weighty and important matters relating to your affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The trial court acknowledged that the charge differed from the standard instructions and made the following observation: \u201c[Y]our exception is noted, sir. And I wish to make a brief statement for the record in the hypothetical event that my charge would be reviewed by either the Appellate or Connecticut Supreme Court or indeed any other court; that is, counsel is correct that the charge just given does differ in some respects from the charge, I would say, typically given on reasonable doubt in the Connecticut courts and designedly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u201cI am convinced, after [fourteen] years of being a judge and many years of practice before that, that the standard reasonable doubt charge in Connecticut is unsatisfactory. It is satisfactory only in the sense that it is routinely upheld by the appellate courts, which is a considerable advantage, to be sure. But over the years I\u2019ve become convinced that jurors\u2019 eyes glaze over when it is given and it is not fully understood and, therefore, does not do adequate justice to the parties and I believe needs to be modernized, simplified, put into plain language but, obviously, appropriate language.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\u201cThe charge given by the court is a slight variation of the charge on reasonable doubt recommended by Justice Ginsburg of the Supreme Court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>States in <em>Victors. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, [27, 114 S. Ct. 1239, 127 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1994)]. It is a charge proposed by the Federal Judicial Center in creating criminal juiy instructions for the federal courts, and I believe that it is much superior to the charge given.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u201cI welcome appellate review of the charge and if it is wrong, it is for the Appellate Court to say. If they say that it is wrong, I will respect their judgment, but, respectfully, from a trial judge\u2019s perspective, the charge just given is a preferable charge. [A]nd based on my experience as a lawyer, as a trial judge, and based on my conversations with many other trial court judges over the years . . . those are my observations but your exception is noted, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Thereafter, the jury found the defendant guilty, and the court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. Following the sentencing, the defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court\u2019s juiy instruction on reasonable doubt improperly had diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Specifically, he claimed that \u201cthe court\u2019s instruction that the juiy must be \u2018firmly convinced\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s guilt, by failing to define further and properly the teim \u2018reasonable doubt,\u2019 misled the jury to a finding of guilt by a lesser standard of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the court failed to distinguish the clear and convincing standard of proof from the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, he also claim[ed] the state\u2019s burden of proof was impermissibly diluted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant and reversed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 679. Specifically, the court noted that, \u201c[i]n cases where the language \u2018a firm conviction of the guilt of the accused\u2019 has been approved by our Supreme Court and this court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>charge also has included language defining reasonable doubt as opposed to possible doubt.\u201d Id., 677. The Appellate Court observed that, unlike the federal instruction on which the trial court had modeled its instruction, the court\u2019s instruction here \u201cdid not point out that a possible doubt is not a reasonable doubt because a reasonable doubt involves a \u2018real possibility that the defendant was not guilty\u2019 and failed to distinguish the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt from the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 678. The Appellate Court also expressed concern that the instruction had failed to define reasonable doubt as one \u201cfor which a valid reason can be assigned,\u201d a definition previously approved by both the United States Supreme Court and this court, which \u201cpoints out the difference between a fanciful or speculative doubt, which the state\u2019s evidence need not overcome, and a real doubt that is based on reason, which the state\u2019s evidence must overcome.\u201d Id. For these reasons, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction had misled the jury into finding \u201cguilt based on a degree of proof below what is constitutionally required\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s conviction therefore must be reversed. Id., 679. The state\u2019s certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On appeal to this court, the state contends that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the instruction had diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We begin with our well established jurisprudence. \u201cIt is fundamental that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970) .... The [reasonable doubt concept] provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014 that bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law. . . . [Id.], 363. At the same time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>by impressing upon the [fact finder] the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused, the [reasonable doubt] standard symbolizes the significance that our society attaches to the criminal sanction and thus to liberty itself. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>[443 U.S. 307, 315, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)]. [Consequently, the defendant] in a criminal case [is] entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge by the court that the guilt of the [defendant] must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201cIn determining whether a trial court\u2019s charge satisfies constitutional requirements, however, individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 105-106, 836 A.2d 224 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S. Ct. 1614, 158 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The words \u201creasonable doubt\u201d are a time honored hallmark of criminal jurisprudence; \u201c[t]he perfect definition of \u2018reasonable doubt,\u2019 however, is as uncertain as its place in American jurisprudence is certain.\u201d <em>Chalmers </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>73 F.3d 1262, 1266 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 834, 117 S. Ct. 106, 136 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1996). Aside from imposing the general standard of reasonable doubt as a constitutional mandate, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>United States Supreme Court has not provided a clear and simple definition, expressing instead a reluctance to impose a specific jury instruction. Indeed, the court has explained that \u201cthe [constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising a jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 5. As a consequence, the major constraint on trial courts that formulate reasonable doubt instructions is that they avoid certain language that categorically has been rejected. See, e.g., <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 41, 111 S. Ct. 328, 112 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1990) (instruction equating reasonable doubt with \u201c \u2018grave uncertainty\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018actual substantial doubt\u2019 \u201d <em>coupled with </em>phrase \u201c \u2018to a moral certainty\u2019 \u201d impermissibly suggested higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under reasonable doubt standard). Similarly, since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Victor, </em>absent circumstances wherein this court has deemed it appropriate to invoke our supervisory authority over the administration of justice to proscribe the use of certain questionable language; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>253 Conn. 195, 209-10, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000) (prohibiting future use of \u201ctwo inference\u201d language); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delvalle, </em>250 Conn. 466, 473-76, 736 A.2d 135 (1999) (prohibiting future use of \u201ca doubt suggested by the ingenuity of counsel\u201d language); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 168, 728 A.2d 466 (prohibiting future use of language that \u201ca rule of law . . . made to protect the innocent and not the guilty\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999); the court generally has left the formation of an appropriate reasonable doubt instruction to the discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s claim before the Appellate Court focused on the trial court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cfirmly convinced,\u201d which he claimed had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof from a beyond a reasonable doubt standard to a clear and convincing evidence standard. Although both this court and the Appellate Court have approved similar language; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 370, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>58 Conn. App. 296, 309, 752 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 944, 762 A.2d 906 (2000); the Appellate Court concluded that the instructions in the present case were constitutionally infirm because they failed also to include other explanatory phrases. Specifically, the Appellate Court pointed to the fact that the trial court did not utilize the language in the federal model instruction defining a reasonable doubt as a \u201creal possibility [that the defendant] is not guilty\u201d; Federal Judicial Center, Modem Federal Jury Instructions: Criminal Pattern Jury Instmctions (1991), Instmction 21, p. FJC-18;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or present an alternative definition of a reasonable doubt approved by the United States Supreme Court as \u201ca real doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned,\u201d which points out the difference \u201cbetween a fanciful or speculative doubt, which the state\u2019s evidence need not overcome, and a real doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that is based on reason, which the state\u2019s evidence must overcome.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 678. We disagree with the Appellate Court that, by using the phrase \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d without further explanation, the instructions failed to distinguish the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt from the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">First, we note that the \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d charge that was given in this case was derived from, and is nearly identical to, the pertinent part of the model instruction on reasonable doubt developed by a committee of federal judges on behalf of the Federal Judicial Center. See footnote 1 of this opinion. That model instruction has been endorsed by a number of state and federal courts. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>73 F.3d 975, 980 (10th Cir. 1995) (instruction \u201ccopied virtually verbatim\u201d from Federal Judicial Center\u2019s instructions was \u201ccorrect and comprehensible statement of the reasonable doubt standard\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 F.3d 125, 128 (5th Cir.) (noting that Fifth Circuit previously has endorsed pertinent section of Federal Judicial Center\u2019s instruction as constitutionally sufficient and declining to find it improper under court\u2019s supervisory authority), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>513 U.S. 894, 115 S. Ct. 246, 130 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Portillo, </em>182 Ariz. 592, 596, 898 P.2d 970 (1995) (invoking court\u2019s supervisory authority requiring Arizona trial courts prospectively to give Federal Judicial Center\u2019s instruction because it \u201cmost fairly and accurately conveys the meaning of reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Winegeart v. State, </em>665 N.E.2d 893, 902 (Ind. 1996) (recommending that Indiana courts use Federal Judicial Center\u2019s instruction); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Merwin, </em>131 Idaho 642, 647-48, 962 P.2d 1026 (1998) (concluding that trial court\u2019s substitution of Federal Judicial Center instruction for Idaho model instruction was not constitutional error, but directing trial courts to use Idaho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>model); <em>State </em>v. <em>Putz, </em>266 Neb. 37, 47-49, 662 N.W.2d 606, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1016, 124 S. Ct. 568, 157 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2003) (\u201cfirmly convinced\u201d language in context with remainder of charge adequately conveys standard of reasonable doubt); <em>State </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>324 S.C. 114, 115-16, 477 S.E.2d 710 (1996) (concluding that trial court\u2019s instruction following federal instruction was not improper). Indeed, as a general matter, instructions describing proof beyond a reasonable doubt in terms of the jury\u2019s responsibility to be \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt before rendering a guilty verdict routinely have been accepted as constitutionally sufficient, even if they do not utilize the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s proposed charge verbatim. See, e.g., <em>Mills </em>v. <em>State, </em>732 A.2d 845, 852-53 (Del. 1999) (instruction correctly conveyed concept of reasonable doubt and comported with due process); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hams, </em>870 S.W.2d 798, 811 (Mo.) (\u201c \u2018[f] irmly convinced\u2019 is essentially synonymous with \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 953, 115 S. Ct. 371, 130 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1994); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>90 Haw. 113, 128-29, 976 P.2d 427 (App. 1998) (concluding that \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d suggests lesser burden than beyond reasonable doubt), aff d in part, 90 Haw. 65, 976 P.2d 379 (1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, numerous commentators have endorsed the \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d charge and recommended it as an accurate description of the reasonable doubt standard. See, e.g., A. Minhas, \u201cProof Beyond a Reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Doubt: Shifting Sands of a Bedrock?\u201d 23 N. Ill. U. L.

Power, \u201cReasonable and Other Doubts: The Problem of Jury Instructions,\u201d 67 Term. L. Rev. 45, 85 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Although the trial court did not further define reasonable doubt as a \u201creal possibility,\u201d as does the model definition, that omission did not convert the state\u2019s burden of proof to one of clear and convincing evidence or suggest to the jury that something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt was sufficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>80 F.3d 560, 566 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting claim that \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d language \u201csuggests a burden of proof akin to the civil \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 standard\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>997 F.2d 1551, 1557 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (rejecting claim that \u201cinstructing jurors that they must be \u2018firmly convinced\u2019 of a defendant\u2019s guilt lowers the government's burden of proof\u2019); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>794 F.2d 1095, 1100-1101 (5th Cir. 1986) (concluding that \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d adequately conveys \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 20 F.3d 131 (first concluding that \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d instruction properly conveyed burden of proof and then rejecting defendant\u2019s challenge to \u201creal possibility\u201d language because that language enhanced \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d instruction); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barrera-Gonzales, </em>952 F.2d 1269, 1272-73 (10th Cir. 1992) (first concluding that \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d language was not improper, although \u201c \u2018hesitate to act\u2019 \u201d instruction preferable, and then rejecting defendant\u2019s challenge to \u201creal possibility\u201d language on ground that it is similar to permissible \u201creal doubt\u201d language). We find the Appellate Court\u2019s concern, that lay jurors, whom we know generally are unfamiliar with the three tiers of burden of proof in our jurisprudence, when hearing the firmly convinced language somehow would equate it with the \u201cclear and convincing standard,\u201d to be unfounded. First, jurors typically lack the familiarity with the clear and convincing standard of proof that would give rise to the risk that they would equate the \u201cconvinced\u201d language with that intermediate burden of proof. Second, even if some jurors are aware of the clear and convincing standard, that standard would require only a \u201chigh probability\u201d; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 Conn. 296, 323, 796 A.2d 516 (2002); not that they be \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt in order to convict.

Indeed, the juxtaposition in the present case of the two concepts, \u201cfirm conviction\u201d and \u201ca reasonable doubt,\u201d made it abundantly clear that proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires more that a \u201chigh probability\u201d that the state\u2019s allegations were true.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The instruction properly informed the jury that the standard in criminal cases mandates a \u201cfirm conviction\u201d of guilt that is devoid of any rational basis for questioning the truth of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s additional instruction in this case \u2014 \u201c[i]f, on the other hand, based on the evidence or lack of evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, you must give him the benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty\u201d \u2014 explained to the jury that, should it harbor any reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt, it was obligated to afford the benefit of that doubt to the defendant and acquit him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the basis of the instructions, taken as a whole; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>see <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 105-106; we conclude that the jury in the present case properly was informed that, if it was firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt based on the evidence, then it did not harbor any reasonable doubt about that guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The test we apply in evaluating the constitutionality of a reasonable doubt instruction is not whether we find it exemplary; rather, we inquire only whether there is a \u201creasonable likelihood that the jury understood the [instruction] to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet\u201d the reasonable doubt standard. <em>Victory.

Although we have concluded in the present case that the instruction properly set forth a constitutionally sufficient description of the state\u2019s burden, we nevertheless take this opportunity to acknowledge that \u201c[composing a perfect definition of reasonable doubt may be an illusory goal, but perfection and certitude are rare in any intellectual discipline whether it be scientific or humanistic.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 20 F.3d 132.

Thus, we have repeatedly stated that attempts to clarify reasonable doubt should be avoided because they often tend to obfuscate that concept.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 476, 678 A.2d 910 (1996) (similarly cautioning about attempts to clarify meaning of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 457, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (same), aff'd after remand, 252 Conn. 128, 750 A.2d 448, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 835, 121 S.

Therefore, we do not fault the trial court in the present case for not defining the phrase reasonable doubt as proposed by the Federal Judicial Center as a \u201creal possibility that the defendant is not guilty,\u201d which the Appellate Court cited to as a basis for its decision reversing the judgment in the present case; nor do we fault the trial court for failing to define expressly the term reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Having said that, however, we note that our appellate courts previously have approved many attempts to define that term. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 193 (reasonable doubt is \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 264 Conn. 104 (reasonable doubt is \u201cthe kind of doubt which in the serious affairs which concern you in everyday life you would pay heed to and attention to\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 369 (\u201c[a reasonable doubt] is such a doubt that as in the serious affairs of every day life you would pay heed to\u201d [internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tion marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>28 Conn. App. 231, 240-41, 611 A.2d 902 (\u201creasonable doubt [is] one which a person \u2018would pay some heed to\u2019 in his or her daily affairs\u201d), cert. denied, 223 Conn. 922, 614 A.2d 827 (1992). Moreover, we never have held that the concept of reasonable doubt is undefinable, or that trial courts should not, as a matter of course, provide a definition. As the foregoing discussion illustrates, there is no mandatory or talismanic phraseology that if spoken will render the instruction constitutionally sufficient. \u201c[E]ven if definitions of reasonable doubt are necessarily imperfect, the alternative \u2014 refusing to define the concept at all \u2014 is not obviously preferable.\u201d <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 26 (Ginsberg, J., concurring). Therefore, we encourage our trial judges to exercise their reasoned discretion, as did Judge Blue in the present case, to fashion a proper instruction. Reference to the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s instruction in the present case was appropriate, and we particularly cite with approval the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s instruction attempting to improve upon that model federal charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>147 N.J. 43, 61, 685 A.2d 1242 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1190, 117 S.

See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>786 F.2d 45, 51-52 (2d Cir. 1986) (\u201cAs for the [District [CJourt\u2019s use of the \u2018real possibility\u2019 language, found in Federal Judicial Center Committee to Study Criminal Jury Instructions, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions \u00a7 21, p. 28 [1982], in its proposed instruction relating to the reasonable doubt standard, we suggest caution in the use of such language as it may provide a basis for confusion and may be misinterpreted by jurors as unwarrantedly shifting the burden of proof to the defense. While we would agree with the appellant that the \u2018hesitate to act\u2019 language suggested in 1 [E.] Devitt &amp; [C.] Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice [and] Instructions \u00a7 11.14 [3d Ed. 1979] and included in the Federal Judicial Center Committee to Study Criminal Jury Instruction, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 6 [1985] would be preferable, we do not find that the use of the \u2018real possibility\u2019 language in this case constituted reversible error.\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>821 F.2d 968, 973 (4th Cir. 1987) (\u201cThe [District [C]ourt\u2019s instruction in this case illustrates the confusion that is engendered by attempting to define a reasonable doubt in terms of a \u2018real possibility\u2019 that the accused is not guilty.

We suspect that the trial court, obviously well versed in the debate, chose to omit that language and tailor the instructions to resolve the burden shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>concerns by reinforcing for the jury that, if they \u201chave a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, [they] must give him the benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> The instruction adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court provides: \u201cThe government has the burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

We note, however, that although we endorse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s instruction, unlike that court, we do not hold that failure to give this instruction necessarily will give rise to the risk of reversible error.

I agree with and join the majority opinion, with one exception. I do not agree with the majority\u2019s specific approval of the reasonable doubt instruction adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>147 N.J. 43, 61, 685 A.2d 1242 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1190, 117 S.

Thus, the majority has approved that instruction without the parties having briefed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Second, and more important, I do not think that this court should, as a general matter and especially in the problematic area of the concept of reasonable doubt, be in the business of drafting specific instructions for trial courts. We do our appellate job better by doing what we ordinarily do, namely, reviewing instructions given by trial courts in the context of specific cases and deciding whether they meet the specific legal challenge presented by the parties. We should not start with language that was never employed, such as that adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court, and then determine, in a litigation vacuum, that that language ought to be what judges say to jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In this connection, I acknowledge that this court, in an opinion that I authored for the court, did draft specific instruction language in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>275 Conn. 534, 579-80, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082, 126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006). In hindsight, I think that this was unwise, and was proven to be so by the fact that, immediately upon the release of that opinion, we were required to issue a replacement page in that opinion amending the previously approved instruction. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">For example, consider the language of the New Jersey instruction that a reasonable doubt \u201cis a doubt that a reasonable person hearing the same evidence would have.\u201d <em>State v. Medina, </em>supra, 147 N.J. 61.1 can conceive of the state contending that this language is too favorable to the defendant because it could give a juror who votes initially to acquit a basis to say to his or her fellow jurors: \u201cI have this doubt. I am a reasonable person who heard the same evidence as you did. Therefore, according to the judge\u2019s instructions, it is a reasonable doubt, and you all have to respect it.\u201d End of deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">My point is not that this will happen, or that such an argument by the state will prevail if presented. My point is simply that we ought to wait until some new language is used by a trial court and briefed by the parties on appeal, and then adjudicate its propriety in the context of the case, rather than approve language without briefing, in a vacuum, and in advance of its use.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
