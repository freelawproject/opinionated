The defendant appeals, upon our grant of certification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the judgment of conviction, rendered following a jury trial, of four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) and one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>90 Conn. App. 132, 134, 876 A.2d 572 (2005). We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the statement was hearsay not subject to the state of mind exception. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts, as set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn January 10, 2002, the defendant telephoned the victim and asked her to cover a shift as a bartender at a restaurant [at which they both previously had worked]. The victim agreed and later was picked up by the defendant, who drove her to work. Following her shift, the victim drove with the defendant to a friend\u2019s house, where they smoked marijuana. The two left after twenty minutes. The victim was under the impression that the defendant was going to drive her home. Instead, he drove her to a deserted tractor-trailer park, then to a highway underpass and finally to his home. The defendant brutally and repeatedly sexually assaulted the victim at each location. Early the next morning, after the defendant had fallen asleep, the victim escaped and ran virtually naked to a nearby business, where the police were called. The police took the victim to a hospital, stopping briefly en route in order for the victim to point out the defendant\u2019s home.\u201d Id., 134-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Thereafter, the state charged the defendant with six counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), and one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The jury returned verdicts of guilty on the first four counts of sexual assault and on the kidnapping charge, and not guilty on the fifth and sixth counts of sexual assault. The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, and sentenced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>defendant to a total effective sentence of thirty years imprisonment, with ten year's special parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions, concluding, inter alia,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the trial court properly had sustained the state\u2019s objection on hearsay grounds to the admission of the following statement made by the victim, the day after the assault, to John J. Hoban, an acquaintance, \u201c \u2018I got Richie. I got him good.\u2019 \u201d Id., 143. The Appellate Court, relying primarily on our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 595, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994), concluded that this statement did not fall within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule; see Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (4); because it was a statement of past intent or motive after an act, rather than a statement of present or future intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 145-46. This certified appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly upheld the exclusion of the victim\u2019s statement to Hoban because that statement was relevant and not hearsay in that it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, or if the statement was hearsay, it is subject to the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant contends that the exclusion of the statement was not harmless error because the statement was noncumulative evidence of the victim\u2019s credibility in a case resting largely on her testimony. In response, the state claims that we should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>not review the defendant\u2019s claim that the statement was not hearsay because he: (1) failed to preserve it before the trial court; and (2) did not brief that claim in the Appellate Court. The state also contends that the trial court properly excluded the victim\u2019s statement to Hoban because it was: (1) so ambiguous as to be meaningless and therefore, irrelevant; and (2) offered as a statement of memory or belief to prove a fact, specifically, that she had fabricated the allegations against the defendant. Finally, the state claims that any evidentiary impropriety in this case is harmless error. We conclude that: (1) the defendant abandoned his claim that the statement was not hearsay by failing to raise it before the Appellate Court; and (2) the statement was not admissible pursuant to the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. After the state had rested its case and the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the defendant called Hoban as a witness. Hoban testified during an offer of proof outside the jury\u2019s presence, that he had been friendly with the victim for a couple of years, and that she frequently had confided in him. Hoban also testified, however, that he did not know her last name at any time. He then was questioned by defense counsel about the conversation that he had had with the victim on January 10, 2002, the day after the assault:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u201cQ. [Directing your attention, sir, to the day after January 10, 2002, did [the victim] confide something in you on that date?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201cA. I got a call in the morning from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u201cQ. What did she confide in you, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t understand it, but she says, <em>\u2018I got him. I got him good,.\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cQ. What did you respond to that?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u201cA. I said . . . what are you talking about? \u2018I <em>got Richie. I got him good,.\u2019 </em>And she hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u201cQ. That was it?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">\u201cA. Yeah. And I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. I went over to my office about an hour and a half later, read the paper . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">At that point, the state argued that Hoban\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s statement to him was inadmissible hearsay. In response, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the statement was offered to show the victim\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the statement was inadmissible under the state of mind exception because that exception applies to \u201cpresent mind for future or past acts,\u201d and the victim\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>referred to a past act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We note at the outset that the defendant\u2019s claim requires that we clarify the standard of review applicable to a trial court\u2019s ruling about whether evidence is admissible pursuant to an exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant relies on the standard applied by the Appellate Court in this case, that \u201c[wjhether evidence offered at trial is admissible pursuant to one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule presents a question of law\u201d subject to plenary review. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 144, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 Conn. App. 364, 375, 815 A.2d 1261 (2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 272 Conn. 515, 864 A.2d 847 (2005). The state contends in response that the Appellate Court improperly engaged in plenary review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, and that the abuse of discretion standard controls such questions. We recognize that the decisions by our appellate courts have not been a model of clarity in this regard,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we take this opportunity to resolve the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>There is a split of authority among other jurisdictions on how evidentiary rulings addressing admissibility under the hearsay rule and its exceptions are to be reviewed. A majority of courts review such trial court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>others engage in de novo review;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and still others engage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in a \u201chybrid\u201d scope of review dependent on whether the hearsay rule or an exception to that rule is under consideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We recognize the superficial appeal of the aforementioned bright line rules in their ease of application, but conclude that such rules overlook the fundamentally complex nature of evidentiary rulings. We therefore decline to adopt a categorical de novo or abuse of discretion standard because application of either standard will afford unwarranted deference in some cases and unwarranted interference in others, irrespective of the differing nature of inquiries at issue depending on the type of statement and the rule of evidence implicated. Although the \u201chybrid\u201d approach in our view correctly recognizes that not all claims require the same degree of scrutiny, its categorical distinctions fail to recognize that, even within the hearsay exceptions, a more nuanced approach is demanded. Rather than invoke a rule based strictly on a category, we conclude that the better approach is one adopted by other jurisdictions in which they examine the nature of the ruling at issue in the context of the issues in the case. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>462 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>458 F.3d 202, 205 (3d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1147, 127 S. Ct. 1014, 166 L. Ed. 2d 764 (2007); <em>State </em>v. <em>Haili, </em>103 Haw. 89, 99-100, 79 P.3d 1263 (2003); <em>In re A.B., </em>308 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Ill. App. 3d 227, 234, 719 N.E.2d 348 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>804 A.2d 1146, 1150 (Me. 2002); <em>Wayment </em>v. <em>Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>116 P.3d 271, 286 (Utah 2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeVincentis, </em>150 Wash. 2d 11, 17, 74 P.3d 119 (2003). Accordingly, we conclude that the appropriate standard of review is best determined, not as a strict bright line rule, but as one driven by the specific nature of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">To the extent a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no \u201cjudgment call\u201d by the trial court, and the trial court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 811 n.19, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005) (wherein issue was whether young child\u2019s statement to her mother regarding sexual abuse fell within scope of medical treatment exception when mother thereafter relayed statement to child\u2019s physician, court applied de novo review of \u201cwhether the trial court properly ruled that the statement at issue fell within the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, a pure question of law\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>George J., </em>280 Conn. 551, 592, 910 A.2d 931 (2006) (whether admission of statement violated constitutional mandates of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 [2004], raised question of law over which court exercises plenary review), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L. Ed. 2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>Patterson, </em>276 Conn. 452, 485-86, 886 A.2d 777 (2005) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting under state of mind hearsay exception victim\u2019s statement evidencing fear of defendant as evidence of defendant\u2019s motive to kill victim because there was sufficient corroborative evidence to render that inference non-speculative). In other words, only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought. For example, whether a statement is truly spontaneous as to fall within the spontaneous utterance exception will be reviewed with the utmost deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. Similarly, appellate courts will defer to the trial court\u2019s determinations on issues dictated by the exercise of discretion, fact finding, or credibility assessments. A paradigmatic example of this distinction would be a trial court\u2019s conclusion that a hearsay statement bears the requisite indicia of trustworthiness and reliability necessary for admission under the residual exception to the hearsay rule, which would be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 729, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006). By contrast, the question of whether the trial court properly could have admitted that statement under the residual exception if the admission of that type of statement <em>expressly was barred </em>under another hearsay exception would present a question of law over which the appellate courts exercise plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Thus, we concur with the approach taken by those jurisdictions that have recognized that the function performed by the trial court in issuing its ruling should dictate the scope of review. See, e.g., <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>v. Washington, supra, 462 F.3d 1135 (whether District Court correctly construed hearsay rule is question of law subject to de novo review; whether statement consistent with declarant\u2019s testimony offered to rebut recent fabrication was made before alleged motive to fabricate arose is subject to abuse of discretion); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>supra, 458 F.3d 205 (whether statement is hearsay is legal question subject to plenary review; whether statement satisfies relevant requirements for hearsay exception is subject to review for abuse of discretion); <em>State </em>v. <em>Haili, </em>supra, 103 Haw. 99-100 (court engages in de novo review of hearsay questions, unless nature of issue requires discretionary \u201cjudgment call\u201d by trial court, such as applicability of residual and recent perception exceptions to hearsay rule); <em>In re A.B., </em>supra, 308 Ill. App. 3d 234 (\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay [either under the common law or pursuant to statute] is a question of law because it does not involve the exercise of discretion, fact finding, or credibility assessments. . . . Only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay is it vested with the discretion to admit or bar the evidence . . . based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cornhuskers Motor Lines, </em>854 A.2d 189, 192 (Me. 2004) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review application of party opponent exception to allegedly falsified truck logs); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 804 A.2d 1150 (determining whether identification statement made to state trooper was for truth of matter asserted and stating that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s decision to admit alleged hearsay is a question of law, which we review de novo\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Wayment </em>v. <em>Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>supra, 116 P.3d 286 (\u201cWhether proffered evidence meets the definition of hearsay in Utah Rule of Evidence 801 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>a question of law, reviewed for correctness. ... Nevertheless, because application of the hearsay rules in a specific case is so highly fact-dependent, a [District [C]ourt\u2019s conclusions on such issues are entitled to some measure of deference.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeVincentis, </em>supra, 150 Wash. 2d 17 (interpretation of rule of evidence is question of law, but application of that interpreted rule of evidence is discretionary by trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that the statement was not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein, but only as circumstantial proof of the victim\u2019s state of mind. We will not reach this claim because it runs afoul of the procedures delineating the limited reviewability of claims in certified appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">It is well settled that, in a certified appeal, \u201cthe focus of our review is not the actions of the trial court, but the actions of the Appellate Court. We do not hear the appeal de novo. The only questions that we need consider are those squarely raised by the petition for certification, and we will ordinarily consider these issues in the form in which they have been framed in the Appellate Court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 433, 493 A.2d 865 (1985); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>260 Conn. 649, 658, 800 A.2d 1160 (2002) (\u201con a certified appeal, our focus is on the judgment of the Appellate Court . . . and we ordinarily do not review claims not raised therein\u201d [citation omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>supra, 434 n.5 (\u201cunder extraordinary circumstances, not present here, we may review matters not raised before the Appellate Court and resolve issues not determined by the Appellate Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Although it appears that the defendant properly may have raised the nonhearsay argument initially before the <em>trial </em>court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 5-5,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> he subsequently failed to mention that claim in his brief to the Appellate Court, which focused solely on his argument that the statement was hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, namely, that the victim had fabricated the accusations against the defendant, but was admissible pursuant to the state of mind exception.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>addressed only the exception to the hearsay rule, and made no mention of any claim that the statement was not hearsay. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 144-47. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s petition for certification is drafted similarly. See footnote 3 of this opinion. We, therefore, decline to reach the defendant\u2019s claim that the statement was not hearsay because he abandoned it by failing to mention it in his brief to the Appellate Court. An unmentioned claim is, by definition, inadequately briefed, and one that is \u201cgenerally . . . considered abandoned. . . . Moreover, a claim that has been abandoned during the initial appeal to the Appellate Court cannot subsequently be resurrected by the taking of a certified appeal to this court.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>276 Conn. 377, 393, 886 A.2d 391 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1148, 126 S. Ct. 2296, 164 L. Ed. 2d 815 (2006). Accordingly, we now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the statement was inadmissible under the state of mind hearsay exception, \u00a7 8-3 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay. ... As a general rule, such hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>271 Conn. 218, 254, 856 A.2d 917 (2004). As we previously have discussed, the only hearsay exception relevant in this appeal is \u00a7 8-3 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which renders admissible \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>then-existing mental or emotional condition, <em>including a statement indicating a present intention to do a particular act in the immediate future, provided that the statement </em>is a natural expression of the condition and <em>is not a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or </em>believed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>See also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 8.19.6, p. 631 (\u201cdeclarations of present state of mind are inadmissible to prove memory or belief that the declarant has performed an act in the past, when such declaration is offered as proof of the performance of that act\u201d). \u201c[F]orward-looking statements of intention are admitted while backward-looking statements of memory or belief are excluded because the former do not present the classic hearsay dangers of memory and narration. The weakness inherent in forward-looking statements \u2014 the uncertainty that the intention will be carried out \u2014 may lead to exclusion, but this is under the relevancy doctrine rather than hearsay analysis.\u201d 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (6th Ed. 2006) \u00a7 276, p. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The issue, therefore, in the present case is whether the trial court properly determined that the victim\u2019s statement, in the context of the facts of this case, was a statement of her present state of mind, a permissible use, or a statement of memory or belief regarding a past act, an impermissible use. Because there is no question that the trial court properly understood the law at issue that the state of mind exception does not apply to the latter, the interpretation of the victim\u2019s statement presents an issue that we review subject to an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Although neither the parties\u2019 briefs nor the court\u2019s independent research has yielded a case directly on point involving a statement by a victim after an alleged assault indicating a potential fabrication, we find instructive a review of the existing case law on the limits of this hearsay exception. The seminal case is the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 54 S. Ct. 22, 78 L. Ed. 196 (1933), which has been incorporated into the commentary to our Code of Evidence. See C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 8.19.6, p. 632; see also footnote 13 of this opinion. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that the victim\u2019s statement to her nurse, \u201c \u2018Dr. Shepard has poisoned me,\u2019 \u201d was inadmissible under the state of mind exception.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 103-104. The court characterized this statement as used not for proof of the victim\u2019s \u201cpresent thoughts and feelings, or even her thoughts and feelings in times past,\u201d but, rather, \u201cas proof of an act committed by some one else, as evidence that she was dying of poison given by her husband. This fact, if fact it was, the [g]ovemment was free to prove, but not by hearsay declarations.\u201d Id., 104; see also id. (\u201c[t]he reverberating clang of those accusatory words would drown all weaker sounds\u201d). The court stated that \u201c[t]here are times when a state of mind, if relevant, may be proved by contemporaneous declarations of feeling or intent. . . . Thus, in proceedings for the probate of a will, where the issue is undue influence, the declarations of a testator are competent to prove his feelings for his relatives, but are incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tent as evidence of his conduct or of theirs. ... In suits for the alienation of affections, letters passing between the spouses are admissible in aid of a like purpose .... In damage suits for personal injuries, declarations by the patient to bystanders or physicians are evidence of sufferings or symptoms . . . but are not received to prove the acts, the external circumstances, through which the injuries came about. . . . Even statements of past sufferings or symptoms are generally excluded . . . though an exception is at times allowed when they are made to a physician. . . . So also in suits upon insurance policies, declarations by an insured that he intends to go upon a journey with another, may be evidence of a state of mind lending probability to the conclusion that the purpose was fulfilled. . . . The ruling in <em>[Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hillmon, </em>145 U.S. 285, 12 S. Ct. 909, 36 L. Ed. 706 (1892)] marks the high water line beyond which courts have been unwilling to go. It has developed a substantial body of criticism and commentary. Declarations of intention, casting light upon the future, have been sharply distinguished from declarations of memory, pointing backwards to the past. There would be an end, or nearly that, to the rule against hearsay if the distinction were ignored.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 104-106. In the case before it, the Supreme Court concluded that the victim\u2019s statement \u201cfaced backward and not forward. This at least it did in its most obvious implications. What is even more important, it spoke to a past act, and more than that, to an act by some one not the speaker. Other tendency, if it had any, was a filament too fine to be disentangled by a jury.\u201d Id., 106. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Our own case law is similarly illustrative in its support of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>supra, 228 Conn. 594, we concluded that the trial court properly had sustained the state\u2019s objections and excluded \u201ctestimony that, after he was apprehended, the defendant waived his Miranda<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rights and admitted that he struck the victim but denied kidnapping or participating in sexual assaults upon her.\u201d We concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s statements after his arrest are inadmissible hearsay and may not be offered to demonstrate his state of mind before his arrest. Statements by an accused \u2018after the act, stating the past intent or motive at the time of the act\u2019 are inadmissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. . . . In the present case, the defendant sought to introduce postarrest statements that he had committed an assault but not a kidnapping or a sexual assault to indicate that he had fled from the police because he had struck the victim. Such statements do not fall within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 595; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>52 Conn. App. 643, 656-57, 727 A.2d 780 (1999) (trial court properly excluded, under both state of mind and residual exceptions, statements by defendant to police that he had stabbed victim in self-defense), aff'd, 252 Conn. 752, 748 A.2d 872, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 876, 121 S. Ct. 182, 148 L. Ed. 2d 126 (2000).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, in <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Yale </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>University, </em>129 Conn. 615, 616-17, 30 A.2d 545 (1943), a civil case wherein the plaintiff sought damages based on his fall on a dark staircase, this court concluded that the trial court improperly had admitted testimony by the plaintiffs sister, who had witnessed the accident, that another woman had said: \u201c \u2018[I] noticed the light was out earlier in the evening. I tried to replace the bulb, but the man who had the keys to the supply room was out of the building.\u2019 \u201d Id., 617. The court concluded that the woman\u2019s statements were not admitted properly under the state of mind exception because they were \u201cnot offered to establish her knowledge at the time they were made, for this would not help the plaintiff, but to establish the knowledge <em>she had in the past </em>in order to show notice to the landlord.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We also have reviewed numerous sister state cases, and we find most persuasive <em>Conyers </em>v. <em>State, </em>354 Md. 132, 158-60, 729 A.2d 910, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 910, 120 S. Ct. 258, 145 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1999).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Conyers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of testimony that the defendant\u2019s cellmate, who had testified against him, had stated to another inmate that he \u201cneeded to take care of number one first,\u201d in connection with allegations that he had searched other inmates\u2019 cells for information about their cases. Id., 154-55. The court concluded that the trial court properly had excluded that statement because it did not fit under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, as the inmate\u2019s \u201cstatement about his self-interest is not proof that he engaged in any specific action for the purpose of \u2018taking care of number one first.\u2019 Under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, \u2018a statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind is admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted, except that it is generally inadmissible ... to prove a fact [such as an action] which purportedly happened <em>before the statement was made.\u2019 </em>6 [L.] McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 803 (3).1, [pp.] 356-57 .... In the instant case, we cannot make the inferential leap that because [the cellmate] allegedly said to [another inmate] that he \u2018was looking out for number one,\u2019 that he actually did rifle through other inmates\u2019 case documents, and in particular [the defendant\u2019s] documents, in order to cut a deal with the [s]tate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Conyers </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We find <em>Conyers </em>to be instructive because the inmate\u2019s statement in that case about \u201c \u2018taking care of number one\u2019 id.; is as ambiguous with respect to any prior acts as was the victim\u2019s ambiguous statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Hoban in the present case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Conyers </em>is an application of principles that are consistent with Connecticut\u2019s law of evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, even if we were to assume that the victim\u2019s statement to Hoban is some evidence that she had fabricated the charges against the defendant, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that the statement was inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We take par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ticulax note of the ambiguous quality of the statement, and the fact that the trial court was required to grapple with categorizing it for purposes of determining its admissibility. Indeed, the victim\u2019s statement simply could have meant that she believed that her identification to the police of the defendant as her attacker would ensure that he would not be able to harm her again. Significantly, the more helpful the ambiguous statement is to the defendant, the more inadmissible it becomes under the law governing the state of mind exception. Specifically, if \u201c \u2018I got Richie\u2019 \u201d is interpreted as a statement of the act of fabrication, the more it becomes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>narrative of past events and, therefore, inadmissible under the state of mind exception as a \u201clook backward. \u201d Thus, the trial court properly concluded that the statement was one of past events, namely, that the victim had trumped up charges against the defendant, and therefore was inadmissible pursuant to the state of mind exception. Accordingly, the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and VERTE-FEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained.

The first way is I would claim that it is an out-of-court statement, not hearsay if it\u2019s offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind rather than the truth of the matter asserted. The state of mind, my contention being, she was aware of the fact the accusations were fabricated.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">\u201cSecondly, I would ask that it be introduced as a statement offered solely to impeach a witness such as a prior inconsistent statement which is not hearsay use of the statement. It\u2019s not offered to prove the \u2014 it\u2019s offered to prove it was made, but not that it was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\u201cThirdly, I would again go back to the area of the residual exception. Residual exception can take place when there\u2019s reasonable necessity for the admission of such a statement when it\u2019s supported by adequate basis of assurance that the evidence has those qualities of reliability and trustworthiness attributable to other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">\u201cHe has indicated he was a friend of [the victim] for a couple of years. [The victim] confided in him as far as things in her life was concerned. This was an issue of her confiding with him the day after an act of alleged sexual assault took place. I think there\u2019s an adequate basis of assurance that this evidence has the qualities of reliability and trustworthiness that are needed. I also think there\u2019s a reasonable necessity for it to be admitted in order for the jury to understand the true situation. So, for those three reasons, I\u2019d ask the court to allow the statements to be testified in front of the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> With respect to the defendant\u2019s other arguments in support of the statement\u2019s admissibility; see footnote 5 of this opinion; the trial court concluded that the statement also was inadmissible: (1) as a prior inconsistent statement; see Conn.

Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9; because it lacked reliability given both the statement\u2019s ambiguity, and the fact that Hoban did not know the victim well enough to know her last name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> The Appellate Court recently observed in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bright Clouds Ministries, Inc., </em>94 Conn.

The state of mind, my contention being, she was aware of the fact the accusations were fabricated.\u201d The trial court\u2019s ruling, rendered after taking the matter under advisement during a recess, addresses only the hearsay exception, concluding that \u201cstate of mind exceptions come in as to present mind for future or past acts. This would be argued as to a past act, if we can inteipret it being a past act. Case law is somewhat discouraging, if I can use that term. They discourage the use of state of mind exception for past act. The court also feels it doesn\u2019t fit appropriately within the state of mind exception.

The defendant in this case properly relied on Connecticut Code of Evidence \u00a7 8-3 (4), which allows for the admission of \u2018a statement of the declarant\u2019s then-existing mental or emotional condition . . . .\u2019 The statement was not, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the trial court may have thought, \u2018a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed\u2019 under the rale.\u201d We note that the defendant did not provide any case citations in this section of his Appellate Court brief to develop the distinction between a statement that is not hearsay, and a hearsay statement subject to an exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> The commentary to \u00a7 8-3 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cSection 8-3 (4) embodies what is frequently referred to as the \u2018state-of-mind\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Periere, </em>186 Conn. 599, 605-606, 442 A.2d 1345 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u201cThe exception allows the admission of a declarant\u2019s statement describing his or her then-existing mental or emotional condition when the declarant\u2019s mental or emotional condition is a factual issue in the case. E.g., [id.], 606-607 (to show declarant\u2019s fear); <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>28 Conn. 317, 320-21 (1859) (to show declarant\u2019s \u2018mental feeling\u2019). Only statements describing then-existing mental or emotional condition, i.e., that existing when the statement is made, are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u201cThe exception also covers a declarant\u2019s statement of present intention to perform a subsequent act as an inference that the subsequent act actually occurred. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 358 n.7, 599 A.2d 1 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 592, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Journey, </em>115 Conn. 344, 351, 161 A.2d 515 (1932). The inference drawn from the statement of present intention that the act actually occurred is a matter of relevancy rather than a hearsay concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u201cWhen a statement describes the declarant\u2019s intention to do a future act in concert with another person, e.g., T am going to meet Ralph at the store at ten,\u2019 the case law does not prohibit admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 592. But the declaration can be admitted only to prove the declarant\u2019s subsequent conduct, not to show what the other person ultimately did. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perelli, </em>125 Conn. 321, 325, 5 A.2d 705 (1939). Thus, in the example above, the declarant\u2019s statement could be used to infer that the declarant actually did go to meet Ralph at the store at ten, but not to show that Ralph went to the store at ten to meet the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u201cPlacement of Section 8-3 (4) in the \u2018availability of the declarant immaterial\u2019 category of hearsay exceptions confirms that the admissibility of statements of present intention to show future acts is not conditioned on any requirement that the declarant be unavailable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 592 (dictum suggesting that declarant\u2019s unavailability is precondition to admissibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">\u201cWhile statements of present intention looking forward to the doing of some future act are admissible under the exception, backward looking statements of memory or belief offered to prove the act or event remembered or believed are inadmissible. See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>129 Conn. 615, 618-19, 30 A.2d 545 (1943). But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 592-93. As the advisory committee note to the corresponding federal rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>suggests, \u2018[t,]he exclusion of \u201cstatements of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed\u201d is necessary to avoid the virtual destruction of the hearsay rule which would otherwise result from allowing state of mind, provable by a hearsay statement, to serve as the basis for an inference of the happening of the event which produced the state of mind.\u2019 Fed. R. Evid. 803 (3) advisory committee note, citing <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 54 S. Ct. 22, 78 L. Ed. 196 (1933).

The [victim] had no reason to misrepresent her mental state at the time the statement was made, and there is no reason to believe that she would misrepresent her mental state in a way that undermined her allegations against the defendant.\u201d We disagree with the defendant because these arguments go to the weight and persuasive value of the victim\u2019s statement in this case as compared to the defendants\u2019 statements in <em>Freeney </em>and <em>Adams, </em>rather than to the admissibility of the victim\u2019s statement under the temporally limited scope of the state of mind exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> This court also concluded that the statement was inadmissible as an admission, for lack of a showing of agency, or as a spontaneous utterance.

See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Madson, </em>638 P.2d 18, 29-30 (Colo. 1981) (statements by victim expressing her fear of defendant inadmissible when self-defense and suicide were not at issue in case); <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>960 S.W.2d 460, 461-62 (Ky. 1997) (statements by deceased victim that she previously had been abused by defendant husband, who was accused of killing her, were not subject to state of mind exception because they were offered to prove fact that already had happened); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 A.2d 1158, 1163-64 (Me. 1978) (victim\u2019s previous statement to friend that she was afraid because her assailant was chasing her inadmissible \u201cfor such fear is tantamount to remembering the prior conduct of [assailant] threatening her with harm\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 282-83, 558 N.E.2d 933 (1990) (murder victim\u2019s statements to his attorney about evolution of transaction of planned sale of his land to defendant were hearsay inadmissible under state of mind exception, unless they pertained to victim\u2019s future intentions); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>950 S.W.2d 482, 483-84 (Mo. 1997) (hearsay statements by murder victim of prior domestic assaults were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>inadmissible because they did \u201cno more than recount past events\u201d); <em>Glover </em>v. <em>State, </em>102 S.W.3d 754, 762-63 (Tex.

App. 277, 287, 699 P.2d 774 (1985), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he fact that the statement is in tire past tense does not necessarily mean that it indicates a past mental state.\u201d We find the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Flett </em>to be misplaced and over-broad. In that case, a sexual assault victim had told her daughter, seven hours after the incident, that she had been raped, and told her son at least two and one-half hours after the incident, \u201cSomething upset me . . . did you take the bastard home?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 286. The court concluded that the trial court properly had admitted her statement to her daughter as an excited utterance, and that the statement that \u201c \u2018 [something upset me\u2019 \u201d was admissible under the state of mind exception because the circumstances of the case indicated that it referred to the victim\u2019s then-existing mental state; \u201cthe fact, by inference, it refers to a past event does not take it out of the scope of the rule, since it is reasonable to believe the condition existed at the time of the utterance . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 287-88. <em>Flett </em>is distinguishable from the present case because the statement at issue therein unambiguously pertained to an emotion; the victim in <em>Flett </em>specifically complained of being \u201c \u2018upset,\u2019 \u201d an expression of emotion that was directly relevant to the issue of consent. Moreover, that statement took place during the middle of a continuum of disturbing events; specifically, the statement was made after she had been sexually assaulted, but before she saw the assailant\u2019s wife while at work the next morning. Id., 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> We note that the defendant relies on a line of older California cases espousing a broader view of the admissibility of statements pursuant to the state of mind exception, specifically, that, \u201c[w]hen intent is a material element of a disputed fact, declarations of a decedent <em>made after as well as before </em>an alleged act that indicate the intent with which he performed the act are admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule, and it is immaterial that such declarations are self-serving.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Whitlow </em>v. <em>Durst, </em>20 Cal. 2d 523, 524, 127 P.2d 530 (1942). This approach is inconsistent with the temporal limitations on the admissibility of such statements contained in \u00a7 8-3 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\"> We also disagree with the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Haynam </em>v. <em>Laclede Electric Cooperative, Inc., </em>827 S.W.2d 200 (Mo. 1992). In that case, 1he plaintiffs, husband and wife, brought an action against the defendant electric company alleging wrongful termination of electric services. Id., 203-204. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>They had pleaded their action based upon \u201cintentional conduct that was \u2018malicious, wanton and willful,\u2019 \u201d and sought both actual and punitive damages. Id., 204. The plaintiffs and the electric company apparently had agreed to payment arrangements for a disputed bill for March of 1986, which would have given the plaintiffs until the end of May to pay the second part of that bill. Id. The electric company shut off the electricity before then, however, and the plaintiff wife spoke to the general manager of the electric company that same day. She testified that he said there was no log of those arrangements, and that the electric company would not turn the power back on until the bill was paid. When the plaintiff wife inquired and the general manager said that there was no one superior to him, the plaintiff wife then said, \u201c \u2018Then you\u2019re God, and there\u2019s nobody else, you know, above that?\u2019 \u201d Id. At that point, the manager replied, \u201c \u2018That\u2019s right, lady.\u2019 \u201d Id. The court concluded that \u201c [although this conversation occurred some four hours after [the power company] had terminated the electric service, the jury was entitled to consider this evidence in determining [the general manager\u2019s] state of mind when he authorized the termination of the electrical service. State of mind is a continuing condition that may be proved by statements evidencing the state of mind either before or following the relevant point in time.\u201d Id., 204-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Even if we were to assume the continuity of states of mind, <em>Haynam </em>is distinguishable from the present case. The electric company\u2019s refusal to restore the power was a continuation of the conduct at issue, namely, the initial disconnection of the plaintiffs\u2019 power, whereas any fabrication in this case would have occurred on the preceding day. Moreover, in our view, the Missouri court mischaracterized the nature of the remarks; rather than hearsay subject to the state of mind exception, we view these comments as nonhearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, specifically, whether the power company manager is God. Rather, that remark more properly would be viewed as circumstantial evidence of the electric company\u2019s malice and wantonness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b253-8\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD9\">with whom ZARELLA and SULLIVAN, Js., join, concurring in part.

In ruling on the state\u2019s objections and the defendant\u2019s arguments in support of the statement\u2019s admissibility, the trial court was, at the very least, implicitly required to determine what the ambiguous statement \u2014 \u201c \u2018I got Richie.

Accordingly, I emphasize my adherence to the abuse of discretion standard for reviewing simple evidentiary issues like that presented by this case, and I join only part II of the majority opinion, which concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the state\u2019s objection to the statement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> Like the majority, I note that the defendant, relying on the Appellate Court opinion in this case, claims that \u201c \u2018[wjhether evidence offered at trial is admissible pursuant to one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule presents a question of law\u2019 \u201d subject to plenary review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>90 Conn. App. 132, 144, 876 A.2d 572 (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 Conn.

I agree with the state\u2019s position that the Appellate Court should not have engaged in plenary review of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, and that the flaw in the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis stems from its reliance on its decision in <em>Gonzalez, </em>a decision that incorrectly cited this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>220 Conn. 487, 600 A.2d 738 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1207, 112 S.

Ed. 2d 876 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">I begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 487, which apparently formed the basis for the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s hearsay ruling is a question of law subject to plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 144; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 75 Conn. App. 375. In my view, the Appellate Court\u2019s reliance in <em>Gonzalez </em>on <em>Tillman </em>was misplaced, as <em>Tillman </em>did not state that evidentiary issues, including the trial court\u2019s application of a hearsay exception, are themselves subject to plenary review. Rather, <em>Tillman </em>noted that the defendant in that case had raised claims that: \u201c(1) the selection of jury panels was unconstitutionally discriminatory; (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury on identification, consciousness of guilt, and the use of prior inconsistent statements; and (3) the trial court improperly ruled that the field notes of a police social worker were inadmissible as hearsay.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>supra, 491. With respect to the standard of review, <em>Tillman </em>referred to all of these issues and stated only that <em>\u201c[t]o the extent that these claims are entitled, to a plenary review, </em>we conclude that they do not establish the defendant\u2019s right to a new trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Put differently, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Tillman </em>did not conclude specifically that evidentiary claims, and specifically hearsay rulings, are subject to plenary review. Thus, in my view, the Appellate Court\u2019s reliance in <em>Gonzalez </em>on <em>Tillman </em>for this proposition simply was mistaken, rendering that case and its progeny no longer good law on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> The majority further states that \u201conly after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay, or is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>subject to a hearsay exception, is it vested with the discretion to admit or to bar the evidence based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds related to the rule of evidence under which admission is being sought.\u201d I agree that the trial court first should determine whether the proffered statement is hearsay before considering the applicability of any hearsay exceptions.

Rev. 519, 521 (2005) (former Chief Justice of Maine Superior Court noting that term \u201csuggests that the trial judge has done something that is terribly out of line\u201d). Justice Mead noted that, in response to these concerns, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has \u201cabandoned the language altogether in favor of the term \u2018sustainable exercise of discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id., 521 and n.9, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296, 787 A.2d 175 (2001) (sentencing case).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> In my view, a trial court that either admits into evidence a statement that is hearsay not subject to an exception, or fails to consider the definition of hearsay, has abused its discretion by disregarding in some way the rules of evidence that are in place to guide that discretion. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 436, 568 A.2d 448 (1990) (\u201c[T]he balancing process is critical to the determination of whether other crime evidence is admissible. Therefore, notwithstanding our deferential standard of review, the failure of the trial court to balance the probative value of the proffered evidence against its prejudicial tendency constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> I agree with the majority that the trial court did not rule specifically on the defendant\u2019s argument that the statement was not hearsay, and also that the defendant failed to raise this claim before the Appellate Court in the first instance, thereby rendering the record inadequate for review of this particular claim in this certified appeal. See part IIA of the majority opinion. In any event, I view the trial court\u2019s analysis, which proceeded directly to the applicability of the state of mind exception, as concluding implicitly that the statement was in fact hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> Accordingly, I reject the reasoning of the four state jurisdictions, specifically the District of Columbia, Iowa, Maryland and Oregon, that specifically review hearsay issues, including the application of hearsay exceptions, as questions of law subject to de novo review. See cases cited in footnote 9 of the majority opinion. I also disagree with the four state jurisdictions, specifically Florida, Illinois, Maine and Utah, and the three federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, specifically the Third, Sixth and Ninth, that apply a hybrid standard whereby the determination of whether a statement is hearsay is subject to plenary review, but the application of exceptions to the hearsay rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>458 F.3d 202, 205 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201cWhether a statement is hearsay is a legal question subject to plenary review. ... If the district court correctly classifies a statement as hearsay, its application of the relevant hearsay exceptions is subject to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d [Citation omitted.]), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1147, 127 S. Ct. 1014, 166 L. Ed. 2d 764 (2007); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>462 F.3d 1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2006) (\u201cWhether a district court correctly construed the hearsay rule is a question of law we review de novo. . . . We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence as non-hearsay for an abuse of discretion.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>409 F.3d 325, 337 (6th Cir. 2005) (stating that \u201c[w]ere view evidentiary rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>by the district court, including alleged violations of the hearsay rule, under the abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d and also that \u201c[w]e review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, such as . . . whether evidence offered at trial constituted hearsay within the meaning of the Federal Rules of Evidence\u201d); <em>K.V. </em>v. <em>State, </em>832 So. 2d 264, 265-66 (Fla App. 2002) (\u201cThe abuse of discretion standard applies in cases where the proponent of the evidence is seeking to have it come in under a hearsay exception. . . . However, the question of whether evidence falls within the statutory definition of hearsay is a question of law.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>People </em>v. <em>Caffey, </em>205 Ill. 2d 52, 90, 792 N.E.2d 1163 (2001) (using abuse of discretion standard to review claims about applicability of various hearsay exceptions, including state of mind and declaration against penal interest, when trial court\u2019s rulings were based on \u201cthe specific circumstances of this case and not on a broadly applicable rule\u201d), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 944, 122 S. Ct. 2629, 153 L. Ed. 3d 810 (2002); <em>In re A.B., </em>308 Ill. App. 3d 227, 234, 719 N.E.2d 348 (1999) (\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay [either under the common law or pursuant to statute] is a question of law because it does not involve the exercise of discretion, fact finding, or credibility assessments. . . . Only after a trial court has made the legal determination that a particular statement is or is not hearsay is it vested with the discretion to admit or bar the evidence . . . based upon relevancy, prejudice, or other legally appropriate grounds.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cornhuskers Motor Lines, </em>854 A.2d 189, 192 (Me. 2004) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review application of party opponent exception to allegedly falsified truck logs); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>804 A.2d 1146, 1150 (Me. 2002) (determining whether identification statement made to state trooper was for truth of matter asserted and stating that \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s decision to admit alleged hearsay is a question of law, which we review de novo\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Wayment </em>v. <em>Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>116 P.3d 271, 286 (Utah 2005) (\u201cWhether proffered evidence meets the definition of hearsay in Utah Rule of Evidence 801 is a question of law, reviewed for correctness. . . .
