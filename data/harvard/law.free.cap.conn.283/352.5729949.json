We affirm the judgment of the trial court because the defendant waived at trial any claim with regard to the acquittal first instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the early morning hours of December 29, 2001, the victim, Damian Ellis, was with his friends, Damian Wade and Arthur Hall, at the Athenian Diner in Water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>bury (diner). The defendant also was present at the diner with a group of friends, which included Jason Greene, his brother, Michael Greene, and Gregory Hunter. The victim\u2019s group had a verbal altercation with the defendant and Hunter that prompted the restaurant manager to eject both groups of men from the diner. The two groups engaged in some additional verbal sparring and then separated once outside the diner.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The defendant\u2019s group entered a black Lexus sport utility vehicle, driven by Hunter, and was exiting the diner parking lot when Hunter stopped the car in front of the victim, who was standing outside the entrance to the diner. Either Hunter or the victim reinitiated the dispute, and Hunter subsequently exited the vehicle and approached the victim\u2019s group with a knife in his hand. The victim backed away from Hunter, down a ramp on the side of the diner, as the defendant exited the vehicle and moved to the comer of the building near the ramp. The defendant walked up to the victim and shot him twice with a nine millimeter Cobray M-ll semiautomatic pistol. One shot entered the victim\u2019s brain and likely killed him within five seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Following the shooting, the defendant got back into the Lexus, which was now driven by Jason Greene, and the two men left the scene. The defendant threw the gun out of the car\u2019s window and shortly thereafter exited the vehicle. Jason Greene later directed the police to the area in which the defendant had discarded the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The defendant was arrested and charged with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), criminal possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (1), and tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151a (a) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant guilty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>first two counts and was unable to reach a verdict on the third count, which subsequently was dismissed by the trial court. The trial court thereafter sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of sixty years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the acquittal first instruction given by the trial court pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 576, violated his constitutional rights to a jury trial and due process of law. The defendant, therefore, asks this court to overrule <em>Sawyer </em>as violative of both the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of our state constitution. Because the defendant failed to preserve this claim at trial by taking an exception to the instruction given by the court, he seeks to prevail pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We affirm the judgment of the trial court and conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>because he expressly waived his claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We begin with a review of the jury instructions at issue in the present case. Following a charge on the elements of the crime of murder, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, under that first count the defendant is charged with the crime of murder. If you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime of murder, you should find the defendant guilty of that crime under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the first count. However, if \u2014 If you find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder under this count, you should then consider what is called a lesser included offense and in this case that is entitled reckless manslaughter in the first degree with a \u2014 reckless manslaughter with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cI\u2019ll read that to you again. And you know, when I repeat something, it\u2019s not to emphasize a certain charge. If I \u2014 If I repeat something, it\u2019s just for purposes of explanation, not for \u2014 not for an emphasis. Now, under the first count the defendant is charged with the crime of murder. If you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the crime of murder, you shall find the defendant guilty of murder under the \u2014 under the first count and you don\u2019t go on to the lesser included offense. If you find the defendant guilty, you don\u2019t go on to the lesser included offense. And this only \u2014 These instructions only pertain to the first count. However, if you find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder under the first count, you should then consider the lesser included offense of reckless manslaughter with a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The trial court later instructed the jury that reckless manslaughter is \u201cthe lesser included offense of the first count. You get to it if you find the defendant not guilty of murder.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury on the requirement of unanimity after charging it on each count by stating that \u201c[e]ach verdict is \u2014 Each count is considered separately and you deliver \u2014 deliver a separate verdict and \u2014 and your verdict has to be unanimous.\u201d The trial court also subsequently instructed the jury that \u201c[w]hen you reach a verdict it must be unanimous.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Defense counsel took no exceptions from the instructions given by the trial court. The state, however, registered its objection to the trial court\u2019s inclusion of a lesser included offense charge. The trial court explained its reasons for including the lesser included offense charge, and then <em>specifically </em>asked defense counsel if the charge as read was <em>what had been requested. </em>Defense counsel responded: \u201cThat is correct, Your Honor.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cUnder <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40], a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The first two <em>Golding </em>requirements involve whether the claim is reviewable, and the second two involve whether there was constitutional error requiring a new trial. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 476-77, 915 A.2d 872 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The record in the present case is adequate for our review because it contains the full transcript of the trial proceedings, and therefore satisfies the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>Although a lesser included offense instruction \u201cis purely a matter of common law, and therefore does not implicate constitutional rights\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 659, 588 A.2d 127 (1991);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s challenge to <em>Sawyer\u2019s </em>unanimity instruction is of constitutional magnitude because it implicates the defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>supra, 227 Conn. 576 (\u201c[t]he possibility of disagreement by the jury is implicit in the requirement of a unanimous verdict and is part of the constitutional safeguard of trial by jury\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim, insofar as it challenges the propriety of the acquittal first instruction, is reviewable under the second prong of <em>Golding </em>as well, and we examine the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim under the remaining prongs of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Turning to the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis, namely, whether \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240; we first set forth the applicable principles that guide our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim. Ordinarily, \u201c[w]here, as here, the challenged jury instructions involve a constitutional right, the applicable standard of review is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict. ... In evaluating the particular charges at issue, we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is . . . whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view [the instructions] as improper.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 477-78. In the present case, the defendant concedes that the instructions as given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>by the trial court were correct in law because they complied with the requirements of unanimity outlined by <em>Sawyer. </em>Therefore, the defendant challenges the underlying premise <em>o\u00ed Sawyer, </em>and argues that he \u201cmay be excused for not pursuing the futile act of objecting\u201d to instructions that complied with our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We recently concluded that \u201cunpreserved, waived claims, fail under the third prong of <em>Golding . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 482. \u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution may waive one or more of his or her fundamental rights. ... In the usual <em>Golding </em>situation, the defendant raises a claim on appeal which, while not preserved at trial, at least was not waived at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 478. In <em>Fabricators, </em>the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s inclusion of the duty to retreat in the jury charge on self-defense because the case did not involve the use of deadly force. Id., 471-73. The defendant did not take an exception to the charge initially requested by the state or the charge as given by the trial court, and defense counsel \u201cclearly expressed his satisfaction with [the] instruction, and in fact subsequently argued that the instruction as given was proper.\u201d Id., 481. On the basis of these actions, we concluded that the defendant could not satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he had waived his right to challenge the self-defense instruction, so that no constitutional violation clearly existed. Id., 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In the present case, defense counsel requested a lesser included offense instruction, which was given by the trial court \u201cas an exercise in caution\u201d over the objection of the state. This is not an instance of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>counsel\u2019s failure to take exception to the instruction as given, which included the language that he now attacks, but rather is a case in which he specifically expressed his satisfaction with that instruction when queried by the trial court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we recently concluded in <em>Fabricatore, </em>\u201c[u]nder this factual situation, we simply cannot conclude that injustice [has been] done to either party ... or that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 481-82. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3) because murder is a class A felony for which the maximum sentence that may be imposed exceeds twenty years. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a (c) and 53a-35a (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a firearm or electronic defense weapon when such person possesses a firearm or electronic defense weapon and (1) has been convicted of a felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-12\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 587, this court concluded that when the crime with which the defendant is charged requires an instruction on lesser included offenses, the trial court must give the jury an acquittal first instruction. Such an instruction requires that the jury be \u201cinstructed not to consider the lesser included offenses until it [has] unanimously found the defendant not guilty of the greater offense . . . .\u201d Id., 574.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of intimidating a witness when, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted, such person uses, attempts to use or threatens the use of physical force against a witness or another person with intent to . . . (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>induce the witness to testify falsely, withhold testimony, elude legal process summoning the witness to testify or absent himself or herself from the official proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The defendant was charged with violating \u00a7 53a-151a (a) (2) based on a telephone call he allegedly had placed to Desiree Whitfield, with whom he had spent the night several days before the shooting. Whitfield testified that the defendant told her that if she did not tell the police that she was present at the diner and identify Hunter as the shooter, he would harm her children. Whitfield testified that, although she initially did as she was told, she subsequently admitted that she had been lying the next day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\"> The state argues that, if any party has a right to challenge the <em>Sawyer </em>instructions given by the trial court, it is the state, because the unanimity instruction was not actually given at the transition between murder and reckless manslaughter. According to the state, this bifurcation of the requirements of <em>Sawyer </em>in such a way may have benefited the defendant, so that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object could well have been a tactical decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\"> The entire discussion between the court and counsel as to the lesser included offense instruction provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u201cThe Court: Any exceptions?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: No. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: None, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\u201cThe Court: You sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">\u201cThe Court: All right. I just want to give you a second chance. All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You know, I just \u2014 Not that it\u2019s worth anything, but just to put on the record, it was \u2014 we had discussed this in chambers about whether or not the defendant was entitled to a lesser included offense charge and it was the state\u2019s position that the evidence did not support that. We had discussed that and it was clear that you were going to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">\u201cThe Court: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I don\u2019t know how it would ever have any appellate purpose or anything, but just so the record\u2019s clear, the state didn\u2019t feel that the defense was entitled to a lesser\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">\u201cThe Court: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: \u2014 any lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">\u201cThe Court: Just so there is enough of a record, and this \u2014 this basically reflects our conversation in \u2014 in chambers. It\u2019s often very difficult to figure out whether an offense is a lesser included offense. I applied the test \u2014 the <em>[State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980)] test \u2014 and I\u2019m not totally convinced that it\u2019s a lesser included offense, but charging on it is\u2014 is \u2014 makes more sense. I \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t want to \u2014 If I \u2014 If I made a mistake and did not \u2014 and did not give the lesser included, it would be a fatal error, so as an exercise in caution, I\u2019ve decided to go along with the request of the defense on this even though I\u2019m not exactly sure that it\u2019s appropriate and give the charge that \u2014 the lesser included that they requested and this\u2014 this was the only one that you requested and \u2014 and this was the right one as far as you were concerned, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-19\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That is correct, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 105, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S.

See <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>209 Conn. 310, 317-18, 551 A.2d 704 (1988) (rejecting claim that plaintiffs objection to jury instructions would have been futile because instructions complied with precedent). Second, as we previously discussed, this is not a case of silence in the face of an allegedly improper charge; instead, it is a case in which defense counsel specifically expressed his satisfaction with that charge. Such an affirmative action by counsel simply cannot lend support to a claim of futility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
