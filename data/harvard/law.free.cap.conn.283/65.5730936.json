Brant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the plaintiffs claim of conversion of a painting by Andy Warhol entitled \u201cRed Elvis\u201d (Red Elvis). The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant was a buyer in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, lawfully took all of the plaintiffs rights in Red Elvis pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-403 (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history, as detailed in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The plaintiff was introduced to Anders Malmberg, a Swedish art dealer, in the late 1970\u2019s or early 1980\u2019s during the course of her marriage to Magnus Lindholm (Lindholm). Throughout the next thirty years, Malmberg served as an ait advisor to both the plaintiff and Lindholm. In his capacity as an ait dealer, Malmberg assisted the plaintiff in her purchase of two works of ait, and assisted Lindholm in multiple purchases and sales of works of art. Malmberg handled all of the Lindholms\u2019 purchase and sale transactions for works of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In 1987, the plaintiff purchased Red Elvis from Malmberg for $300,000. The only written documentation evidencing the plaintiffs purchase of Red Elvis was the invoice that she received from Malmberg, written on Malmberg\u2019s stationery. During the process of purchasing Red Elvis, the plaintiff relied entirely on Malmberg to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In 1989, the plaintiff, with the assistance of Malmberg, loaned Red Elvis to the Museum of Modem Art in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>York to be included in a Warhol exhibition. A label affixed to the painting indicated that it was owned by a \u201c[p]rivate [collector\u201d and had been loaned to the Museum of Modem Art \u201c[c]ourtesy Anders Malmberg.\u201d The defendant visited the exhibition, viewed Red Elvis and saw its label, thereby becoming aware that Malmberg was associated with Red Elvis and its owner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In 1996, the Guggenheim Museum (Guggenheim) decided to sponsor an exhibition of Warhol paintings that would travel to several European venues, ending in New York City during the summer of 2000. Vivien Greene, an assistant curator at the Guggenheim, prepared a list of Warhol works of art to be considered for inclusion in the exhibition. Red Elvis was one of the works of art on the list. Also included on the list were several works of art owned by the defendant, who at this time was a member of the Guggenheim\u2019s board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In late summer of 1998, Germano Celant, a curator of the exhibition, met with the defendant to discuss loaning some of his Warhol artwork to the exhibition. In addition, Celant asked the defendant to assist him in obtaining loans of other Warhol artwork for the exhibition, including Red Elvis. The defendant advised Celant that he believed that Red Elvis was owned by a Swedish woman and that Celant should contact either Stellan Holm, a Swedish art dealer, or James Mayer, a London art dealer, for more information. The defendant referred Celant to Holm and Mayer because he knew that Malmberg was associated with Red Elvis and its owner, and that Holm and Mayer had had previous business relations with Malmberg. The defendant also spoke to Holm, who had worked with the defendant on numerous occasions buying and selling Warhol artworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>In the fall of 1998, the defendant had never met Malmberg, but was aware that he enjoyed a reputation as a well respected art dealer. At that time, the defendant did not personally know either the plaintiff or Lindholm.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Through the efforts of Holm, who had contacted Malmberg, the plaintiff agreed to lend Red Elvis to the exhibition. Holm notified the defendant that the plaintiff would lend Red Elvis to the Guggenheim and that her name would be listed on the loan forms. Malmberg helped the plaintiff to complete the loan forms, in which the plaintiff requested that the exhibition display Red Elvis with an identification plaque that read \u201c \u2018Private Collection, Courtesy Anders Malmberg, Malmo, Sweden.\u2019 \u201d The defendant assisted the Guggenheim with the shipping arrangements for Red Elvis, which was sent from the United States to Europe in September, 1998. Accordingly, as of September, 1998, the defendant knew from Holm that the plaintiff owned Red Elvis and that it was on loan to the Guggenheim for a Warhol exhibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In 1998, Lindholm initiated divorce proceedings against the plaintiff in Connecticut. Because of a shortage of funds, the plaintiff enlisted Malmberg to assist her in selling certain works of art located in the Lindholms\u2019 residence in Greenwich. On November 16,1999, the plaintiff and Malmberg entered into an agreement that designated Malmberg as the plaintiffs agent for the purpose of selling \u201c \u2018certain works.\u2019 \u201d Although the agreement did not specify which artworks Malmberg was authorized to sell, the plaintiff had neither agreed to sell nor discussed with Malmberg or anyone else the possibility of selling Red Elvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">On December 6,1999, the family court issued an order requiring the plaintiff \u201cto immediately return ... all artwork and other property which she removed from the marital home whether claimed by [Lindholm] or [the plaintiff]\u201d and enjoining the plaintiff \u201cfrom selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>property without a court order . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 8, 1999, the plaintiffs divorce counsel wrote a letter to Malmberg notifying him of the court order, thereby putting Malmberg on notice that he no longer was authorized to sell any property of either the plaintiff or Lindholm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">During this same time period, Holm, who had been working closely with the defendant in the purchase and sale of other Warhol works of art, advised the defendant, on the basis of a conversation with Malmberg, that Malmberg had purchased Red Elvis. Holm also asked whether the defendant would be interested in purchasing the painting if it became available for sale. Soon afterward, the defendant met with Holm and Malmberg at the defendant\u2019s residence. When Malmberg and Holm repeated that Malmberg had purchased Red Elvis from the plaintiff and asked whether the defendant would be interested in purchasing it, the defendant indicated that he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On or about February 2, 2000, the defendant agreed to pay Malmberg $2.9 million dollars for Red Elvis. Malmberg gave the defendant an invoice for the $2.9 million sale, indicating that a $900,000 deposit would be required immediately and that the balance would be due by a certain date. Although the defendant wired the deposit money to Malmberg, he objected to paying the balance prior to delivery of the painting without first entering into a formal contract with Malmberg. The defendant retained counsel to draft a contract and to conduct the necessary lien searches to identify any claims that Lindholm, who was in the midst of a bitter divorce and was reputed to be litigious, might have to the painting. During the contract negotiations, the law firm that the defendant had retained conducted a hen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>search and an Art Loss Register<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> search relating to Red Elvis. Neither search revealed a claim or lien by Lindholm or any other individual. The defendant\u2019s counsel cautioned the defendant, however, that these searches only provided \u201cminimal assurances\u201d that Malmberg had good title to the painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The defendant and Malmberg exchanged numerous drafts of the contract during the negotiations, which were completed on March 20, 2000. Ultimately, Malmberg agreed to delay payment of the balance until the delivery of Red Elvis to a bonded warehouse in Denmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">During the negotiations, Holm served as a messenger between Malmberg and the defendant\u2019s counsel. In an effort to address the defendant\u2019s concerns about Lindholm\u2019s potential claims, Holm prepared a letter (the Swedish-English letter) to be signed by the plaintiff stating that she had good title when she sold the painting to Malmberg. The letter would be treated as confidential unless Lindholm made a claim to Red Elvis. Holm showed the letter to the defendant, but the letter was never signed by the plaintiff. When the defendant\u2019s counsel requested a copy of the signed letter, Holm refused, stating that it was none of the defendant\u2019s business. The defendant\u2019s counsel communicated Holm\u2019s response to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The defendant also was concerned that, even though Holm had assured him that Malmberg was the current owner, Malmberg had not yet acquired title to the painting or that this transaction was going to be a \u201cflip.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The defendant\u2019s counsel, in an effort to clarify whether Malmberg owned the painting, requested a copy of the invoice from the plaintiff to Malmberg. Malmberg denied this request on the ground that such invoices are not normally and customarily disclosed in the context of an art transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On February 17, 2000, during the contract negotiations between the defendant and Malmberg, the Guggenheim notified the plaintiff, as a lender to the Warhol exhibition, that the exhibition would be terminating prematurely. At that point, the plaintiff agreed, at the suggestion of Greene, to lend Red Elvis to the branch of the Guggenheim located in Bilbao, Spain. After Malmberg advised the plaintiff that Red Elvis would get better exposure at an exhibition at the Louisiana Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, the plaintiff agreed to lend the painting to the Louisiana Museum. The plaintiff did not inform Greene that she had changed her mind about displaying the painting in Bilbao until Greene called her on March 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Also on March 17, 2000, the defendant spoke with Elissa Myerowitz, a registrar employed by the Guggenheim, to inquire when his Warhol works of art would be returned to him. The defendant also asked about the current status of Red Elvis. Myerowitz indicated that the painting was being returned to the plaintiff, who was listed as the lender on the loan forms. The defendant advised Myerowitz that the plaintiff no longer owned Red Elvis and that she should contact the new owner, Malmberg, because it was his understanding that Malmberg wanted Red Elvis to go to Denmark. The defendant believed that Red Elvis was going to be shipped to Denmark because, at that time in the negotiations, he had agreed to accept delivery there. Myerowitz then told Greene about her conversation with the defendant, after which Greene called the plaintiff. During this conversation, the plaintiff informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Greene that she had changed her mind and had decided to lend the painting to the Louisiana Museum. The plaintiff also informed Greene that Red Elvis should be released to Malmberg\u2019s custody because he was going to arrange for the shipment of the painting to Denmark. Greene advised the plaintiff that she would have to provide the Guggenheim with a letter authorizing the Guggenheim to release Red Elvis to Malmberg, which the plaintiff did on March 20, 2000. Greene then informed Myerowitz of the substance of Greene\u2019s conversation with the plaintiff, confirming that Red Elvis was to be released to Malmberg for shipment to the museum in Denmark. On March 21, 2000, the defendant called Myerowitz to inform her about the shipping arrangements to Denmark.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On April 12, 2000, after execution of the purchase contract, the defendant wired the remaining $2 million purchase price to Malmberg\u2019s bank account and took possession of Red Elvis. On April 27, 2000, the defendant had the painting insured and arranged to have it shipped from Denmark to the United States. The defendant then allowed Red Elvis to be shown in a traveling exhibition from May, 2000, through the end of 2002, doing nothing to conceal the fact that he believed that he owned the painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">From March, 2000, until the fall of 2000, the plaintiff took no steps to verify that Red Elvis was on display at the Louisiana Museum but, instead, relied on Malmberg\u2019s representations that the painting was there. In the fall of 2000, Malmberg informed the plaintiff that Red Elvis had not arrived at the Louisiana Museum in time to be apart of the exhibition. Thereafter, following an inquiry from Malmberg, the plaintiff authorized the sale of Red Elvis for $4.6 million to a Japanese buyer. The plaintiff authorized Malmberg to ship Red Elvis to Japan. In January, 2001, the plaintiff met with Malmberg and delivered an invoice conveying title to Red Elvis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to one of Malmberg\u2019s companies, Eagle Eye Art Investments, Inc. The plaintiff agreed to have the sale proceeds sent directly to Malmberg\u2019s bank account. When the plaintiff agreed to sell Red Elvis for $4.6 million, she believed that she still owned Red Elvis, and was unaware that Malmberg already had sold the painting to the defendant in March, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In June, 2001, while awaiting her $4.6 million payment from the sale to the Japanese buyer, the plaintiff read a magazine article that reported that the defendant had purchased Red Elvis from Malmberg. When the plaintiff telephoned Malmberg, he told her that the article was inaccurate and that the defendant actually had bought a different painting, which was referred to as Green Elvis. For more than one year from the time that the plaintiff learned that the defendant had purchased Red Elvis, the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought the return of the sale proceeds from Malmberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On April 5, 2002, counsel for the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant informing him that Malmberg\u2019s purported sale of Red Elvis to the defendant had not been authorized by the plaintiff and that title in the painting had not passed to the defendant. He further stated that, if the defendant did not return the painting to the plaintiff, she would commence proceedings against the defendant in the United States to recover the painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">On November 5, 2002, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging, inter alia, conversion, conspiracy to commit fraud, statutory theft, and unjust enrichment against the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to all counts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>defendant asserted the special defense that he was a buyer in the ordinary course of business pursuant to \u00a7 42a-2-403 (2), under which he took all of the plaintiffs rights to Red Elvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">At trial, the defendant presented expert testimony that, in the art industry, it was the ordinary and customary practice that if an individual regularly worked with a particular art dealer or an art dealer was identified on the identification label of a loaned work of art, inquiries about an art transaction would be presented to the art dealer rather than directly to the principal. Buyers ordinarily and customarily relied on representations made by respected dealers regarding their authority to sell works of art. Purchases and sales of works of art were documented solely by a single invoice from seller to buyer. It was also ordinary and customary to proceed with the purchase of valuable works of art without requesting or receiving documentary proof that the selling dealer had the authority to sell the work of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Following a trial to the court, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision on August 29,2005, in which it concluded that the defendant had satisfied his burden of proving that he was a buyer in the ordinary course of business, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. The court noted that the defendant, a merchant, had bought Red Elvis in good faith by observing reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the art industry and by taking reasonable steps to investigate title. The court further recognized that \u201cthe vast majority of art transactions . . . are completed on a handshake and an exchange of an invoice,\u201d and found that the defendant had taken the unusual steps of \u201cretaining counsel, authorizing counsel to engage in due diligence and insisting on formal contract documents [containing warranties and representations] in addition to an invoice.\u201d In addition, the court indicated that the defendant\u2019s counsel had conducted a lien search and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>an Art Loss Register search that revealed no defects in title, and found that the defendant reasonably had relied on the assurances of Malmberg and Holm, both of whom had reputations as honest and trustworthy art dealers. Moreover, the court concluded that it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that Malmberg had title to the painting because the Guggenheim had released the painting to him and he had been able to deliver Red Elvis to the defendant in Denmark. Because the plaintiff had been represented by an art dealer, it would have been inappropriate for the defendant to contact the plaintiff directly. The court concluded, on the basis of the reasonable steps taken by the defendant, that it would have been an extraordinary measure for the defendant to have insisted on seeing the signed Swedish-English letter or the invoice from the plaintiff to Malmberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">This appeal followed. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant took good title to Red Elvis as a buyer in the ordinary coruse of business because: (1) the defendant was an art merchant who had valid concerns about Malmberg\u2019s ability to convey title; (2) applicable commercial standards of fair dealing required the defendant to \u201cinvestigate [the transaction] scrupulously\u201d; (3) the investigation conducted by the defendant\u2019s counsel provided only \u201cminimal assurances\u201d that Malmberg had good title; (4) Malmberg refused to provide documentary proof that he owned Red Elvis; and (5) the defendant could have discovered that Malmberg did not have good title and that a court order precluded the plaintiff from selling the painting if he had telephoned the plaintiff, the plaintiffs counsel, Lindholm, or Lindholm\u2019s counsel. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cHistorical facts constitute a recital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>of external events and the credibility of their narrators. So-called mixed questions of fact and law, which require the application of a legal standard to the historical-fact determinations, are not facts in this sense. . . . [Such questions require] plenary review by this court unfettered by the clearly erroneous standard. . . . When legal conclusions of the trial court are challenged on appeal, we must decide whether [those] . . . conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Friezo </em>v. Friezo, 281 Conn. 166, 181, 914 A.2d 533 (2007). Here, we must determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant was a buyer in the ordinary course of business. This requires application of the legal standards in the governing statutes to the underlying historical facts. Accordingly, the plaintiffs claim that the defendant is not a buyer in the ordinary course is a mixed question of fact and law subject to our plenary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly found that the defendant had established his affirmative defense that he was a buyer in the ordinary course, and, therefore, took all of the plaintiffs rights to Red Elvis. \u201cIt is an elementary rule that whenever the existence of any fact is necessary in order that a party may make out his case or establish his defense, the burden is on such party to show the existence of such fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Zhang </em>v. <em>Omnipoint Communications Enterprises, Inc., </em>272 Conn. 627, 645, 866 A.2d 588 (2005). Therefore, the burden was on the defendant to show the existence of such facts as would entitle him to the status of a buyer in the ordinary course pursuant to \u00a7 42a-2-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Section 42a-2-403 (2) provides that \u201c[a]ny entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.\u201d \u201c \u2018Entrusting\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cany delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor\u2019s disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-403 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">There is no dispute in the present case that the plaintiffs March 20, 2000 letter authorizing the Guggenheim to release Red Elvis to Malmberg constituted an entrustment under \u00a7 42a-2-403 (3), or that Malmberg, an art dealer, is a merchant dealing in \u201cgoods of that kind\u201d \u2014 works of art \u2014 under \u00a7 42a-2-403 (2). Under the plain language of \u00a7 42a-2-403 (2) and (3), therefore, Malmberg, as a merchant dealing in art entrusted with the painting, had the power to transfer all the rights of the entruster to a buyer in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">A \u201c \u2018[bjuyer in [the] ordinary course of business\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201ca person that buys goods in good faith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods, and in the ordinary course from a person ... in the business of selling goods of that kind. A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller\u2019s own usual or customary practices. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-l-201 (9).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A person buys goods in good faith if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>is \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing\u201d in the conduct or transaction concerned. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-201 (20).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We are required, therefore, to determine whether the defendant followed the usual or customary practices and observed reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the ait industry in his dealings with Malmberg. As we have indicated, the defendant presented expert testimony that the vast majority of art transactions, in which the buyer has no reason for concern about the seller\u2019s ability to convey good title, are \u201ccompleted on a handshake and an exchange of an invoice.\u201d It is not customary for sophisticated buyers and sellers to obtain a signed invoice from the original seller to the dealer prior to a transaction, nor is it an ordinary or customary practice to request the underlying invoice or corroborating information as to a dealer\u2019s authority to convey title. Moreover, it is not customary to approach the owner of an artwork if the owner regularly worked with a particular ait dealer because any inquiries about an art transaction customarily are presented to the art dealer rather than directly to the principal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>It is customary to rely upon representations made by respected dealers regarding their authority to sell works of art. A dealer customarily is not required to present an invoice establishing when and from whom he bought the artwork or the conditions of the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We are compelled to conclude, however, that the sale from Malmberg to the defendant was unlike the vast majority of art transactions. The defendant had good reason to be concerned that Lindholm might have claims to the painting. Several courts have held that, under such circumstances, a handshake and an exchange of invoice is not sufficient to confer status as a buyer in the ordinary course. In <em>Porter </em>v. Wertz, 68 App. Div. 141, 143, 416 N.Y.S.2d 254 (1979), aff'd, 53 N.Y.2d 696, 421 N.E.2d 500, 439 N.Y.S.2d 105 (1981), for example, the owner of a painting entrusted it to an individual with whom he previously had conducted art transactions for display in the individual\u2019s home. This individual then used the services of a delicatessen employee, posing as an art dealer, to sell the painting to a merchant art buyer. Id., 145-46. In discussing the good faith obligation of a merchant, the court stated that although the definition of good faith \u201cby its terms embraces the reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade, it should not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be interpreted to permit, countenance or condone commercial standards of sharp trade practice or indifference as to the provenance, i.e., history of ownership or the right to possess or sell an object d\u2019art . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 146. The buyer made no inquiry as to whether the purported art dealer, who was in fact a delicatessen employee, was the owner of the painting or had been authorized by the owner to sell the painting. Id. Because a simple telephone call would have revealed the fact that the defendant was not an art merchant, thereby leading to doubt that would have required further verification, the court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>eluded that the buyer could not claim buyer in the ordinary course of business status. Id., 146-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In <em>Howley </em>v. <em>Sotheby\u2019s, Inc., </em>New York Law Journal, Vol. 195 (February 20, 1986) p.6, col. 3B, the owner of a painting sought its recovery from the defendant art dealer. The defendant had purchased the painting from the caretaker of the owner\u2019s home, who had posed as the owner\u2019s nephew, even though the defendant was unsure whether the \u201cowner\u2019s nephew\u201d had authority to sell the painting. Id. The court concluded that, because the defendant was a professional art dealer, he should have been \u201cscrupulously concerned with taking proper title in anything he purchases.\u201d Id. Because the defendant had not taken any steps to verify title, even after the \u201cowner\u2019s nephew\u201d informed him that the sale first needed the owner\u2019s approval, the defendant did not fulfill his obligation and was liable for conversion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In <em>Cantor </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>639 F. Sup. 364, 367-68 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 833 F.2d 1002 (2d Cir. 1986), the court, citing <em>Howley, </em>imposed a duty upon a sophisticated buyer to inquire into a painting\u2019s ownership when circumstances dictate. In <em>Cantor, </em>the buyer and the seller had engaged in numerous previous art transactions. Id., 366. When the buyer sought the return of several of his artworks that were on consignment with the seller, the seller gave the buyer a painting, to which he claimed ownership, as security for the artworks on consignment. Id., 367. The buyer, who had been aware of the seller\u2019s financial difficulties and was familiar with the seller\u2019s practice of selling works on consignment, had reason to doubt the seller\u2019s ownership of the painting. Id., 368. This doubt led to a duty to obtain some verification that the seller had good title. Because the buyer had made no efforts to verify title to the painting, choosing to rely solely on the seller\u2019s assurances, the court concluded that the buyer had not fulfilled his duty and was liable for conversion. Id., 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Finally, in <em>Morgold, Inc. </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>891 F. Sup. 1361, 1369 (N.D. Cal. 1995), the court held that an art dealer buyer had obtained good title to a painting by satisfying \u201cthe reasonable commercial standards in the art industry . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In that case, the buyer and the seller had engaged in previous art transactions for several years. Id., 1364. When the buyer purchased the painting from the seller, he was unaware that the seller had only a one-half interest in the painting. Id., 1363-65. The court imposed a duty on \u201cdealers in art [to] take reasonable steps to inquire into the title to a painting, particularly if there are warnings that something is wrong with a transaction.\u201d Id., 1368. In <em>Morgold, Inc., </em>the buyer had engaged in previous art transactions with the seller and had contacted an expert on the artist, who gave no indication of problems with the painting\u2019s title. Id., 1365. Because there were no other warning signs indicating problems with title, the court concluded that the buyer had fulfilled his duty to make a reasonable inquiry and had acquired good title and a right to possession of the painting. Id., 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We agree with these courts that a merchant buyer has a heightened duty of inquiry when a reasonable merchant would have doubts or questions regarding the seller\u2019s authority to sell. We further conclude that the steps that a merchant must take to conform to reasonable commercial standards before consummating a deal depend on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the sale. In the present case, the defendant had concerns about Malmberg\u2019s ability to convey good title to Red Elvis because he believed that Lindholm might have had a claim to the painting. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>also was concerned that Malmberg had not yet acquired title to the painting or that the transaction might be a \u201cflip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Because of his concern that Lindholm might make a claim to Red Elvis, the defendant took the extraordinary step of hiring counsel to conduct an investigation and to negotiate a formal contract of sale on his behalf. He also insisted on and obtained a formal contract containing representations and warranties that Malmberg had title to the painting. In addition, during the course of the investigation, the defendant\u2019s counsel conducted both a lien search and an Art Loss Register search that revealed no competing claims to Red Elvis. Although the defendant was cautioned that the searches provided only minimal assurance that Malmberg had good title to the painting, such searches typically are not conducted during the course of a normal art transaction and, therefore, provided the defendant with at least some assurance that Lindholm had no claims to the painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Moreover, the evidence was sufficient for the trial court reasonably to conclude that at all times during the transaction, both Malmberg and Holm had reputations as honest, reliable, and trustworthy art dealers. This is not like the situation in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Wertz, </em>supra, 68 App. Div. 146, in which the court concluded that the buyer was not a buyer in the ordinary course of business because he did not know the dealer or his reputation. The defendant had little reason to doubt Malmberg\u2019s claim that he was the owner of Red Elvis, and any doubts that he did have reasonably were allayed by relying on Holm\u2019s assurances that Malmberg had bought the painting from the plaintiff because she needed money due to her divorce. The defendant established at trial that it is customary to rely on the assurances of respected art dealers when conducting a transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>and the defendant had no reason to depart from this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The defendant\u2019s concerns were further allayed when Maimberg delivered Red Elvis to a bonded warehouse in Denmark, the delivery location the parties had agreed to in the contract of sale. At the time of the sale, the painting was on loan to the Guggenheim, whose policy it was to release a painting on loan only to the true owner, or to someone the true owner had authorized to take possession. The defendant was not informed that the plaintiff had authorized release to Maimberg for the sole purpose of lending the painting to a museum in Denmark. Knowing that the Guggenheim would release the painting to an authorized party only, it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that Maimberg was the true owner of the painting. We conclude that these steps were sufficient to conform to reasonable commercial standards for the sale of artwork under the circumstances and, therefore, that the defendant had status as a buyer in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We recognize that the customary practice in the art industry of not requiring a merchant buyer to obtain documentary proof that the seller owns the work of art whenever there are reasonable doubts or questions regarding the seller\u2019s authority to sell imposes risks on persons who entrust art to an art dealer. Section 42a-1-201 (9) evinces a legislative desire, however, for courts to respect \u201cthe usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged . . . .\u201d We are not entitled to impose the type of business practices that we would prefer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Moreover, the evidence presented at trial established that the reason that documentary proof of ownership customarily is not required is to protect the confidentiality of the owner and the buyer. Requiring a merchant buyer to obtain an invoice or other supporting docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>mentation proving the seller\u2019s ownership would in every transaction destroy the privacy and confidentiality that buyers and sellers have come to desire and expect. Accordingly, only when circumstances surrounding the sale cast severe doubt on the ownership of the artwork are merchant buyers required to obtain documentary assurance that the seller has good title. In this instance, the Swedish-English letter was produced at Holm\u2019s suggestion to give the defendant assurance that the <em>plaintiff </em>had good title when she sold the painting to Malmberg. In light of the customary practices in the industry, the defendant reasonably could have concluded that Malmberg was unwilling to produce a signed copy of the letter because of his desire to protect the owner\u2019s expectation of confidentiality in their transaction. The purpose of the letter was not to give the defendant assurance that <em>Malmberg </em>had good title to the painting, and any concerns about Malmberg\u2019s title that could be inferred from the refusal to show the defendant a signed copy of the letter were quickly allayed by Malmberg\u2019s subsequent delivery of the painting to Denmark. Accordingly, we conclude, on the basis of all the circumstances surrounding this sale, that the defendant\u2019s failure to obtain an invoice from the plaintiff to Malmberg or a signed copy of the Swedish-English letter does not strip him of his status as a buyer in the ordinary course of business. For the same reasons, we conclude that the defendant was not required to contact directly the plaintiff or other parties who might have had knowledge concerning Red Elvis\u2019 title.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the defendant was a buyer in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, took all rights the plaintiff had to the painting pursuant to \u00a7 42a-2-403 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\"> Although the plaintiffs complaint also named the Brant Foundation, Inc., and Anders Malmberg as defendants, the plaintiff did not appeal from the judgment in favor of the Brant Foundation, Inc., and withdrew her complaint against Malmberg prior to trial.

In March, 2003, the Swedish court convicted Malmberg of gross fraud embezzlement and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $4.6 million. The Swedish court allowed the plaintiff to pursue additional damages against Malmberg in the future. Subsequently, on May 24, 2005, the plaintiff withdrew her claims against Malmberg in this action. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\"> The trial court in its analysis relied on the current version of \u00a7 42a-l-201 (9). At the time of the sale from Malmberg to the defendant, a buyer in the ordinary course of business was defined as \u201ca person who in good faith and without knowledge that the sale to him is in violation of the ownership rights or security interest of a third party in the goods buys in ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker. . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 42a-l-201 (9). Neither party contends that the trial court used the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>statutory standard for determining whether the defendant is a buyer in the ordinary course of business. We also note that the second sentence of the current version of \u00a7 42a-l-201 (9), which was added to the statute by Public Acts 2001, No. 01-132, \u00a7 135, can be interpreted as codifying the standard in existing case law, that a sale must comport with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged. For convenience and consistency in our analysis, we refer to the current version of \u00a7 42a-l-201 (9).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> The trial court in its analysis used the version of the statute in effect at the time of the sale, which provided that \u201c \u2018[g]ood faith\u2019 in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 42a-2-103 (1) (b). That language currently is codified at \u00a7 42a-l-201 (20). See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-109, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 23. Because both definitions contain identical language, we refer to the current definition of good faith in \u00a7 42a-l-201 (20) for convenience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Although the court in <em>Morgold, Inc. </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>supra, 891 F.
