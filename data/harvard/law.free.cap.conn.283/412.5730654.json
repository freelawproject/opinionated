Specifically, we must consider whether a plaintiffs withdrawal of claims against a party, without payment of a settlement or other consideration, constitutes a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d for purposes of apportionment under General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (n).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>We conclude that a withdrawal does not constitute such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>an agreement, and we reject the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The defendant is an obstetrician working with the practice group of Associated Women\u2019s Health Specialists, P.C. (Associated Health). The defendant attended to Jodee\u2019s mother, Leslie Aponte, during Aponte\u2019s pregnancy beginning in November, 1994, and through May, 1995, and during the early stages of her labor on May 25, 1995, at Waterbury Hospital. The defendant left during the second stage of Aponte\u2019s labor and thereafter was unavailable. Ian Cohen, another obstetrician affiliated with Associated Health, attended to Aponte during the final stages of labor and delivery. During that delivery, an obstetrical emergency occurred, known as shoulder dystocia, wherein the infant\u2019s head delivers, but partly retracts because the baby\u2019s shoulders become lodged, requiring delivery of the child within minutes to avoid risk of neurological injury or death. See generally T. Stedman, Medical Dictionary (28th Ed. 2006) p. 602. As a result of the shoulder dystocia during her birth, Jodee sustained an injury to her brachial plexis, a network of nerves in the neck, leaving her with a permanent injury affecting her upper left extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">On August 22, 1997, Aponte and Joseph Viera, Jodee\u2019s father, commenced this medical malpractice action against the defendant, Cohen, Associated Health and Waterbury Hospital. In November, 2003, they withdrew the claim against Waterbury Hospital. In December, 2003, Baker was substituted as the plaintiff to represent Jodee\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>On December 16, 2004, during jury selection, the plaintiff withdrew the claims against Cohen and Associated Health. On January 20, 2005, the defendant filed a notice of claim of apportionment as to the withdrawn defendants, Cohen, Associated Health and Waterbury Hospital. In response, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the defendant from introducing, inter alia, any evidence for the purposes of establishing fault against the withdrawn defendants. After argument on the motion, the trial court rendered an oral decision granting the plaintiffs motion, thereby foreclosing the defendant from seeking apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging, in essence, that the defendant had breached the standard of care by failing: to assess properly Aponte\u2019s risk factors for shoulder dystocia; to diagnose timely the problems during Aponte\u2019s labor that indicated a risk of shoulder dystocia; and, finally, to perform a cesarean section to prevent the injuries ensuing from shoulder dystocia. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and awarded $948,692 in economic damages and $1.5 million in noneconomic damages. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict and thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) prevented him from pursuing an apportionment complaint against Cohen; (2) prevented the jury from considering an alternative theory as to the cause of the shoulder dystocia; (3) submitted to the jury misleading and improper interrogatories; and (4) concluded that it had personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant also claims that certain evidentiary rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>by the trial court and conduct by the plaintiffs counsel resulted in undue prejudice to him. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The defendant claims that he was entitled to seek apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (n), which provides in relevant part that, although \u201c[a] release, settlement or similar agreement entered into by a claimant . . . discharges that person from all liability for contribution . . . the total award of damages is reduced by the amount of the released person\u2019s percentage of negligence determined in accordance with subsection (f) of this section.\u201d Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly precluded him from seeking apportionment of liability between himself and Cohen based on its determination that, because the plaintiff had withdrawn the action against Cohen without payment of a settlement, there was no \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d that brought Cohen within the scope of \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court properly concluded that the defendant could not seek apportionment against Cohen.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">At the outset, we note that, \u201c[b]ecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396, 655 A.2d 759 (1995). Well settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>principles of statutory interpretation govern our review. General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d When the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes do not reveal a meaning that is plain and unambiguous, our analysis is not limited, and we look to other factors relevant to determining the meaning of \u00a7 52-272h (n), including its legislative history, the circumstances surrounding its enactment and its purpose. <em>Nine State Street, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>270 Conn. 42, 46, 850 A.2d 1032 (2004). \u201cThe test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Tar<em>nowsky </em>v. <em>Socci, </em>271 Conn. 284, 287 n.3, 856 A.2d 408 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the evolution of tort law in this state regarding the apportionment of damages among multiple tortfeasors. \u201cPrior to October 1, 1986, this state followed the rules of joint and several liability with no contribution among joint tortfeasors. Stated briefly: If the illegal conduct of each of the defendants was a proximate cause of the collision, they would be liable jointly and severally, the plaintiff would have a right to recover the entire amount of damages awarded from either, and, if he did so, the defendant paying them would have no right of contribution against the other; or the plaintiff might have sued either alone, and of course in the event of a recovery, that one would have been compelled to pay the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>amount of damages. . . . <em>Donner </em>v. Kearse, 234 Conn. 660, 666, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u201cUnder the common law of joint and several liability, therefore, even a defendant whose degree of fault was comparatively small could be held responsible for the entire amount of damages, so long as his negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. Thus, the plaintiff could collect the entire amount of his judgment from the richest defendant, or from the defendant with the deepest pocket. ... Id., 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u201cIn response largely to these concerns, the legislature undertook to reform the tort recovery provisions of our civil system, by enacting No. 86-338 of the 1986 Public Acts (Tort Reform I), which took effect October 1,1986. Tort Reform I replaced the common-law rule of joint and several liability with a system of apportioned liability, holding each defendant hable for only his or her proportionate share of damages. Specifically, \u00a7 3 (f) of Tort Reform I provided that each defendant initially would be hable for only that percentage of his negligence that proximately caused the injury, in relation to [100] per cent, that is attributable to each person whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the damages .... Therefore, under Tort Reform I, the jury, in determining the percentage of negligence attributable to any defendant, could take into account the negligence of any other person, regardless of whether that person was a party to the action. Tort Reform I, however, did not provide the plaintiff with a means of securing payment of damages unless that person was also a party. <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u201cUnder Tort Reform I, to avoid the possibihty that a jury would find that the neghgence of a nonparty was aprox\u00edmate cause of [the plaintiffs] injuries, [the] plaintiff was required to name as defendants all persons whose actions suggested even the slightest hint of negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>gence. The unwanted practical effect, therefore, was that plaintiffs were required to pursue claims of weak liability against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our courts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cThe legislature amended these tort recovery provisions just one year later when it enacted No. 87-227 of the 1987 Public Acts (Tort Reform II), the pertinent provisions of which now are codified in part under \u00a7 52-572h. These revisions, which took effect October 1, 1987, altered the class of individuals to whom the jury could look in determining whose negligence had been a proximate cause of a plaintiff s injuries. In short, these revisions changed the focus of this class of negligent individuals from any person to any party and certain other identifiable persons. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (c), (d), (f) [and] (n). Thus, while Tort Reform I provided that the jury, in determining the percentage of responsibility of a particular defendant, could also consider the entire universe of negligent persons, Tort Reform II limited this universe to only those individuals who were parties to the legal action or who were specifically identified in \u00a7 52-572h (n). . . . <em>Eskin </em>v. <em>Castiglia, </em>253 Conn. 516, 525-26, 753 A.2d 927 (2000). Thus, the provisions set forth in \u00a7 52-572h establish two classes of persons whose negligence must be considered by the trier of fact: (1) the parties to the action; and (2) settled or released persons, as the term is defined in subsection (n).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>257 Conn. 718, 729-31, 778 A.2d 899 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In sum, in substantially revising and rewriting \u00a7 52-572h, the legislature: limited the persons to whom percentages of negligence could be attributed; required the jury or court to specify any findings of fact necessary for the court to articulate recoverable economic damages and recoverable noneconomic damages; and revised the method of reallocating an uncollectible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>amount of damages so that all recoverable economic damages would be reallocated among the other defendants and would compensate the claimant fully for such recoverable economic damages. See <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 666-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Nonetheless, \u201cTort Reform II overlooked [certain] significant details required to implement effectively the newly created fault apportionment system. . . . Among other things, Tort Reform II did not specify the procedure to be used in asserting an apportionment claim. ... To remedy this and other problems, the legislature, in 1995, enacted [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-102b,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which delineates the manner in which apportion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ment claims under \u00a7 52-572h are to be brought. See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-111, \u00a7 1. . . . [Section] 52-102b (c) sets forth the notice that is required when a defendant asserts an apportionment claim against a nonparty to the action who has settled with the plaintiff or who has been released from the plaintiffs claims.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>280 Conn. 125, 142, 905 A.2d 654 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Against this legislative landscape, we must now examine what constitutes \u201c[a] release, settlement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>similar agreement entered into by a claimant\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h (n). Specifically, the present case requires that we consider whether, pursuant to the apportionment scheme under \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h and 52-102b; see footnotes 2 and 5 of this opinion; the court should have permitted the defendant to seek apportionment of liability between himself and Cohen, when the plaintiffs action against Cohen had been withdrawn, and he thus no longer was a party to the action. The defendant acknowledges that the term \u201cwithdrawal\u201d is not provided for expressly in \u00a7 52-572h, but contends that it nonetheless should be included within the statute based on two theories. The first theory is that, to further the statutory goal of proportionality, the terms \u201crelease\u201d and \u201csettlement\u201d in \u00a7 52-572h (n) must be read broadly to include the withdrawal of an action. The defendant\u2019s second theory is that, even if it is not included under a broad reading of \u201crelease\u201d and \u201csettlement,\u201d a withdrawal constitutes a \u201csimilar agreement\u201d within the meaning of subsection (n) in light of what he deems the legislature\u2019s \u201cdesire to apply the statutory scheme without regard to terminological exactitude over the circumstances under which a defendant exits the case and without necessarily referring to a particular type of document or settlement money.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, we are mindful that \u00a7 52-572h abrogated the common-law rule of joint and several liability. \u201c[W]hen a statute is in derogation of common law ... it should receive a strict construction and is not to be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of [statutory] construction. ... In determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>to matters clearly brought within its scope. . . . Although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed. . . . The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed can be seen to serve the same policy of continuity and stability in the legal system as the doctrine of stare decisis in relation to case law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Matthiessen </em>v. <em>Vanech, </em>266 Conn. 822, 838-39, 836 A.2d 394 (2003), quoting <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>249 Conn. 709, 715, 735 A.2d 306 (1999). Accordingly, we conduct our inquiry through this narrow lens.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">To address the defendant\u2019s first contention, we begin with the terms \u201csettlement\u201d and \u201crelease.\u201d Both of these terms have well established meanings. \u201cA settlement is a legally enforceable agreement in which a claimant agrees not to seek recovery outside the agreement for specified injuries or claims from some or all of the persons who might be liable for those injuries or claims.\u201d Restatement (Third), Torts, Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 24 (a) (2000). It is well established that, to be a legally enforceable agreement, a settlement must be supported by consideration. See, e.g., <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>124 Conn. 625, 630-32, 1 A.2d 911 (1938); <em>Church </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>85 Conn. 579, 582-83, 83 A. 1115 (1912). Its goal is to further finality and to avoid the costs and uncertainties of protracted litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">A release is an agreement to give up or discharge a claim. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Gartenhaus Cafe, </em>211 Conn. 67, 73-74 n.8, 557 A.2d 540 (1989); <em>Ramsay </em>v. <em>Camrac, Inc., </em>96 Conn. App. 190, 200, 899 A.2d 727, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 910, 908 A.2d 538 (2006). It \u201cterminates litigation or a dispute and [is] meant to be a final expression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of settlement . . . .\u201d 66 Am. Jur. 2d 370-71, Release \u00a7 1 (2001). A release acts like a contract and, as with any contract, requires consideration, voluntariness and contractual capacity. See id., \u00a7\u00a747 through 51, pp. 416-20; see also <em>Dwy </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>89 Conn. 74, 77-79, 92 A. 883 (1915) (\u201cIt is an ancient and familiar legal proposition that a release or discharge of one or more of several joint tort-feasors, <em>given for a consideration, </em>is a release of all. . . . [I]t has been said that the reason is that the law considers that the one who has received the release committed the whole tort and occasioned the whole injury, and that it has satisfied the injured party.\u201d [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]). In other words, the document ensures the released tortfeasor that he has bought his peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Accordingly, \u201c[Releases and settlements . . . represent a surrender of a cause of action, perhaps for a consideration less than the injury received\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Gion</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>friddo </em>v. <em>Gartenhaus Cafe, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 73-74 n.8; but, nevertheless, a surrender pursuant to an agreement. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-195c (a). An \u201cagreement\u201d is \u201c[t]he union of two or more minds in a thing done or to be done; a coming together of parties in opinion or determination .... [T]he legal import of the word includes not only a promise, but also the consideration for which the promise was made.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). Thus, a settlement and release reflect concerted behavior. Indeed, as the foregoing discussion illustrates, settlements and releases, in the context at issue, are agreements that generally go hand in hand. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-195c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">By contrast, a withdrawal shares few of the essential characteristics of a settlement and a release. Although the legislature has not defined the term withdrawal, its rules governing the manner in which a party may withdraw a cause of action inform the term\u2019s meaning. A plaintiff may withdraw an action unilaterally and unconditionally before a hearing on the merits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the withdrawn party is not required to give any consideration to provide legal effect to the withdrawal. Signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cantly, a withdrawal also does not, in and of itself, extinguish the cause of action against the withdrawn party, as do a settlement and release. See <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 56, 717 A.2d 77 (1998); <em>Ramsay </em>v. <em>Camrac, Inc., </em>supra, 96 Conn. App. 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The defendant contends, however, that the withdrawal in this case did operate as a surrender of a cause of action, and hence did constitute a release or settlement because the statute of limitations had expired by the time the plaintiff withdrew her action against Cohen. Thus, once the withdrawal occurred, the plaintiff could not reinstitute an action against Cohen. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">At the outset, we note that the defendant never made this argument until <em>after </em>trial in his motion to set aside the verdict. Even if we were to assume that he is entitled to its review, the fact that, in a given case, the plaintiff may exercise the option of releasing a defendant at a point in time when the statute of limitations will bar her right to pursue a cause of action against that party <em>by operation of law </em>does not reflect the relinquishment of a right pursuant to an <em>agreement, </em>an essential element of a release or settlement, which, as we explain herein, must be supported by consideration to be legally enforceable. Moreover, we must construe these terms in accordance with a universal meaning, not one that is dependent on happenstance on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, there is no linguistic or jurisprudential support for the defendant\u2019s contention that a withdrawal falls within the meaning of a release or settlement. See <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 349, 170 A.2d 883 (1961) (\u201ccourts cannot import an intent into legislation devoid of language fit to express it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s alternate claim that the plaintiffs withdrawal of the action against Cohen constituted a \u201csimilar agreement\u201d under \u00a7 52-572h (n) that would have required the trial court to allow the defendant to include Cohen for apportionment purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">At the outset, we underscore that the legislature frequently has used the term withdrawal. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-80, 52-81, 52-82, 52-192a, 52-194 and 52-195c. Typically, the omission of a word otherwise used in the statutes suggests that the legislature intended a different meaning for the alternate term. See <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996) (\u201cWhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Thus, we presume that, had the legislature intended for apportionment to apply to withdrawn parties, it would have used the term \u201cwithdrawal\u201d in lieu of, or in addition to, \u201csimilar agreement.\u201d See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 216, 901 A.2d 673 (2006) (\u201cIt is aprinciple of statutory construction that a court must construe a statute as written. . . . Courts may not by construction supply omissions ... or add exceptions merely because it appears that good reasons exist for adding them. . . . The intent of the legislature, as this court has repeatedly observed, is to be found not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. ... It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is a function of the legislature.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nonetheless, we consider whether the legislature may have used \u201csimilar agreement\u201d to encompass withdrawals. We note that the term \u201csimilar agreement\u201d is used only in subsection (n) of \u00a7 52-572h. It is not referenced elsewhere in that statute or in \u00a7 52-102b, which prescribes the procedures for seeking apportionment. See <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>supra, 280 Conn. 142. Indeed, in every other section of the apportionment scheme under \u00a7\u00a7 52-102b and 52-572h, the only type of agreements or persons subject to such agreements refer to release and settlement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, consistent with its context in \u00a7 52-572h, we construe \u201csimilar agreement\u201d to mean an agreement having the essential characteristics of a release or settlement. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (defining \u201csimilar\u201d as \u201chaving characteristics in common: very much alike\u201d and \u201calike in substance or essentials\u201d). A release and settlement are shaped \u201cin accordance with the intent of the negotiations between the injured party and the settling tortfeasor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>supra, 249 Conn. 719. Accordingly, based on the common understanding and definitions of withdrawal, agreement, release and settlement set forth in part IA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>of this opinion, it is clear that a withdrawal does not constitute a similar agreement. To attribute to the term withdrawal the import of these other expressions of an exchange of benefit or promise would not comport with the legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Although we need not determine precisely what the legislature intended by the use of the phrase \u201csimilar agreement\u201d in \u00a7 52-572h (n), we consider some possibilities to illustrate how other agreements may be similar to releases and settlements and, in contrast, why withdrawals do not constitute such a similar agreement. <em>Echavarria </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., 275 </em>Conn. 408, 415, 880 A.2d 882 (2005) (\u201c[I]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). One such possibility is the acceptance of an offer to compromise, which requires a written offer by the plaintiff to settle the claim for a sum certain, written acceptance of that offer by the defendant, payment of that sum to the plaintiff and a concomitant withdrawal of the action. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-192a and 52-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Another possibility that the plaintiff suggests is a covenant not to sue, which also is a bilateral agreement that requires consideration in exchange for the relinquishment of a claim. See, e.g., <em>Tomczuk </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>184 Conn. 182, 192-93, 439 A.2d 935 (1981); <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Madow, </em>179 Conn. 269, 273, 426 A.2d 268 (1979); <em>Kosko </em>v. <em>Kohler, </em>176 Conn. 383, 387, 407 A.2d 1009 (1978). We have recognized that a covenant not to sue resembles, but is not the same as, a release. See <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>supra, 249 Conn. 725 n.10 (\u201cAlthough at common law a release of one joint tortfeasor released the other tortfeasors, a covenant not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>sue did not. <em>Bonczkiewicz </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corp., </em>148 Conn. 573, 581, 172 A.2d 917 [1961]; <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hirsch, </em>119 Conn. 586, 589, 178 A. 423 [1935]; <em>Dwy </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>[supra, 89 Conn. 79]. Because the present case [involves a release and] did not involve a covenant not to sue, this opinion does not have any impact on the viability of that mechanism as a means by which an injured party may seek full recovery against the employer after collecting a portion of his damages from the employee.\u201d);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 66 Am. Jur. 2d 374, supra, \u00a7 4 (\u201ca covenant not to sue differs from a release in that a \u2018release\u2019 extinguishes a cause of action as to all joint tortfeasors whereas a \u2018covenant not to sue\u2019 does not extinguish the cause of action and does not release other joint tortfeasors even if it does not specifically reserve the rights against them\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-216a (\u201c[a]n agreement with any tortfeasor not to bring legal action or a release of a tortfeasor in any cause of action shall not be read to a jury or in any other way introduced in evidence by either party at any time during the trial of the cause of action against any other joint tortfeasors, nor shall any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>other agreement not to sue or release of claim among any plaintiffs or defendants in the action be read or in any other way introduced to a jury\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, the legislature may have contemplated a stipulated judgment, which \u201chas its roots in the law of contracts as well as the law of judgments. ... [It is] a judgment rendered by the court upon the consent of the parties, which is in the nature of a contract to which the court has given its approval . . . (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kim </em>v. <em>Magnotta, </em>249 Conn. 94, 106, 733 A.2d 809 (1999). Like a release and settlement, these instruments are also shaped \u201cin accordance with the intent of the negotiations between the injured party and the settling tortfeasor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>supra, 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the legislature did not intend the term \u201csimilar agreement\u201d to encompass a withdrawal of a defendant. This conclusion is consistent with the intent of Tort Reform II, as expressed in Public Acts 1987, No. 87-227, which \u201cwas to limit the universe of negligent persons that a finder of fact may consider in apportioning damages to only those entities that are either parties to the suit or parties who have reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiff \u2014 a clear indication that the legislature intended that \u00a7 52-572h (c) permit the plaintiff to obtain, to the maximum extent possible, complete compensation for his injuries.\u201d <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>247 Conn. 256, 270, 721 A.2d 511 (1998). Indeed, were we to hold otherwise, plaintiffs would not withdraw claims that discovery later revealed were marginal, and we thus would revive the \u201cunwanted practical effect [under Tort Reform I] . . . that plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tiffs [would be] required to pursue claims of weak liability against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our courts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>supra, 257 Conn. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Finally, we note that our interpretation of the statute is consistent with the legislative policies that \u00a7 52-572h was designed to implement, specifically, that the plaintiff be fully compensated and defendants pay their fair share, but, that when those rights conflict, the plaintiffs interests will prevail. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (c) (holding defendant responsible for immune person\u2019s share of negligence by precluding defendant from bringing apportionment complaint against immune persons); General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (g) (reallocating uncollectible amount from one defendant among other defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The defendant claims that the withdrawal in the present case was unique because of the circumstances under which it was given. Specifically, the defendant claims that the withdrawal in the present case constituted a settlement because it was conditioned upon Cohen\u2019s acceptance of a list of terms that Cohen otherwise was not obligated to perform.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if we were to conclude that the legislature, when it expressly used the limiting terms \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d in \u00a7 52-572h (n), contemplated that a withdrawal with consideration could operate as a settlement, we disagree that the record demonstrates, as matter of law, that the plaintiff received consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>in return for withdrawing his claim against Cohen so as to constitute a settlement pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The record reveals the following additional facts. At the hearing on the motion to set aside the verdict, the defendant claimed that the withdrawal of the action against Cohen acted as a release, settlement or similar agreement so as to bring it within \u00a7 52-572h (n). In support of the motion, the defendant provided an affidavit by Eugene Cooney, Cohen\u2019s attorney, attesting that: \u201c[T]he plaintiff voluntarily withdrew his claim against [Cohen] without payment of a settlement. ... In connection with the process by which the claim against [Cohen] was withdrawn, the plaintiffs attorney, Joshua D. Koskoff drew up in his own handwriting a series of terms which were to accompany the withdrawal. . . . The handwritten dates appearing at the bottom of [the document] are in my hand. As I recall, these dates represented the dates that the plaintiff wanted to call [Cohen] as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Koskoff vehemently objected to the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the withdrawal as an agreement that triggered the right to apportionment pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He disagreed that there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>been a quid pro quo in exchange for the withdrawal and asserted that the handwritten terms simply reflected his own notes memorializing that the plaintiff had not released Cohen from the requirements of patient confidentiality to which he had been bound before the present action. Finally, as the record demonstrates, Koskoff contended that, before any determination could be made about the meaning of the handwritten note and the intent of the parties, he should be called to testify. The defendant did not call Koskoff to testify or present any other evidence on the intent of the parties as reflected in this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>It is well settled that \u201c[t]he construction of a written document is a matter of law, where the meaning is to be ascertained from the document itself; but where the meaning can be understood only from extrinsic facts, the construction is generally a question of fact . . . .\u201d <em>School District No. 8 </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>33 Conn. 330, 333 (1866); accord <em>Security Equities </em>v. <em>Giamba, </em>210 Conn. 71, 77-78, 553 A.2d 1135 (1989); <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 199, 520 A.2d 208 (1987), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 786, 626 A.2d 719 (1993). \u201cThe law is clear that a contract includes not only what is expressly stated therein but also what is necessarily implied from the language used. ...

Id., 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201cThe construction of a contract is usually a question of fact because the interpretation of its language is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>search for the intent of the parties, making contractual intent a classic question of fact. <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>[3 Conn.

The intent of the parties is to be garnered in light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the contract, along with the primary purpose of the contract. <em>American Totalisator Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>210 Conn. 413, 418, 555 A.2d 421 (1989).

This is particularly true when the handwritten note is entirely consistent with Koskoff s claim to the trial court that the note merely memorialized the plaintiffs reminder to Cohen of the rules of confidentiality to which he otherwise was obligated once the case against him had been withdrawn.

See footnote 13 of this opinion. Moreover, the defendant did not avail himself of Koskoff s offer to testify to what the document was intended to accomplish. Certainly Cooney\u2019s statement in his affidavit that the terms \u201cwere to accompany\u201d the withdrawal does not indicate unambiguously that that withdrawal was conditioned on the terms. Consequently, given the ambiguity as to the meaning of this document, the trial court properly could have considered such extrinsic evidence as to the conduct of the parties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Electric Cable Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>pounds, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>95 Conn.

App. 139, 150, 829 A.2d 901 (2003). On the basis of the record in the present case, the trial court properly could not have determined that the withdrawal in this case conclusively constituted a release, settlement or other similar agreement pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly precluded the defendant from pursuing an apportionment complaint against Cohen on the basis of its determination that, because the plaintiff had withdrawn the action against Cohen, there was no \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d that brought Cohen within the scope of \u00a7 52-572h. We recognize, however, the hardship to defendants similarly situated to the one in the present case. Section 52-102b (f) provides the \u201cexclusive means by which a defendant may add a person who is or may be liable pursuant to section 52-572h for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>party to the action.\u201d Section 52-102b, however, provides a means to seek apportionment against persons who are not parties to the action only if an apportionment complaint is filed within 120 days after the return date in the plaintiffs original complaint; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (a);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or against \u201csettled\u201d or \u201creleased\u201d persons. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (c). Thus, under the procedural scheme prescribed by the legislature, the defendant could not file an apportionment complaint against Cohen while he was a party. For the reasons set forth in part I A, B and C of this opinion, the defendant also could not seek apportionment against Cohen under the procedures for released or settled persons. Thus, this legislative gap leaves the defendant without recourse to obtain apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u201cThe legislature [however] has repeatedly manifested its concern for the overall fairness of our tort law. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-572e. [We] hope that the legislature will be able to find a place on its busy agenda for inquiry into the consequences and the desirability of today\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>supra, 249 Conn. 728 <em>(Peters, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly precluded him from presenting an alternative theory as to the cause of the shoulder dystocia, which in turn was the cause of Jodee\u2019s injury. Specifically, the defendant contends that, based on Cohen\u2019s testimony as to the circumstances of the delivery, the defendant should have been permitted to offer his expert opinion that the shoulder dystocia was caused by Jodee\u2019s unusual, and thus unforeseeable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>position at birth, rather than facts that the defendant reasonably could have foreseen. The defendant contends that the trial court precluded him from offering his opinion predominately based on its improper conclusion that Cohen\u2019s testimony as to the pertinent facts was not credible and, secondarily, based on its improper conclusion that the plaintiff did not have adequate notice that the defendant intended to advance this alternate theory. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Under the rules of evidence, \u201c[a]n expert may testify in the form of an opinion and give reasons therefor, provided sufficient facts are shown as the foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d Conn.

Ed. 2d 309 (2006). \u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The record reveals the following additional facts. At trial, the plaintiff offered expert testimony to establish that the defendant had breached the standard of care by failing to ascertain and recognize various risk factors for shoulder dystocia before and during Aponte\u2019s early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>stages of labor and then by failing to perform a cesarean section. In particular, the plaintiffs experts opined that Jodee\u2019s unusually large size, more than ten pounds at birth, was the predominant cause of the shoulder dystocia.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Cohen testified as a fact witness as to the circumstances of the delivery. Specifically, he testified about various maneuvers that he had undertaken when attempting to deliver Jodee after he ascertained that shoulder dystocia had occurred. First, he \u201creach[ed] into the birth canal to try to find the baby\u2019s back arm and/or hand\u201d to pull that part of the baby\u2019s body out first to reduce the diameter of the shoulders. When he could not find the baby\u2019s arm on this first attempt, he inserted his hands inside the mother\u2019s vagina to tiy to prod the baby\u2019s shoulders to rotate from their top to bottom position into a sideways position. After that effort did not work, he attempted unsuccessfully to fracture the baby\u2019s collarbone to reduce the shoulder diameter. Next, Cohen applied a maneuver whereby the mother\u2019s legs were held into the air and pressure was exerted above her pelvis in another unsuccessful attempt to rotate the baby\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Cohen then stated: \u201cAnd so I went back to my original attempt reaching into the birth canal looking for the back arm and to my surprise I found the baby\u2019s fist right adjacent [to] the shoulder, the back shoulder, of the baby as it was coming out. It was in a position that I didn\u2019t expect to find it because I expected the arm and fist to be somewhat in front of the baby but in this case [it] was right along the side of the shoulder and somewhat behind. And I grasped that fist and gently applied traction to it and the baby\u2019s arm basically reached out toward me and the baby basically fell out into my arms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Subsequently, the defendant testified that the reason for the lack of progress in Aponte\u2019s labor when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>was monitoring her \u201cwas clearly the patient\u2019s refusal to push. Once the patient would push, I had a clear assumption that she would deliver vaginally, and she did.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the defendant whether he had an opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as to why Jodee\u2019s shoulders were stuck at the pelvis at the time of delivery. The plaintiff objected on the ground that the defendant had no personal knowledge on which to base his opinion, given that he was not present at the birth and did not know that Jodee had been injured until some later point in time. The trial court sustained the objection, ruling that the defendant must establish a foundation for the basis of his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the defendant to base his expert opinion as to the cause of the shoulder dystocia on the following hypothetical situation: \u201cAssume that at the time of delivery after several attempts were made to dislodge the shoulders, it was found that one of the baby\u2019s fists was found to be located somewhat behind one of the shoulders, and once that fist was released, that Jodee was delivered easily after that.\u201d The plaintiff again objected, asserting that the hypothetical scenario had failed to represent fully the facts at the time of Jodee\u2019s delivery. The court sustained the objection, agreeing that the record contained additional facts necessary to present a more complete and accurate picture in the hypothetical situation, such as the specific maneuvers that Cohen had performed and which shoulder and arm he first had pulled out. Before the defendant proceeded, the plaintiff asked the court to require that the defendant make an offer of proof as to what he intended to establish with this testimony. The plaintiff raised several concerns, including the relevance of the testimony, given that the defendant had agreed that shoulder dystocia had been the cause of Jodee\u2019s injuries and, therefore, any counter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>theory as to how a child hypothetically could have gotten injured would not be relevant. The defendant admitted that he had agreed that shoulder dystocia caused Jodee\u2019s injury. He asserted, however, that he should be able to offer an opinion, based on Cohen\u2019s testimony, that Jodee\u2019s shoulders may have been stuck, not because they were too large to fit through the birth canal, as the plaintiffs experts had opined, but, rather, because the position of Jodee\u2019s hand adjacent to her shoulder had increased the diameter around her shoulders. The plaintiff then objected on several grounds: no expert had testified that this factual scenario was among those creating a risk of shoulder dystocia and therefore a <em>Porter </em>hearing<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was required to determine the reliability of such a conclusion; the defendant\u2019s testimony would be speculative because Cohen\u2019s testimony did not indicate that Jodee\u2019s hand position was responsible for causing her shoulders to become lodged; the defendant previously had not disclosed this theory; and the testimony was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Although the trial court agreed with the plaintiffs disclosure claim, it sustained the objection based on the speculative nature of the defendant\u2019s hypothetical and the absence of support in the record for its factual predicate. Specifically, the defendant had made it clear that he intended to predicate his opinion on the factual assumption that, during the entire time Jodee had been lodged in her mother\u2019s pelvis, her hand always had been where Cohen found it in his final attempt to extricate the baby, adjacent to her back shoulder. The court repeatedly stated that it was too great an inferential leap to conclude, based on Cohen\u2019s testimony, that Jodee\u2019s hand had been in that position the entire time. The court noted that, according to his testimony, in his last attempt to dislodge Jodee\u2019s shoulders, Cohen had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>repeated the first maneuver he had tried, but with a different result, and Cohen had undertaken several other maneuvers in between those efforts to attempt to manipulate Jodee\u2019s position. The court further noted that Cohen never had testified that the position of Jodee\u2019s hand was the cause of the shoulder dystocia. Accordingly, the court refused to allow the defendant to offer his opinion on causation of the shoulder dystocia based on his hypothetical scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Turning to the defendant\u2019s claim, it is clear from the record that the defendant has misconstrued the trial court\u2019s statements regarding the inferential \u201cleap\u201d at issue as a determination of the credibility of Cohen\u2019s testimony. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s opinion would have been based on speculation, and not on reasonable inferences from the facts established by Cohen\u2019s testimony. The defendant similarly misconstrues the court\u2019s comments on the discharge summary Cohen had prepared after Aponte\u2019s delivery. The court deemed it \u201ccurious\u201d that Cohen\u2019s discharge summary did not reflect anything about Jodee\u2019s hand position affecting the delivery. In response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the discharge summary was not inconsistent with Cohen\u2019s testimony, the court stated, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s inconsistent, I\u2019m just saying ... it seems to be an important fact that was left out of the discharge summary.\u201d The court thereafter related this point to its ruling that the evidence did not support the hypothetical. In other words, the court\u2019s point was that, if Cohen thought that the baby\u2019s hand position had been the cause of the problem, one would have expected Cohen to note it, rather than limit his comments to the position of the shoulders. Indeed, later, at the charging conference, the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know if shoulder dystocia includes a hand that may be up there, and if so, why didn\u2019t . . . Cohen write in his summary that he found the hand and pulled it out and it wasn\u2019t the shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>hung up but it was a hand?\u201d The court did not suggest that, because Cohen had omitted information about Jodee\u2019s hand placement in his discharge summary, he must not have been truthful when testifying regarding that matter. Rather, the court indicated that Cohen\u2019s summary was consistent with his testimony, in which he similarly did not state or provide facts from which one reasonably could infer that Jodee\u2019s hand position had remained constant throughout the delivery and thus had caused the shoulder dystocia.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cThe established rule is that, on direct examination, the stated assumptions on which a hypothetical question is based must be the essential facts established by the <em>evidence.\u201dKeeney v.

In the present case, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the factual predicate of the hypothetical on which the defendant intended to base his expert opinion was not supported by the evidence and, hence, was speculative. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 275 Conn. 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court submitted to the jury improper and misleading interrogatories. Specifically, the defendant claims that the interrogatories impermissibly guided the jury to reach a particular result in favor of the plaintiff, rather than explained or limited a general verdict, as is intended under the rules of practice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u201cIn <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R.

App. 340, 346, 782 A.2d 728, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 925, 783 A.2d 1027 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In the present case, the plaintiffs amended complaint asserted nine allegations to support his claim that the defendant had breached the standard of care, in that he had: (1) failed to obtain an adequate history of Aponte\u2019s 1988 labor and delivery; (2) failed to manage properly Aponte\u2019s second stage of labor; (3) failed to assess properly Aponte\u2019s risk factors for shoulder dystocia; (4) failed to diagnose timely risk factors of shoulder dystocia; (5) failed to monitor the progress of labor; (6) permitted a prolonged second stage of labor; (7) failed to diagnose properly arrest of descent; (8) failed to listen to Aponte;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (9) failed to perform a cesarean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>section. At the end of trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court submitted interrogatories to the jury that listed each of the aforementioned nine allegations as a basis for establishing that the defendant had breached the standard of care. The jury responded affirmatively to eight of the nine questions, answering in the negative only to the fifth question regarding monitoring Aponte\u2019s labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In our view, the court\u2019s interrogatories to the jury are consistent with the purpose of this device, to elicit \u201ca determination of material facts, [and] to furnish the means of testing the correctness of the verdict rendered, and of ascertaining its extent.\u201d <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>supra, 81 Conn. 612. Moreover, we see no undue prejudice to the defendant simply by restating in the interrogatories the factual allegations forming the basis of the complaint as to the breach of the standard of care. Cf. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>219 Conn. 569, 581, 594 A.2d 939 (1991) (concluding trial court had not abused its discretion by refusing to submit defendant\u2019s proposed interrogatories in light of court\u2019s determination that they were \u201cconfusing and [did] not track the . . . issues [submitted] . . . for the jury\u201d and agreeing that they asked jury \u201cto consider legal principles not applicable to the facts in issue\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Finally, although the rules of practice specifically address interrogatories as they relate to a general verdict; see Practice Book \u00a7 16-18 (\u201c[t]he judicial authority may submit to the jury written interrogatories for the purpose of explaining or limiting a general verdict\u201d); this court never has limited the trial court\u2019s discretion in providing interrogations to such cases. See, e.g., <em>Bovat </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>258 Conn. 574, 584-85, 783 A.2d 1001 (2001) (interrogatories in single cause of action for highway defect properly stated both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>design defect and defect in repair as basis for verdict). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in submitting the interrogatories to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The defendant also claims that the cumulative effect of three aspects of the trial resulted in undue prejudice. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly allowed the plaintiffs experts to testify as to Aponte\u2019s lack of informed consent when there was no informed consent claim in the case; (2) the court improperly ruled on the admission of expert testimony regarding the effect of Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes on her earning capacity for purposes of damage calculations; and (3) the \u201cgeneral trial atmosphere rendered impossible a dispassionate evaluation of the relative role of [the defendant] in its proper context.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">We note at the outset that the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims are reviewed under our well established standard. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence . . . [and its] ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>General Electric Co., </em>275 Conn. 395, 406, 880 A.2d 151 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Turning to the challenged testimony as to the issue of informed consent, the defendant points to testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>from two of the plaintiffs experts and from Aponte. Specifically, two of the plaintiffs experts stated that, given Jodee\u2019s size at birth, the standard of care would require that a physician inform a patient as to the risks and benefits of vaginal delivery and a cesarean section. Aponte testified that the defendant never had informed her of any risks associated with delivering Jodee vaginally. The defendant objected, contending that because there was no informed consent claim in this case, the testimony was irrelevant. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection based on its determination that the testimony was relevant to the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had breached the standard of care by failing to assess properly the risks of shoulder dystocia. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We recognize that, although this testimony undoubtedly would bear on informed consent if that were an issue in the case; see generally <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 290-93, 465 A.2d 294 (1983) (discussing development and elements of informed consent as basis for medical malpractice liability); the plaintiff did not assert a lack of informed consent claim. This testimony, however, also was directly relevant to a claim that the plaintiff did assert, namely, that the defendant had failed to recognize that Aponte\u2019s delivery presented a risk of shoulder dystocia. If, as the plaintiffs experts had testified, the standard of care would have obligated the defendant to discuss the risks of vaginal delivery with Aponte, his failure to do so would provide evidence that he had not in fact recognized that those risks were present. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this evidence was relevant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cortes, </em>276 Conn. 241, 254, 885 A.2d 153 (2005) (\u201cRelevant evidence, that is, \u2018evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>it would be without the evidence\u2019 . . . Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1; generally is admissible; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-2; unless \u2018its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u2019 Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-3.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Moreover, the trial court expressly instructed the jury that informed consent was not at issue in the case. It is well established that, \u201c[i]n the absence of any indication to the contrary, we presume that the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction[s].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Alston, 272 Conn. 432, 446, 862 A.2d 817 (2005). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion with respect to its rulings and instruction on informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings relating to evidence of Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes as it pertained to the calculation of economic damages. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted Lawrence Forman, the plaintiffs vocational expert, to offer unscientific testimony because Forman had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>failed to consider the effect of Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes on her vocational capacity and earnings. The defendant further claims that, although the trial court had permitted him to cross-examine Forman and argue to the jury about Forman\u2019s failure to consider this condition, the court improperly precluded him from offering expert testimony to demonstrate that this condition would affect Jodee\u2019s work capacity and life expectancy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Turning first to Forman\u2019s testimony, we note that the defendant does not claim that the methodology by which Forman reached his conclusion was unreliable. Rather, he claims that Forman\u2019s application of that methodology to the facts of the case was unreliable because Forman had failed to consider Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes. We disagree with his claim on two fronts. First, our review of Forman\u2019s testimony reflects that he clearly stated that he had considered Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes, but concluded that it was not relevant to her vocational capacity because that condition can be controlled through medication and diet. Second, it is well settled that, \u201c[o]nce the validity of a scientific principle has been satisfactorily established, any remaining questions regarding the manner in which that technique was <em>applied </em>in a particular case . . . generally [present] an issue of fact that goes to weight, and not admissibility.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 88 n.31, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 551-52, 757 A.2d 482 (2000) (rejecting defendant\u2019s claim that trial court improperly admitted testimony from state\u2019s expert concerning microscopic hair analysis because expert did not evaluate all of hair characteristics discussed in forensic literature, and because he did not take measurements, or quantify certain characteristics, of hair sample). Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Forman\u2019s decision not to factor Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes into his calculations was the grist for the cross-examination mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendant further claims that, once Forman was permitted to offer an opinion as to Jodee\u2019s vocational capacity, the trial court improperly precluded him from offering expert testimony in two forms to establish that juvenile diabetes would affect her vocational capacity and life expectancy. First, the trial court precluded, on the ground that the defendant\u2019s disclosure was untimely, expert testimony from Joseph Rosenblatt, an endocrinologist, and James Cohen,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a vocational rehabilitation specialist, whom the defendant claimed would testify that juvenile diabetes would affect Jodee\u2019s life and should have been considered by Forman. The defendant claims that his disclosure of these witnesses was not untimely; rather, he disclosed them within two weeks after it first became apparent to him that the plaintiffs experts, Forman and Gary Crakes, an economist, had not taken into account Jodee\u2019s medical condition. Specifically, the defendant points to Crakes\u2019 deposition on November 30, 2004, as the point in time when this fact first became known to him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The record reveals the following additional undisputed facts. In January, 1999, the plaintiff disclosed Forman and Crakes as his experts regarding damages. In January, 2002, and August, 2004, respectively, Forman and Crakes submitted their reports; neither report reflected any indication that they considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Jodee\u2019s juvenile diabetes to be a relevant factor. In November, 2002, the plaintiff provided to the defendant, in response to his discovery requests, the records for the diabetes clinic where Jodee was being treated. On May 13, 2002, in response to requests by the defendant, the trial court issued a scheduling order that extended the deadline for deposing expert witnesses until September 6, 2002. On June 3, 2004, the defendant completed his deposition of Forman. He filed his disclosures of Rosenblatt and James Cohen on December 10, 2004, and December 13, 2004, respectively, while jury selection was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion to preclude these witnesses on the grounds of undue prejudice, undue interference with the orderly progress of the trial and bad faith delay in the disclosures. Specifically, the court noted the facts that: the scheduling order long had expired; jury selection was in progress; the trial was scheduled to commence on February 1, 2005; the defendant\u2019s experts would be introducing a new element into the trial \u2014 shortened life expectancy due to juvenile diabetes; and the defendant had known of Jodee\u2019s condition and of the plaintiffs experts several years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Given these facts, \u201c[t]he court was well within its discretion to prevent this kind of ambush.\u201d <em>Gaudio </em>v. <em>Griffin Health Services Corp., </em>249 Conn. 523, 548, 733 A.2d 197 (1999) (no abuse of discretion when disclosure made thirty days before trial and defendant could have raised issue years ago); see <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>209 Conn. 536, 540-41, 551 A.2d 1254 (1989) (no abuse of discretion when disclosure made three weeks before scheduled trial date and defendant disclosed witness six months after deadline under scheduling order), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>216 Conn. 604, 609, 583 A.2d 124 (1990). Indeed, at the latest, on June 3,2004, after completing Forman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>deposition, the defendant knew that Forman had not factored the juvenile diabetes into his calculation. Under the rules of practice, the defendant was obligated to disclose his experts within a reasonable time prior to trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 13-4 (4).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He failed to act timely, however, based on the information readily available to him.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Finally, we briefly address the second form in which the defendant sought to establish that Forman\u2019s exclusion of juvenile diabetes as a factor in Jodee\u2019s vocational capacity was incorrect. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded as irrelevant evidence that would have contradicted Forman\u2019s assumption that Jodee\u2019s diabetes could be controlled. The defendant contends that testimony from Sevket Yigit, the physician who had treated Jodee at the Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center Diabetes Clinic, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the clinic\u2019s treatment records were relevant to this issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Briefly stated, Yigit never opined that Jodee\u2019s condition could not be controlled. Yigit expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s suggestion that Jodee was at risk of complications from her condition because her father had died of complications from the same disease. Indeed, Yigit never even stated that Jodee\u2019s condition was not being controlled regularly; he noted that the records reflected an entry from one visit in which he had noted a concern about inadequate control due to, inter alia, multiple caregivers, but also that his examination reflected that \u201ceverything looked fine.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this evidence on grounds of relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The defendant also makes a broad claim that he was prejudiced by certain conduct by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel during the proceedings, such as facial grimaces, body language and interruptions to his closing argument. The defendant concedes that the trial court addressed most of the contested conduct, but contends that the trial court\u2019s action was ineffective as evidenced by the fact that the conduct continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">To the extent that the trial court\u2019s actions and the admissions by the plaintiffs counsel to this court reflect that the plaintiffs counsel engaged in such conduct, we note that we do not sanction any conduct that may divert the jury\u2019s attention from the issues properly before it. Nonetheless, in the absence of a request by the defendant for further instruction or a mistrial, we presume that the trial court took appropriate remedial measures to preserve the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. Specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ically, the defendant claims that service of process was defective because the plaintiff had not served the defendant either personally or at his usual place of abode, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-54 and 52-57 (a). It is undisputed that the plaintiff served the summons and complaint on the office manager at Associated Health, the defendant\u2019s obstetric practice group. The defendant further claims that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>FitzSimmons </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists, </em>125 Conn. 490, 7 A.2d 448 (1939), reversal of the judgment is the proper remedy. We decline to review this claim because it was not preserved properly for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The record reveals the following additional facts. The plaintiff commenced this action on August 22, 1997. The defendant filed his motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction on October 17, 1997. The plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to that motion on December 3, 1997, claiming that: (1) the defendant had actual notice, which was consistent with the purpose of the service of process statutes; and (2) unnecessary delay and confusion would result if the motion were granted because the plaintiff would be able to file a new action against the defendant under the accidental failure of suit statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-592, and the plaintiff then would file a motion to consolidate that action with the action against the then remaining defendants in the case. The defendant took no further action to claim the motion, and the trial court did not rule on the motion to dismiss until May 7, 2001, as indicated by the notation of \u201c[djenied\u201d on a postcard dated May 11, 2001. The defendant timely filed a motion for articulation; however, the court took no action on that motion, and the defendant took no steps to compel any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">It is well settled under our rules of practice and case law that, \u201c[i]t is incumbent upon the appellant to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . . [A]n appellate tribunal cannot render a decision without first fully understanding the disposition being appealed. . . . Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stutz </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>279 Conn. 115, 125-26, 901 A.2d 33 (2006); see Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 (\u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In the present case, we have no record from which to determine the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling. The trial court may have relied on one of the grounds asserted in the plaintiffs opposition, or on the ground of waiver, as the plaintiff now claims before this court, because of the defendant\u2019s actions in proceeding with his defense in the intervening years between the defendant\u2019s filing of the motion and the court\u2019s decision on the motion, or on some other ground. \u201cConclusions of the trial court cannot be reviewed where the appellant fails to establish through an adequate record that the trial court incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably have concluded as it did . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daigle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. </em>Co., 257 Conn. 359, 364, 777 A.2d 681 (2001).

Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, we refer to McNamee as the defendant. Aponte and Joseph Viera had brought the action both as representatives of Jodee\u2019s interests and in their individual capacities. Thereafter, Aponte and Joseph Viera withdrew the claims brought in their individual capacities and substituted Balter to represent Jodee\u2019s interests.

I\u2019m sure that neither defense counsel for [Cohen], I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want it to be perceived as an agreement, nor was it an agreement, and I think that he recognizes that. But if there is some allegation that has some type of effect of a release, we should certainly hear from that witness. To the contrary, all that occurred was just some understanding that it would be clear that there was no release to go about discussing these affairs with anybody. That [Cohen] had no authorization to do that, and so it was really the antithesis of a release. And certainly I think even counsel, who may have been thinking more about his relationship with the insurance company than with [Cohen], who he seems to be arguing should be held as part of an apportionment. There should be \u2014 the argument that seems to be there should be allowed to be an apportionment of fault against [Cohen]. That seems to be a conflicting argument for \u2014 that a lawyer would make on behalf of his client that hey, in fact my client should be allowed to be held responsible. So I\u2019m sure that if [Cohen\u2019s] attorney were here, he would concede that it should have no such effect, and I won\u2019t go any further into that because I think it is entirely unfair for defense counsel in this case to make representations to the court on something that she could have no knowledge of and was not present to.

I agree with and join the majority opinion. I write separately solely to register my conclusion that the withdrawal of a negligence claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>against a defendant that is supported by consideration, constitutes a \u201csimilar agreement\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (n), and therefore, triggers the apportionment of liability provisions of that statute. Simply stated, it is apparent to me that such an arrangement would fall comfortably within both the language and policies of the apportionment statute and, as such, there is no reason to exclude a withdrawal executed and filed in exchange for bargained for consideration\u2014 not necessarily financial \u2014 from the terms of the statute. The following hypothetical illustrates my point. Suppose a plaintiff withdraws his or her negligence action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against a defendant in exchange, say, for that defendant\u2019s promise to take, or to refrain from taking, certain actions in the future, or in exchange, say, for that defendant\u2019s promise to make a charitable contribution to a particular charity. Although no money changed hands between the parties, it is clear that the plaintiffs withdrawal was predicated on a bargained for agreement from which the plaintiff derived a significant benefit. The fact that this benefit was not expressed in monetary terms should make no difference in determining the applicability of \u00a7 52-572h.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> I note that \u00a7 52-572h is a statute of general applicability that applies to all actions predicated on theories of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">1 See footnote 2 of the majority opinion for the relevant text of \u00a7 52-572h.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b482-6\">PALMER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYG\">with whom ZARELLA, J., joins, dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court properly construed General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (n)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as precluding the defendant Thomas McNamee from raising an apportionment claim against Ian Cohen, who, for seven years, also was a defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>this action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> until, during jury selection, the plaintiff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> withdrew his claim against him. In particular, I disagree with the majority that the plaintiffs voluntary withdrawal of his claim against Cohen \u2014 which operated as a release of liability because the statute of limitations had run on the plaintiffs claim against Cohen long before the filing of the withdrawal \u2014 does not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d that triggers McNamee\u2019s right to seek apportionment against Cohen. In concluding that the withdrawal is not a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572h (n), the majority reaches a result that is both manifestly unfair to McNamee and fundamentally at odds with the purpose of Tort Reform I<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and II.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s holding is unfair because it allows the plaintiff, in his sole discretion, to bar McNamee from raising an apportionment claim against Cohen merely by withdrawing his claim against Cohen. By prohibiting McNamee from seeking apportionment against Cohen, the majority also contravenes the legislative intent underlying tort reform, namely, to abolish the common-law rule of joint and several liability and to replace it with a system based on principles of comparative fault. Because I do not believe that the legislature reasonably could have intended the result that the majority reaches, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The majority\u2019s conclusion is based on its construction of the term \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d as encompassing only bilateral agreements between the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When that language is viewed in isolation from our statutory apportionment scheme as a whole, I agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>that the majority\u2019s interpretation is perfectly reasonable. In my view, however, the majority\u2019s interpretation gives far too little weight to the purpose of our apportionment statutes, which we previously have identified as abolishing the common-law rule of joint and several liability; see, e.g., <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Waterbury Hospital, </em>280 Conn. 125, 141, 905 A.2d 654 (2006); so as to make \u201ca defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff proportionate to the defendant\u2019s degree of fault.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>278 Conn. 428, 461, 899 A.2d 563 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Under \u00a7 52-572h (c), a defendant in a negligence action has a right of apportionment against any other person against whom the plaintiff seeks to recover at trial. Furthermore, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b, a defendant also has the right, within 120 days from the commencement of the plaintiffs action, to bring into the action any person whom the plaintiff has not named in the action but who the defendant nonetheless believes is or may be liable for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, under \u00a7 52-572h (f), the defendant also has a right of apportionment against any \u201csettled or released persons\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572h (n), which, for purposes of contribution among liable tortfeasors, identifies the category of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>sons who have entered into a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d with the plaintiff, irrespective of whether any such person previously has been named by the plaintiff as a defendant. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (c) (defendant not required to file notice of intent to seek apportionment against released or settled person who formerly was party to action but must file notice of intent to seek apportionment against settled or released person who never was party). It is apparent that the legislature, in enacting these statutory provisions, sought to establish a scheme pursuant to which each tortfeasor pays <em>only </em>his proportionate share of the damages for which he is liable to the plaintiff. The means by which the legislature sought to achieve that end was to permit any defendant against whom the plaintiff seeks to recover at trial the right to have the finder of fact apportion damages among any and all other alleged tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Under the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 52-572h, however, a defendant is barred from seeking apportionment against a person who, like Cohen, was named as a defendant by the plaintiff but, after the expiration of the 120 day period for filing an apportionment complaint under \u00a7 52-102b, has all claims against him withdrawn by the plaintiff. Under the interpretation that the majority adopts, the defendant is barred from seeking apportionment in those circumstances because there is no mechanism to do so. Thus, in the present case, McNamee could not have filed an apportionment complaint against Cohen while Cohen was still a defendant because \u00a7 52-102b applies only to nonparties. See footnote 8 of this opinion. McNamee could not file an apportionment complaint against Cohen after the plaintiff had released Cohen from liability because the 120 day limitation period of \u00a7 52-102b had expired several years earlier. Finally, McNamee otherwise could not seek apportionment against Cohen because, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>majority, a withdrawal is not a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d for purposes of our apportionment scheme, even though the plaintiffs withdrawal of his claim against Cohen had <em>precisely </em>the same effect as a settlement or release inasmuch as the plaintiffs withdrawal occurred after the statute of limitations had run on his claim against Cohen. In other words, the majority concludes that, under the scheme that the legislature devised for implementing proportionality, McNamee had an absolute right to seek apportionment against any person who the plaintiff <em>left out of the action </em>but did not have the same right to seek apportionment against those whom the plaintiff <em>himself </em>alleged <em>in the action </em>were responsible for the claimed injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">This result is patently illogical because the persons whom the plaintiff named in the action are the very persons against whom McNamee most likely would wish to exercise his right of apportionment. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme, however, a plaintiff, in his sole discretion, may deprive a defendant of the right of apportionment against any and all such persons simply by filing an action against them, waiting 120 days, and then withdrawing his claims against them. It is obvious that, in engaging in such a strategy, the plaintiff can deprive the defendant altogether of his apportionment rights. I do not believe that the legislature would have taken the steps that it had to abolish joint and several liability in favor of proportional liability, on the one hand, and then create a loophole that empowers any plaintiff to return to the former by depriving the defendant of any opportunity to invoke the latter, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In attempting to construct a rationale for its holding, the majority asserts that its statutory interpretation \u201cis consistent with the legislative policies that \u00a7 52-572h was designed to implement, specifically, that the plaintiff be fully compensated and defendants pay their fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>share, but, that when those rights conflict, the plaintiffs interests will prevail.\u201d In support of its assertion, the majority cites to General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (c), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person who is immune from liability shall be made an apportionment defendant nor shall such person\u2019s liability be considered for apportionment purposes pursuant to [\u00a7] 52-572h,\u201d and to \u00a7 52-572h (g), which establishes, inter alia, the right of a plaintiff in a negligence action \u201cto reallocate damages awarded against an insolvent defendant to other parties to the action whose negligence caused the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>247 Conn. 256, 271, 721 A.2d 511 (1998). Neither of these two statutory provisions, however, comes into play until <em>after </em>the defendant has been afforded the right <em>to seek </em>apportionment pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-102b and 52-572h (c). More importantly, construing the term \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d as encompassing a withdrawal\u2014 in particular, a withdrawal that is made after the applicable statute of limitations has run, as in the present case \u2014 creates no conflict between the rights of plaintiffs and the rights of defendants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The majority also asserts that the interpretation that McNamee advances would revive \u201c [t]he unwanted prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tical effect [under Tort Reform I] . . . that plaintiffs [would be] required to pursue claims of weak liability against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our courts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Majority opinion, p. 423, quoting <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>257 Conn. 718, 730, 778 A.2d 899 (2001). I disagree. Under the statutory scheme, if a plaintiff believes that a claim against a particular named defendant is worth pursuing, then the plaintiff has every right and opportunity to do so; if not, the plaintiff may withdraw the claim, knowing that any remaining defendant may pursue an apportionment claim against the released defendant. I see no difference whatsoever between that decision and the decision whether to accept a settlement, be it for $1, for $1 million or for any other monetary or nonmonetary consideration. In either case, the plaintiff must decide among competing considerations because, under our apportionment scheme, the defendant is entitled to seek apportionment against any person who has settled with the defendant. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (f) (providing that fact finder shall specify \u201cthe percentage of negligence that proximately caused the injury, death or damage to property in relation to one hundred per cent, that is attributable to each party whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the injury, death or damage to property <em>including settled or released persons under subsection [n] of this </em>section\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Furthermore, the \u201cunwanted practical effect [under Tort Reform I]\u201d to which the majority refers in its quote from <em>Collins </em>relates to a problem \u201cunder Tort Reform I . . . [whereby] the jury, in determining the percentage of negligence attributable to any defendant, could take into account the negligence of <em>any other person, </em>regardless of whether that person was a party to the action. Tort Reform I, however, did not provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>plaintiff with a means of securing payment of damages unless that person was also a party.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>supra, 257 Conn. 730. As a result, \u201c[the] plaintiff was required to name as defendants all persons whose actions suggested even the slightest hint of negligence. The unwanted practical effect, therefore, was that plaintiffs were required to pursue claims of weak liability against third parties, thereby fostering marginal and costly litigation in our courts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Tort Reform II, however, addressed this problem by limiting the universe of negligent persons whom the jury could consider in apportioning damages between parties to the action, and between those who have been released or who have settled. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, therefore, under Tort Reform II, the plaintiff in a negligence action has no incentive to name every person whose actions suggest the slightest hint of negligence, nor is there any possible danger that our resolution of this case, one way or the other, would revive the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">If, however, as the majority asserts, Tort Reform II did reflect a desire on the part of the legislature to avoid protracted litigation of weak claims, the majority fails to explain how permitting a plaintiff to withdraw an action against some but not all of the defendants,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> many years into the proceedings, appreciably furthers a legislative policy of avoiding \u201cmarginal and costly litigation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) More importantly, however, whatever marginal benefit arguably might flow from the majority\u2019s interpretation of our apportionment scheme cannot possibly justify the loss of the right of apportionment that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>remaining defendants stand to suffer under the majority\u2019s statutory construction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Finally, the majority asserts that its interpretation \u201cis consistent with the intent of Tort Reform II, as expressed in Public Acts 1987, No. 87-227, which was to limit the universe of negligent persons that a finder of fact may consider in apportioning damages to only those entities that are either parties to the suit or parties who have reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiff \u2014 a clear indication that the legislature intended that \u00a7 52-572h (c) permit the plaintiff to obtain, to the maximum extent possible, complete compensation for his injuries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Majority opinion, p. 435, quoting <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 270. When viewed in proper context, however, the quote from <em>Babes </em>lends no support to the proposition for which it is cited, namely, that the plaintiffs withdrawal of its claim against Cohen was not a \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d for apportionment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The issue in <em>Babes </em>was whether the state, when it is sued for negligence upon its waiver of sovereign immunity under General Statutes \u00a7 52-556,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is immune from a reallocation of damages under \u00a7 52-572h (g) in the event that it is found liable for a proportionate share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of the plaintiffs damages and the plaintiff is unable to recover the portion of damages awarded against another defendant. See <em>Babes </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 257-59. We answered that question in the negative; id., 259; explaining that \u201cwhen the legislature enacted \u00a7 52-556, it intended that the substantive rules governing negligence actions generally would apply to actions brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556. Because, at that time, the rules of joint and several liability governed negligence actions, the state, in an action brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-556, could be held responsible for the entire amount of damages awarded, rather than simply its proportionate share of such damages . . . .\u201d Id., 266. We further stated that \u201cit would be illogical to allow the state to benefit from the apportionment provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (c) when there are multiple liable defendants, but not to subject the state to the reallocation provisions of \u00a7 52-572h (g) when a liable codefendant is insolvent.\u201d Id., 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In reaching our conclusion, we briefly summarized the history of Tort Reform, explaining that, \u201cunder Tort Reform I, [the trier of fact] in determining the percentage of damages attributable to a particular defendant . . . was able to take into account the percentage of damages attributable to any other person, even if that person was not a party to the suit. A plaintiff was unable, however, to recover complete compensation for his injuries unless every person whose negligence proximately caused the injuries was a party to the suit. The share of damages attributable to nonparties was not recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201cThe legislature amended \u00a7 52-572h (c) just one year later when it enacted Public Acts 1987, No. 87-227, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 87-227) [which was part of Tort Reform II]. . . . [T]he intent of P.A. 87-227 was to limit the universe of negligent persons that a finder of fact may consider in apportioning damages to only those entities that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>either parties to the suit or parties who have reached a settlement with the plaintiff \u2014 a clear indication that the legislature intended that \u00a7 52-572h (c) permit the plaintiff to obtain, to the maximum extent possible, complete compensation for his injuries.\u201d Id., 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">It is apparent, therefore, that the passage from <em>Babes </em>on which the majority relies simply refers to the same problem that was addressed in the passage from <em>Collins </em>on which the majority also relies, namely, that, under Tort Reform I, a plaintiff often was unable to obtain complete compensation because of language in Tort Reform I that permitted the fact finder, in determining the percentage of negligence attributable to the defendant, to consider the negligence of a nonparty. Thus, we explained in <em>Babes </em>that, by limiting the universe of negligent persons whom the jury could consider in apportioning damages to persons against whom the plaintiff actually <em>could </em>recover, namely, parties and \u201csettled or released persons\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (f); the legislature merely had sought to remedy that aspect of Tort Reform I that had placed defendants at an unfair advantage by preventing plaintiffs from obtaining complete compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">There is nothing in Babes, however, or in any other case, to suggest that the legislature, in enacting Tort Reform II, sought any result other than to strike an equitable balance between the interests of plaintiffs and of defendants. Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme, the balance that the legislature sought to achieve has been shifted dramatically in favor of the plaintiff, who now has the ability to erect an absolute bar to apportionment. Because that cannot be what the legislature sought to accomplish, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\"> In their original complaint, the original plaintiffs, Leslie Aponte and Joseph Viera; see footnote 1 of the majority opinion (describing posture of parties); alleged, inter alia, that, \u201c[bjeginning in or about November 1994 and continuously thereafter to in or about May 1995 and thereafter, the defendant, IAN COHEN, undertook the care, treatment, monitoring and supervision of the infant plaintiffs mother . . . and the infant JODEE VIERA, then in \u00fatero, for pregnancy, labor and delivery. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u201cWhile under the care, treatment, monitoring and supervision of the defendant, IAN COHEN, the infant plaintiff . . . suffered serious, painful and permanent injuries ....</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u201cThe injuries . . . were caused by the failure of the defendant, LAN COHEN, to exercise that degree of care and skill ordinarily and customarily used by physicians specializing in the field of obstetrics under all of the circumstances ... in that he . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u201cfailed to adequately and properly care for and treat the mother of the infant plaintiff during labor and delivery . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u201cfailed to adequately and properly observe and monitor the mother of the infant plaintiff during labor and delivery . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">\u201cfailed to recognize and properly treat the infant plaintiff and her mother for arrested descent . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">\u201cfailed to properly recognize, treat and diagnose a cephalo-pelvic disproportionment . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">\u201cused excessive traction and/or force during the delivery of the infant plaintiff . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">\u201cfailed to deliver the infant plaintiff by cesarean section . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">\u201cdelayed delivery of the infant plaintiff by cesarean section beyond the point of ability to do so safely . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">\u201cfailed to adequately consider all intrapartum and labor factors concerning the probability of shoulder dystocia . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">\u201cfailed to anticipate or plan for a shoulder dystocia . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">\u201cfailed to timely consult with other specialists in the field of obstetrics; and . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">\u201cfailed to adequately and properly read and interpret fetal monitoring tapes.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-20\"> I, like the majority, refer to Fred Balter, the guardian of the estate of Jodee Viera, as the plaintiff.

See part I C of the majority opinion. If McNamee had established, as a matter of fact, that the plaintiffs attorney, Joshua D. Koskoff, had conditioned the withdrawal of the plaintiffs claim against Cohen on Cohen\u2019s agreement to comply with the terms of the handwritten note that Koskoff had given to Cohen\u2019s attorney, Eugene Cooney, then that agreement clearly would have constituted consideration for the withdrawal and, in turn, clearly would have been a \u201csettlement\u201d or \u201csimilar agreement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-572h (n). See footnote 12 of the majority opinion (detailing text of handwritten note). A careful review of the record, however, reveals that, although McNamee\u2019s counsel adverted to the plaintiffs claim against Cohen, she did not press it at trial \u2014 for example, she did not seek to present evidence to establish the claim and did not make an offer of proof \u2014 even though she generally was aware of the existence of the alleged agreement between the plaintiff and Cohen. Contrary to the majority\u2019s contention, however, the terms of the purported agreement are not insufficient as a matter of law to constitute consideration. In support of its conclusion, the majority asserts that Cohen already was obligated by statute to abide by the conditions contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Koskoffs note. The majority further suggests that Cohen\u2019s adherence to those conditions otherwise would not constitute adequate consideration because they did not include a payment of money. With respect to the majority\u2019s first assertion, it is incorrect that the conditions set forth in Koskoffs note \u201cmerely memorialized the plaintiff\u2019s reminder to Cohen of the rules of confidentiality to which he otherwise was obligated [under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146o] once the case against him had been withdrawn.\u201d Even if those rules of confidentiality do bar Cohen from speaking with McNamee about his role as an attending physician during the delivery of Jodee Viera \u2014 a dubious proposition in view of the fact that Cohen and McNamee were partners at the time of Jodee Viera\u2019s delivery, they both participated in the delivery and, for many years, both were defendants in this action \u2014 Koskoffs note contains a condition that has nothing to do with \u00a7 52-146o, namely, that Cooney \u201cwill endeavor to arrange a meeting with Cohen with [Koskofi] or, failing that, will answer written questions truthfully put to him by [Koskoff]. \u201d Cohen\u2019s agreement to that condition, if established, alone would be sufficient to satisfy any requirement of consideration. With respect to whether only the payment of money will suffice as consideration for purposes of a \u201csettlement\u201d or \u201csimilar agreement\u201d under \u00a7 52-572h (n), to the extent that, as the plaintiff claims, consideration is a requirement at all, there is nothing in the statutory scheme to suggest that only the payment of money, and not airy other type or kind of consideration, will suffice. In this regard, I agree with Justice Borden\u2019s concurring opinion. Because, however, McNamee did not press this claim at trial, the trial court did not rale on it. McNamee\u2019s failure to obtain such a ruling is fatal to his contention on appeal that he was entitled to a favorable ruling on the claim. Moreover, under such circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying McNamee\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\"> Although the majority does not expressly say so, it is apparent, in the majority\u2019s view, that the pertinent statutory language is not plain and unambiguous within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z because the majority, in construing that statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, explicitly relies on extratextual evidence, including the purpose of our statutory apportionment scheme. I agree that \u00a7 1-2z is inapplicable because, as the majority acknowledges, the statutory scheme, \u201cwhen read in context, is susceptible to more titan one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In contrast to the majority, however, I believe that the more reasonable construction of the term \u201crelease, settlement or similar agreement\u201d encompasses the plaintiffs withdrawal of his claim against Cohen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\"> \u201cSection 52-102b was enacted in 1995 by No. 95-111 of the 1995 Public Acts, in order to address questions that had become apparent regarding how, procedurally, to implement the concept of proportional liability <em>[when] the plaintiff in a tort action had not brought an action against all the potential tortfeasors and the original defendant sought to apportion liability and, therefore, damages, among those other potential tortfeasors. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\u201c[Section] 52-102b provides that, if a defendant in a tort action believes that another person [not named in the plaintiffs complaint] is or may be liable for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages, the defendant may serve an apportionment writ, summons and complaint on that other person and seek the relief of an apportionment of liability. This apportionment complaint must be filed within 120 days of the return day of the underlying tort complaint.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Lostritto </em>v. <em>Community Action Agency of New Haven, Inc., </em>269 Conn. 10, 42, 848 A.2d 418 (2004) <em>(Borden, J., </em>concurring and dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> Of course, this court has recognized that, \u201c[a]s finally enacted, [Tort Reform I] represents a complex web of interdependent concessions and bargains struck by hostile interest groups and individuals of opposing philosophical positions.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 185, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Thus, although our apportionment scheme contains provisions, like those singled out by the majority, that favor plaintiffs, there are other provisions that favor defendants. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (a) (allowing defendant to bring any nonparty into negligence action for purposes of apportioning liability); General Statutes \u00a7 52-102b (g) (providing that \u201c[i]n no event shall any proportionate share of negligence determined pursuant to subsection [\u00b6] of section 52-572h attributable to an apportionment defendant against whom the plaintiff did not assert a claim be reallocated under subsection [g] of said section\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (plaintiff who settles claim against party for substantially less than jury ultimately assigns as settled party\u2019s proportionate share of damages is precluded from recovering balance from remaining defendants).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> In such circumstances, the case still must be tried with respect to the remaining defendant or defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> Moreover, as McNamee aptly maintains, even in a case in which discovery ultimately leads to a dead end as to one or more of the defendants, the plaintiff has nothing to fear from the remaining defendant\u2019s pursuit of an apportionment claim against his or her codefendant or codefendants. When, however, the withdrawal is motivated by trial strategy, as it apparently was in the present case, then the policy underlying our apportionment statutes strongly favors the right of the remaining defendant to pursue an apportionment claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 provides: \u201cAny person injured in person or property through the negligence of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state against personal injuries or property damage shall have a right of action against the state to recover damages for such injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
