The plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> state of Connecticut appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court dismissing its appeal from the decision of the family support magistrate terminating the child support orders against the defendant, Jeffrey Jodoin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> retroactive to the eighteenth birthday of the minor child, Joshua Jodoin. Because P.A. 04-100 amended various family statutes to render the support available to a child of unmarried parents equal to that provided to a child whose parents have divorced, we conclude that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires us to construe P.A. 04-100 to apply retroactively. This entitles the minor child to support beyond his eighteenth birthday and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The named plaintiff, Robin Walsh, is the mother of the minor child, who was bom on November 8, 1986. The defendant is the acknowledged father of the minor child. In March, 1990, the state, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>had been providing public assistance to Walsh for the support of the minor child, applied to the court for a support order pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 46b-172 (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The family support magistrate, <em>Katherine Y. Hutchinson, </em>granted the state\u2019s request and ordered the defendant to pay continuing support and arrearage to Walsh, as well as to provide medical and dental insurance at a reasonable cost for the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Thereafter, in November, 2004, the family support magistrate, <em>Harris T. Lifshitz, </em>granted the state\u2019s application and ordered the defendant to appear in January, 2005, to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the court\u2019s previous orders in the case. In March, 2005, at a hearing held on that application, the support enforcement officer informed the court that, although the minor child had turned eighteen years of age, the state would continue to enforce the support order pursuant to P.A. 04-100 because he was still enrolled in high school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Magistrate Lifshitz concluded, however, that the order had been terminated by operation of law on the minor child\u2019s eighteenth birthday on November 8, 2004. Accordingly, he refused to extend the order, and he ordered support enforcement services to modify or to adjust its records to reflect termination of the order as of November 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The state appealed from the decision of Magistrate Lifshitz to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (n).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the state claimed that P.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>04-100 applies retroactively to extend support orders that already had been entered before the public act\u2019s effective date of October 1, 2004. Relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>D\u2019Eramo </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>273 Conn. 610, 872 A.2d 408 (2005), and General Statutes \u00a7 55-3,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court, <em>Swienton, J., </em>concluded that P.A. 04-100 was a substantive change in the law that presumptively applied prospectively only. The trial court further concluded that there was nothing in the text or legislative history of P.A. 04-100 that indicated that the legislature had intended for the public act to apply retroactively, notwithstanding its purpose, which was to equalize the treatment of children in need of support, independent of their parents\u2019 marital status. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thereafter, the state moved for reargument, contending that the trial court\u2019s construction of P.A. 04-100 violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions by providing a greater support benefit to the children of divorced parents than to children of unmarried parents. The trial court denied the motion for reargument. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">On appeal, the state claims that the trial court improperly concluded that P.A. 04-100 does not apply retroactively in light of the fact that the legislature had enacted it to create parity among all children entitled to support. The state also claims that the trial court\u2019s construction to the contrary violates the equal protection rights of children of unmarried parents by disadvantaging them compared to children of parents who were married when those children were bom. Although we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that there is insufficient evidence of the requisite legislative intent to justify retroactive application of this substantive law, we nevertheless conclude that P.A. 04-100 applies retroactively because a prospective only application would perpetuate a continuing equal protection violation with respect to children of unmarried parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Whether a statute applies retroactively raises a question of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>262 Conn. 686, 701, 817 A.2d 76 (2003). \u201c[T]he retroactive application of a law occurs only if the new or revised law was not yet in effect on the date that the relevant events underlying its application occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 681, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. ... In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The rule is rooted in the notion that it would be unfair to impose a substantive amendment that changes the grounds upon which an action may be maintained on parties who have already transacted or who are already committed to litigation. ... In civil cases, however, unless con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>siderations of good sense and justice dictate otherwise, it is presumed that procedural statutes will be applied retrospectively. . . . Procedural statutes have been traditionally viewed as affecting remedies, not substantive rights, and therefore leave the preexisting scheme intact. . . . [Although we have presumed that procedural or remedial statutes are intended to apply retroactively absent a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary ... a statute which, in form, provides but a change in remedy but actually brings about changes in substantive rights is not subject to retroactive application. . . . While there is no precise definition of either [substantive or procedural law], it is generally agreed that a substantive law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>D\u2019Eramo </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 620-21. Put differently, substantive changes to statutes \u201cin the absence of any clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary [are] presumptively prospective.\u201d Id., 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The relevant provisions of P.A. 04-100, which is a substantive law governing the rights to support of children of unmarried parents, have an effective date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>October 1,2004, but the public act does not state explicitly whether it applies only to support orders rendered after that date. In contrast, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which, as amended by Public Acts 1994, No. 94-61 (P.A. 94-61), similarly extended parental obligations in divorce cases,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> specifically provides that it \u201cshall apply only in cases where the decree of dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment is entered on or after July 1,1994.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 (b). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>although the related statute applicable in dissolution proceedings quite clearly applies only to orders entered <em>after </em>a date certain, the legislature, in enacting P.A. 04-100, did not provide, with similar clarity, an indication of its intent with respect to its application.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The legislative history similarly contains no evidence indicating clearly whether the legislature intended P.A. 04-100 to apply retroactively to court orders already in effect as of its effective date. Speaking in support of the bill that subsequently was enacted as P.A. 04-100 shortly before its passage by the House of Representatives, Representative Christopher Stone stated only that it \u201cincorporates several of the characteristics or several of the requirements that we presently have for married couples who have children who are engaged in divorce proceedings into the provisions presently in the books for [f]amily [c]ourt magistrates and collection of child support for unmarried individuals. Most primarily and substantively, the bill extends the obligation of child support for non-married individuals who have children to a \u2014 until the child is [nineteen] years old or graduates from high school, whichever occurs first. That\u2019s the present law for individuals who are married and have children and who subsequently get divorced and is a child support obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 47 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Sess., p. 2336; see also id., p. 2337, remarks of Representative Stone (\u201cthis bill really just provides consistency within our law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Despite the remedial purpose of P.A. 04-100, there is insufficient evidence to permit us to conclude that the legislature intended it to apply retroactively, particularly given the limitations set forth by \u00a7 55-3. See footnote 7 of this opinion. It is, however, well settled that \u201c[t]his court should try, whenever possible, to construe statutes to avoid a constitutional infirmity, but may not do so by rewriting the statute or by eschewing its plain language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 251, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989); see also, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>270 Conn. 198, 217, 853 A.2d 434 (2004) (\u201c[in] choosing between two constructions of a statute, one valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>legislature\u2019s underlying intent\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, our duty to construe statutes in a manner that protects them, if possible, from constitutional jeopardy may well require us to conclude that they apply retroactively. See <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet, </em>16 Cal. 3d 583, 588, 546 P.2d 1371, 128 Cal. Rptr. 427 (1976) (amendment to divorce statute that previously discriminated against men by providing that earnings and accumulations of wife, but not husband, while living apart were separate property, applied retroactively because \u201cthe probable constitutional infirmity of the former law does lend some support to the conclusion that the [legislature intended the amendment to have retroactive effect . . . [and] [w]e may reasonably infer, therefore, that the [legislature wished to replace the possibly infirm law with its constitutionally unobjectionable successor as soon as possible\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Accordingly, we must turn to the state\u2019s claim that construing P.A. 04-100 to apply prospectively only violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with respect to the rights of children bom to unmarried parents. The state argues that an equal protection violation occurs because this prospective only construction perpetuates the constitutional violation inherent in the statutory scheme that existed prior to P.A. 04-100, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>which had provided children of unmarried parents with less support than was available to the similarly situated children of parents who were married at the time of the children\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">It is well settled that \u201ca [s]tate may not invidiously discriminate against illegitimate children by denying them substantial benefits accorded children generally. . . . [0]nce a [s]tate posits a judicially enforceable right on behalf of children to needed support from their natural fathers there is no constitutionally sufficient justification for denying such an essential right to a child simply because its natural father has not married its mother.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Gomez </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>409 U.S. 535, 538, 93 S. Ct. 872, 35 L. Ed. 2d 56 (1973). This ban on discrimination exists because \u201cthe legal status of illegitimacy, however defined, is, like race or national origin, a characteristic determined by causes not within the control of the illegitimate individual, and it bears no relation to the individual\u2019s ability to participate in and contribute to society.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>476 U.S. 852, 854 n.5, 106 S.

[noting that] [although we have held that classifications based on illegitimacy are not suspect, or subject to our most exacting scrutiny . . . the scrutiny applied to them is not a toothless one .... [A] classification based on illegitimacy is unconstitutional unless it bears an evident and substantial relation to the particular . . . interests [the] statute is designed to serve. . . . [Restrictions on support suits by illegitimate children will survive equal protection scrutiny to the extent they are substantially related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>462 U.S. 1, 8, 103 S. Ct. 2199, 76 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1983); see also <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Habluetzel, </em>456 U.S. 91, 99-100, 102 S. Ct. 1549, 71 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1982) (striking down one year statute of limitations in support cases involving unmarried parents despite state\u2019s \u201cinterest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims [that] will justify those periods of limitation that are sufficiently long to present a real threat of loss or diminution of evidence\u201d because \u201c[b]y granting illegitimate children only one year in which to establish paternity, Texas has failed to provide them with an adequate opportunity to obtain support\u201d). Viewed in light of these cases, it is apparent that our support statutes in effect after the effective date of P.A. 94-61, but before the effective date of P.A. 04-100 were, at the very least, subject to significant constitutional questions because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>they provided children bom out of wedlock with less support than was provided to children bom to married parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Accordingly, we find instmctive those sister state cases that have constmed their support statutes to rescue them from constitutional jeopardy under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s illegitimacy case law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>23 Mass. App. 590, 591, 504 N.E.2d 659 (1987), a nineteen year old man, bom out of wedlock, who lived in his mother\u2019s home while attending community college sought from the Probate Court an order extending his father\u2019s support obligation beyond the age of eighteen prescribed by the relevant statute. A person in a similar situation, but with parents who had been married at the time of his birth and subsequently divorced, could have received such sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>port under the statute providing for support orders in dissolution cases. Id., 592. Noting that there were no problems of proof of paternity in the case; id., 592 n.3; the court concluded that <em>Gomez </em>and the other Supreme Court cases stood for the proposition that a person bom out of wedlock \u201cconstitutionally is entitled to the same type of support from his biological father, after attaining the age of eighteen and until he reaches twenty-one, as a child of divorced parents would be entitled to receive in like circumstances . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 593. The court relied on this proposition to interpret the Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction broadly enough to allow for such postmajority support for persons bom out of wedlock.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id., 595; see also <em>Rawles </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>172 Ill. App. 3d 931, 935-36, 527 N.E.2d 680 (construing statute to give trial court discretion to provide payment of postmajority college expenses for child bom out of wedlock because statute applicable to divorces provided for such payments), appeal denied, 123 Ill. 2d 566, 535 N.E.2d 410 (1988); <em>Gerhardt </em>v. <em>Estate of Moore, </em>150 Wis. 2d 563, 571-72, 441 N.W.2d 734 (1989) (A statute denying illegitimate children the right to seek additional support from their fathers after a lump sum settlement payment is unconstitutional because \u201c[t]he nonmarital child, unlike the marital child, is barred from seeking additional support, regardless of need. That is hardly fair to the nonmarital child, much less constitutional.\u201d); cf. <em>Ex parte Jones, </em>592 So. 2d 608, 609 (Ala. 1991) (extending to children bom out of wedlock its prior holding in <em>Ex parte Bayliss, </em>550 So. 2d 986, 987 [Ala. 1989], giving trial courts jurisdiction to provide postmajority educational support in divorce cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In light of this case law and the differences in the statutes applicable to the support of children of married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and unmarried parents between 1994 and 2004, it readily is apparent that the fairness and consistency in the law provided by the enactment of P.A. 04-100 has constitutional implications. Moreover, the state has not proffered, and we cannot conceive of any \u201clegitimate state interest\u201d to justify this disparity that is capable of surviving the heightened scrutiny given to legitimacy based classifications. See, e.g., <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 462 U.S. 8. We cannot, therefore, countenance a construction of P.A. 04-100 that would serve to perpetuate this more than ten year old constitutional violation,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and we conclude that P.A. 04-100 applies retroactively to extend support orders already in effect at the time of its enactment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dismissed the state\u2019s appeal from the decision of the family support magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to sustain the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> Public Acts 2004, No. 04-100, provides in relevant part: \u201cSection 1.

But yes, there are \u2014 currently there really are two classes, children of parents who were married and children of unmarried couples.

This is presently the rule for dissolution, legal separation, and annulment cases with decrees entered on or after July 1, 1994. <em>Our proposal would apply the same rule for all children regardless of the marital status of their parents.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)

The Appellate Court noted that the issue \u201cis framed by the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 46b-61, 46b-62 and 46b-54, which, in coryunction, provide that in an action for support of an illegitimate child brought by the custodial parent, the counsel fees thereby incurred by that parent cannot be recovered from the noncustodial parent, while the fees incurred by a parent for support of a legitimate child may be recoverable from the other parent.\u201d Id., 52. The court concluded that, to \u201cconstrue \u00a7 46b-62 so as to deny a custodial parent the right, to collect, from the noncustodial parent, counsel fees incurred in an action under \u00a7 46b-61 for support of an illegitimate child would effectively preclude the pursuit of support from noncustodial parents on behalf of the class of illegitimate children in need of maintenance by custodial parents without funds to prosecute such suits. ... It would be a legislative hoax to permit an action for support of illegitimate children under \u00a7 46b-61 and at the same time to bar effectively such actions for their support in cases of greatest need exhibited by custodial parents who, because of indigency, cannot even enter the courtroom for want of counsel fees.\u201d Id., 53-54. Noting \u201cthe obvious constitutional infirmity of 1he statute if read strictly,\u201d the court concluded that \u00a7 46b-62 \u201cmust be construed to permit the award of attorney\u2019s fees in child support actions filed on behalf of illegitimate children.\u201d Id., 54-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> Indeed, the Massachusetts court also noted that the legislature subsequently had amended the support statute to provide for such support payments to persons bom out of wedlock beyond their eighteenth birthdays. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>supra, 23 Mass.
