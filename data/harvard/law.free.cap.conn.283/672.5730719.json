The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the department had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter. The plaintiff further claims that, if we conclude that the department had jurisdiction, the trial court incorrectly concluded that the department\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and did not constitute an unconstitutional taking under article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The department, the util<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ity and the defendant office of consumer counsel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contend to the contrary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">As context for our review of the factual and procedural history of this case, we first provide an overview of the relevant regulatory landscape. In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (federal act), Pub. L. No. 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117. Section 210 of the federal act, codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3, required the federal Energy Regulatory Commission (federal commission) to prescribe rules requiring electric utilities to purchase electric energy from qualifying small power production facilities. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 (a) (2000); see also 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.303 (a) (2006). \u201cSmall power production facility\u201d is defined in relevant part as \u201ca facility which . . . produces electric energy solely by the use ... of biomass waste [or] renewable resources . . . .\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 796 (17) (A) (i) (2000). The federal act also provides that the rates for the purchase of energy from a small power production facility \u201cshall be just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility and in the public interest, and . . . shall not discriminate against qualifying cogenerators or small power producers.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 (b) (1) and (2) (2000); see also 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304 (a) (1) (i) and (ii) (2006). These rates may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>not exceed \u201cthe incremental cost to the electric utility of alternative electric energy\u201d; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 (b) (2000); see also 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.304 (a) (2) (2006); which is defined as \u201cthe cost to the electric utility of the electric energy which, but for the purchase from such cogenerator or small power producer, such utility would generate or purchase from another source.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 (d) (2000). This incremental cost also is known as the utility\u2019s avoided cost. See 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.101 (b) (6) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">In adopting the avoided cost regulations, the federal commission assumed that the cost to small power production facilities of generating electricity would be lower than the avoided cost that they would be paid for the energy. See <em>American Paper Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Electric Power Service Corp., </em>461 U.S. 402, 406-407, 103 S. Ct. 1921, 76 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1983). The federal commission explained that it had \u201cset the rate [for purchasing electric energy] at full avoided cost rather than at a level that would result in direct rate savings for utility customers\u201d in order \u201cto provide incentives for the development of cogeneration and small power production . . . .\u201d Id., 406. The federal commission also had determined that the rate was \u201cjust and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 413; even though it was not the \u201clowest possible reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 413-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The federal act required each state\u2019s regulatory authority to implement the rules adopted by the federal commission for each electric utility over which it had ratemaking authority. See 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a-3 (f) (1) (2000). The Connecticut General Assembly responded by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a et seq., which substantially incorporated the federal definitions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>mandates, including the avoided cost pricing provisions. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (a) and (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In response to the enactment of \u00a7 16-243a et seq., the department initiated an investigation into cogeneration and small power production. See Decision and Order, Dept, of Public Utility Control, \u201cInvestigation into Co-generation and Small Power Production: \u2018Going Back to the Future\u2019 \u201d (December 11, 1985) (1985 decision and order). In the 1985 decision and order, the department indicated that, in determining pricing methods for such facilities, its goal was \u201cto encourage [small power production facility] development to the maximum feasible extent and to protect utility ratepayers by assuring that over the term of power purchase agreements, there will be net benefits to the state and to ratepayers.\u201d Id., p. 30. To meet these objectives, the department indicated that \u201ccontracts should achieve payments of 100 [percent] of utility avoided costs over the term of the power purchase agreement\u201d and that \u201c[contracts for [qualified facilities] using renewable fuels should receive more favorable terms than for [qualified facilities] using fossil fuels . . . .\u201d Id. The department also recognized that \u201cproceedings to review cogenerator contracts have often taken longer than the cogenerator, utility or [department may have wished.\u201d Id., p. 47. To address this problem, the department determined that, when \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>complete contract is being submitted for review that has the agreement of both [the] utility and [the] cogenerator the [department] will follow expedited procedures . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Thereafter, the department adopted regulations to implement these policies. The regulations established a competitive bidding process for obtaining a long-term purchase contract that would be triggered only when an electric utility has a demonstrated need for additional electric generating capacity. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 16-243a-4 (a) and 16-243a-5. Section 16-243a-7 of the regulations exempts \u201c[Resource recovery projects<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which seek pricing under the provisions of [General Statutes \u00a7] 16-243a\u201d from these standard bidding procedures. Id., \u00a7 16-243a-7 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">With this regulatory background in mind, we review the facts and procedural history of the present case. The plaintiff operates a municipal solid waste burning electric generating facility in Lisbon. In 1991, the plaintiff, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 16-243a, submitted to the department a petition for a declaratory ruling that its facility was a resource recovery project and was therefore exempt under \u00a7 16-243a-7 (a) (4) of the regulations from the bidding requirements for obtaining a long-term purchase contract with the utility. In the petition, the plaintiff also sought a ruling that the utility was required by the 1985 decision and order and \u201cby [\u00a7] 16-243a . . . and . . . [the department\u2019s] [Regulations to enter into an [electricity [p]urchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>[agreement [1991 agreement] ... to purchase electricity generated by the [the plaintiffs] [facility at the rates set forth in that [agreement.\u201d In support of this request, the plaintiff represented that the utility\u2019s \u201cparticipation in the transactions specified in the [1991] [agreement constitutes prudent and efficient management and is otherwise consistent with the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 16-19e<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> .... [Thus, for the term of the 1991 agreement, the utility] will be allowed to recover payments under the [1991] [agreement in a manner at least as favorable to [the utility] as the manner in which [the utility] recovers fossil fuel expenses.\u201d The 1991 agreement provided that the utility \u201cwill pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>chase and [the plaintiff] will sell the entire [n]et [electric [o]utput of the [f]acility . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">On March 13, 1991, the department issued a decision in which it found that the plaintiffs facility was a resource recovery project within the meaning of \u00a7 16-243a-7 (a) (4) of the regulations, that the plaintiffs production of electricity would further the state\u2019s policy of developing diversified energy resources, that its status entitled it under \u00a7 16-243a-7 (a) (4) to contract to sell electricity to the utility even though the utility did not have a need for additional capacity, and that the plaintiff was exempt from the department\u2019s standard bidding procedures. The department also found that \u201cpayments over the twenty-five year life of the [p]roject [were] expected to be [99 percent] of the most recently approved avoided costs\u201d for the utility. The department concluded that the 1991 agreement between the plaintiff and the utility met all applicable regulatory criteria and approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The 1991 agreement contained a dispute resolution clause providing that \u201c[a]ny dispute regarding payments from the [utility] to [the plaintiff] or interpretation of [the] [agreement not covered by subsection (b) [of paragraph twenty-three]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> shall be presented to the [department] for resolution. Any decision of the [department] as to the matter submitted to it shall be subject to appeal in the normal manner for appeals from decisions of the [department]. If the [department] fails or refuses to resolve any such disputes, or fails to act on such disputes within a reasonable period of time not to exceed ninety . . . days, such dispute shall be subject to resolution by any court of competent jurisdiction within the [s]tate of Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>In 2002, the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> created an accounting device known as generation information system certificates, or renewable energy certificates. NEPOOL created the certificates in part because many states, including Connecticut, had enacted statutes requiring certain retail sellers of electricity, including the utility, to purchase a specified amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 16-245a (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The certificates verify that specified units of electricity have been generated using renewable fuel or have been produced with low emissions and, pursuant to state law, can .be purchased to satisfy the state renewable energy requirements. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-245a (b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>certificates effectively \u201cunbundled\u201d the renewable energy attribute of the electric product from the generic energy component for accounting purposes and allowed them to be traded separately. Since 2002, NEPOOL has assigned to the plaintiff, pursuant to NEPOOL\u2019s standard rules of operation, the certificates associated with the generation of electricity at the plaintiff\u2019s facility, \u201cwithout prejudice to which person or entity is the owner of such certificates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In 2004, the utility filed a petition with the department (2004 petition) in which it requested that the department reopen the 1991 proceeding and issue a declaratory ruling that the plaintiff was required to transfer the renewable energy certificates to the utility pursuant to the 1991 agreement. The plaintiff opposed the 2004 petition on the ground that the department lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter and that, if the department had jurisdiction, the utility was not entitled to the certificates. The department held a public hearing on the 2004 petition, issued a draft decision and received comments. Thereafter, the department issued its final decision (2004 decision) in which it concluded, first, that it had jurisdiction over the matter under \u00a7 4-176 and other state statutes and, second, that the 1991 agreement required the plaintiff to transfer the certificates to the utility. The department reasoned that \u201cthe \u2018electricity\u2019 that [the plaintiff] offered to sell and that the [department ordered [the utility] to purchase necessarily meant electricity generated by renewable fuel. No other electricity generated by [the plaintiff] would have qualified [the plaintiff] for the . . . statutory and regulatory treatment [that] it [had] received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the trial court from the 2004 decision pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 and 16-35.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>concluded that the department had jurisdiction to hear the utility\u2019s 2004 petition under \u00a7 4-176, among other statutes, that the 2004 decision did not constitute an unconstitutional taking and that there was substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s determination that the 1991 agreement required the plaintiff to transfer the renewable energy certificates to the utility. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">This appeal followed. The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court incorrectly concluded that (1) the department had subject matter jurisdiction over the contract dispute that formed the basis of the 2004 petition, (2) there was substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s 2004 decision, and (3) the 2004 decision did not constitute an unconstitutional taking. We reject each claim and, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that the department had subject matter jurisdiction over the utility\u2019s 2004 petition to reopen the 1991 proceeding for the purpose of determining the ownership of the renewable energy certificates. The plaintiff argues that the department lacked jurisdiction because the issue of whether the utility or the plaintiff owned the certificates under the 1991 agreement is a question of the intent of the parties under a privately negotiated agreement, and no state statute confers jurisdiction on the department to decide such an issue. The defendants counter that the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment was authorized by statute to set the parameters for contracts between small power production facilities and utilities, and to review and approve such contracts, and that this statutory authority necessarily encompassed the resolution of pricing disputes. Accordingly, the defendants argue, the department had jurisdiction over the 2004 petition under \u00a7 4-176 and General Statutes \u00a7 16-9.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants that the department had jurisdiction over the 2004 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">At the outset, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cAdministrative agencies are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely [on] the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction [on] themselves. . . . We have recognized that [i]t is clear' that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. ... It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions, under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). \u201c[A] subject matter jurisdictional defect may not be waived ... [or jurisdiction] conferred by the parties, explicitly or implicitly. . . . [T]he question of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law . . . and, once raised, either by a party or by the court itself, the question must be answered before the court may decide the case. . . . We have long held that because [a] determination regarding . . . subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Batte-Holmgren </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>281 Conn. 277, 283, 914 A.2d 996 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Administrative agencies have jurisdiction not only to determine the applicability of statutes to particular facts but \u201c[to] issue declaratory rulings based on their interpretations of statutes.\u201d <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977). \u201cIt is inherent in our judicial system of dispute resolution that the interpretation of statutes, like the development of the common law, grows out of the filtering of a set of facts through the law as seen by the [agency] . . . .\u201d Id., 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In the present case, the plaintiff does not dispute that the department had jurisdiction under \u00a7 4-176 to determine whether the plaintiffs facility was a resource recovery project within the meaning of \u00a7 16-243a-7 (a) (4) of the regulations, whether the plaintiffs production of electricity would further the state\u2019s policy of developing diversified energy resources, whether its status entitled it to contract to sell electricity even though the utility did not have a need for additional capacity and whether the plaintiff was exempt from the department\u2019s standard bidding procedures. Nor does the plaintiff dispute that the department had jurisdiction to determine whether the pricing structure of the 1991 agreement complied with the requirement of \u00a7 16-243a that the rates paid by the utility be based on avoided costs. The plaintiff does claim, however, that the department, having made these determinations, lacked jurisdiction to reopen the 1991 proceeding to determine whether the parties intended that the rates set forth in the 1991 agreement would include the renewable energy attribute of the plaintiffs electrical production, now represented by the certificates. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">First, we are unable to accept the plaintiffs characterization of the issue before us as one of pure contractual intent. See <em>Indeck-Yerkes Energy Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Service Commission, </em>164 App. Div. 2d 618, 621, 564 N.Y.S.2d 841 (1991) (meaning of contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>cogeneration facility and utility \u201cis not [issue] of pure interpretation of the language of the agreement\u201d). As we have indicated, the department\u2019s approval of the 1991 agreement was premised on the department\u2019s determination that the plaintiff was a resource recovery facility, as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-207 (9),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that sought pricing under the avoided cost rate provisions of \u00a7 16-243a. Accordingly, as with other terms of the 1991 agreement, the meaning of the agreement\u2019s pricing provisions, including whether they were intended to transfer ownership of the renewable energy component of the electricity to the utility, is more a question of legislative intent and public policy than a question of the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>34 Conn. App. 246, 249, 641 A.2d 398 (1994) (construing contractual dispute resolution provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>similar to provision in present case and concluding that \u201cthe parties\u2019 intent as evidenced by their agreement aligns with the intent of the state legislature that the department regulate and supervise public utilities and establish reasonable rates\u201d). Indeed, although the department concluded in the 2004 decision that \u201cthe parties intended that renewable energy attributes generated by [the plaintiff] . . . [would] be included in the \u2018entire net electric output of the facility,\u2019 \u201d it also concluded that the renewable energy certificates \u201care and <em>were intended by the [department </em>to be sold by [the plaintiff] and purchased by [the utility]. The [department's reliance on Connecticut\u2019s unique body of law is the necessary and material condition for [the] . . . approval\u201d of the 1991 agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">It is apparent that, if the certificates had been in existence when the 1991 agreement was under review by the department, and the intent of the parties with respect to the ownership of the certificates had been clear, the department would have had jurisdiction to determine whether the legislature intended that the avoided costs would include the renewable energy attribute of the energy sold by resource recovery projects for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 16-243a and 16-245a and whether the parties\u2019 intent was consistent with those statutes and the public policies that they embody. Cf. <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 356. Specifically, the department would have had jurisdiction to interpret the governing statutes to determine (1) whether the legislature intended that the word \u201celectricity\u201d in the phrase \u201crates for electricity purchased from a private power producer . . . based on the full avoided costs\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>(c) \u2014 which provided the basis for the 1991 agreement\u2014 include the renewable energy component represented by the certificates or, instead, meant generic electricity without the renewable energy component, and (2) whether the electricity that the utility purchased at the avoided cost rate should be applied to its renewable energy portfolio requirement under \u00a7 16-245a (a), or, instead, the utility should be required to purchase <em>both </em>the electricity <em>and </em>the certificates to meet the requirement. In enacting the avoided cost price provision, the state legislature adopted a federal policy that was intended to balance Congress\u2019 desire to encourage the use of renewable energy sources with its desire to ensure that the rate paid by consumers was just and reasonable, legislative desires that the department is charged with implementing. We see no reason to conclude that the department lacked jurisdiction to make these determinations under \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 and 16-9 merely because the certificates were created and \u00a7 16-245a, which recognized and gave value to the certificates, was enacted after the execution of the 1991 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The fact that the terms of the 1991 agreement were negotiated by the parties and not dictated by the department does not affect this conclusion. The pricing and payment structure of the 1991 agreement was subject to review and approval by the department to ensure that it complied with the applicable statutes and regulations and that it was consistent with public policy regardless of whether the parties voluntarily had agreed to its terms.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>had jurisdiction over the issues raised in the 2004 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the department\u2019s determination that the utility was entitled to the renewable energy certificates and to the proceeds from all prior sales of the certificates was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The gist of the plaintiffs argument is that it was entitled to special regulatory treatment because of its <em>status </em>as a resource recovery facility, i.e., a producer of renewable energy, and not because the electricity that it actually sold to the utility included any renewable energy attribute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u201c[JJudicial review of the [department\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . .

The federal commission has concluded that the ownership of renewable energy certificates is an issue to be decided on the basis of state law and policy, and is not controlled by federal law. In <em>In re Covanta Energy Group, </em>105 F.E.R.C. 61,004, 61,005 (2003), rehearing denied sub nom. <em>In re American Ref-Fuel Co., </em>107 F.E.R.C. 61,016 (2004), several renewable energy facilities filed a petition with the federal commission seeking a declaratory order that avoided cost contracts entered into pursuant to the federal act do not automatically convey ownership of certificates to the purchasing utility in the absence of an express contractual provision to the contrary. The federal commission noted that the factors to be considered in determining avoided costs under the federal act did not include the renewable attribute of the energy generated by the renewable energy facility. See id., 61,007. \u201cThis is because avoided costs were intended to put the utility [in] the same position when purchasing [qualified facility] capacity and energy as if the utility generated the energy itself or purchased the energy from another source. In this regard, the avoided cost that a utility pays a [qualified facility] does not depend on the type of [qualified facility], i.e., whether it is a fossil-fuel-cogeneration facility or a renewable-energy small power production facility. The avoided cost rates, in short, are not intended to compensate the [qualified facility] for more than capacity and energy.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the federal commission concluded that, under federal law, \u201ccontracts for the sale of [qualified facility] capacity and energy entered into pursuant to [the federal act] do not convey [renewable energy certificates] to the purchasing utility (absent an express provision in a contract to the contrary).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">The federal commission also noted, however, that renewable energy certificates \u201care created by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>[s]tates. They exist outside the confines of the [federal act],\u201d and the issues of who owns them and to whom they may be sold or traded are not controlled by the federal act. Id. Accordingly, the federal commission also concluded that, although \u201ca state may decide that a sale of power at wholesale automatically transfers ownership of the state-created [renewable energy certificates], that requirement must find its authority in state law, not [the federal act].\u201d Id. Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell dissented from the federal commission\u2019s decision, stating that she agreed that the ownership of the certificates was not controlled by the federal act but that the majority\u2019s conclusion that avoided cost contracts do not automatically convey the certificates to the purchasing utility under the federal act was inconsistent with that conclusion. Id., 61,008; see also E. Holt, R. Wiser &amp; M. Bolinger, \u201cWho Owns Renewable Energy Certificates?

Each state has ruled . . . that as applied to existing contracts for the sale of power to utilities by renewable energy producers, the certificates are the property of the purchasing utility rather than the producer.\u201d <em>In re Ownership of Renewable Energy Certificates, </em>supra, 389 N.J. Super. 485, citing E. Holt, R. Wiser &amp; M. Bolinger, supra, p. xiv.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> State regulatory agencies have considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion: (1) the fact that utilities would not be obligated to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources if not for their regulatory status and, therefore, that the renewable attributes are inextricably tied to the electricity; (2) requiring utilities to pay extra for the certificates would be a windfall to the renewable energy sources who contracted to receive the avoided cost without any expectation of additional remuneration; and (3) in states that require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable energy sources, awarding the certificates to the renewable energy facility would mean that the utilities that are subject to the requirement would have to pay the facility twice, once based on avoided cost and a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>time when it purchases the certificates, without any additional benefit to ratepayers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> E. Holt, R. Wiser <em>&amp; </em>M. Bolinger, supra, pp. xi-xii; see also <em>In re Ownership of Renewable Energy Certificates, </em>supra, 489 (assignment of certificates to utilities adds value to electricity received by utilities, but this windfall resulted not from modification of purchase contracts but from legislative policy of reducing rates paid by consumers); id., 489-90 (assignment of certificates to renewable energy facility would result in higher rates to consumers who already have paid for electricity).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In the present case, the department concluded that the utility was entitled to the certificates because \u201cthe \u2018electricity\u2019 that [the plaintiff] offered to sell and that the [department ordered [the utility] to purchase necessarily meant electricity generated by renewable fuel. No other electricity generated by [the plaintiff] would have qualified [the plaintiff] for the . . . statutory and regulatory treatment [that] it [had] received. [The federal act] alone would not have qualified [the plaintiff] for [this] treatment . . . .\u201d Specifically, \u201c[n]othing in [the federal act] provides for the exemption from bidding and unique regulatory treatment regarding renewable resources and resource recovery facilities, under which [the plaintiff] sought and received [department approval.\u201d In addition, the department\u2019s regulations, and not federal law, authorized the approval of the 1991 agreement even though the utility did not have a demonstrated need for additional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>We conclude that the department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 16-243a and 16-245a is consistent with the policies underlying the statutes and the department\u2019s regulations, and was reasonable. Specifically, the department reasonably concluded that the plaintiff qualified for the regulatory treatment that it received in the 1991 proceeding because it had agreed to <em>sell </em>renewable energy to the utility, and not merely because of its status as a <em>producer </em>of renewable energy. There is legal and factual support for the conclusions that the avoided cost rate itself was intended to provide an incentive to develop renewable energy sources; <em>American Paper Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Electric Power Service Corp., </em>supra, 461 U.S. 406;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that the state regulatory exemptions from the standard bidding requirements and the regulatory requirement that the utility have a demonstrated need for additional capacity were intended to provide an additional benefit to resource recovery facilities, all at the expense of the utilities and their customers.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the renewable attribute of the energy, represented by the certificates, were not included in the avoided cost rate, then the utility would be required to purchase the certificates in order to comply with \u00a7 16-245a, thereby providing an additional, unbargained-for benefit to the plaintiff, again at the expense of the utility and ratepayers.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The department expressly recognized in the 1985 decision and order that an important public policy underlying the state\u2019s adoption of the mandates of the federal act was to protect ratepayers and to ensure that any agreements that the utility entered into would provide net benefits to ratepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Moreover, the term \u201cunbundling\u201d itself implies that the renewable attribute of the energy generated by renewable energy sources is an inherent attribute of the energy, and, therefore, the creation and state recognition of the certificates did not result in an entirely new commodity but in the splitting of a preexisting commodity, i.e., \u201celectricity,\u201d that the utility had con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tracted to purchase.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It was reasonable, therefore, for the department to conclude that the word \u201celectricity,\u201d as used in \u00a7 16-243a (c) and the 1991 agreement, meant renewable energy. In other words, the term \u201celectricity\u201d necessarily included the renewable attribute that later was \u201cunbundled\u201d from the energy and represented by the certificates. Accordingly, we conclude that the department reasonably determined that the certificates were owned by the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Finally, we address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the department\u2019s decision that the utility was entitled to the renewable energy certificates did not violate article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the department\u2019s \u201csubstitution of its dominion over the [certificates] for [the] plaintiffs control over the property is a taking without compensation.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Whether the department\u2019s decision amounted to an unconstitutional taking is a question of law over which our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>184 Windsor Avenue, LLC </em>v. <em>State, </em>274 Conn. 302, 320 n.20, 875 A.2d 498 (2005). Article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution provides that \u201c[t]he property of no person shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\u201d An unconstitutional \u201ctaking occurs when there is a substantial interference with private property which destroys or nullifies its value or by which the owner\u2019s right to its use or enjoyment is in a substantial degree abridged or destroyed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tamm </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>222 Conn. 280, 284, 610 A.2d 590 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The trial court concluded in the present case that the transfer of the certificates to the utility did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property from the plaintiff because the certificates were not the plaintiffs property.

See, e.g., <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation &amp; Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>269 Conn. 57, 82, 848 A.2d 395 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\"> We note that the plaintiff devoted only approximately one-half of one page of its appellate brief to this issue and argued only that <em>one </em>of the arguments relied on by the department and the trial court in support of their conclusions that the utility was entitled to the certificates was not supported by substantial evidence. Ordinarily, this court will not address claims that have been inadequately briefed. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, 255 </em>Conn. 268, 281 n.30, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001) (\u201c[c]laims on appeal that are inadequately briefed are deemed abandoned\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We do so in the present case, however, because the defendants adequately briefed this issue and because the issue is a matter of some public importance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b715-5\"> Utility regulatory agencies in Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Wisconsin have concluded that the purchasing utility owns the renewable energy certificates when the purchase contract predates the creation of the certificates and the statutory requirement that a certain percentage of the energy purchased by certain retail sellers of electricity be from renewable energy sources. See E. Holt, E. Wiser &amp; M. Bolinger, supra, p. xiv. Regulatory agencies in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah have concluded that the certificates associated with purchase contracts executed after the creation of the statutory scheme regulating them belong to the generator of the energy. See id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b716-5\"> On the other hand, the following arguments in favor of awarding the certificates to the renewable energy sources have been made: (1) the fact that utilities are obligated to purchase energy from renewable energy facilities does not mean that purchase contracts necessarily convey the certificates to the utilities because being such a facility is merely a qualifying characteristic that makes the facility eligible for such contracts; (2) conveying the certificates to the utilities would result in a windfall to them; and (3) utilities and ratepayers benefit from the use of renewable energy even if the certificates are not conveyed to the utilities. E. Holt, R. Wiser &amp; M. Bolinger, supra, pp. xi-xiii.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b717-4\"> We recognize that this conclusion arguably is inconsistent with the conclusion of the federal commission in <em>In re Covanta Energy Group, </em>supra, 105 F.E.R.C. 61,007, that avoided costs were not intended to include the renewable attribute of the energy under federal law. We note, however, that the federal commission was split on that issue, that portion of the decision has been subject to some criticism; see E. Holt, R. Wiser <em>&amp; </em>M. Bolinger, supra, p. 51; the only state court to confront the issue before this court declined to follow the federal commission\u2019s decision; see <em>In re Ownership of Renewable Energy Certificates, </em>supra, 389 N.J. Super. 490-91; and the federal commission\u2019s decision appears to be inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the avoided cost scheme was intended to provide an incentive to develop renewable energy sources. <em>American Paper Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Electric Power Service Corp., </em>supra, 461 U.S. 406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b717-5\"> As we have indicated, in addition to bringing this state action, the plaintiff, along with Minnesota Methane, LLC, brought an action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, challenging the department\u2019s decision on several grounds. See footnote 16 of this opinion. Addressing the plaintiffs claim under the contracts clause of the federal constitution, the District Court concluded that \u201c[t]he [department] took into consideration the renewable attribute [of the electricity] when approving the [1991 agreement], including those terms that were favorable to the generators due to the renewable attribute of the energy they produced. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>[department] later determined that the renewable attribute of the transferred energy, now monetized in the form of [the renewable energy certificates], must be transferred to [the utility]. That determination, an interpretation of the [1991 agreement], does not impair the original [agreement].\u201d <em>Wheelabrator Lisbon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>No. 3:04CV1436, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 455571, *30 (D. Conn. June 23, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> In the companion case of <em>Minnesota Methane, LLC </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>283 Conn. 700, 931 A.2d 177 (2007), the plaintiff, Minnesota Methane, LLC (Minnesota Methane), which is a \u201csmall renewable power project\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 16-243b (a) (6), initially represented at oral argument to this court that the utility would be entitled to credit for the purchase of renewable energy under \u00a7 16-245a even if the utility did not receive the certificates associated with the energy. The department and the utility responded that that would result in double counting because both the utility and the entity to which Minnesota Methane sold the certificates would receive credit for the renewable energy, and that this was inconsistent with the underlying public policy of promoting the development of renewable energy sources. During rebuttal argument, Minnesota Methane appeared to withdraw its initial claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> In support of the 2004 petition, the utility submitted to the department certain educational materials concerning the certificate program. These materials explained that the \u201c[cjoncept of [u]nbundling\u201d was intended to <em>\u201c[separate] </em>the environmental attributes of electric power from the energy commodity\u201d; (emphasis added); resulting in two commodities: (1) energy; and (2) environmental attributes, represented by the tradable certificates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> In the plaintiffs action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut; see footnotes 16 and 26 of this opinion; the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that the department\u2019s decision violated the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. See <em>Wheelabrator Lisbon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>No. 3:04CV1436, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 455571, *2, *30 (D. Conn. June 23, 2006). The District Court concluded that, because the department had concluded that the utility owns the certificates, the plaintiff was not deprived of any property interest.
