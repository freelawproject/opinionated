The plaintiff claims that the commissioner improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>construed General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-294,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was repealed and is presently codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a), to deprive the commissioner of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claim for dependent\u2019s benefits under General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-306 (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> following the death of her husband, Peter Chambers (decedent). Specifically, we consider whether, under the limitations periods applicable in 1979, a dependent has filed a timely claim for dependent\u2019s benefits when the employee had filed a federal, but not a state, occupational disease claim during his life and died more than two years after the first manifestation of his disease. We answer that question in the negative and, accordingly, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>As set forth in the decision of the board, the relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. \u201cThe decedent was employed at the Electric Boat [Corporation] shipyard. On or about July 30, 1979, he filed a claim under the [Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 etseq. (federal act)] claiming he suffered from a work-related lung ailment. In October, 1980, he ceased working at Electric Boat [Corporation]. He did not file a [f]orm 30C seeking benefits under [the state act]. On January 31, 1999, [the decedent] died. On March 9, 1999, his widow filed a [f]orm30C seeking \u00a7 31-306 . . . death benefits under Connecticut law. The [defendants] filed a [f]orm 43 contesting the claim, and specifically contested jurisdiction.\u201d The commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The plaintiff subsequently appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s decision dismissing her claim. The plaintiff claimed that the commissioner improperly had dismissed her claim on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the notice of her dependent\u2019s claim was timely under \u00a7 31-294c (a). The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The plaintiff claims that the board improperly concluded that the commissioner properly had interpreted \u00a7 31-294c (a) to conclude that the plaintiffs claim for dependent\u2019s benefits was untimely. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that: (1) the limitations period of \u00a7 31-294c (a) for dependents\u2019 claims is separate and distinct from the limitations period for injury claims, such that the timely notice of claim by the decedent in his own right is not a prerequisite to her subsequent dependent\u2019s claim; and (2) in the alternative, if the timely filing of notice by the decedent in his own right is a prerequisite to her subsequent dependent\u2019s claim, then the decedent\u2019s claim under the federal act also satisfied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>notice requirement of the state act. We conclude that the timely notice of claim by the decedent is, under the facts of the present case, a prerequisite to the plaintiffs dependents\u2019 claim, and we conclude that the decedent\u2019s federal act claim did not satisfy the notice of claim required under \u00a7 31-294c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] . . . a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation .... There has been no prior judicial or time-tested interpretation of \u00a7 31-294c (a). Accordingly, our statutory analysis accords no deference to the board\u2019s interpretation of that statute. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u201c[W]e are mindful of the principles underlying Connecticut practice in [workers\u2019] compensation cases: that the legislation is remedial in nature . . . and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . . We also recognize, however, that the filing of a timely notice of claim is a condition precedent to liability and a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>intent of the legislature. . . . The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>283 Conn. 813, 820-21, 930 A. 2d 666 (2007). Although the defendants contend that \u00a7 l-2z governs our review of \u00a7 31-294c (a) as it applies to the facts of this case, we find the statutory scheme \u201cdifficult to construe with complete consistency . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 820. \u201cAccordingly, our analysis is not limited, and we, therefore, apply our well established process of statutory interpretation, under which we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case ....</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cIn seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . We have previously recognized that our construction of the [state act] should make every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible .... In applying these principles, we are mindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 821-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the limitations period of \u00a7 31-294c (a) for dependents\u2019 claims is separate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>distinct from the limitations period for injury claims, such that the timely notice of claim by the decedent in his own right is not a prerequisite to the plaintiffs subsequent dependent\u2019s claim. To the contrary, we conclude that the decedent\u2019s timely filing of notice was a prerequisite to the plaintiffs subsequent dependent\u2019s claim because the statute of limitations requires the filing of \u201csome claim\u201d within the applicable limitations period, and because the decedent lived beyond that limitations period without filing a claim within that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 822, we addressed the proviso language of \u00a7 31-294c (a), namely, \u201cprovided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident or first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents, or the legal representative of the deceased employee, may make claim for compensation within the two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As part of our analysis of the issue in <em>Fredette, </em>we reviewed, as a threshold matter, the operation of the statute absent the foregoing proviso. In so doing, we concluded that the statute of limitations applies \u201cto <em>all </em>potential claims under the act, including claims of the employee\u2019s estate or his dependents.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 824. \u201cConcomitantly, [we stated that] we conclude that the timely filing of any compensable claim under the act has the effect of satisfying the limitations period for all potential claims under the act. Because the limitations period begins to run when at least <em>some claim </em>has vested, however; <em>Tolli </em>v. <em>Connecticut Quar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>ries Co., </em>101 Conn. 109, 114, 124 A. 813 (1924) (\u2018fixing the time of an injury at which some claimant would have the right to have compensation begin\u2019); we also conclude that the failure to file any compensable claim within the applicable limitations period would have the effect of barring all claims under the act, irrespective of whether they yet had become compensable.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We then elaborated that \u201c\u00a7 31-294c (a) requires, not that claims under the act be brought in any particular order, but rather that a compensable claim be filed within the applicable limitations period, irrespective of [who brings that initial claim]. In the case of an instantaneously fatal injury, for example, the claims of the decedent\u2019s estate and his dependents immediately would become compensable, and the filing of either claim would satisfy the limitations period for both. In the case of an employee who survives his injuries, however, his estate and dependents must wait until the employee\u2019s death to file their claims. See <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>[239 Conn. 19, 25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996)]. <em>In [that] scenario, if the employee had lived beyond the expiration of the limitations period and had failed to make a timely claim, the employee\u2019s estate and dependents\u2019 claim would be time barred. </em>If, however, the employee had filed a timely claim during his lifetime, that claim would have had the effect of satisfying the limitations period with respect to the claims of his estate and dependents.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 824-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In the present case, because the decedent died <em>more </em>than two years after the first manifestation of a symptom of his occupational disease, the applicable statute of limitations was one year from the first manifestation of a symptom of that occupational disease. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-294 (\u201c[n]o proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given <em>within one year </em>from . . . the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease . . . provided, <em>if death has resulted within two years </em>from the date of the . . . first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents . . . may make claim for compensation within such two-year period or within one year from the date of death\u201d [emphasis added]). Therefore, the only compensable claim during the entire limitations period was that of the decedent, because the claims of the estate and dependents did not vest until the employee\u2019s death. <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 25. Accordingly, although the timely notice of an employee\u2019s claim is <em>not </em>necessarily a prerequisite to a dependent\u2019s claim, the timely notice of claim by the decedent is a prerequisite in the present case because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>the decedent was the only potential claimant capable of satisfying the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The plaintiff argues that dependents\u2019 claims are \u201cseparate and distinct from underlying injury claims,\u201d and that the legislature \u201cused the word \u2018provided\u2019 in \u00a7 31-294 to distinguish the filing requirements for injury claims from the filing requirements for death claims.\u201d Relying on the proviso language of the statute, the plaintiff specifically contends that the only requirement for death claims \u201cis that the notice of claim be filed within one year of the date of death or within two years of the accident or first manifestation of the occupational disease that caused the death, whichever is later.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a) (\u201cprovided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident or first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents, or the legal representative of the deceased employee, may make claim for compensation within the two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Dependents\u2019 claims are separate and distinct from underlying injury claims; <em>Biederzycki </em>v. <em>Farrel Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>103 Conn. 701, 704-705, 131 A. 739 (1926); and a dependent may not rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>claim of his decedent, but rather he must file his own claim for dependent\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31-306. See Public Acts 1998, No. 98-104, \u00a7 1 (providing, in response to cases from board precluding dependents\u2019 benefits, that, in cases in which employee received benefits at time of death, employer must notify dependents that they must file separate notices of claim to pursue benefits under \u00a7 31-306). As we explained in <em>Fredette, </em>however, the proviso language of the statute of limitations does not set forth a separate and distinct limitations period for dependents\u2019 claims. <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 836. Instead, the proviso serves \u201cas an expansion of the underlying one year limitations period for cases in which the employee had, during his lifetime, failed to satisfy the underlying statute of limitations but still had died relatively swiftly . . . namely, within two years of the injury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">As we previously have discussed, the underlying limitations period \u2014 under the 1979 revision to the General Statutes applicable in the present case, of one year\u2014 applies to <em>all </em>claims, unless the employee dies <em>within two years </em>of the first manifestation of a symptom of his occupational disease. In that case, a limitations period of the later of two years from the date of the first manifestation or one year from the date of death, whichever is later, controls the claims of his dependents and estate. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-294; <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 832. Because, in the present case, the decedent died more than two years after the first manifestation of his disease, the proviso does not operate to provide the plaintiff with an additional year after her decedent\u2019s death to file her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The plaintiff also argues that, when the legislature eliminated a period of repose from the statute in 1959, it \u201csought to ensure that ... [a] dependent\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>death benefits based on occupational disease, would not be barred before those rights had accrued.\u201d Our decision in the present case, the plaintiff contends, runs contrary to that intent because it means that the decedent\u2019s failure to file a notice of claim within one year from the first manifestation of his disease would have the effect that the legislature intended to prevent, namely, precluding the plaintiffs claim before it vested. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In 1927, the legislature inserted the following language into the predecessor statute to \u00a7 31-294c (a): \u201c[N]o claim for an occupational disease shall be made by an employee or his dependents against the employer in whose employ the disease is claimed to have originated, except while the employee is still in such employ, or within three years after leaving such employ.\u201d Public Acts 1927, c. 307, \u00a7 5. The legislature extended the three year period of repose to five years in 1939; see General Statutes (1939 Sup.) \u00a7 1330e; and removed it altogether in 1959. Public Acts 1959, c. 580, \u00a7 8. The effect of the foregoing repose period undoubtedly had been, on occasion, to bar a claimant\u2019s cause of action even before that action began to accrue; see <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 582, 512 A.2d 893 (1986); specifically, in cases in which the employee\u2019s occupational disease manifested itself more than five years after the employee ended his employment with the employer allegedly responsible for that disease. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 792-93, 657 A.2d 616 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The plaintiff is correct that, under our interpretation of \u00a7 31-294c (a), an employee\u2019s failure to satisfy the underlying limitations period might similarly extinguish his dependent\u2019s claim \u2014 which vests upon the employee\u2019s <em>death </em>\u2014 before the employee\u2019s death. Whereas the repose period precluded <em>any </em>claim more than five years after the employee left the responsible employer, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>\u00a7 31-294c (a), however, the decedent can preserve his dependents\u2019 claims by timely filing his own notice of claim. Such a relationship between the employee\u2019s and his dependents\u2019 claims is consistent with the nature of dependents\u2019 claims; see <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 25 (\u201cthe availability of survivor-ship benefits under \u00a7 31-306 is inextricably linked to, and wholly dependent upon, the existence of a compensable injury or illness suffered by the employee\u201d); insofar as the employee has as much choice to file a claim as he has to enter into a full and final settlement of that claim. See id., 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We have concluded that: (1) \u201cin any claim based on an occupational disease, whether for benefits payable to the employee during his lifetime or to the dependents or his estate after the employee\u2019s death, <em>some claim </em>must be filed\u201d within the applicable limitations period; (emphasis in original) <em>Fredette </em>v. <em>Connecticut Air National Guard, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 838; which, in the present case, was one year from the date of the first manifestation of the occupational disease; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-294; and (2) because the decedent died more than two years after the first manifestation of his occupational disease, and because the plaintiffs claim did not vest until the decedent\u2019s death, the timely filing of a notice of claim by the decedent is a prerequisite to the plaintiffs claim. Accordingly, we now turn to the second, alternative claim of the plaintiff, namely, that the claim of the decedent under the federal act satisfied the notice of claim requirements of the state act. We conclude, to the contrary, that the language of \u00a7 31-294c (a) and case law interpreting the statute make clear that sufficient \u201cnotice of claim for compensation\u201d requires, not simply that the plaintiff alert the employer or the commissioner to the existence of any compensable claim, but rather that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>inform the employer or commissioner of his or her intent specifically to pursue such a claim under the state act.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 31-294c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given .... Notice of a claim for compensation may be given to the employer or any commissioner and shall state, in simple language, the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting from the accident, or the date of the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease and the nature of the disease, as the case may be, and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed. . . .\u201d In the present case, the parties agree that the decedent\u2019s notice of claim under the federal act stated \u201cin simple language . . . the date of the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease and the nature of the disease . . . and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a). The issue, therefore, is whether, by \u201cnotice of claim for compensation,\u201d the legislature intended to limit the term \u201ccompensation\u201d to mean compensation <em>under the state act. </em>We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In analyzing this language, we do not write on a clean slate. In fact, we specifically considered \u201cwhat is meant by the words \u2018written notice of claim for compensation\u2019 \u201d in <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corp., </em>118 Conn. 315, 317, 172 A. 353 (1934). In that case, we considered whether a physician\u2019s letter to the employer\u2019s insurer, notifying it of the employee\u2019s injury, \u201cconstituted a compliance with the requirements of the statute.\u201d Id., 316. We were persuaded that it did not, in part because of a provision of General Statutes (1930 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Rev.) \u00a7 5232, a predecessor to \u00a7 31-294c (a), which provided in relevant part that \u201cany employee who shall have sustained an injury in the course of his employment shall forthwith notify his employer, or some person representing him, of such injury; and, on his failure to give such notice, the commissioner may reduce the award of compensation proportionately to any prejudice which he shall find the employer has sustained by reason of such failure.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corp., </em>supra, 317.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This court concluded that the legislature intended by the words \u201cnotice of claim for compensation\u201d something more than the notice of injury required by the provisions of \u00a7 5232. Id. \u201cThe distinguishing element [we stated] must be that under the former the written notice intended is one which will reasonably inform the employer that the employee is claiming or proposes to claim <em>compensation under the [a)ctP </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.; see also <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Penn Seaboard Steel Corp., </em>100 Conn. 423, 425, 123 A. 906 (1924) (distinguishing notice of injury from notice of claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 829 A.2d 818 (2003). In that case, an employee, who was injured in a car accident, filed a timely notice of claim under the state act. Id., 527-28. In addition, the employee and his wife initiated a third party action against the driver and owner of the other vehicle involved in that accident. Id., 529. Subsequent to the death of the employee, the employee\u2019s wife amended the complaint in the third party action to allege that the employee\u2019s death was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>consequence of the injuries that he had sustained in the accident. Id. Although the wife sent a copy of that amended complaint to her husband\u2019s former employer less than one year after his death, she formally filed her claim for survivor\u2019s benefits more than five years thereafter. See id., 530. On appeal to this court, the wife claimed that her untimely notice was not fatal to her claim for benefits, in part, because the amended complaint constituted sufficient notice. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In rejecting that argument, we indicated that constructive notice of a potential claim does not equate with specific notice of an actual one. Id., 532. Quoting from <em>Rehtarchik </em>v. <em>Hoyt-Messinger Corp., </em>supra, 118 Conn. 317, we stated that \u201cthe written notice required . . . must \u2018reasonably inform the employer that the employee [or dependent] <em>is claiming or proposes to claim compensation under the [state act) . . . </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 534. We rejected the plaintiffs claim because the \u201c[t]he amended complaint . . . contained <em>no indication that the plaintiff was seeking or intended to seek . . . benefits </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 535. Moreover, we concluded that the employer\u2019s mere \u201crecognition of the fact that the [wife] <em>might </em>seek benefits as a consequence of the decedent\u2019s death\u201d was insufficient to constitute notice. (Emphasis in original.) Id., 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Moreover, the context of \u00a7 31-294c (a); see General Statutes \u00a7 31-275;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> supports our conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>\u201cnotice of claim for compensation\u201d must indicate that compensation is claimed under the state act. Section 31-294c (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo proceedings for compensation <em>under the provisions of this chapter </em>shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Put another way, a \u201cnotice of claim for compensation\u201d is a condition precedent to \u201cproceedings for compensation.\u201d It is logical, therefore, to conclude that the legislature intended the \u201ccompensation\u201d for which notice is given to be the same \u201ccompensation\u201d for which proceedings are maintained, namely, \u201ccompensation <em>under the provisions of this chapter </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">On the basis of the language of \u00a7 31-294c (a), as well as the case law interpreting the statute, we conclude that, in addition to the requirements explicitly set forth in the statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sufficient \u201cnotice of claim for compensation\u201d under \u00a7 31-294c (a) requires that the plaintiff reasonably inform the employer or commissioner of his or her intent to pursue a claim specifically under the state act.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In the present case, the decedent filed a claim for benefits under the federal act on July 30, 1979. He did so on a form produced by the federal Department of Labor, which form referenced sections of the federal act and included the language, \u201cI hereby make a claim for compensation benefits, monetary and medical, under the [Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>tion] Act.\u201d The notice of claim form made no reference to the state act, nor did the decedent separately indicate that he simultaneously intended to claim benefits under the state act. Moreover, at the time of the decedent\u2019s claim, it was commonly understood that the federal and state acts were mutually exclusive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, far from evincing an intent to pursue a claim under the state act, the decedent\u2019s decision to pursue benefits under the federal act, at the time, would have been seen as an election <em>not </em>to pursue benefits under the state act.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The plaintiff argues that the decedent\u2019s claim under the federal act satisfies the notice requirement of \u00a7 31-294c (a) principally because it included several factual elements that are common to claims under both the federal and state acts, namely, the decedent\u2019s name and address, the employer\u2019s name and address, the date that the decedent was diagnosed with the disease, and the allegation that he had acquired his disease from his occupation. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-294c (a) (\u201c[n]otice . . . shall state, in simple language . . . the date of the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease and the nature of the disease . . . and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">As previously discussed, the relevant inquiry when evaluating a notice of claim under \u00a7 31-294c (a) is whether it adequately apprises the employer, not only of those elements, but also of the employee\u2019s intent to seek benefits under the state act. When viewed in this context, the notice of claim under the federal act does not satisfy the notice requirement of \u00a7 31-294c (a) because it made no indication that the decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>intended to pursue benefits under the state act. Indeed, because benefits under the federal act do not track precisely the benefits under the state act, in some instances, the inquiry that the employer may take to investigate the claims may differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We also are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs reliance upon <em>Tardy </em>v. <em>Abington Constructors, Inc., </em>71 Conn. App. 140, 150, 801 A.2d 804 (2002), for the proposition that \u201cstrict compliance with a notice of claim is not required as long as it puts the employer on notice to make a timely investigation.\u201d The alleged defects in the notice of claim in that case involved mistakenly listing the place of injury instead of the place of death, and listing the decedent as a claimant, as opposed to his estate. Id., 149. In holding that the claim nonetheless was adequate, the Appellate Court relied upon our statement in <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 535, 543 n.8, 637 A.2d 392 (1994), that, \u201cif the notice of claim is sufficient to allow the employer to make a timely investigation of the claim, it triggers the employer\u2019s obligation to file a disclaimer.\u201d In order, however, for \u201cthe employer to make a timely investigation of <em>the claim\u201d; </em>(emphasis added) id.; an employer must, at a minimum, know what that claim is.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Finally, we disagree with the plaintiffs argument that, at worst, the failure of the decedent to indicate his intent to pursue benefits under the state act should be deemed a defect or inaccuracy of notice, which \u201cshall [not] bar maintenance of proceedings unless the employer shows that he was ignorant of the facts concerning the personal injury and was prejudiced by the defect or inaccuracy of the notice. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>utes \u00a7 31-294c (c). The failure to have filed a notice of claim is, not simply a defect in notice, but rather no notice at all. See <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\"> The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-294 provides in relevant part: \u201cNo proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident or from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury, provided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident or first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents, or the legal representative of the deceased employee, may make claim for compensation within such two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later.

We said that \u201cwe do not suggest, that after the death of a decedent who <em>had </em>filed a timely claim during his lifetime, there is <em>no </em>subsequent time limitation on the filing of a separate claim by his dependents or legal representative.

In that case, the board considered whether a claim for benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c also constituted notice under the state act.

In <em>DeMello, </em>the board concluded that, in light of the \u00a7 7-433c claim, the absence of a separate notice of claim under the state act constituted, at most, a defect in notice, which required the employer \u201cto show that it was prejudiced by the defects in the notice and that it was ignorant of the circumstances of the injury.\u201d <em>DeMello </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>supra, No. 03633 CRB-08-97-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The board, in its decision in the present appeal, distinguished <em>DeMello, </em>stating that the \u201cprimary rationale in [that] decision was the juxtaposition of state workers\u2019 compensation statutes and state heart and hypertension statutes.\u201d We need not determine whether the board clarified or overruled its earlier decision in <em>DeMello. </em>The determination of a legal issue of first impression by the board is not binding on this court. <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 460-61 n.15, 594 A.2d 446 (1991). We acknowledge, however, that in <em>Collins </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 431, we concluded that a police officer\u2019s claim under the state act constituted sufficient notice under \u00a7 7-433c.
