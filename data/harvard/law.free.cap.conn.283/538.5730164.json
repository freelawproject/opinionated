Palozie, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court affirming the judgment of the Probate Court denying the plaintiffs application for title and right of possession to a twenty-three acre parcel of land situated on Crane Road in Ellington (Crane Road property).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>trial court improperly concluded that a declaration of trust executed by the plaintiffs deceased mother, Sophie H. Palozie (decedent), was invalid and unenforceable because the decedent had not manifested an unequivocal intent to create a trust and to impose upon herself the enforceable duties of a trustee. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On March 7,2003, the plaintiff commenced this action against the decedent\u2019s estate, which is administered by the defendants, Richard T. Palozie and Joanne Palozie-Weems, by filing an application in Probate Court seeking title and right of possession to the Crane Road property. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98 (a) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the application, the plaintiff claimed that he recently had discovered a \u201cdocument entitled \u2018[declaration of [t]rust\u2019 dated February 23,1988 signed by the decedent,\u201d wherein the decedent had declared that she held the Crane Road property in trust for the use and benefit of the plaintiff. After conducting a hearing, the Probate Court denied the plaintiffs application, concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the declaration of trust was invalid and unenforceable. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the Probate Court to the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a) (\u201c[a]nyperson aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">After conducting a trial on the merits of the plaintiffs application,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court found the following facts. \u201cOn February 23, 1988, [the decedent] asked her grandson David Palozie, who is also the plaintiffs son, to visit her. It was David\u2019s birthday and he did go to [the decedent\u2019s] home with his wife Susan. While there [the decedent] asked David and his wife, Susan [Palozie], to witness her signature on a document and they did so. The document ... is entitled \u2018[declaration of [t]rust.\u2019 At the time David did not know what the document purported to be, nor was there any evidence that Susan did either. The signature of the settlor appeal's to be that of [the decedent] and it has not been shown otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u201cAt the same time [the decedent] asked David and Susan [Palozie] to witness a second document purporting to be a quitclaim deed to the Crane Road prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>erty, again with the witnesses having no knowledge of what the document was. . . . The quitclaim deed purports to convey to herself as trustee under the terms of the [declaration of [t]rust, the Crane Road property. The quitclaim deed was not acknowledged and neither it nor the [d]eclaration of [t]rust were recorded on the land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u201cNo one, other than [the decedent] was aware of the nature of these documents. Apparently, she kept them in either a small metal box or a suitcase in her home. [The decedent] died, in her home on March 13, 1991, intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u201cFamily members, including the plaintiff and [the decedent\u2019s] daughter, Gaye Reyes, gathered at the house. They retrieved a small metal box and a suitcase. The contents of the metal box were briefly examined and then taken by the plaintiff to the house trailer in which he lived, which was located on the property. ([The decedent] lived separately in a house on the same property.)</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cGaye [Reyes] was appointed administratrix of the estate and filed an inventory on March 24, 1992, which included the Crane Road property as an asset of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">\u201cGaye Reyes was removed as administratrix approximately ten years later because the administration of the estate was not proceeding timely. Two of [the decedent\u2019s] grandchildren, Richard Palozie and Joanne Palozie-Weems were appointed as successor coadministrators in June, 2002. In January, 2003, they filed an application to sell the real estate in question. The plaintiff objected to the proposed sale claiming, for the first time since [the decedent\u2019s] death in 1991, that he, and not [the decedent\u2019s] estate, held legal title to the property by virtue of the purported trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>On the basis of the foregoing facts, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove, by clear and satisfactory evidence, that the decedent had \u201cadequately manifest[ed] an intention to create a trust and to accept the enforceable duties of trustee.\u201d See <em>Long </em>v. <em>Schull, </em>184 Conn. 252, 255, 439 A.2d 975 (1981) (\u201c[w]hen an estate is a party, the burden is on the [claimant] ... to prove the claim by clear and satisfactory proof\u2019). The trial court observed that the decedent had not informed \u201c[t]he witnesses to the \u2018[declaration of [t]rust\u2019 . . . what the instrument was,\u201d and had \u201ckept the document under her total control during her lifetime with no obligation ... to the supposed beneficiaries.\u201d \u201cThe likelihood is that [the decedent] wished to retain total control of the property during her lifetime for her own benefit, and not as a trustee for the plaintiff . . . [and, therefore, the trust instrument] was a poorly designed effort to establish a testamentary document, rather than a trust with the requirements that would entail.\u201d In arriving at this determination, the trial court found it noteworthy that: (1) \u201cthere was evidence that [the decedent] and . . . [the plaintiff] were not always without conflict in their relationship,\u201d as reflected by a family violence protective order issued against the plaintiff on behalf of the decedent in 1990; and (2) the quitclaim deed \u201cwas never recorded, nor was it properly acknowledged as required by General Statutes \u00a7 47-5.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court determined that the declaration of trust was void and unenforceable and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>therefore, rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the present appeal. The declaration of trust provides in relevant part: \u201cWhereas I, Sophie H. Palozie, of the Town of Ellington, County of Tolland, State of Connecticut, am the owner of certain real property located at (and known as) 315 Crane Road in the Town of Ellington, State of Connecticut . . . NOW THEREFORE, KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that I do hereby acknowledge and declare that I hold and will hold said real property and all my right, title and interest in and to said property and all furniture, fixtures and personal property situated therein on the date of my death, IN TRUST being of sound mind to wit I make this my last private verbal act . . . [f]or the use and benefit of . . . Donald L. Palozie, Trustee [under declaration of trust] February 23, 1988 . . . [but] if such beneficiary be not surviving, for the use and benefit of . . . Gaye M. Reyes . . . .\u201d The instrument further provides: \u201cUpon my death, unless the beneficiaries shall predecease me or unless we all shall die as a result of a common accident or disaster, my [successor [t]rustee is hereby directed forthwith to transfer said property and all my right, title and interest in and to said property unto the beneficiary absolutely and thereby terminate this trust . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly found that the decedent had not manifested an intent to create a trust, or to impose upon herself the enforceable duties of a trustee, based on her failure to communicate her intent and on her exclusive retention and control of the trust instrument and quitclaim deed during her lifetime. We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claim, we briefly review the basic principles that govern the validity and enforcement of trusts. The requisite elements of a valid and enforceable trust are: \u201c(1) a trustee, who holds the trust property and is subject to duties to deal with it for the benefit of one or more others; (2) one or more beneficiaries, to whom and for whose benefit the trustee owes the duties with respect to the trust property; and (3) trust property, which is held by the trustee for the beneficiaries. \u201d 1 Restatement (Third), Trusts \u00a7 2, comment (f), p. 21 (2003); see also <em>Goytizolo </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>27 Conn. App. 22, 25, 604 A.2d 362 (1992) (\u201c[a] trust requires three basic elements: [1] a trust res; [2] a fiduciary relationship between a trustee and a beneficiary requiring the trustee to deal with the trust res for the benefit of the beneficiary; and [3] the manifestation of an intent to create a trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u201cOne owning property can create an enforceable trust by a declaration that he holds the property as trustee for the benefit of another person.\u201d <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>172 Conn. 292, 295-96, 374 A.2d 230 (1977). A trust may be created \u201cwithout notice to or acceptance by any beneficiary or trustee\u201d; 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 14, p. 216; and in the absence of consideration. Id., \u00a7 15, p. 222; see also <em>Hebrew University Assn. </em>v. <em>Nye, </em>148 Conn. 223, 229, 169 A.2d 641 (1961) (\u201c[i]t is true that one can orally constitute himself a trustee of personal property for the benefit of another and thereby create a trust enforceable in equity, even though without con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>sideration and without delivery\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthe settlor may reserve extensive powers over the administration of a trust\u201d; <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>supra, 296; and may reserve the right to modify or revoke the trust at will. See, e.g., <em>DiSesa </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>160 Conn. 250, 263-64, 278 A.2d 785 (1971); <em>Cherniack </em>v. <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>151 Conn. 367, 369-70, 198 A.2d 58 (1964); see also 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 25, p. 377 (trust \u201cis not rendered testamentary merely because the settlor retains extensive rights such as a beneficial interest for life, powers to revoke and modify the trust, and the right to serve as or control the trustee . . . or because the trust is intended to serve as a substitute for a will\u201d). \u201cNo trust, however, is created unless the settlor presently and unequivocally manifests an intention to impose upon himself enforceable duties of a trust nature. ... If what has been done falls short of showing the complete establishment of a fiduciary relationship, as where the intent to become a trustee is doubtful because what was said or done is as compatible with an intent to make a future gift as with an intent to hold the legal title to property for the exclusive benefit of another, the proof fails to show more than a promise without consideration.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>supra, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">To determine whether the decedent manifested an intent to create a trust and to impose upon herself the enforceable duties of a trustee, we begin with the language of the trust instrument. See <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>177 Conn. 476, 481, 418 A.2d 895 (1979) (\u201c[t]he issue of intent as it relates to the interpretation of a trust instrument. . . is to be determined by examination of the trust instrument itself and not by extrinsic evidence of actual intent\u201d); <em>Marzahl </em>v. <em>Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>170 Conn. 62, 64, 364 A.2d 173 (1976) (\u201cOne of the basic elements necessary for the creation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>trust is a manifestation of intention to create it. Effect must be given to that intent <em>which finds expression in the language used.\" </em>[Emphasis added.]). This is because \u201cwhere the manifestation of the settlor\u2019s intention is integrated in a writing, that is, if a written instrument is adopted by the settlor as the complete expression of the settlor\u2019s intention, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict or vary the terms of the instrument in the absence of fraud, duress, undue influence, mistake, or other ground for reformation or rescission.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 21, comment (a), p. 322; accord 1 A. Scott, W. Fratcher &amp; M. Ascher, Trusts (5th Ed. 2006) \u00a7 4.5, pp. 209-15; cf. <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>246 Conn. 359, 370, 370-71 n.10, 716 A.2d 92 (1998) (if testamentary instrument is clear and unambiguous, testator\u2019s intent is to be determined: \u201c[1] from the language of the will itself; and [2] without resort to extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent\u201d). \u201cIf a [trust instrument] is unambiguous within its four comers, intent of the parties is a question of law requiring plenary review. . . . Where the language of the [trust instmment] is clear and unambiguous, the [instmment] is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity .... Similarly, any ambiguity in a [trust instmment] must emanate from the language used . . . rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>280 Conn. 605, 612, 909 A.2d 947 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">If, however, the tmst instrument \u201cis an incomplete expression of the settlor\u2019s intention or if the meaning of the writing is ambiguous or otherwise uncertain, evidence of the circumstances and other indications of the transferor\u2019s intent are admissible to complete the terms of the writing or to clarify or ascertain its meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 21, comment (a), p. 322; accord 1 A. Scott, W. Fratcher &amp; M. Ascher, supra, \u00a7 4.5, pp. 209-15. Under such circumstances, the question of the decedent\u2019s intent to create a trust and to impose upon herself the duties of a trustee is a question of fact subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard. Cf. <em>HLO Land Ownership Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>248 Conn. 350, 357, 727 A.2d 1260 (1999) (\u201c[a]bsent a statutory warranty or definitive contract language, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract, being a determination of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact that is subject to reversal on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>appeal only if it is clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In the present case, we conclude that the trust instrument is ambiguous with respect to whether the decedent intended to create a trust and to impose upon herself the enforceable duties of a trustee. Cf. <em>Enviro Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>AIU Ins. Co., </em>279 Conn. 194, 200, 901 A.2d 666 (2006) (\u201cwhether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court\u201d). Although the instrument plainly states that the decedent intended to hold the Crane Road property in trust, it also contains the following language, \u201cbeing of sound mind to wit I make this my last private verbal act,\u201d which imports ambiguity into the trust instrument.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA verbal act is an out-of-court statement that causes certain legal consequences, or, stated differently, it is an utterance to which the law attaches duties and liabilities . . . [and] is admissible nonhearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the facts contained therein.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>271 Conn. 218, 255, 856 A.2d 917 (2004). Of particular significance for purposes of our analysis, however, is not the decedent\u2019s characterization of the execution of the trust instrument as a verbal act, which appears to have little or no bearing on her intent to create a trust or to impose upon herself the duties of a trustee, but, rather, her characterization of it as her <em>last act. </em>In light of this language, it is unclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>whether the decedent intended to create a presently enforceable trust, with all of the rights, duties and responsibilities that such a trust entails, or whether she intended to execute a testamentary document, which would become effective and enforceable only after her death. See <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co., </em>110 Conn. 22, 28-29, 147 A. 139 (1929) (\u201cThe essential characteristic of an instrument testamentary in its nature is, that it operates only upon and by reason of the death of the maker. Up to that time it is ambulatory. By its execution the maker has parted with no rights and divested himself of no modicum of his estate, and per contra no rights have accrued to and no estate has vested in any other person. The death of the maker establishes for the first time the character of the instrument. . . . Upon the other hand, to the creation of a valid express trust it is essential that some estate or interest should be conveyed to the trustee, and, when the instrument creating the trust is other than a will, that estate or interest must pass immediately.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Because the declaration of trust is ambiguous, we review the trial court\u2019s finding concerning the decedent\u2019s intent under the clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201cThe law governing [our] limited appellate review is clear. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we give great deference to its findings. ... In reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . Instead, we make every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 526, 558-59, 893 A.2d 389 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Although communication of intent to create a trust and delivery of the trust instrument are \u201cnot essential to the existence of a trust [they are] of great importance in determining the real intent of the alleged declarant.\u201d 90 C.J.S., Trusts \u00a7 66, p. 192 (2002). This is because a settlor\u2019s failure to communicate his or her intent and to deliver the trust instrument \u201cis some indication of the absence of a final and definitive intention to create a trust.\u201d 1 A. Scott, W. Fratcher &amp; M. Ascher, supra, \u00a7 4.2.2, p. 189; see also <em>Aronian </em>v. <em>Asadoorian, </em>315 Mass. 274, 276, 52 N.E.2d 397 (1943) (when trust instrument is ambiguous \u201clack of notice [has] substantial probative force upon the question of intent\u201d); accord 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 13, comment (c), p. 209 (although \u201c[t]he intention to create a trust may be sufficiently manifested by a settlor without handing an instrument evidencing that intention or otherwise communicating the intention to the trustee, the beneficiary, or any other person . . . [t]he failure of a property owner ... to communicate such an intention to anyone . . . [such as the failure to hand anyone the instrument an owner had drawn up declaring an intention to hold certain property in trust], is some, but not conclusive, evidence that the property owner had not arrived at a definite, present intention to create a trust\u201d); G. Bogert, Trusts (6th Ed. 1987) \u00a7 23, p. 63 (\u201c[w]hile giving another control of the [trust] document is the most usual and natural method of showing an intent that the instrument take effect, this state of mind may also be shown by other means ... or by acting toward another as if he were the beneficiary of the trust described in the instrument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the decedent informed neither the beneficiaries of the trust nor any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>one else that she had intended to hold the Crane Road property in trust. Additionally, it is undisputed that she never delivered the trust instrument or the quitclaim deed to the beneficiaries or any other third party, and that she never recorded the trust instrument or the quitclaim deed on the town land records. These undisputed facts amply support the trial court\u2019s finding that the decedent had not arrived at a final and definitive intention to create a trust and to impose upon herself the enforceable duties of a trustee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The plaintiff claims, however, that the trial court\u2019s factual finding was clearly erroneous because \u201cdifferent uncontested evidence clearly shows [the decedent\u2019s] intention to [create a trust and to impose upon herself] the duties of a trustee.\u201d In support of this claim, the plaintiff points out that the decedent acted in a manner consistent with the interests of the beneficiaries during her lifetime by preserving the trust instrument and quitclaim deed and by maintaining the Crane Road property. We reject this claim because the trier of fact \u201cis not required to draw only those inferences consistent with one view of the evidence, but may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 312, 838 A.2d 135 (2004); see also <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>Schaller Subaru, Inc., </em>supra, 277 Conn. 558-59 (\u201cIn reviewing factual findings, [w]e do not examine the record to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>whether the [court] could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . .

The rule is premised upon the idea that when the parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed, that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their understanding, was reduced to writing. After this, to permit oral testimony, or prior or contemporaneous conversation, or circumstances, or usages [etc.], in order to learn what was intended, or to contradict what is written, would be dangerous and unjust in the extreme. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cThe parol evidence rule does not of itself, therefore, forbid the presentation of parol evidence, that is, evidence outside the four comers of the contract concerning matters governed by an integrated contract, but forbids only the use of such evidence to vary or contradict the terms of such a contract. Parol evidence offered solely to vary or contradict the written terms of an integrated contract is, therefore, legally irrelevant. When offered for that purpose, it is inadmissible not because it is parol evidence, but because it is irrelevant. By implication, such evidence may still be admissible if relevant (1) to explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument; (2) to prove a collateral oral agreement which does not vary the terms of the writing; (3) to add a missing term in a writing which indicates on its face that it does not set forth the complete agreement; or (4) to show mistake or fraud. . . . These recognized exceptions are, of course, only examples of situations where the evidence (1) does not vary or contradict the contract\u2019s terms, or (2) may be considered because the contract has been shown not to be integrated; or (3) tends to show that the contract should be defeated or altered on the equitable ground that relief can be had against any deed or contract in writing founded in mistake or fraud.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>HLO Land Ownership Associates Ltd.

The decedent\u2019s understanding of the nature of a \u2018verbal act\u2019 is probably less important than the fact that she constitutes this document as her <em>last </em>such act.
