Order to show cause was made, with <em>interim </em>restraint, why the consummation of the sale should not be restrained <em>pendente lite.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-11\">\u201cObviously such restraint <em>pendente lite </em>is necessary to preserve the subject-matter of the litigation and this is conceded. It is contended, however, by defendant that the questions raised in the present litigation are clearly <em>res adjudicata </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and that hence complainant is not entitled to litigate them again nor to have the consummation of the sale restrained for that sole purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-4\">\u201cThe records offered on this issue are voluminous. Consideration thereof leaves the court still in doubt that the issue raised by the present bill has been concluded in the previous litigation; and it necessarily results that the <em>interim </em>restraint will be continued until final hearing.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-5\"><em>Mr. Dougal Herr {Mr. William A.
