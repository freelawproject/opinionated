Braunstein, deceased, et al., defendants-respondents.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b217-6\">[Submitted May 26th, 1933.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3y\">Decided September 27th, 1933.]</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-11\">On appeal from a decree of the court of chancery advised by Vice-Chancellor Ingersoll, who filed the following opinion :</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-12\">\u201cThe complainant, widow of Samuel M. Braunstein, files her bill praying for the specific performance of a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>alleged to have been made between the complainant and her husband, in his lifetime, for the payment of certain alimony and other costs and expenses. The allegations of the bill of complaint are that:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-4\">\u201cComplainant and said Braunstein were married in 1921 and lived together until about January 28th, 1928, at which time Braunstein separated himself from the complainant and lived apart until his death, which occurred on November 14th, 1928; that in April, 1928, the complainant filed her bill praying that her husband be ordered to provide her with suitable 'support and maintenance; that an answer was filed to said bill and the cause being brought to issue, same was referred to one of the vice-chancellors; that the cause was duly brought on for a hearing and the production of witnesses and taking of proof was entered upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">\u201cIt was stated in open court that a probability existed that a settlement of the differences might be effected upon a conference of the parties, and the said hearing was continued for a period of two weeks. Said conference proceeded with the result that on or about the 13th day of November, 1928, an oral agreement was entered into whereby Braunstein agreed to pay his wife a certain sum of money, to be paid in equal monthly installments, commencing the 1st day of December, 1928, and to deposit certain shares of stock sufficient to provide from dividends thereon such sum so agreed to be paid (said stock being held by Samuel M. Braunstein, Incorporated, a corporation of the State of Delaware), and that said Braunstein should also pay the solicitor of said complainant a certain sum. The said agreement having been concluded, was intended to be incorporated in a final decree of this court, to be entered in said cause then pending between the parties. This decree was never entered because of the fact that Braunstein died upon the day of the completion of said contract and before the decree could be presented to the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">\u201cMotion is .now made to strike the bill because the bill displays no equity, for eleven separate reasons, the sixth of which reads: \u2018Upon the face of the bill, the alleged agreement was not to become effective until reduced to writing, or upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>entry of a final decree in the maintenance suit, neither of which occurred.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\">\u201cIt is apparent upon the allegations of the bill that the agreement was \u2018intended to be incorporated in a final decree of this court, to be entered in said cause then pending between the parties to said agreement.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">\u201cThe question to be considered is, therefore, was there an agreement between the parties upon which specific performance could be decreed? No other construction can be made of the language in the bill than that the parties had agreed that they would consent to the entering of a final decree in this court embodying the terms of the'agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">\u201cVice-Chancellor Berry, in <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Dennison, 98 N. J. Eq. 230; affirmed, 99 N. J. Eq. 883 </em>(at <em>p. 237), </em>said: \u2018Our Divorce act vests in the court of chancery the power to order suitable support and maintenance for the wife, and \u201cfrom time to time to make such further orders touching the same as shall be just and equitable.\u201d This power and authority has been jealously guarded by this court, in consequence of which it has uniformly been held that all such agreements are subject to approval or modification by this court; and no such agreements, unless fair, equitable and just, will be approved or enforced. But they have just as uniformly been enforced when couched in such terms as to meet the court\u2019s approval. <em>Calame </em>v. <em>Calame, 25 N. J. Eq. 548; Buttlar </em>v. <em>Buttlar, 70 N. J. Eq. 675; Buttlar </em>v. <em>Buttlar, 71 N. J. Eq. 671; Hal-stead </em>v. <em>Halstead, 74 N. J. Eq. 596; Rennie </em>v. <em>Rennie, 85 N. J. Eq. 1; Boehm </em>v. <em>Boehm, 88 N. J. Eq. 74; Hollingshead </em>v. <em>Hollingshead, 91 N. J. Eq. 261.\u2019</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">\u201cChancellor Walker, in <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, 99 N. J. Eq. 461 </em>(at <em>p. 469), </em>said: \u2018It is one thing for a wife to express her willingness to accept a certain sum in lieu of alimony, and quite another for the court to ascertain and adjudge that the sum is suitable and adequate for her support.\u2019 And again <em>Dreier </em>v. <em>Dreier, 101 N. J. Eq. 342, </em>the chancellor said (at <em>p. 345) : </em>\u2018This whole proceeding, however, is irregular, as it is required that the provisions for the wife (on settlement) should be found to be suitable after the court has looked into the arrangements and other surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ings, and that it is for her benefit and found to be adequate, where it appears the parties have agreed upon a settlement as to permanent alimony for the future support of the wife. See <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Greenberg, 99 N. J. Eq. 461, 469. </em>This has not been done. No appeal has been made to the court to investigate this matter, as required by the cases; but a decree, as mentioned, has been handed to the court and it is asked to pass it <em>pro forma. </em>This, of course, it will not do.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-4\">\u201cThis contract was not approved by this court, and by reason of the death of the defendant, it can never be approved by this court, nor can any decree be entered therein. Suits for divorce and maintenance are abated by the death of either party before the entry of a final decree, and a decree entered after such death will be vacated. <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, 82 N. J. Eq. 395.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">\u201cWithout considering, therefore, the other points raised for the motion, the bill must be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>Mr. Robert H. McOarter, </em>for the complainant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-7\"><em>Messrs. Dole \u00a1&amp; Dole, </em>for the defendants-respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The decree appealed from will be affirmed, for the reasons expressed in the opinion filed in the court below by Vice-Chancellor Ingersoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">A further reason tending to support dismissal of the bill is that at least one party necessary to the granting of the full relief sought was not in court. It appears by the allegations of the bill that a corporation, namely, S. M. Braunstein, Incorporated, held and still holds the capital stock of the Boardwalk Realty Company which, in sufficient quantity to produce in dividends a sum equal to $10,000 yearly, was to be deposited with the Guarantee Trust Company of Atlantic City. S. M. Braunstein, Incorporated, is not a party to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chief-Justice, Thenchabd, Paeicee, Case, Bodine, Donges, BEehee, Van Buskiek, Kays, Hetfield, Deae, Wells, Dill, JJ. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
