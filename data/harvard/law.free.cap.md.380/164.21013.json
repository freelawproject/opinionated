Jones, respondent, following a driving incident where respondent refused to submit to a chemical breath test. On October 12, 2002, respondent was forcibly stopped by officers following a police chase where respondent attempted to drive his car the wrong way on Interstate Route 95 toward the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Respondent, who failed field sobriety tests, was issued an Order of Suspension, pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for refusing to take a chemical breath test to determine his amount of alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Respondent contested this suspension at an administrative show cause hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), to whom the Motor Vehicle Administration (hereinafter, the \u201cAdministration\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d), petitioner, had delegated final administrative decision-making authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>in such cases, pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1. Following a hearing, the ALJ found that respondent had violated \u00a7 16-205.1 and respondent\u2019s Maryland driving privileges were suspended by the Administration for 120 days. Respondent sought judicial review of the Agency\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The Circuit Court reversed the Agency\u2019s decision and vacated the 120-day suspension of respondent\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Administration then filed a Petition for Writ of Certio-rari to this Court and on October 9, 2003, this Court granted the petition. <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Jones, </em>377 Md. 275, 833 A.2d 31 (2003). In its brief, the Administration presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cDid the circuit court err in reversing an administrative suspension decision upon its own finding of facts and requiring that the MVA prove a suspected drunk driver was asked to take a chemical breath test within two hours of his apprehension, where the implied consent statute Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f) does not impose such a requirement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We answer the Administration\u2019s question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. We hold that the text of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i) is clear and unambiguous and limits the issues to be considered by an ALJ in a suspension hearing to the six enumerated issues of \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i)(l\u20146). As the issue of whether an arresting officer must advise and request a chemical breath test from a suspected drunk driver within two hours of the driver\u2019s apprehension is not listed within the \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) factors, the ALJ did not have to consider that issue when determining the findings of fact and conclusions of law resulting in the suspension of respondent\u2019s driving privileges by the Administration for refusal to take the chemical breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On October 12, 2002, Officer Blair of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police observed a Ford Explorer, driven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>by respondent, facing sideways across the northbound traffic lanes of Interstate 95 (1-95) at mile marker 56.2, near the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Officer Blair proceeded to pull his cruiser behind the vehicle and activated his lights and siren. Respondent made a U-turn from his position and proceeded to drive south in the northbound lane of Interstate Route 95 in the direction of the Fort McHenry toll booth plaza. He was pursued by the officer. During the chase, respondent veered in front of several oncoming vehicles. At approximately 1:59 p.m., other officers, including Officer W.R. Morningstar of the Maryland Transportation Police, were called to assist in apprehending respondent. According to the Statement of Probable Cause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed by Officer Morningstar, respondent finally stopped his vehicle after another officer, Officer Grimm, \u201cstood in the roadway causing the Explorer to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The Statement of Probable Cause further stated that, after respondent stopped his vehicle, Officer Morningstar \u201cobserved the operator [respondent] stepping out of the vehicle and attempting to walk to the rear of the vehicle. The operator kept his hand on the vehicle to steady himself and when he reached the rear, he sat down on the bumper because he was having problems standing on his own\u201d (alteration added). During the course of the stop, Officer Morningstar smelled the odor of alcohol on respondent\u2019s breath and observed respondent\u2019s poor coordination. He also noted that respondent performed poorly on, and thus failed, the sobriety field tests administered during the stop. The officers on the scene believed that respondent had been driving his vehicle while impaired or under the influence of alcohol due to respondent\u2019s driving behavior, his poor performance on the field tests and the officers\u2019 observations during the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Officer Morningstar then placed respondent in a patrol car and, according to the officer, respondent was read his DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form at that time. After being read his rights, respondent stated that he would refuse all chemical breath sobriety tests. The Statement of Probable Cause indicated that respondent\u2019s refusal of the test occurred shortly after he was placed in an officer\u2019s patrol car, but it did not indicate the exact time of the refusal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent, however, did not actually sign the DR-15 advice form until 4:40 p.m., which acknowledged in writing his refusal to take the breath test. Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, Officer Morningstar issued respondent an Order of Suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Pursuant to his rights under \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(v)(l), respondent requested an administrative \u201chearing to show cause why [respondent\u2019s] driver\u2019s license should not be suspended concerning the refusal to take the [chemical breath] test\u201d (alterations added). On December 12, 2002, a hearing was conducted in front of an ALJ at the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Administration presented several documents at the hearing which were admitted into evidence by the ALJ, including the DR-15A \u201cOfficer Certification and Order of Suspension,\u201d the Statement of Probable Cause and the respondent-signed DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form acknowledging respondent\u2019s refusal to take the chemical breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Respondent did not testify or offer any evidence during the hearing. Respondent, however, argued that he had not b\u00e9en properly advised by Officer Morningstar of the ramifications of a refusal to take the chemical breath test. Respondent contended, and the Circuit Court found, that the incident occurred at 1:59 p.m. because that was the time Officer Morningstar listed on the Statement of Probable Cause as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>time he was called to assist with the situation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondent also asserted that over two hours had passed before he was advised about and asked to take the chemical breath test because 4:40 p.m. was the time recorded next to respondent\u2019s and Officer Morningstar\u2019s signatures on the. DR-15 \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form. As a result, respondent argued that he was not asked to take a chemical breath test, nor was he read his \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d form in a timely manner, <em>i.e., </em>within two hours of his apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The ALJ found that respondent\u2019s argument was only relevant in a criminal prosecution. The ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cThe case law cited by [respondent] pertains to criminal action. This is an administrative proceeding. The two hour limitation on alcohol tests that you\u2019ve cited in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code is not applicable in administrative hearings----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cThe other point is that this individual made an election to refuse to take the test. I don\u2019t think that a dismissal or a no action in this matter is appropriate or warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201c... [T]his is an administrative proceeding not a criminal proceeding and the time frame is not something that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>looked at in administrative proceedings.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The AL J found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u201cAfter considering the evidence ... presented in this case, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that the police officers who stopped and detained [respondent] had reasonable grounds to believe that [respondent] was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol based on the fact that on October 12, 2002, the investigating ... police officer observed [respondent] driver make a U-turn on Interstate Route 95 and drive into oncoming traffic forcing other traffic to take evasive action to avoid collisions. [Respondent] stopped his vehicle only after a police officer stood in front of his vehicle. Police officers detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on [respondent\u2019s] breath. [Respondent] needed to hold onto the guardrail and his vehicle to maintain balance while out of the vehicle. [Respondent] performed poorly on or failed field sobriety exercises that were administered to him. I also find that the police fully advised [respondent] driver of administrative sanctions to be imposed as evidence by a review of ... the [signed] DR-15 [form]. And that [respondent] driver refused to take a chemical test for intoxication. I conclude that [respondent] has violated Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation [Article].\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The Agency then suspended respondent\u2019s privilege to drive in Maryland for 120 days as provided for in \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l)(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Respondent sought judicial review of the Agency\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County and that court heard the case on July 14, 2003. On July 16, 2003, the Circuit Court issued an Order reversing the decision of the Agency and vacating the 120-day suspension of respondent\u2019s Maryland driving privileges. The Circuit Court held that the Administration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u201chad the burden to prove that [respondent] was offered an alcohol concentration test within the two-hour statutory limitation and that [respondent] refused it. The requirement is clear and unambiguous, and it equally applies to all persons who are stopped for suspected driving while under the influence of alcohol and all police officers who arrest them. Since there was no evidence that [respondent] was offered the test within the two-hour statutory limitation, the [Circuit] Court will reverse and vacate the decision of the ALJ and the 120 day license suspension.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, commonly known as Maryland\u2019s Implied Consent Law, provides the statutory structure for the suspension of a suspected drunk motorist\u2019s driving privileges where that driver refuses to submit to a chemical breath test for intoxication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 16-205.1(a)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201c(2) Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) of the Transportation Article, an officer detaining a suspected drunk driver must advise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>suspect of certain rights enumerated in that subsection and may not compel that suspect to take a chemical breath test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section \u00a7 16-205.1(b) further discusses the exact procedures an officer must follow if the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect the driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including detaining the suspect, requesting a chemical breath and/or blood test and advising the suspect of administrative sanctions for refusal to take a requested test. If, as occurred in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the suspect refuses to take the chemical breath test after being properly advised, \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3) directs the officer to confiscate the suspect\u2019s driver\u2019s license, serve an order of suspension, issue a temporary license and inform the suspect of the suspect\u2019s right to a hearing and of the possible administrative sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The procedure regarding such an administrative hearing is set forth by \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The specific issues to be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>ered by an ALJ during the suspension hearing are enumerated by \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c(7)(i) At a hearing under this section, the person has the rights described in \u00a7 12-206[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of this article, but <em>at the hearing the only issues shall be:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">1. Whether the police officer who stops or detains a person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">2. Whether there was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">3. Whether the police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed, including the fact that a person who refuses to take the test is ineligible for modification of a s\u00faspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) and (2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">4. Whether the person refused to take the test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>5. Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">6. If the hearing involves disqualification of a commercial driver\u2019s license, whether the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">(ii) The sworn statement of the police officer and of the test technician or analyst shall be prima facie evidence of a test refusal or a test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing.\u201d [Footnote added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The central issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) implicitly requires that, in a \u00a7 16-205.1 suspension hearing, the Administration must also establish that the arresting officers satisfied the requirements of the provisions of \u00a7 10-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">As a \u00a7 16-205.1 suspension hearing for refusal to submit to a chemical breath test and its possible administrative sanctions are purely statutory in nature, we look to the well-settled canons of statutory interpretation in making our holding. It has long been settled by this Court that \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>364 Md. 354, 364, 772 A.2d 1240, 1245-46 (2001) (quoting <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 57, 763 A.2d 136, 139 (2000) (internal citation omitted)). First and foremost, a court should thoroughly examine the plain language of the statute when attempting to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intentions. <em>Holbrook, </em>364 Md. at 364, 772 A.2d at 1246; <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. at 57, 763 A.2d at 139. If the statutory language in question is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then this Court \u201cwill give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Pak v. Hoang, </em>378 Md. 315, 323, 835 A.2d 1185, 1189 (2003) (quoting <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003) (internal citation omitted)). This Court, however, will not add or delete words from the statute. <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 427 (2002). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We will look \u201cbeyond the statute\u2019s plain language in discerning the legislative intent\u201d only where the statutory language is ambiguous. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc., </em>377 Md. 471, 483, 833 A.2d 1014, 1021 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Administration argues that the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) clearly sets out the <em>\u201conly\u201d </em>factors that should be considered by an ALJ when deciding whether the Administration should suspend a motorist\u2019s driving privileges for refusal to submit to a chemical breath test and that the Legislature did not intend to include any additional issues. The Administration further argues that the Legislature did not intend for \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i) to contain technical loopholes to benefit suspected drunk drivers because the purpose for enacting the implied consent law was to encourage drivers to take the test and to protect the safety of the public. <em>See Motor Vehicle Administration v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 373, 739 A.2d 58, 68 (1999). The Administration additionally argues that the statute in question was not enacted to protect the suspected drunk driver\u2019s due process rights, but to obtain the best evidence of the driver\u2019s impairment to get that driver off of the State\u2019s roadways in order to protect public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Respondent, however, contends that, regardless of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i)\u2019s limiting language, the fact that \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) cross references \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309 of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> adds implicit issues to an ALJ\u2019s suspension hearing determinations. In addition, respondent argues that \u00a7 16-205.1(f) must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 16-205.1(g), which sets out the procedure for a suspected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>drunk driver\u2019s withdrawal of an initial refusal to submit to the chemical breath test, a withdrawal that must be unequivocally given within two hours of the suspect\u2019s apprehension. Respondent argues that to not include the two hour requirement within a suspension hearing would render \u00a7 16-205.1(g) meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the language of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i) of the Transportation Article is clear and unambiguous on its face. The section states that at a suspension hearing under subsection (f) \u201cthe <em>only </em>issues shall be\u201d the six enumerated issues in the section (emphasis added). The word \u201conly\u201d is defined as \u201cno one or nothing more besides; solely or exclusively ... no more than ... merely.\u201d <em>The Oxford American College Dictionary </em>953 (Putnam 2002). It is a limiting word. When used as it is in \u00a7 I6-205.1(f)(7)(i), <em>i.e., </em>preceding a list of several factors to be considered, it is used to exclude all other possible factors. If the Legislature intended the AL J to consider whether the officers requested the chemical breath test within two hours of his apprehension, it would have included a seventh factor under (f)(7)(i). In providing for administrative sanctions, the Legislature appears to be concerned solely with the issue of whether the refusal was <em>informed </em>and not with the lapse of time between the suspect\u2019s apprehension and the test being requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Further support for this interpretation is shown in the requirements of \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(i), which directs the suspension of a suspect\u2019s license if the ALJ makes the following four findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c1. The police officer who stopped or detained the person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>2. There was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">3. The police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed, including the fact that a person who refuses to take the test is ineligible for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license under subsection (n)(l) and (2) of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">4. A. The person refused to take the test; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">B. A test to determine alcohol concentration was taken and the test result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Legislature did not include any reference to whether the officer requested the test within two hours of the suspect\u2019s apprehension in this provision. As the issue was omitted from both (f)(7) and (f)(8), it is clear that the Legislature did not intend that issue to be a factor for the ALJ\u2019s consideration in a license suspension hearing where the suspect refused to take a chemical breath test. Moreover, the provision requiring that a withdrawal of a refusal be within two hours of the suspect\u2019s apprehension<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> would only be relevant if, in fact, a withdrawal of refusal was made or attempted. None was attempted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">This plain language interpretation limiting the (f)(7)(i) factors to those specifically enumerated in the statute is in line with the Legislature\u2019s intent that \u00a7 16-205.1 \u201cwas written to provide, in cases of drunk driving, \u2018a swift penalty which is separate from any criminal penalties that may be imposed for the driving offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lytle, </em>374 Md. at 62, 821 A.2d at 76-77 (internal citation omitted). We have also stated that the Legislature intended \u201cto create procedures that would be an expedient and effective deterrent and sanction against drunk driving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 821 A.2d at 78. Extracts from the bill file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>for House Bill 556 of 1989 \u201cexplicitly indicate an intent to limit the issues considered at resultant administrative hearings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, expediently and efficiently suspending the Maryland driving privileges of suspected drunk drivers for failing to submit to a chemical breath test also serves the legislative purpose in designing \u00a7 16-205.1 \u201cfor the protection of the public and not primarily for the protection of the accused,\u201d <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 373, 739 A.2d at 68 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 464, 597 A.2d 939, 943 (1991) (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The plain language of Md.Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i) of the Transportation Article clearly does not include any time related issues pertaining to the chemical breath test or the DR-15 advice form as the word \u201conly\u201d limits the issues to be considered in a hearing to suspend a suspected drunk driver\u2019s driving privileges for refusing a chemical breath test to those six issues enumerated within the statute\u2019s subsection. As we may not add or delete any language from a statute, <em>see Gillespie, </em>370 Md. at 222, 804 A.2d at 427, we hold that the two hour requirement proffered by respondent and imposed by the Circuit Court is not relevant in suspension hearings pursuant to \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(i) of the Transportation Article. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE AGENCY.

The Statement of Probable Cause was included in the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>due to the fact that the arresting officer submitted it to the Motor Vehicle Administration along with the forms required to be sent to the Motor Vehicle Administration following a drinking and driving incident pursuant to Md.Code (1977, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 16.205.l(b)(3)(vii). Thus, the administrative record in the case <em>sub judice </em>contains substantial detail about the incident occurring on October 12, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">.

In the alternative to the Administration\u2019s main argument that the plain language of \u00a7 16-205.l(f)(7)(i) does not require proof the chemical test request was refused within two hours of the suspect's apprehension, the Administration additionally argues that the Circuit Court erred when it made several findings of fact not made by the AU in derogation of our holding that \u201c[a] court reviewing a decision of an administrative agency generally is limited to determining whether there was substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings of fact and whether the agency\u2019s conclusions of law were correct.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Administration v.
