Shirley R. Brookins, Steven P. Martin and Rashida S. Hogg, the respondents, were charged, by indictment, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, with violating \u00a7 13-209, respondent Brookins by paying for walk around services provided by third parties on election day, and respondents Martin and Hogg by conspiring to violate the section and incurring an obligation to pay for walk around services provided on election day. More particularly, the State of Maryland, by the State Prosecutor, the petitioner, alleged that respondent Brookins, the operator of a temporary employment agency in the District of Columbia, used campaign funds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Republican nominees for Governor and Lieutenant Governor (hereinafter referred to as \u201cEhrlich/Steele\u201d) to hire and pay approximately 200 residents of a homeless shelter located in the District to provide walk around services on the general election day; that she transported them to the polls, where those walk around services, i.e. accosting voters outside the polls, communicating a voting preference, and distributing Ehrlich/Steele campaign literature, were performed; and for which the respondent Brookins paid each worker the following day. The State alleged that respondents Martin and Hogg, hired Maryland residents, mostly high school and college students, and offered them cash amounts ranging from $80.00 to $110.00 to render walk around services on the day of the election, including distributing Ehrlich/Steele campaign materials, communicating to voters accosted outside the polls a voting preference and advocating for the election of Robert Ehrlich for Governor and Michael Steele for Lieutenant Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The respondents filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Motions to Dismiss the indictments on the grounds that \u00a7 13-209 was unconstitutional in that it violated their First Amendment free speech rights both on its face and as applied in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Circuit Court granted the respondents\u2019 motions, holding \u201c\u00a7 13-209 is facially unconstitutional\u201d and, thus, violative of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Specifically, the court concluded that the State\u2019s enunciated interest in curtailing the appearance of \u201cundue influence and vote buying\u201d was not so compelling or of sufficient \u201cmagnitude to warrant the curtailment of the Defendants\u2019 (and all others) freedom of speech----\u201d Pointing out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>that \u201cMaryland already has a statute that addresses vote buying (\u00a7 16-201)\u201d and, thus, provides a remedy for the actions targeted by \u00a7 13-209, the Court also was of the view that the statute \u201clack[ed] detailed parameters\u201d and, in any event, was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet the compelling State interest. Having determined that the statute was facially unconstitutional, the court declined to address the other issues raised in the case, including its constitutionality under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The State timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and, simultaneously, filed with this Court a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. We issued the writ of <em>certiorari </em>before there were any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court. <em>State v. Brookins, </em>374 Md. 582, 824 A.2d 58 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On appeal, the respondents argued that, because the measure limits speech, the determination of whether it meets constitutional muster turns on the time-honored test of whether the State law is \u201cnarrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest\u201d to survive strict scrutiny. With regard to that standard, the respondents asserted that \u00a7 13-209 is unconstitutional because it neither enunciates a compelling state interest nor is sufficiently narrowly-tailored, and, thus, it impermis-sibly violates their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The State argued that \u00a7 13-209 is constitutional. In support of its position, the State first argued that this Court should not apply strict scrutiny in its analysis of whether or not \u00a7 13-209 is unconstitutional. To the contrary, the State asserted that we should employ a less stringent standard because the provision is, at its heart, about the conduct of spending money, and only incidentally affects speech. The State alternatively argued that the provision is constitutional even under the strict scrutiny analysis because 1) the law was enacted to meet a compelling state interest, \u201cto prevent real or apparent corruption of the electoral process\u201d, and 2) the provision was narrowly tailored to accomplish that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Following oral argument, the Court issued, on September 4, 2003, an Order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, with the reasons therefor to be set forth in an opinion to follow. <em>State v. Brookins, </em>376 Md. 697, 831 A.2d 453 (2003). We now give our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech____\u201d That right, \u201camong the fundamental personal rights and liberties[, is] secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgement by a State.\u201d <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 95, 60 S.Ct. 736, 740, 84 L.Ed. 1093, 1098 (1940). \u201cDiscussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of the system of government established by our Constitution.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 14, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, 685 (1976). Accordingly, as the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201cthe First Amendment \u2018has its fullest and most urgent application\u2019 to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d <em>Eu v. San Francisco Cty. Democratic Central Comm., </em>489 U.S. 214, 223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271, 282 (1989) (quoting <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d 35, 41 (1971)). Further, [t]he First Amendment affords the greatest protection to political expression in order \u201c \u2018to assure the unfettered exchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 14, 96 S.Ct. at 632, 46 L.Ed.2d at 685 (quoting <em>Roth v.

The <em>Buckley </em>Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cAlthough First Amendment protections are not confined to \u2018the exposition of ideas,\u2019 <em>Winters v.

Grant </em>makes clear that petition circulation is \u201ccore political speech\u201d for which the First Amendment protection is \u201cat its zenith.\u201d 486 U.S. at 425, 108 S.Ct. at 1894, 100 L.Ed.2d at 438. The Supreme Court has also recognized, as we have seen, that \u201cthe constitutional guarantee has its fullest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,\u201d <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v.

Consequently, the actions that make up the walk around services that \u00a7 13-209 proscribes on election day are no less \u201ccore political speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Particularly, where a statute restricts or burdens political speech, the State has the burden of showing that there is a sufficiently compelling reason, unrelated to the content of the speech, for enacting the legislation. <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. 191, 196-98, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1850-51, 119 L.Ed.2d 5, 12-15 (1992). Furthermore, the State must prove that the statute is narrowly tailored to effectuate that compelling interest and is \u201cthe least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.\u201d <em>Id., U.S. v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Group, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 1887, 146 L.Ed.2d 865, 879 (2000) (quoting <em>Sable Communications of California, Inc. v.

Stated differently, the State\u2019s burden is met if it establishes that the statute remedies the conduct aimed at without excessively abridging the speech of those not engaged in the targeted action. <em>Fed.

Section 1-40-110, which made it a felony to pay petition circulators to obtain the requisite number of signatures, <em>id. </em>at 417, 108 S.Ct. at 1889, 100 L.Ed.2d at 431, was one of the provisions of a State law that permitted voters to place propositions, i.e. proposals for new laws or amendments to the Constitution, on the ballot through an initiative process, so long as they were able to obtain the signatures of at least five percent of the qualified voters on an initiative petition within a six-month period. <em>Id., </em>486 U.S. at 416, 108 S.Ct. at 1889, 100 L.Ed.2d at 431. The appellees, proponents of an amendment to the state constitution, paid individuals to help obtain enough signatures to have their proposed amendment placed on the ballot and were subsequently charged with violating the State law. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado held that the statute was constitutional, <em>id. </em>at 418-19, 108 S.Ct. at 1890, 100 L.Ed.2d at 432-33, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, sitting <em>en banc, </em>reversed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 419, 108 S.Ct. at 1890-91, 100 L.Ed.2d at 433, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201cthe effect of the statute\u2019s absolute ban on compensation of solicitors is clear.

In short, like the campaign expen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>diture limitations struck down- in <em>Buckley, </em>the Colorado statute imposes a direct restriction which \u2018necessarily reduces the quantity of expression.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Grant v. Meyer, </em>828 F.2d 1446, 1453-1454 (10th Cir.1987) quoting <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 634, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, 687 (1976)). Furthermore, the Appellate Court rejected the State\u2019s justifications of the measure: \u201cto prevent fraud or to protect the public from circula-tors that might be too persuasive\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 420, 108 S.Ct. at 1892, 100 L.Ed.2d at 434, and \u201cto assure that [an initiative] had a broad base of public support.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals. As an initial matter, it concluded that the provision prohibiting the use of paid petition circulators was \u201ca limitation on political expression subject to exacting scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 108 S.Ct. at 1891, 100 L.Ed.2d at 434. That is so, the Court explained, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\u201c[t]he circulation of an initiative petition of necessity involves both the expression of a desire for political change and a discussion of the merits of the proposed change. Although a petition circulator may not have to persuade potential signatories that a particular proposal should prevail to capture their signatures, he or she will at least have to persuade them that the matter is one deserving of the public scrutiny and debate that would attend its consideration by the whole electorate. This will in almost every case involve an explanation of the nature of the proposal and why its advocates support it. Thus, the circulation of a petition involves the type of interactive communication concerning political change that is appropriately described as \u201ccore political speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 421-22, 108 S.Ct. at 1891-92, 100 L.Ed.2d at 434-35. (footnotes omitted). Thus, the Court said, the issue the appellees championed was a \u201cmatter of societal concern that appellees have a right to discuss publicly without risking criminal sanctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 108 S.Ct. at 1891, 100 L.Ed.2d at 434 (citing <em>Thornhill v.

The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cThe refusal to permit appellees to pay petition circulators restricts political expression in two ways: First, it limits the number of voices who will convey the appellee\u2019s message and the hours they can speak and, therefore limits the size of the audience they can reach. Second, it makes it less likely that the appellees will garner the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the ballot, thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 422-23, 108 S.Ct. at 1892, 100 L.Ed.2d at 435-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Court rejected the appellant\u2019s contention that the statute was not overly burdensome because it allowed the appel-lees other means of political speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201cThat appellees remain free to employ other means to disseminate their ideas does not take their speech through petition circulators outside the bounds of First Amendment protection. Colorado\u2019s prohibition of paid petition circula-tors restricts access to the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse, direct one-on-one communication.

Thus, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cA restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today\u2019s mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate\u2019s increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">On the other hand, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\u201cBy contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor\u2019s ability to engage in free communication. A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying'basis for the support. The quantity of communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>cation by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing. At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor\u2019s support for the candidate. A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and issues. While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><em>Id., </em>424 U.S. at 20-21, 96 S.Ct. at 635-36, 46 L.Ed.2d at 689 (footnote omitted). In sum, in contrast to restrictions on expenditures, as to which the Court emphasized, \u201cthis Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16, 96 S.Ct. at 633, 46 L.Ed.2d at 687, the Court held that provisions restricting campaign contributions did not unjustifiably burden First Amendment freedoms. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 96 S.Ct. at 640, 46 L.Ed.2d at 693-94.

The respondents chose to meet their obligation to the campaign by paying workers to advocate for the ticket by distributing campaign materials, communicating to potential voters a voting preference and electioneering or canvassing the polls, the aim of all of which clearly was to convey a political message. As the Court in <em>Buckley </em>pointed out, the spending of money by a political candidate directly affects the ability of that candidate to disseminate his or her political message effectively. It is to prevent that very political speech that \u00a7 13-209 specifically was enacted. Indeed, that statute restricts campaign expenditures in the form of payments to individuals to provide \u201cwalk around services\u201d on election day. As defined by \u00a7 13-209, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>relevant statute, these \u201cwalk around services\u201d include the distribution of campaign materials, communicating a voting preference, and electioneering or canvassing the polling place, all of which the statute was designed to prevent, or at least has the effect of impacting. All of the activity at which the statute is aimed, in fact, directly impedes the ability of the candidate to convey his political message.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The State urges us to accept that such measures are necessary to prevent the \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d purpose of avoiding \u201ccorruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d We decline to conclude that \u00a7 13-209 is content neutral. Whether individuals may exercise their free speech rights by paying another individual to distribute his or her campaign flyers or perform other walk around services \u201cdepends entirely on whether their speech is related to a political campaign.\u201d <em>Burson v.

The historical context and background surrounding the enactment of the \u201cwalk around services\u201d statute is offered, via newspaper clippings from the 1960s and 1970s, to support the proposition that the statute was enacted to temper the then-rampant corruption and vote-buying in the electoral process.

Second, it asserts that \u201cthe prohibition applies only to those whose partisan election day activities are motivated by the potential corrupting influence of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the State submits that the statute allows candidates to pay for other political campaign activities that are less likely to be corrupt or appear corrupt, including \u201cproviding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>meals for workers, telephoning voters, transporting them to polls, and media advertising.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In <em>Burson, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee statute that restricted vote solicitation within 100 feet of the polling place. Acknowledging that the statute was a \u201cfacially content-based restriction on political speech,\u201d 504 U.S. at 198, 112 S.Ct. at 1851, 119 L.Ed.2d at 13, \u2014 rather than a restriction on the voicing of a particular viewpoint, it prohibited public discussion of an entire <em>topic </em>\u2014 id. at 197, 112 S.Ct. at 1850, 119 L.Ed.2d at 13, applying strict scrutiny, the Court held that it was necessary to serve the compelling state interests of protecting the right of the State\u2019s citizens to vote freely for the candidates of their choice and ensuring an election conducted with integrity and reliability and that it was narrowly drawn to accomplish those goals. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 112 S.Ct. at 1857-58, 119 L.Ed.2d at 21-22. Recognizing that to survive strict scrutiny, it is not enough merely to assert a compelling interest, the State \u201cmust demonstrate that its law is necessary to serve the asserted interest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 199, 112 S.Ct. at 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d at 15, it examined the evolution of election reform in this country and abroad. <em>Id. </em>at 200-06, 112 S.Ct. at 1852-55, 119 L.Ed.2d at 15-19. Following its examination, the Court summarized its findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cIn sum, an examination of the history of election regulation in this country reveals a persistent battle against two evils: voter intimidation and election fraud. After an unsuccessful experiment with an unofficial ballot system, all 50 States, together with numerous other Western democracies, settled on the same solution: a secret ballot secured in part by a restricted zone around the voting compartments. We find that this widespread and time-tested consensus demonstrates that some restricted zone is necessary in order to serve the State\u2019s compelling interests in preventing voter intimation and election fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 112 S.Ct. at 1855, 119 L.Ed.2d at 19. Thus, critical to the Court\u2019s holding was evidence of the history of the election process in the United States during the colonial era, when there were no secret ballots and voters were left open to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>flagrant bribery and intimidation, Tennessee\u2019s continual historical efforts to reform the election system to ensure the right of voters- to vote secretly and without intimidation and the consensus among the states on the need for legislation reducing voter intimidation and bribery to the extent that each of the 50 states had enacted legislation limiting access in or around polling places.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Noting that it is rare that legislation will survive strict scrutiny, the Court pronounced that case to be such a rare instance. 504 U.S. at 210, 112 S.Ct. at 1857, 119 L.Ed.2d at 22. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">\u201cHere, the State, as recognized administrator of elections, has asserted that the exercise of free speech rights conflicts with another fundamental right, the right to cast a ballot in an election free from the taint of intimation and fraud. A long history, a substantial consensus, and simple common sense show that some restricted zone around polling places is necessary to protect that fundamental right. Given the conflict between these two rights, we hold that requiring solicitors to stand 100 feet from the entrances to polling places does not constitute an unconstitutional compromise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 211, 112 S.Ct. at 1857-58, 119 L.Ed.2d at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The interest asserted by the State, to prevent real or apparent corruption of the electoral process, is a compelling one. Unlike in <em>Burson, </em>however, we are not persuaded that the State has demonstrated that \u00a7 13-209 is necessary to serve that interest or that it is narrowly drawn to achieve its asserted goals. To be sure, the State submitted news articles from the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s, concerning the practice of political clubs and/or organizations to pay for walk around services on election day. These articles included <em>inter alia, </em>an inside look at the process in one particular club and the views of certain politicians with respect to the corrupting influence and impact of the practice. The petitioner submitted these articles, which also detail the legislative focus on the practice of paying for walk-around services, and how it resulted in the enactment of Acts of 1979, Ch. 217, the direct precursor of \u00a7 13-209, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>evidence of the compelling state interest to prevent corruption and it urges this Court to rely on these articles as evidence of the legislative intent behind the enactment of \u00a7 13-209\u2019s to curb vote-buying, endorsement buying or their appearance. It asserts that the payment for walk around services, given scenarios in which candidates with large campaign budgets paid individuals to provide \u201ccampaign services,\u201d cast an ominous pall over the then-existing state of the electoral process. One article cited by the State suggested that the payment for these services actually amounted to vote-buying, ensuring that those who were hired to campaign for a given candidate would vote for that candidate on election day. <em>See </em>Michael Weis-skopf, <em>Baltimore: Politics as Usual, </em>Washington Post, September 11, 1978. The State, in addition, offers evidence that there were or are concerns about paying walk around money in other states and that, as a result, bills to prohibit the practice were introduced in several State Legislatures, including Georgia, New Jersey, South Carolina and Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">This showing does not approach either the clear history of blatant voter intimidation and coercion, offered and relied upon, in <em>Burson </em>or the widespread national consensus that Court identified as making the legislative response in that case necessary. Of course, it is not required that the showing in this case be identical to the showing in <em>Burson </em>or any other case or that there be some formulaic model for determining whether a compelling state interest has been shown or demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is required that the State \u201cmust demonstrate that its law is necessary to serve the asserted interest,\u201d <em>Burson, </em>504 U.S. at 199, 112 S.Ct. at 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d at 15. We agree with the Circuit Court, the State simply has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The State has shown neither that the statute is necessary to accomplish the stated goal nor that the statute is narrowly tailored to punish the targeted action without needlessly infringing the First Amendment rights of others. First, the State\u2019s purported interest in corruption or apparent corruption of the electoral process by prohibiting vote-buying, endorsement buying or their appearance already is sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>covered by existing statutes. Md.Code (2003) \u00a7 16-201 of the Election Law Article (derived without substantive change from Art. 33, \u00a7 16-201), imposes penalties of up to $2,500 in fines and up to 5 years imprisonment for anyone who \u201cinfluence[s] or attempts to influence a voter\u2019s voting decision through the use of force, threat, menace, intimidation, bribery, reward, or offer of reward.\u201d Md.Code (2003) \u00a7 16-203 of the Election Law Article, criminalizes interference with the vote balloting process and prohibits access to campaigners and electioneers within 100 yards of the polling place. Therefore, regarding the State\u2019s interest in preventing actual vote-buying, \u00a7 13-209 is superfluous and redundant and, thus, is not the least restrictive measure for achieving that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Moreover, we are unconvinced that there exists the appearance, not to mention the actuality, of vote-buying when a candidate pays individuals to campaign on his or her behalf on election day. Logically, in order for the payment in return for campaign services to constitute vote-buying, two things must coalesce: 1) the individual paid to campaign on behalf of the candidate must not have planned to vote for the candidate for which he or she is campaigning; and 2) as a result of payment, the campaigner must have voted for or planned to vote for the candidate. For vote-buying to be \u201capparent,\u201d the voting populace must be aware of these factors. There is no evidence that individuals paid to hand out campaign materials advocating for the Ehrlich/Steele ticket voted for, or would be more likely to vote for, those candidates as a result of being paid to perform walk around services on election day.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither is there evidence that voters would have had any knowledge that the individuals were paid to hand out leaflets. In fact, the statute does not purport to prohibit payment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>day of election, when the appearance of vote-buying would be the strongest, but it prohibits payment <em>at any time </em>or the incurring of any obligation to pay individuals for campaign services to be performed on the day of the election. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that voters would know that the campaigner was paid at all. There is also no reason to believe that voters would be aware of the paid campaigner\u2019s voting preference prior to the day of election. This Court is not willing to uphold a statute that restricts core political speech on the basis of such a speculative and unlikely, in any event, hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We also do not believe that paying individuals to hand out leaflets on election day necessarily creates the appearance that a candidate has broader-than-actual constituent support. Inherent in the conclusion that the payment of paid leaflet circulators creates an appearance of false broad-based support is the supposition that those handing out leaflets do not actually support the candidate. That conclusion, however, is not substantiated or even necessarily supported by the weight of probability; it is equally as probable that those hired to hand out leaflets do, indeed, embrace the candidate\u2019s political views, as it is that they do not, resulting, therefore, in an accurate reflection of the candidate support. To determine whether or not \u201cbroad-based\u201d support for a candidate exists in actuality, in proportion to his or her visible support, would require a court to look into the subjective intent of each campaigner and to attempt to discern the effect of any imbalance between actual support and the perceived support for the candidate on the voters. Even if the payment of paid leaflet circulators created an appearance of greater than actual candidate support, it still does not rival the apparent corruption inherent in the assumption of <em>quid pro quo </em>that arises when individuals make large campaign contributions to a candidate. The State\u2019s asserted goal of preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption does not rise to the level of a compelling state interest in light of the fact that the measure \u201crestricts access to the most effective, fundamental, and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse, direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>one-on-one communication\u201d, <em>Meyer, supra, </em>486 U.S. at 424, 108 S.Ct. at 1893, 100 L.Ed.2d at 434, and thus, it unconstitutionally infringes on freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We are not remotely convinced that the decision of a candidate to spend money conveying his or her message by hiring individuals to hand out literature one-on-one to the voters creates any greater appearance of voter support than any other election-day expenditure. The statute does not penalize a candidate who chooses to spend his money on major network advertising on the day of election, even if he pays the actors to convey their support for his candidacy. Surely, any such expenditure could conceivably lead voters to believe that a given candidate has greater support than he or she actually has, and, in the case of mass media, such a candidate reaches far more voters than volunteers handing out leaflets at the polling place. The statute in this case is not appropriately crafted to justify the restriction of political speech. In <em>Bur-son, </em>the Court recognized that because the Tennessee statute limited the prohibited electioneering zone to the 100 feet surrounding the polling place, the statute was sufficiently narrow to effectuate the goal of ensuring the right to vote free from intimidation and duress while limiting the infringement upon free speech. The statute in this case, (which, we note, purports to alleviate some of the same evils as <em>Burson: </em>the election corruption or the appearance of corruption), eliminates all paid political advocacy on the entire day of election, a day, which arguably is the most crucial for conveying a candidate\u2019s message. Accepting, as we do and as the Supreme Court does, that a candidate has the right to spend money to best convey his or her political message to the voters, the fact that the statute leaves open other avenues of advocacy does not remedy the fact that a particularly representative form of political speech, one-on-one interaction with the voters, is significantly reduced as a result of \u00a7 13-209. <em>See Meyer v. Grant, supra, </em>486 U.S. at 424, 108 S.Ct. at 1893, 100 L.Ed.2d at 436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>In effect, considering the fact that Maryland already has statutes that criminalize vote-buying and voter-interference within 100 feet of the polling place, \u00a7 13-209 addresses those areas where fraud and corruption may potentially creep into the electoral system. That justification, however, does not give the State the right to abridge speech because it paternalistieally seeks to establish a completely fraud-free atmosphere within which the electorate is exposed only to the absolute untainted truth about political candidates or their platforms. We embrace the reasoning conveyed by the Colorado Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court in <em>Meyer, supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he First Amendment is a value-free provision, whose protection is not dependent on \u2018the truth, popularity, or social utility of the ideas and beliefs which are offered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyer, </em>486 U.S. 414, 419, 108 S.Ct. 1886, 1891, 100 L.Ed.2d 425, 433 (1988) (quoting <em>Grant v.
