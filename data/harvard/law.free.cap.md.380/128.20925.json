The Commission charged respondent with violating Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1.7 (Conflict of interest),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the matter to Judge Stuart R. Berger of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Judge Berger held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that respondent had not violated any of the Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Judge Berger made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201c1. Respondent, Steven J. Potter, Esq. is 39 years old. He graduated from law school in 1989 and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1990. After completing a judicial clerkship, he began to practice law thereafter as an employee with the Law Office of Sheldon Braiterman, P.A. In February 1992, he left his employment at the Law Office of Sheldon Braiterman. From 1992-1997, the Respondent had his own practice. There is no evidence of any prior disciplinary complaints filed against the Respondent during his 13 year tenure as a member of the Maryland Bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, Esq. has been a member of the Maryland Bar since 1979. From at least 1992 to the present, Mr. Weitzman has conducted his practice as a sole practitioner. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 11. From 1992 until July 1997, Mr. Weitzman and the Respondent had offices in the same building. During this time, Mr. Weitz-man employed the Respondent as an independent contractor to work with- him on some of Mr. Weitzman\u2019s cases. Mr. Weitzman and the Respondent had fee sharing agreements during that time period. From 1992 to July 1997, Mr. Weitzman and the Respondent did not have any disputes over those fee sharing agreements. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 32.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201c3. During the period of July 1997 until on or about July 26, 2001, Mr. Potter was employed by the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman (hereinafter \u2018the law firm\u2019). There is no writing reflecting the terms of Mr. Potter\u2019s employment with the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 35. Mr. Weitzman testified that the terms of Mr. Potter\u2019s employment called for a salary of $3,500.00 a month. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 17 and Afternoon Session, p. 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201c4. In addition, the Respondent believed he was entitled to a percentage of the net proceeds, if any, from the law firm. Further, under the verbal terms of Mr. Potter\u2019s employment, the Respondent received a percentage of the fees generated by cases he worked on for the firm. When the Respondent brought a client to the law firm, he received 50% of the fee generated by that client. After the fees were deposited into the law firm\u2019s bank account, the Respondent would receive his share of the fees, less \"withholding taxes, from Mr. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 39 and Afternoon Session, p. 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">\u201c5. While employed by Mr. Weitzman, the Respondent was provided an office in which to work. Mr. Potter kept the files he was working on for the law firm in that office. Mr. Weitzman testified that the Respondent was free to remove files from the office if he needed to go to court or to take a file home. It was Mr. Weitzman\u2019s custom to retain client files while the representation was active and for at least five years thereafter. <em>See, </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 25-26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201c6. Two of the clients that the Respondent brought to the law firm were Joseph Caldart (hereinafter \u2018Caldart\u2019) and Lorrie Kazmar (hereinafter \u2018Kazmar\u2019). <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 20-22. Accordingly, Mr. Potter, not Mr. Weitz-man, brought both the Caldart and Kazmar matters to the law firm. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 36-38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201c7. The Caldart matter involved both a worker\u2019s compensation matter and a third-party claim. Mr. Caldart signed a form agreement entitled \u2018Power of Attorney and Contingent Fee Arrangement\u2019 on June 25, 1999 on the letterhead of the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 21. The agreement calls for payment of a fee of \u2018one-third (33/\u00e9) if terminated without suit\u2019 and \u2018one-third (33/\u00e9) if suit is tried, of all amounts recovered by settlement or verdict\u2019 and reimbursement of advanced costs or as awarded by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201c8. Although the form agreement designates Mr. Weitz-man as the attorney for the purpose of representing Caldart in connection with an \u2018attack by goat at Forward Visions on 6/14/99,\u2019 it was Mr. Potter, not Mr. Weitzman, who served as Caldart\u2019s attorney. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 59-60. Indeed, Mr. Weitzman did not \u2018remember spending any time with Mr. Caldart,\u2019 and \u2018did not handle the case.\u2019 <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 59-60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201c9. Lome Kazmar signed an agreement entitled \u2018Power of Attorney and Contingent Fee Arrangement\u2019 dated May 12, 2000. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 17. The agreement states that Ms. Kazmar \u2018appoints Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman and Steven J. Potter as Attorneys for the purpose of representing [her] in connection with all claims and cases of action arising out of [her] contracting mesothelioma, and other illness related to her exposure to asbestos.\u2019 <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201c10. The Kazmar agreement calls for a fee of \u2018one-third (33\u2153) if terminated without suit\u2019 and \u2018one third (33\u2153) if suit is tried, of all amounts recovered by settlement or verdict and reimbursement to said Attorney for expenses advanced including Court costs.\u2019 <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 17. Ms. Kazmar died during the representation, and Barbara St. John, as personal representative for her estate, entered into a similar agreement on behalf of the estate. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201c11. Although both Messrs. Weitzman and Potter were formerly retained in the \u2018Power of Attorney and Contingent Fee Agreement,\u2019 Mr. Potter, not Mr. Weitzman, served as the attorney for Ms. Kazmar, and thereafter, her estate. Indeed, Mr. Potter interviewed Ms. Kazmar \u2018extensively,\u2019 while Mr. Weitzman poked his head in and said hello. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201c12. The clear and convincing evidence elicited at the hearing demonstrates that Mr. Potter provided the legal services to the clients on behalf of the law firm regarding both the Caldart and Kazmar matters. See, Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 20-23 and 59-60.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201c13. Respondent elected to leave his employment with the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman for several reasons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>including, but not limited to, the fact the Respondent believed that Mr. Weitzman had not lived up to their agreement as to Mr. Potter\u2019s share of the profits for 2000, and because Mr. Weitzman had hired an inexperienced attorney and paid him the same as he paid the Respondent. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 99. The Respondent also thought his salary was too low and he did not always agree with Mr. Weitzman\u2019s methods of operation. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 99.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">\u201c14. On July 26, 2001, the Respondent advised Mr. Weitzman that he was resigning from his employment effective immediately. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 24-25. The Respondent did not provide advance notice of his resignation to Mr. Weitzman because he feared that Mr. Weitzman would take action to interfere with and prejudice the best interests of the clients who Mr. Potter brought to the law firm. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 128-29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201c15. Mr. Potter did not communicate with any client, including Joseph Caldart or Barbara St. John, concerning his intention to resign from his employment with the law firm until his resignation was effective. Mr. Potter refrained from telling any client that he was leaving the law firm until after he left, out of a concern not to breach any duty of loyalty that he might have to his employer. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 74 and 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201c16. Mr. Potter did not solicit any of the clients of the law firm before he resigned from his employment. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 100. Indeed, Mr. Weitzman acknowledged that \u2018none of the clients suffered ... \u2019 because of Mr. Potter\u2019s departure from the law firm. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 39.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201c17. Joseph Caldart terminated his contingency fee agreement with the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman on or about July 27, 2001 and entered into a new fee agreement with Mr. Potter at that time. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 71-73; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 16, 22. The letter written to Mr. Weitzman notes that \u2018[i]f there are any expenses arising from Mr. Potter\u2019s representation of [Mr. Caldart] for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>you are requesting reimbursement, please forward your request with supporting documentation to Mr. Potter.\u2019 <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201c18. Barbara St. John, the personal representative of the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar terminated all contingency fee agreements between Ms. Kazmar, Ms. St. John, the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar and the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitz-man on or about August 31, 2001. Ms. St. John, as personal representative of the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar, entered into a new fee agreement with Mr. Potter as did the Estate\u2019s trial counsel in New York. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 75-76, 96; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 19, 20. The letter is silent as to the contingency fee agreement or the costs advanced by the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman in the Kazmar matter. Joint Exhibit 20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201c19. The clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that the clients who followed Mr. Potter when he left the Law Office of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, for all practical purposes, did not know Mr. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, P. 124; Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 58-60. As a result, Mr. Potter had every reason to believe that both the Caldart and Kazmar clients would elect to have him continue his representation if he left the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 123-24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201c20. The Respondent believed that he would need the client files relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters to continue to represent them properly. Mr. Potter believed that if he did not take possession of the files relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters, Mr. Weitzman would withhold the files or take other action, thereby impairing the Respondent\u2019s ability to represent the clients and otherwise impede the progress of the clients\u2019 cases. Mr. Potter anticipated that Mr. Weitzman would forcibly retain possession of the clients\u2019 files in order to obtain a financial share from the proceeds of any recovery in excess of the amount of any <em>quantum meruit </em>to which Mr. Weitzman might be entitled. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 93-94; Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 9; Exhibits 12,13 and 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201c21. The Respondent also took a file relating to a bankruptcy matter involving Marlene King. Although Mr. Weitzman retained both the unearned attorneys\u2019 fees and the advance filing fee in the King case, Mr. Potter prepared and filed the case for Mrs. King and handled it to its conclusion for her without additional compensation or cost to Mrs. King. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 129.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">\u201c22. The clients\u2019 files that Mr. Potter took with him from the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman were maintained intact. Copies were supplied to Bar Counsel. The clear and convincing evidence at the hearing demonstrates that no part of the contents of those files has been lost or destroyed. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 121-22.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201c23. At the time of the hearing before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, some twenty-two months after Mr. Potter\u2019s resignation from his employment with the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, the Caldart and Kazmar cases remain pending, although settlement in Caldart is represented to be likely. The Caldart case was not filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County until after Mr. Potter resigned from the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitz-man. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 134. The discovery proceedings in the Kazmar case did not begin until after Mr. Potter resigned from the law firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201c24. Prior to his departure from the law firm, the Respondent accessed the firm\u2019s computer and deleted the files maintained on the computers for the Caldart and Kazmar matters. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 27-28. The computer records included all documents prepared by the Respondent and/or the firm\u2019s secretaries relating to these two matters. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 29.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c25. After Mr. Potter\u2019s departure, Andr\u00e9 Weitzman wrote a letter to Mr. Caldart threatening Mr. Caldart with a lawsuit unless Mr. Potter made \u2018suitable arrangements under the employment contract for a payment of a percentage of the fee earned in [the] case.\u2019 <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 10. Mr. Weitzman also sent a letter to the law firm engaged to represent the Estate of Lome Kazmar advising the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>firm that the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman \u2018maintains a proprietary interest in the payment of a fee in th[e] case and a lien.\u2019 <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 11. Mr. Weitzman made similar claims to the employer/insurer\u2019s defense counsel, the insurer\u2019s adjusting agents, the third party insurer\u2019s agents and the third party defendant\u2019s counsel. <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 8, 9 and 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201c26. After resigning from the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, Mr. Potter acted appropriately by securing counsel (Brian Parker, Esq.) to advise him and represent him on any legal and ethical issues that arose from his departure from the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, as well as to attempt, in good faith, to resolve any and all disputes with Mr. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 77, 104; Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 71-72.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201c27. Mr. Potter, through competent counsel, Brian Parker, Esq. attempted, responsibly, to address with Mr. Weitzman all pending client matters relating to clients of the law firm, as well as the division of potential attorneys\u2019 fees from the Caldart and Kazmar cases. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 74-77; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 4, 5. Notwithstanding Mr. Parker\u2019s credible efforts to resolve the disputes by and between Mr. Potter [sic] and Mr. Weitzman, Mr. Weitzman refused to resolve his differences with Mr. Potter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201c28. Mr. Weitzman filed his grievance against Mr. Potter on October 16, 2001, only after repeatedly threatening Mr. Potter\u2019s attorney (Brian Parker, Esq.), that he would do so if Mr. Potter did not agree to the terms of Mr. Weitz-man\u2019s financial demands. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 78; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 1, 36.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201c29. After Mr. Parker\u2019s efforts proved unproductive, Norman Smith, Esq. assumed the role of counsel to Mr. Potter. The threats from Mr. Weitzman continued including Mr. Weitzman\u2019s representation that he would initiate criminal proceedings against Mr. Potter for theft if Mr. Potter did not acquiesce to Mr. Weitzman\u2019s financial demands. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 75, 81, 92 and 97.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201c30. Only after Mr. Weitzman was unable to achieve the fee-sharing agreement that he proposed did Mr. Weitzman file, according to Mr. Parker, his complaint against Mr. Potter with the Attorney Grievance Commission. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, p. 78; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 12, 13 and 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">\u201c31. According to the credible testimony of Messrs. Parker and Smith, the Respondent was willing to resolve the financial dispute with Mr. Weitzman on terms they both thought were generous to Mr. Weitzman. Mr. Weitzman\u2019s hostility towards Mr. Potter in his communications with Messrs. Parker and Smith prevented a settlement from occurring. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 76, 88, 91; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 5,13 and 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201c32. Notwithstanding the fee dispute between Mr. Weitzman and the Respondent, Mr. Potter reimbursed Mr. Weitzman for all funds advanced by the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman for expenses associated with the Cal-dart and Kazmar litigation. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 105; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibit 32, 33.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201c33. The Respondent acknowledged reviewing the financial records of the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman for the year 2000. Mr. Weitzman considered these reports to be his private records. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, P. 51. The entries on the reports include deposits from Mr. Weitz-man\u2019s personal accounts, which he used to pay firm salaries and expenses. The reports also contained disbursements for personal expenses. <em>See </em>Tr., Afternoon Session, pp. 48-50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\u201c34. The Respondent maintains that he reviewed the financial summaries to determine whether there were any profits in which he had a right to share. Mr. Weitzman had advised Mr. Potter that the law firm had no profits in 2000, but the firm\u2019s accountant informed Mr. Potter that there were profits. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 46, 47, 102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\u201c35. Mr. Weitzman did not tell Mr. Potter he could not look at the financial summaries of the law firm. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 50. If the Respondent had asked, Mr. Weitzman might have shown the reports to the Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>and given an explanation. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 42, 50. Indeed, Mr. Weitzman had offered Mr. Potter the opportunity to review the law firm\u2019s records in the past. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, pp. 46, 120. The Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s actions in reviewing the records were reasonable inasmuch as he believed he was entitled to a percentage of the law firm\u2019s net proceeds as part of the verbal employment agreement arrived at between him and his employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cThe Petition for Disciplinary Action filed in the Court of Appeals alleges that the Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.4, 1.7(b) and (c) and 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d). Rule 1.4, entitled \u2018Communication\u2019 provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">This Court finds that Bar Counsel has not demonstrated that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4 concerning client communication. Bar Counsel has not sustained its burden of proof because it did not show, by clear and convincing evidence, that any client represented by Mr. Weitzman or Mr. Potter was not kept \u2018reasonably informed of the status\u2019 of his or her matter. Further, Bar Counsel did not offer any evidence whatsoever that any client made a reasonable request for information with which Mr. Potter failed to comply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\u201cThe Petitioner maintains that the letters Respondent wrote on behalf of Mr. Caldart and Ms. St. John \u2018indicate that the clients were not aware of their obligations to [Mr.] Weitzman.\u2019 <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 20; <em>See </em>Joint Exhibits 16 and 20. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Respectfully, there is nothing in either letter, or in any communication satisfying Bar Counsel\u2019s burden to show that the Respondent failed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of a matter or failed to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit any client to make any informed decision regarding their representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\u201cClearly, no client testified in these proceedings. Although direct testimony from a client is unnecessary to establish a violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4, there must be clear and convincing evidence to establish such a violation. Bar Counsel did not adduce clear and convincing evidence that either Mr. Caldart or Ms. St. John lacked the information necessary to make a decision as to which attorney they wanted to represent them. Indeed, the clients who followed Mr. Potter when he left the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman, for all practical purposes, were represented by Mr. Potter throughout the course of their representation at the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitz-man. As a result, the matters involving Mr. Caldart and the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar remained with Mr. Potter after he left his employment with Mr. Weitzman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cFurther, this Court finds that Bar Counsel has not established by clear and convincing evidence that any of Mr. Potter\u2019s actions violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(b) or (c) concerning conflicts of interest. Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(b) and (c), entitled \u2018Conflict of Interest: General Rule\u2019 provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(2) the client consents after consultation, (c) The consultation required by paragraphs (a) and (b) shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and any limitations resulting from the lawyer\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>sponsibilities to another, or from the lawyer\u2019s own interests, as well as the advantages and risks involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">Bar Counsel contends that the Respondent acted solely in his own interest when he denied Weitzman access to the files and other information concerning the representation thereby involving the clients in his dispute with [Mr.] Weitz-man.\u2019 <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact at 20-21. The clear and convincing evidence elicited at the hearing demonstrates that Mr. Potter\u2019s representation of Mr. Cal-dart and the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar was [sic] not materially limited by Mr. Potter\u2019s self-interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u201cThere is no allegation during these proceedings that Mr. Potter did not represent competently his clients, including Mr. Caldart and the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar. Further, there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Potter took advantage of \u2014 or even attempted to take advantage of \u2014 any client in any way. On the contrary, the clear and convincing evidence before this Court is that each client consented to Mr. Potter\u2019s continued representation after appropriate consultation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe Respondent is also charged with violating Rule 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.

With regard to the allegations of a Rule 8.4(a) violation, for the reasons stated <em>supra </em>at pp. 131-42 and <em>infra </em>at pp. 143-51, this Court does not find by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Potter has violated or has attempted \u2018to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u2019 Further, there is no allegation that Mr. Potter knowingly assisted or induced anyone to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or did so through anyone else. As a result, this Court finds that Bar Counsel has not demonstrated that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\u201cRule 8.4(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">It is professional conduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">(b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201cThe Court finds that Petitioner has failed to demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Potter committed \u2018a criminal act that reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u2019 The Court acknowledges that it is not necessary for the Respondent to be charged or convicted of the criminal offense in order to find a violation of Rule 8.4(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 394-95, 692 A.2d 465 (1997) (holding that there is no requirement that the Respondent be charged with or prosecuted for the criminal offense to find a violation of Rule 8.4(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct; all that is required is proof of the underlying conduct by clear and convincing evidence). Nevertheless, based on clear and convincing evidence, the Court finds that Respondent has not committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cPetitioner attempts to show that Mr. Potter violated Section 7-104(a) of the Maryland Theft Statute when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>deprived Mr. Weitzman of the paper and computer generated materials relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters. Section 7-104(a) provides, in relevant part, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">A person may not willfully or knowingly obtain or exert unauthorized control over property, if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u2022 intends to deprive the owner of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u2022 willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u2022 uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing the use, concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law \u00a7 7-104(a) (2002). The Court finds that under the facts and circumstances of this case, Respondent lacked any intent to deprive Mr. Weitz-man of client files and computer records. The client files were kept intact at all times; no part of any file has been lost or destroyed. The Court further finds that while Respondent\u2019s deletion of computer records may have been inappropriate and improper, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that the deletion of computer records under the facts and circumstances of this case constitute^] a criminal act that reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">\u201cMr. Potter reasonably believed that the clients would follow him after leaving Mr. Weitzman\u2019s firm. <em>See </em>Findings of Fact, <em>supra, </em>p. 136-37. At all times, Respondent did what he believed was in the best interests of his clients. Indeed, had the clients instructed him to do so, Respondent would have transferred the files back to Mr. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Tr., Morning Session, p. 119. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court finds that Mr. Potter did not commit a criminal act. Further, because this Court finds that Mr. Potter acted solely in his clients\u2019 best interests, the Court finds that Petitioner [sic] has failed to show that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Potter acted in any way that reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">\u201cFurther, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the Respondent\u2019s conduct constituted fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary. Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law \u00a7 7-113 (2002), it is prohibited for a fiduciary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">\u2022 fraudulently and willfully appropriate money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u2022 secrete money or a thing of value that the fiduciary holds in a fiduciary capacity with a fraudulent intent to use the money or thing of value contrary to the requirements of the fiduciary\u2019s trust responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that Petitioner has failed to show, through clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated Section 7-113. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Mr. Potter acted in the sole interests of his clients. Accordingly, this Court finds that Petitioner has failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent fraudulently misappropriated any files or computer records or any other thing of value in violation of Section 7-113. Indeed, all of the files were maintained intact and copies provided to Bar Counsel. Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">\u201cRule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">\u201cFor the reasons stated <em>supra </em>at 140-44 and <em>infra </em>at pp. 145-51, this Court does not find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Potter engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. While it is undisputed that Mr. Potter removed files and deleted com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>puter records, he did so in order to represent competently the clients, not to be dishonest or deceitful. Mr. Potter\u2019s actions served solely to protect his clients\u2019 interests. While the Court does not condone Mr. Potter\u2019s actions, this Court finds that Mr. Potter did not violate Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct under the facts and circumstances of these matters. Mr. Potter reasonably believed that both the Caldart and Kazmar clients would choose to have him continue his representation if he terminated his employment with Mr. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Findings of Fact, p. 136-37. As such, Mr. Potter did what he thought was in the best interests of his clients. Further, Mr. Potter believed that if he did not take possession relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters, Mr. Weitzman would withhold the files or take other action thereby impairing the Respondent\u2019s ability to represent the clients and otherwise impede the clients\u2019 cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">\u201cPetitioner directs the Court\u2019s attention to three separate cases wherein courts found an attorney in violation of Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 431 A.2d 1336 (1981); <em>In re Complaint as to the Conduct of Corey B. Smith[, </em>315 Or. 260], 843 P.2d 449 (Or.1992); <em>In the Matter of Gary M. Cupples, </em>952 S.W.2d 226 (Mo.1997). However, the facts of these cases are distinguishable from the facts presented to this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201cIn <em>Kahn, </em>the Respondent secretly removed and photocopied many office records from his boss\u2019s firm for the express purpose of taking inventory and evaluating the firm\u2019s open cases as a basis for a financial settlement with his boss for the transfer of the firm to Respondent. <em>Kahn, supra, </em>290 Md. at 660, 431 A.2d 1336. The information Respondent misappropriated was used for the Respondent\u2019s own financial benefit. <em>Id. </em>at 676[, 431 A.2d 1336]. Further, the Respondent paid \u2018runners\u2019 to solicit people involved in automobile accidents to go to the firm where the Respondent worked. <em>Id. </em>at 663 \u2014 64[, 431 A.2d 1336].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u201cThe hearing Court found that Respondent used false and fraudulent medical reports and bills for medical services as proof of damages in claims for personal injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 672[, 431 A.2d 1336]. The Respondent in <em>Kahn </em>committed highly egregious acts which were solely for the purpose of enhancing his personal financial status. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that the Respondent acted in his clients\u2019 best interests and not for his own financial purpose. Indeed, the Respondent attempted, in good faith, to address with Mr. Weitzman the division of potential attorneys\u2019 fees from the Caldart and Kazmar cases, which Mr. Weitzman refused to resolve. <em>See </em>Findings of Fact, <em>supra, </em>pp. 138-39.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">\u201cIn <em>Smith, supra, </em>843 P.2d 449, the Respondent met 31 new clients in his office and had each sign individual retainer agreements in violation of the firm\u2019s requirement to only use retainer agreements for representation by the Respondent\u2019s firm. <em>Smith, supra, </em>843 P.2d at 450. The Respondent did not open new firm files for any of the 31 new clients. <em>Id. </em>Upon leaving the firm, the Respondent took with him the files relating to all 31 of these clients as well as 50 to 75 other cases. <em>Id. </em>at 450-51.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cThereafter, the Respondent mailed letters to the 31 new clients announcing his opening of a new law office under a different name yet continuing to do the same work. Additionally, Respondent mailed letters to opposing counsel, insurance companies, medical providers, and workers\u2019 compensation referees involved in the 31 matters notifying them of the changed address and law firm name. Further, only after the Respondent\u2019s firm filed civil actions against the Respondent, did the Respondent inform the 31 clients that they had a choice whether to be represented by the Respondent or the firm. The hearing Court found that \u2018before the 31 new clients signed the individual retainer agreements, the [Respondent] anticipated leaving [his firm]; that he intended to keep these clients as his own if and when he left [the firm]; and that he therefore consciously kept the 31 new clients out of the [firm\u2019s] file system.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 451. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Court found that such conduct clearly involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation as prohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">\u201cAccording to the Court in <em>Smith, </em>the letters from the accused to the 31 clients included misrepresentations to the clients; the letters from the accused to opposing counsel, insurance companies, medical providers, and workers\u2019 compensation referees included misrepresentations to the public; and the surreptitious handling of the client files was dishonest and deceitful toward the firm. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, Mr. Potter made no such misrepresentations either to his clients, Mr. Weitzman, or other relevant parties; Mr. Potter consulted with his clients regarding his departure from the Law Offices of Andre R. Weitzman. <em>See supra, </em>pp. 135-36. Further, the extent to which the Respondent in the <em>Smith </em>case concealed new clients from the firm and misappropriated numerous files involving numerous clients is a far cry from Mr. Potter\u2019s actions. Mr. Potter never concealed the Caldart and Kazmar matters from Mr. Weitzman; Mr. Potter openly brought these matters with him to the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman. <em>See </em>Findings of Fact, <em>supra, </em>p. 134. Bar Counsel\u2019s attempt to compare the Respondent\u2019s deplorable conduct in <em>Smith </em>is misplaced. As stated previously, Mr. Potter\u2019s conduct flowed from his feeling of responsibility to his clients. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Mr. Potter\u2019s actions are distinguished from the Respondent\u2019s actions in <em>Smith.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">\u201cIn <em>Cupples, supra, </em>952 S.W.2d 226, the Respondent, a partner in a law firm, secreted 18 clients by failing to register these clients in a billing system in preparation to withdraw from the law firm. <em>See Cupples, supra, </em>952 S.W.2d 226. The Respondent also failed to turn over particular cases that he had received but that would not have been assigned to him by the firm\u2019s alphabetical system. <em>Id. </em>at 229. Additionally, the Respondent failed to report work on these particular cases during weekly meetings with his co-partners of the firm. <em>Id. </em>When the Respondent\u2019s part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ners discovered his deceitfulness, Respondent \u2018at best, was not forthright about his intent to withdraw from the firm and not forthcoming with cooperating] with the firm.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 238. The Court found that the Respondent\u2019s actions \u2018violated his duties to the firm.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>As stated previously, the clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that Mr. Potter acted solely in the interests of his clients. Unlike the Respondent in <em>Cupples, </em>Mr. Potter\u2019s motivating factor in his actions was not to deceive and defraud, but to protect the clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\u201cAccordingly, this Court finds that Mr. Potter has not engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. Accordingly, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Potter has violated Rule 8.4(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cRule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cThe Petitioner alleges that Mr. Potter\u2019s action constitutes conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Clearly, public confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice. Conduct that erodes public confidence is viewed properly as prejudicial to the administration of justice. It is well settled that \u2018an attorney occupies a high position of trust with his client, and that an attorney must exercise the utmost good faith, fairness and fidelity toward the client.\u2019 <em>See Littell v. Morton, </em>369 F.Supp. 411, 425 (D.Md.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>519 F.2d 1399 (4th Cir.1975); <em>see also Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor, </em>93 Md.App. 337, 346-47, 612 A.2d 322 (1992) (stating that the fiduciary relationship which exists between an attorney and client carries with it the duty of loyalty and utmost good faith).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201cFor the reasons stated <em>supra, </em>pp. 140-48, this Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. The clear and convincing evidence introduced at the hearing is that the Respondent\u2019s actions with regard to the matters involving Mr. Caldart and the Estate of Lorrie Kazmar were undertaken to foster what the Respondent believed was in the best interests of the clients. As the Petitioner readily acknowledges, there were no clients prejudiced by the Respondent\u2019s conduct. <em>See </em>Petitioner\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at-. Clearly, the lack of prejudice to the clients is not dispositive. Nevertheless, the fact that no client suffered as a result of Mr. Potter\u2019s actions is a factor in considering whether Mr. Potter\u2019s actions constitute \u2018conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cMoreover, Mr. Potter, not Mr. Weitzman, brought both the Caldart and Kazmar matters to the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman. Further, Mr. Potter provided the legal services to the clients on behalf of Mr. Weitzman\u2019s law firm regarding both the Caldart and Kazmar matters. As a result, Mr. Potter has every reason to believe that both the Caldart and Kazmar clients would elect to continue his representation if he left the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201cAlthough this Court neither countenances nor condones the taking of files and the deletion of computer records, the client files that Mr. Potter took with him from the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman were maintained intact. The clear and convincing evidence from the hearing demonstrates that no part of the contents of those files has been lost or destroyed. Further, notwithstanding the fee dispute between Mr. Weitzman and Mr. Potter, the Respondent has reimbursed Mr. Weitzman for all funds advanced by the Law Offices of Andr\u00e9 R. Weitzman for expenses associated with the Caldart and Kazmar litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u201cAccordingly, under the facts and circumstances of this case, this Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the Respondent engaged in \u2018conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u2019 As a result, this Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">\u201cFor these reasons, the Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4, Rule 1.7(b) and (c) and Rule 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Respondent does not except to the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law.

The hearing judge erred as a matter of law and we sustain Bar Counsel\u2019s exceptions. Respondent\u2019s conduct was criminal conduct that reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer; it was deceitful and was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Respondent engaged in criminal conduct by deleting the client files from the computer when he was not authorized to do so. We find by clear and convincing evidence that respondent\u2019s conduct in deleting the computer records violated Maryland Code (2002, 2003 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 7-302 of the Criminal Law Article, which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a person may not intentionally and willfully exceed that persons\u2019s authorized access to a computer with the intent to \u201calter, damage, or destroy all or any part of data or a computer program stored, maintained, or produced by a computer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Respondent exceeded his authorized use of the law firm\u2019s computer system in violation of \u00a7 7-302(c)(l) and he also did so with the intent to alter and destroy part of the data stored by that computer system in violation of \u00a7 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>302(c)(2)(ii). Respondent\u2019s deletion of the computer records constituted criminal conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such conduct also reflected adversely upon his honesty and trustworthiness. Respondent was authorized to use the law firm\u2019s computers to generate and store documents relating to client matters. He did not have permission, however, to delete these computer records without the consent of his employer. Respondent\u2019s fear that Mr. Weitzman would interfere with his continued representation of the Caldart and Kazmar clients after respondent left the law firm did not authorize him to destroy the firm\u2019s computer records relating to those clients. Respondent deleted the computer records at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. on July 11, 2001, two weeks before respondent planned to quit his employment with the Law Offices of Andre\u2019 Weitzman. This surreptitious conduct in the middle of the night is strong evidence that respondent knew that his conduct was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In addition to deleting the computer records, respondent removed all files from the law firm relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters. The hearing judge concluded that respondent did not violate Rule 8.4 because he was acting in the clients\u2019 interests. In finding no violation of Rule 8.4, the hearing judge focused on respondent\u2019s motive, rather than on his intent. For example, the hearing judge determined that, based on respondent\u2019s motive of protecting the clients\u2019 interests, respondent did not remove the files or delete the computer records \u201cto be dishonest or deceitful.\u201d The hearing judge erred in concluding that the removal of the files was not a violation of Rules 8.4(c) and (d). Regardless of respondent\u2019s motive, <em>ie., </em>his purported desire to protect the interests of the clients, his conduct was dishonest and deceitful. As we have indicated, respondent had no authority to delete the records, and he knew that he had no such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Respondent\u2019s unauthorized removal of the client files violated Rules 8.4(c) and (d). At the time respondent removed the client files, he did not have the authorization of the law firm or the clients. Although respondent\u2019s belief that Caldart and Kazmar would choose ultimately to have him continue to provide legal services for them, they did not give respondent permission to remove their files nor could they have given him such permission while he was employed with the firm. Respondent acted dishonestly and in an untrustworthy manner in exceeding the scope of his authority, appropriating files, and deleting computer records.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">It is important to note that we are not focusing on the solicitation of clients by a departing associate or partner of a law firm. The conduct in question in the instant case is the removal of files by a lawyer without the knowledge of the law firm. It appears that such conduct is uniformly condemned as highly improper and unethical. One partner has a fiduciary duty to another partner. <em>Herring v. Offutt, </em>266 Md. 593, 597, 295 A.2d 876, 879 (1972); Md. Code (1975, 1999 Repl. Vol., 2003 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 9A-404 of the Corporations and Associations Article. Similarly, under the law of agency, there exists a fiduciary relationship between a law firm and its associate lawyers. <em>Insurance Co. v.

In <em>Kahn, </em>the attorney\u2019s former employer had been disbarred after pleading guilty in federal court to a charge of mail fraud. Thereafter, the attorney, Kahn, and his former employer, Berman, allegedly discussed transferring Berman\u2019s law practice to Kahn. Kahn testified before the hearing judge in the disciplinary action that he removed and photocopied index cards relating to the cases on which he and another associate had been working in order to place a value on those cases as a basis for a financial agreement with Berman for the transfer of the practice. The hearing judge found, however, that Kahn used the information he had copied from the case files to recreate files for former firm clients who chose to continue to receive his legal services. The hearing judge made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c[A]s a salaried employee of Berman, [Kahn] acquired no property interest or claim of right in the information contained in Berman\u2019s office files at the time of Berman\u2019s disbarment. Consequently, the removal and photocopying of Berman\u2019s records summarizing the contents of Berman\u2019s office files was an illegal appropriation of the information contained therein. Whether this information was useful in attempting to reach a financial agreement with Berman is immaterial, as the evidence is clear that it was not used for this purpose but instead was used by [Kahn] for his own financial benefit in facilitating his representation of former Berman clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 676, 431 A.2d at 1348. The <em>Kahn </em>hearing judge concluded that Kahn had engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law. <em>Id. </em>We agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 431 A.2d at 1349. Although the hearing judge in the case <em>sub judice </em>found <em>Kahn </em>to be distinguishable, as we do in <em>some </em>respects, <em>Kahn </em>nonetheless stands for the proposition that it is unethical and illegal for a lawyer to take information from client files without the consent of the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The hearing court in the case <em>sub judice </em>dismissed the out-of-state cases relied upon by Bar Counsel as distinguishable and not relevant. Although the attorney\u2019s conduct in <em>In the Matter of Cupples, </em>952 S.W.2d 226 (Mo.1997), and <em>In re Smith, </em>315 Or. 260, 843 P.2d 449 (1992), was more egregious than that of respondent in the instant case, Bar Counsel is correct that those cases support its contention that removal of client files under the circumstances in which respondent acted was unethical.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In the attorney disciplinary action, <em>In the Matter of Cup-ples, </em>952 S.W.2d 226 (Mo.1997), the Missouri Supreme Court held that the attorney, Cupples, violated Missouri Rule 4-8.4(c) by secreting client litigation files from his partners in preparation to withdraw from the law firm and by removing client litigation files from the firm without the appropriate consent of his partners or the client. Even though the Missouri court found that all of the attorney\u2019s conduct was for the purpose of deceiving and defrauding his partners with the intent to appropriate the business for himself, <em>id. </em>at 230-31, and in the instant case, respondent\u2019s motive may not have been to \u201cdeceive and defraud, but to protect the clients,\u201d the Missouri Supreme Court was clear that Cupples violated ethical rules by taking the client files. The motive of the lawyer was not central to the finding of a violation of the ethical rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The court noted that the problems that occurred when the attorney decided to leave the law firm were symptomatic of a growing trend in the legal profession \u2014 that of partners becoming increasingly mobile and feeling much freer to shift from one firm to another. <em>Id. </em>at 233. When partners and associates leave law firms, the issue of the continued representation of the client inevitably arises. The Missouri court cogently pointed out that clients are not the property of the lawyer. The court addressed the duty of a lawyer to a client as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzC\">\u201cThe client has the right to choose the attorney or attorneys who will represent it. <em>Rule 1-1.16(a) (3) (1997); see also Model Code, </em>DR 2-110(B)(4). \u2018[C]lients are not the \u201cpossession\u201d of anyone, but, to the contrary, control who represent them.\u2019 <em>Kelly v. Smith, </em>611 N.E.2d 118, 122 (Ind.1993). \u2018Clients are not merchandise. They cannot be bought, sold, or traded. The attorney-client relationship is personal and confidential, and the client\u2019s choice of attorneys in civil cases is near absolute.\u2019 <em>Koehler v. Wales, </em>16 Wash.App. 304, 556 P.2d 233, 236 (1976); <em>see also Ellerby v. Spiezer, </em>138 Ill.App.3d 77, 92 Ill.Dec. 602, 605, 485 N.E.2d 413, 416 (1985); <em>Resnick v.

The client\u2019s files belong to the client, not to the attorney representing the client. The client may direct an attorney or firm to transmit the file to newly retained counsel. <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>727 F.2d 941, 944 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 819, 105 S.Ct. 90, 83 L.Ed.2d 37 (1984); <em>Rose v.

Finally, an attorney representing a client has a duty to communicate with the client regarding the client\u2019s representation. <em>Rule lp-1.U(b)(1997); see also Model Code, </em>EC 9-2. This duty includes communicating with the client about material changes in who represents the client. <em>See Rule 1-1.16(d) (1997); Rule 1 </em>(Preamble); <em>Vollgraff v. Block, </em>117 Misc.2d 489, 458 N.Y.S.2d 437, 440 (1982); Judy R. May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Comment: In Search of Greener Pastures: Do Solicitation Rules and Other Ethical Restrictions Governing Departing Partners Really Make Sense Today?, </em>40 VILL. L. REV. 1517, 1528 (1995).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 234. The court found that Cupples breached duties owed by him to the client by failing to inform the client of the material change in representation and failing to obtain the client\u2019s informed consent as to how it wished its work to be handled. <em>Id. </em>at 235. The court also found that Cupples, as a partner in the firm, breached fiduciary duties owed by him to the law firm. <em>Id. </em>at 237. He violated these duties by hiding client files from the firm and failing to inform the firm of the legal work he was handling for the client. <em>Id. </em>The court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201cThe withdrawing attorney and the firm also have a duty to orderly maintain or transfer the clients\u2019 files in accordance with the clients\u2019 directions and to withdraw from representing those clients by whom they are discharged. Both the withdrawing attorney and the firm have a mutual duty, not only to the client, but to each other as well, to make certain that these tasks are completed in a competent and professional manner to the reasonable satisfaction of their clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 236-37. This duty of the withdrawing partner to the firm is not limited to the partner; the withdrawing associate has a like duty. <em>Id. </em>at 236. Cupples\u2019 actions violated the rule of professional conduct prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In <em>In re Smith, </em>315 Or. 260, 843 P.2d 449 (1992), the attorney, Smith, engaged in similar conduct. During the two and one-half months preceding his departure from the firm, Smith, who was an employee associate of the firm, met with thirty-one clients and had them sign individual retainer agreements rather than firm retainer agreements. The Oregon Supreme Court, agreeing with the disciplinary hearing panel, concluded that the attorney\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation as prohibited by DR 1-102(A)(3) in that \u201cbefore the 31 new clients signed the individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ual retainer agreements, the [lawyer] anticipated leaving [the law firm]; that he intended to keep these clients as his own if and when he left [the firm]; and that he therefore consciously kept the 31 new clients out of the [firm\u2019s] file system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. When Smith left the firm, he took the files of these thirty-one clients as well as files relating to fifty to seventy-five other cases. The court held that Smith\u2019s dishonesty, deceit, and misrepresentation violated a duty to his clients, the public and his former law firm. <em>Id. </em>The court imposed a suspension from the practice of law for four months, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">\u201c[T]he real and potential harm to the public is great when lawyers attempt to take economic rights from their own firms (as did the accused here): A breach of integrity like this one merits a severe sanction. <em>See </em>ABA Standard 1.1 (\u2018The purpose of lawyer discipline proceedings is to protect the public and the administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged their professional duties to clients, the public, the legal system, and the legal profession.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASu\"><em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The American Bar Association, in Informal Ethics Opinion C 787, addressed the question, <em>inter alia, </em>of whether a salaried attorney who decides to leave the law firm and plans to become associated with another attorney may, without the knowledge of the partners of the firm, remove from the law office the files upon which he has been working. ABA Comm, on Ethics and Profl Responsibility, Informal Op. C-787 (1964). The Committee on Ethics responded with a resounding \u201cNO.\u201d The opinion concluded that \u201cthe acts of the attorney employed by the partnership in removing the files upon which he had been working from the offices of the partnership without the knowledge of the partners would be highly improper, unethical and a violation of his obligation to his former employers.\u201d Commenting on the hypothetical scenario in which the client might have had knowledge that the attorney was removing the files, the Committee opined that \u201cthis would not excuse the attorney\u2019s conduct.\u201d The Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility of the Idaho State Bar ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>pressed the same view in Formal Opinion No. 108, dated August 28, 1981. Addressing the broader question of the propriety of covenants not to compete between attorneys, the Committee concluded \u201c[o]f course, when the associate leaves the association\u2019s employ, he cannot take with him client files which are the property of the association.\u201d <em>See also </em>Michigan State Bar Comm, on Profl and Judicial Ethics, Informal Op. CI-681 (1981) (Superceded by RI-49 1990) (citing ABA Informal Opinion C-787 and stating that a withdrawing associate or partner may not take client files before the clients have discharged the firm and retained the lawyer even if the lawyer fears that the firm will refuse to turn over the files).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Respondent has committed acts that reflect adversely on his honesty and trustworthiness as a lawyer; he engaged in conduct involving dishonesty or deceit; and he engaged in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Respondent has violated Rules 8.4(b), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We now turn to the appropriate sanction to be imposed. Bar Counsel recommends that respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law with the right to apply for reinstatement in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The purpose of sanctioning an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the errant attorney. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 474, 800 A.2d 782, 789 (2002). Attorney disciplinary proceedings also are aimed at deterring other attorneys from committing violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 800 A.2d at 789. The severity of the sanction depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors or aggravating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Angst, </em>369 Md. 404, 416-18, 800 A.2d 747, 755 (2002). On occasion, in considering the appropriate sanction to be imposed, we have referred to the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Braskey, </em>378 Md. 425, 453-54, 836 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>605, 622 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, 378 </em>Md. 395, 411, 836 A.2d 588, 597 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 88, 803 A.2d 505, 511 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). The Standards set out a framework for consideration of discipline matters, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">(1) What ethical duty did the lawyer violate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">(2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">(4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances? <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\"><em>See </em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, <em>reprinted in ABA Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards, </em>338-39, 344 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">By deleting computer records, respondent committed criminal acts. Because he knew that he lacked the authority to take the client files and delete the computer records, respondent acted intentionally and dishonestly. Although respondent knew that his actions were improper and illegal, he acted in an effort to facilitate his representation of the two clients and the hearing judge found that he had the clients\u2019 best interests in mind. The hearing judge found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">\u201c[Respondent] believed that if he did not take possession of the files relating to the Caldart and Kazmar matters, Mr. Weitzman would withhold the files or take other action, thereby impairing the Respondent\u2019s ability to represent the clients and otherwise impede the progress of the clients\u2019 cases. [Respondent] anticipated that Mr. Weitzman would forcibly retain possession of the clients\u2019 files in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>obtain a financial share from the proceeds of any recovery in excess of the amount of any <em>quantum meruit </em>to which Mr. Weitzman might be entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We thus consider, for the purpose of a sanction, that respondent acted in what he believed to be the clients\u2019 best interests. The hearing judge also found that respondent did not solicit any of the clients of the firm before he resigned from the firm. He also found that respondent had \u201cevery reason to believe that both the Caldart and Kazmar clients would elect to have him continue his representation if he left [the firm].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">There is no evidence in the record that the clients actually were harmed by respondent\u2019s conduct. This does not mean that respondent\u2019s misconduct did not breed any negative consequences, however. We must consider the harm to respondent\u2019s former employer and to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Respondent\u2019s conduct created the potential that Mr. Weitz-man could suffer harm in the future. Mr. Weitzman had a policy of keeping client files for at least five years after the representation had ended. Respondent\u2019s unauthorized appropriation of the files and deletion of the computer records prevented Mr. Weitzman from adhering to this practice. Although respondent brought the Caldart and Kazmar clients to the firm and provided legal services for them, they were clients of the firm for two years and one year, respectively. If the clients ever filed a malpractice suit against the firm, Mr. Weitzman would have no documentation to aid in his defense of the suit. Thus, Mr. Weitzman potentially was harmed by not possessing any files or computer records relating to these two client matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Mr. Weitzman was harmed because respondent\u2019s taking of the paper files extinguished whatever ability Mr. Weitzman might have had to exercise a retaining lien on those files in order to secure any payment to which he may have been entitled. <em>See </em>Rule 2-652(a) (Retaining lien);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Griev-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>anee Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 31, 741 A.2d 1143, 1159 (1999). A retaining lien depends upon the attorney having possession of the client\u2019s papers. <em>Id.; </em>C. Wolfram, <em>Modem Legal Ethics, </em>\u00a7 9.6.3, Attorney Liens, at 560 (1986) (stating that \u201c[t]he retaining lien is enforceable only by possession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Next, we consider several mitigating factors. Respondent has no prior disciplinary record and has been a member of the Maryland Bar in good standing for thirteen years. Respondent\u2019s actions appear to be an isolated incident, or at least do not constitute a pattern or course of conduct. Before respondent became employed with Mr. Weitzman\u2019s firm in 1997, Mr. Weitzman employed respondent for five years as an independent contractor to work on some of Mr. Weitzman\u2019s cases. There are no allegations that respondent acted improperly from 1992 until 2001, when respondent engaged in the conduct that is the subject of this grievance proceeding. Finally, we accept the hearing judge\u2019s determination that respondent\u2019s underlying motive was \u201cto represent competently the clients, not to be dishonest or deceitful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">A primary purpose of sanctions is to protect the public. We have stated that \u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Thus, the appropriate sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including consideration of aggravating and any mitigating factors. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 656, 745 A.2d 1086, 1092 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Respondent has violated Rules 8.4(b), (c), and (d). Notwithstanding the attorney\u2019s motive, lawyers in this State may not delete computer records or take client files from the law firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>without authorization. After consideration of all the circumstances presented herein, we conclude that respondent\u2019s misconduct was sufficiently serious to warrant a suspension from the practice of law for a period of ninety days, said suspension to commence thirty (30) days from the date of entry of this Opinion and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.
