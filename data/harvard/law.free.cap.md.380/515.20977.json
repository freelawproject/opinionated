The decision was reviewed first by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and then by the Court of Special Appeals, 150 Md.App. 138, 819 A.2d 383 (2003). Petitioner sought review of the decision by the Court of Special Appeals because the remedy that court fashioned, she contends, exceeded its authority and violated the Maryland Constitution and Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 to 10-305 of the State Government Article [hereinafter APA].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Whether a court has exceeded its statutory and judicial authority over an administrative agency is a question that involves the constitutional balance of power between the judiciary and executive administrative agencies. That balance of power is governed by an established area of administrative law dealing with the scope of judicial review over the various types of administrative agency decisions. In this case, we consider whether the Court of Special Appeals exercised the proper standard of judicial review over an administrative agency decision in a matter that is committed, ultimately, to the agency\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Linda Ann Spencer, a pharmacist, continued to practice pharmacy after her license expired on July 1, 1999. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>August 16, 1999, Spencer\u2019s supervisor, having confirmed with the Maryland State Board of Pharmacy (\u201cthe Board\u201d) the expiration and non-renewal of Spencer\u2019s pharmacy license, instructed Spencer to cease practicing pharmacy, which she did. Spencer then contacted the Board to inquire why her license had not been renewed, asserting that she had timely submitted the required renewal application. An internal review of the Board\u2019s office records, however, indicated that no application or accompanying fee was received. Spencer surmised that her application had been lost in the mail and therefore submitted a renewal application to the Board on August 30, 1999. Although her application included certification that she had acquired the requisite number of continuing education credits, the majority of those credits were obtained after her license had expired in June. Nevertheless, the Board granted Spencer\u2019s renewal application on September 14, 1999, after which Spencer resumed her practice of pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The Court of Special Appeals described the remaining events that led to this appeal as follows (referring to the Board as \u201cappellant\u201d and to Spencer as \u201cappellee\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">\u201cAppellant issued charges against appellee on February 16, 2000, alleging that she had practiced pharmacy without a license for a period of six weeks and that she had failed to maintain records of required continuing education credits. Appellant scheduled a case resolution conference (CRC) to attempt to resolve the matter without the necessity of a hearing. Mr. Stanton Ades and Ms. Laura Schneider, two members of the Board, represented appellant at the CRC. The settlement negotiations were unsuccessful. Both Mr. Ades and Ms. Schneider sat on the panel of Board members who eventually heard this contested case. On many occasions, beginning in July 2000, appellee sent letters to counsel for appellant, seeking to have the matter referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). Appellee believed appellant incapable of giving her a fair and impartial hearing because appellant had been intimately involved in settlement negotiations with appellee and may have prejudged the case. Appellant repeatedly denied appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>requests to move the case to OAH, stating that appellant\u2019s knowledge of settlement negotiations did not disqualify it from hearing evidence. In further justification for refusing to move the case, appellant stated that appellee 'failed to assign any specific facts indicating the Board would not be an impartial arbiter,\u2019 and also noted that the Board \u2018ha[d] never delegated a matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cFinally, on August 14, 2000, appellee filed a motion to refer the cas\u00e9 to the Office of Administrative Hearings or, in the alternative, to recuse members of the Board. Appellant denied that motion on September 15, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cAppellant held a hearing on the matter on September 20, 2000, and resumed the hearing on January 8, 2001. Counsel for appellant had given books containing exhibits to the members of the Board on the morning of the hearing. When counsel for appellee arrived for the hearing, he noticed that at least one member of the Board was reviewing evidence before the start of the hearing. Counsel for appellee complained about the member reviewing documents that were not in evidence, and asked that member to recuse himself. This request was denied. He then renewed the motion to move the case to OAH and appellant denied that motion also. Finally, counsel for appellee asked that the two members who were involved in settlement negotiations recuse themselves, and that request was also denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cAppellee did not dispute that she had practiced pharmacy without a license for a period of six weeks. Her counsel argued, however, that her practice of pharmacy without a license was authorized under Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-226(b) of the State Government Article, because she had submitted a timely renewal application. Appellee did not present any evidence, other than her testimony, that she had filed a renewal application prior to the expiration of her license on July 1, 1999. Appellant\u2019s records did not reveal any application, check, or money order from appellee prior to July 1, 1999. Appellant determined that appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>testimony on the matter lacked credibility and found that she had not filed a timely renewal application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201cDuring the hearing, counsel for appellee accused members of the Board of prejudging the case, of sleeping during the hearing, and of not paying attention to testimony. After the accusation about sleeping, the hearing deteriorated to the point where several members of the Board engaged in a heated conversation with counsel for appellee involving demands for apologies and chastisements about finger pointing from counsel and members of the Board. Finally, one of the Board members asked counsel for appellee to leave the room, but he remained and continued arguing. Eventually, counsel was asked if he would act appropriately, and he said he would, so the hearing continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cLater, counsel for appellee objected to the entry of a mail log, and argued that it \u2018does not go to [appellee\u2019s] credibility.\u2019 Ms. Hawkins, one of the Board members, stated \u2018sure it does.\u2019 When counsel then said to the Board, \u2018Ms. Hawkins already said out loud it went to credibility,\u2019 Ms. Hawkins denied saying it and then added, \u2018I did not [say that], and you\u2019re a bold-faced liar.\u2019 Counsel for appellee objected to being called a liar during the proceeding and attempted to have Ms. Hawkins removed from hearing the case, but that request was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cOn February 21, 2001, appellant issued its Final Decision and Order, finding that appellee had violated Md.Code (1981, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-301, 12-701, 12-707(e), and 12-313(b)(24) of the Health Occupations Article. Appellant placed appellee on probation, imposed a fine, and reprimanded her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">150 Md.App. at 142-46, 819 A.2d at 385-87 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Spencer then filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that she had been deprived of procedural due process because Mr. Ades and Ms. Schneider participated both as representatives of the Board in settlement negotiations and as members of the panel adjudicating her case. Agreeing with Spencer\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ments, the Circuit Court vacated and reversed the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order. The Circuit Court ruled that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s decision; that the Board\u2019s renewal of Spencer\u2019s license pending the outcome of the investigation operated as a waiver of the violations subsequently found by the Board; and that Spencer had been deprived of due process as a result of the arguments that took place at the Board hearing between her attorney and two Board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The Board appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the Circuit Court that Spencer was denied her right to a fair and unbiased hearing, focusing on Ms. Hawkins\u2019 accusation that Spencer\u2019s counsel was a \u201cbold-faced liar.\u201d The intermediate appellate court reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling that the Board\u2019s renewal of Spencer\u2019s license had foreclosed the Board from taking disciplinary action against her. Consequently, it remanded the case to the Circuit Court \u201cwith instructions to remand the case to the Board, directing [the Board] to delegate the authority to conduct the contested case hearing and to issue the final administrative decision in this case to the OAH.\u201d 150 Md.App. at 155, 819 A.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Spencer then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court. 376 Md. 49, 827 A.2d 112 (2003). Although petitioner has phrased the first question for our review as whether the Court of Special Appeals, by its order to the administrative agency to refer the case to the OAH, violated Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 10-205 of the APA, a more accurate way of formulating the question, as we explain <em>infra, </em>is whether the Court of Special Appeals afforded the administrative agency the proper level of deference in a matter committed to the agency\u2019s discretion. Petitioner\u2019s second question is whether the order to remand the matter to the OAH contravened either <em>res judicata </em>or double jeopardy principles as applied to administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals exceeded its judicial authority when it fashioned a remedy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>interfered with the Board\u2019s discretion to determine whether her case should be remanded to the OAH. She contends that the Court of Special Appeals violated Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights in ordering the Board to send the case to the OAH, because in so doing, that court performed a \u201cnonjudicial function,\u201d violating the constitutional mandate that the power of the three branches of government in Maryland \u201cbe forever separate and distinct.\u201d <em>See Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 334 A.2d 514 (1975). Petitioner also argues that because \u00a7 10-205 of the APA does not explicitly authorize the courts to delegate matters to the OAH, the Court of Special Appeals did not have authority to do so. Although the Board, as respondent, initially opposed these arguments in its Answer to Petition for Writ of Certiorari, in its brief, respondent reversed course and now agrees with petitioner that the Court of Special Appeals performed a non-judicial function in violation of Article 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">This Court, of course, is not bound by the concessions made by the parties on issues of law, which we may independently review. <em>See In re Heather B., </em>369 Md. 257, 266 n. 9, 799 A.2d 397, 402 n. 9 (2002). But we agree with both parties that the Court of Special Appeals exceeded its authority when it compelled the Board to exercise discretion the Legislature explicitly granted to the administrative agency. We therefore will reverse in part the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment and remand the matter to the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">EL</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We address first the procedural and analytical posture of this case as it comes before this Court. When this Court sits in review of an administrative agency decision, we reevalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ate the decision of the agency under the same statutory standards as would the circuit court; we do not employ those standards to reevaluate the decision of the circuit or intermediate appellate court. <em>See Division of Labor v. Triangle General Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 416, 784 A.2d 534, 539 (2001); <em>Dept. of Health v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051, 1060 (2001) (noting that it is the final decision at the administrative level, not the decision of the reviewing court, which is the focus of each level of judicial review). Thus, as to the merits of such a matter, ordinarily and primarily, the inquiry is not whether the Court of Special Appeals erred, but whether the administrative agency erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In the present case, in what way might the Board have erred? The answer to this question lies with the two disputed administrative actions taken by the Board that were reversed by the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner\u2019s original motion to the Board requested either (a) that her case be referred to the Office of Administrative Hearings or, in the alternative, (b) that the Board members who participated in the settlement negotiations recuse themselves. Petitioner asked the Circuit Court to review both the denial of the recusal motion and the denial of the motion to remove to the OAH. These two denials by the Board constitute the two administrative decisions which petitioner asked the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, disagreeing with the Board\u2019s denial of both of those requests, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cIn light of the actions by the Board that caused an appearance of impropriety in the proceedings in this case before the Board, this Court holds that the circuit court did not err by finding that appellee was denied due process in that hearing. Consequently, we remand this case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with instructions to remand the case to the Board, directing appellant to delegate the authority to conduct the contested case hearing and to issue the final administrative decision in this case to the OAH.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>150 Md.App. at 155, 819 A.2d at 393. Critical to understanding this case is the observation that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s analysis amounted to a simultaneous review of <em>two separate administrative actions: </em>(1) the Board\u2019s failure to recuse certain members of the panel and (2) the Board\u2019s failure to refer the case to the OAH. Although the Court of Special Appeals apparently considered the agency\u2019s failure to recuse the biased panel members to go hand-in-hand with the failure to refer the case to the OAH, we think it clear that the determination that \u201cthe actions of the Board members created an appearance of impropriety and unfairness\u201d is separate and distinct from the determination that \u201cthe case must be retried before [the OAH].\u201d For even if the Board was required to recuse the biased members from the adjudicating panel, it was not logically bound to refer the case to the OAH. The Board could have easily complied with the court\u2019s judgment by replacing the biased members, yet persisted in its decision to forgo the OAH. Thus, those determinations were two distinct decisions by the agency, both of which were reviewed by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">With respect to the agency decision denying the recusal motion, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthe actions by the Board that caused an appearance of impropriety in the proceedings in this case before the Board ... denied [petitioner] due process in that hearing.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 559, 625 A.2d 914, 923 (1993) (stating that \u201c[procedural due process, guaranteed to persons in this State by Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, requires that administrative agencies performing adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions observe basic principles of fairness as to parties appearing before them\u201d). Petitioner, of course, is satisfied with that ruling and did not raise that issue in the petition for certiorari, and neither did respondent cross-petition on that issue. Accordingly, we do not review that ruling by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Mehrling v. Nationwide, </em>371 Md. 40, 44 n. 3, 806 A.2d 662, 665 n. 3 (2002) (noting that the Court of Appeals will not normally address a question not presented in petition for certiorari), and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>remand, the Board must adhere to the court\u2019s ruling as it bears on the defects in procedural due process at petitioner\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It is the second administrative decision taken by the Board, and its review by the Court of Special Appeals, that concerns us in the case <em>sub judice. </em>By this we mean the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding \u201cdirecting [the Board] to delegate the authority to conduct the contested case hearing and to issue the final administrative decision in this case to the OAH.\u201d The key point here is that the Court of Special Appeals judicially reviewed the Board\u2019s decision to deny the motion to refer the case to the OAH, and it found that decision to be wanting. The court\u2019s reasoning behind its determination is made in a footnote to its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cWe recognize that \u2018under the APA, the delegation of matters to the OAH is not a mandatory function but a function within the discretion of the administrative agency.\u2019 <em>[Regan v. Board of Chiropractic, </em>120 Md.App. 494, 513, 707 A.2d 891, 900 (1998).] In light of the facts of this particular case, however, it would not be appropriate to remand the case to the same tribunal that heard the case originally. * * * In this case, we have held that the actions of the Board members created an appearance of impropriety and unfairness, and for that reason, the case must be retried before a different tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">150 Md.App. at 156 n.14, 819 A.2d at 393 n.14. We do not think it so obvious that this case \u201cmust\u201d be retried before the OAH, and the Court of Special Appeals did not discuss the appropriate standard of judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision not to refer. Because the Court of Special Appeals did not consider the appropriate standard of judicial review and whether, under that standard, the agency\u2019s decision must be overturned, that task is now before this Court, as we sit in review of the agency\u2019s action and not so much the decision by the intermediate appellate court. Therefore, this case requires us (1) to determine the proper standard of review to apply to the Board\u2019s decision not to refer the case to the OAH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>and (2) applying that standard, to determine whether the Board\u2019s decision should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Whether the administrative agency\u2019s refusal to delegate to the OAH was improper requires us to determine the standard of review for such an agency decision. The standard of review for an agency decision, in turn, will depend upon the level of discretion delegated to the administrative agency with respect to such decisions. <em>See MTA v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 293-94, 799 A.2d 1246, 1257 (2002) (Wilner, J., concurring); <em>Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 280-81, 40 A.2d 673, 677 (1945); <em>see generally </em>A. Rochvarg, <em>Maryland Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4.29-4.38 (2001); E. Tomlinson, <em>The Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, </em>56 Md. L.Rev. 196 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">To discover the proper standard of judicial review, we begin with the APA. Because this case involves an agency acting in a \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d capacity, adjudicating the personal rights of petitioner, judicial review is governed by \u00a7 10-222, which is applicable to final decisions in contested cases. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-222(a). Were we reviewing the agency acting in its policy-making or \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d capacity, a wholly different analysis governs the decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-125; <em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 654 A.2d 449 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Section 10-222(h) governs the scope of judicial review of final administrative agency decisions in contested cases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">(h) <em>Decision. </em>\u2014 In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Section 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(vi) provides a statutory framework for understanding the scope of judicial review of agency decisions and is of particular interest to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Section 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(iv) deals with judicial review of agency conclusions of law. Section 10-222(h)(3)(v) deals with judicial review of agency factual determinations. Section 10-222(h)(3)(vi) deals with judicial review of any other agency determination\u2014 for instance, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>determinations over matters committed to the agency\u2019s discretion. Our jurisprudence has expanded on the meaning of these statutory provisions and provided guidance for their application by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">When an agency makes \u201cconclusions of law\u201d in a contested case, the court, on judicial review, decides the correctness of the agency\u2019s conclusions and may substitute the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency\u2019s. <em>Total AV v. Dept. of Labor, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124, 127-28 (2000) (noting that questions of law addressed by administrative agency are completely subject to review by courts, although agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute may be entitled to some deference).. This established principle of administrative law is exemplified in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(iv), which permits judicial modification or reversal of agency action that (i) is unconstitutional; (ii) exceeds the agency\u2019s jurisdiction; (iii) results from unlawful procedure; or (iv) is affected by \u201cany other\u201d error of law. <em>See </em>Tomlinson, <em>supra, </em>at 215 n. 131 (\u201cQuestions of law encompass the first four grounds listed in the judicial review provision of the APA\u201d). Section 10-222(h)(3)(iv), by authorizing correction of <em>\u201cany other </em>error of law,\u201d implicitly indicates (a) that courts retain authority to correct <em>all </em>(\u201cany\u201d) errors of law and (b) an understanding that agency errors based upon the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>three provisions are also considered to be <em>legal </em>errors (\u201cany <em>other </em>error of <em>law </em>\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In contrast, when an agency is not interpreting law but instead makes a \u201cfinding of fact,\u201d we have applied \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review. Substantial evidence review of agency factual findings is embodied in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v). That provision grants a court authority to overrule an agency\u2019s factual finding only when the finding is \u201cunsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted.\u201d According to this more deferential standard of review, judicial review of agency factual findings is limited to ascertaining whether a reasoning mind could have reached the same factual conclusions reached by the agency on the record before it. <em>See Stansbury v. Jones, </em>372 Md. 172, 182-185, 812 A.2d 312, 318-320 (2002) (discussing substantial evidence review in Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, there are circumstances when an agency acts neither as a finder of fact nor as an interpreter of law but rather in a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d capacity. <em>See, e.g., Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 625 A.2d 914. Logically, the courts owe a higher level of deference to functions specifically committed to the agency\u2019s discretion than they do to an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or factual findings. Therefore, the discretionary functions of the agency must be reviewed under a standard more deferential than either the <em>de novo </em>review afforded an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or the substantial evidence review afforded an agency\u2019s factual findings. In this regard, the standard set forth in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(vi), review of \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d agency actions, provides guidance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the courts as they seek to apply the correct standard of review to discretionary functions of the agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">This Court recently applied the arbitrary or capricious standard of review to discretionary functions of the agency in a case closely analogous to this one. <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler </em>involved an administrative agency\u2019s decision to reopen a hearing after it had already begun deliberations on the matter. In that case, we first determined that the decision to reopen a hearing for additional evidence was committed to the agency\u2019s discretion. 330 Md. at 557-58, 625 A.2d at 922. As a discretionary function of the agency, the decision to reopen the hearing, we said, was subject to judicial review, but only under the arbitrary or capricious standard. Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201c[A]s long as an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and other constitutional requirements, it is ordinarily unreviewable by the courts. It is only when an agency\u2019s exercise of discretion, in an adjudicatory proceeding, is \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018capricious\u2019 that courts are authorized to intervene [citing the provision now codified as 10 \u2014 222(h)(vi), the arbitrary and capricious standard of review].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Similarly, in <em>MTA v. King, </em>we held that an agency\u2019s discretion to determine the magnitude of a sanction could only be reviewed pursuant to \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(vi), <em>ie., </em>for arbitrariness or eaprieiousness. 369 Md. at 291, 799 A.2d at 1255-56. Even if the court felt the punishment to be \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the violation, the agency\u2019s determination of the amount or level of sanction could not be second-guessed, unless the sanction \u201cwas so extreme and egregious that the reviewing court can properly deem the decision to be \u2018arbitrary or capricious,\u2019\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(h)(3)(vi). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>does not differ significantly from <em>Zeigler </em>or <em>King </em>in that the decision being reviewed is also one committed to the agency\u2019s discretion and is to be reviewed under the same arbitrary or capricious standard set forth in 10-222(h)(3)(vi). Whether an action is in fact deemed arbitrary or capricious will vary depending upon the amount of discretion granted an agency, a matter of substantive law, <em>see King, </em>369 Md. at 293-94, 799 A.2d at 1257 (Wilner, J., concurring); thus, the level of discretion afforded an agency\u2019s decision to reopen a hearing, as in <em>Zeigler, </em>may differ from the discretion afforded an agency\u2019s decision to forgo the OAH, as in the instant case. Arbitrary and capricious review will apply to both types of decisions, but whether the agency\u2019s decision in each case is actually arbitrary or capricious will correspond to the discretion afforded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Applying the legal principles outlined above, we hold that (1) the determination by an agency to refer a case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>OAH is a matter committed to its discretion and that (2) the Board did not abuse that discretion under the arbitrary or capricious standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">First, it is clear that the Board\u2019s refusal to refer the case to the OAH was not a legal conclusion or a factual finding but rather a function of the Board\u2019s discretion. The discretion is granted to the Board in \u00a7 10-205(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which declares an \u201cagency <em>may </em>delegate to the Office [of Administrative Hearings] the authority\u201d (emphasis added) to hear the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The word \u201cmay\u201d connotes a permissive, discretionary function of the agency when it delegates a case to the OAH. <em>See Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235, 1237 (1990); <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm. v. Silkor Development Corp., </em>246 Md. 516, 522, 229 A.2d 135, 139 (1967) (construing the word \u201cmay\u201d to signal the ordinary meaning of permission unless the context or the purpose of the statute shows that it is meant to be imperative); <em>see also Regan, </em>120 Md.App. at 513, 707 A.2d at 900 (noting that under the APA, the delegation of matters to the OAH is not a mandatory function but a function within the discretion of the administrative agency). Nor was the Board <em>required </em>to send the case to the OAH, because logically there existed other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>options to the Board, such as recusing the offending members and replacing them with different members, or, pursuant to \u00a7 10 \u2014 205(b), referring to the OAH the authority to make a proposed decision but retaining for itself the ultimate authority to decide the case. In fact, the Board may very well decide to send the case to the OAH; but if it does so, it shall not be under the auspices or compulsion of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Second, it is clear that the Board\u2019s decision to forgo the OAH was not arbitrary or capricious. An agency\u2019s prerogative with respect to case referral to the OAH is similar in scope to that of the agency\u2019s prerogative in determining the severity of sanctions, <em>see King, </em>369 Md. at 291, 799 A.2d at 1255-56; <em>Resetar v. State Bd. of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 562, 399 A.2d 225, 238 (1979) (\u201cIt is impossible to catalogue just what would or would not constitute arbitrary action on the part of an administrative agency ... in imposing sanctions\u201d), or to that of forgoing prosecution of a particular individual. In such cases, it is most difficult to apply or even articulate a judicial standard by which the agency\u2019s discretionary decision might be deemed arbitrary or capricious, <em>cf. Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (holding that the FDA\u2019s decision not to take enforcement actions was not subject to judicial review under the federal APA because such enforcement decisions are \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d and do not supply the courts with \u201claw to apply,\u201d that is, a legal standard to which the agency can be held). The reviewing court, absent some showing of fraud or egregious behavior on behalf of the agency, will be hard pressed to articulate a reason why the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it did not send the case to the OAH. This is true for the case before us today. Even conceding the error of the Board\u2019s failure to recuse certain members from the panel, that alone does not suffice to render arbitrary or capricious the Board\u2019s decision not to refer to the OAH. The Court of Special Appeals erred when it reviewed this discretionary function and found the agency wanting and incapable of conducting a fair hearing and rendering a fair decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>To be sure, because of the nature of the Board members participating, it was improper for those members who participated in the settlement negotiations to remain as panel members adjudicating petitioner\u2019s case, and those members may not constitute a part of the panel if or when petitioner\u2019s case is reheard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But that did not by itself require referral to the OAH, as any number of other options lay open to the Board. The proper course, in view of the Board\u2019s discretion to refer, was to remand the case to the Board with instructions to cure the defects the reviewing court found at the original hearing, but without a mandate requiring referral of the case to the OAH. That is what we shall do, and the lower court\u2019s direction regarding referral of the case to the OAH is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument, that a remand will create issues of <em>res judicata </em>or double jeopardy, is without merit and frivolous. The Board\u2019s enforcement of its licensing and disciplinary requirements serve purposes essential to the protection of the public, which are deemed remedial, rather than punitive, and therefore are not subject to double jeopardy principles. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 235, 666 A.2d 128 (1995); <em>Ward v. Dept. of Pub. Saf. &amp; Cor. Services, </em>339 Md. 343, 350, 663 A.2d 66, 69 (1995) (holding that where the purpose of the penalty is remedial, it is not punishment for double jeopardy purposes); <em>McDonnell v. Comm\u2019n on Medi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>cal Discipline, 301 </em>Md. 426, 436, 483 A.2d 76, 81 (1984) (noting that the \u201cpurpose of disciplinary proceedings against licensed professionals is not to punish the offender but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public\u201d). Even if double jeopardy was applicable, which it is not, the rehearing would not be precluded, as a new trial (or rehearing) ordinarily is not precluded by double jeopardy principles when a conviction is reversed on grounds other than sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Huffington v. State, </em>302 Md. 184, 189, 486 A.2d 200, 203 (1983). The remand was not based on insufficiency of evidence but on defects in procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Neither is <em>res judicata </em>applicable in this case because there is no final judgment \u2014 the case is still on appellate review \u2014 and because issue and claim preclusion require a subsequent cause of action in which those doctrines may take effect; this appeal is not a subsequent cause of action but all part of the same case. <em>See Murray International v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502, 504 (1989) (noting that <em>res judicata </em>principles preserve the conclusive effect of judgments, \u201cexcept on appeal or other direct review,\u201d and quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982) that \u201c[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART.

Because of the reasoning of our opinion, we will decline to address the constitutional arguments posed by the parties, for this Court regularly has adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can be disposed of properly on a non-constitutional ground. <em>Piscatelli v.

Even in the case of an agency interpreting law, our jurisprudence has shown a level of deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of law, provided the agency is interpreting its own regulations, <em>MTA v. King </em>369 Md. 274, 288-89, 799 A.2d 1246, 1254 (2002), or is interpreting the statute it administers, <em>Jordan v. Hebbville, </em>369 Md. 439, 450, 800 A.2d 768, 775 (2002). Nevertheless, erroneous interpretations of law are never binding upon the courts. <em>State Ethics v. Antonetti, </em>365 Md. 428, 447, 780 A.2d 1154, 1166 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-5\">. Although a few of our cases appear to conflate substantial evidence review with arbitrary or capricious review, <em>see, e.g., Insurance Comm'r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau of Cas. Underwriters, </em>248 Md. 292, 300-01, 236 A.2d 282, 286 (1967), it does not follow that they are one and the same. The substantial evidence test applies to agency findings of fact, as indicated by the very language of \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v) (\u201cevidence\u201d supported by the whole \u201crecord\u201d). Arbitrary and capricious review, on the other hand, could conceivably apply to any action of the agency not covered by the other provisions of \u00a7 10-222(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We do not encounter, or decide, this issue of whether the arbitrary and capricious standard in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(vi) will govern every type of agency action not encompassed by \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i)(v). <em>See Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 569-570, 625 A.2d 914, 928 (1993) (Bell, J., dissenting); A. Rochvarg, <em>Maryland Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 4.38 (2001). It is notable, however, that in contrast to the first five grounds for judicial review in \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(v), \u00a7 10 \u2014 222(h)(3)(vi) does not delineate the <em>type </em>of agency decision to which it applies, <em>cf. </em>\u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(iv) (implicitly and necessarily involving <em>legal </em>determinations by the agency); \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(vi) (explicitly applying to evidentiary, factual findings), and could conceivably be a \"catch-all\u201d standard of review for any other agency action. And even in the absence of an applicable statutory scheme providing for judicial review, we have held an implied limitation upon an administrative agency\u2019s authority is that its decisions \"be not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Bucktail, LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 550, 723 A.2d 440, 449 (1999); see also our line of cases explaining mandamus actions as they apply to ministerial or non-discretionary functions of administrative agencies, discussed in <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, 273 </em>Md. 486, 500-504, 331 A.2d 55, 65-66 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-5\">. Section 10-205(b) provides for the delegation of a contested case to the OAH:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">(b) <em>Scope of authority delegated. </em>\u2014 An agency may delegate to the Office [of Administrative Hearings] the authority to issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">(1) proposed or final findings of fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">(2) proposed or final conclusions of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">(3) proposed or final findings of fact and conclusions of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">(4) proposed or final orders or orders under Article 49B of the Code; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">(5) the final administrative decision of an agency in a contested case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b560-12\">. Although it is our understanding that, as a matter of practice, most state agencies subject to the APA exercise their authority to delegate duties to the OAH by regulation or administrative order and usually in broad categories of case types, there appears no reason why an agency may not do so on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis in a given case. We do not here address whether an agency's violation of its own established protocol with regard to OAH delegation may somehow amount to arbitrary or capricious agency action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\">. We do not adopt a <em>per se </em>rule of recusal, nor do we intend our holding or comments to imply that recusal is mandatory when a trial judge participates in settlement negotiations. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-813, Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3 (setting forth the situations requiring mandatory recusal); <em>see also </em>Annot., <em>Judge\u2019s Comments-Urging Settlement, </em>6 A.L.R.3d 1457 (1966).

The Board considered the settlement negotiations in rendering its final decision, noting in the Order that \"[a]lthough the Respondent agreed to a proposal at the conference, she later rejected it.\u201d It is the overall appearance of impropriety in this case that requires recusal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
