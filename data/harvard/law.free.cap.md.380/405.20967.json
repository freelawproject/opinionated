Cadigan, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, for hearing, Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to find facts and draw conclusions of law. <em>See </em>16-757(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Following the hearing, at which the complainant, Wilbert Myles, the complainant\u2019s supervisor and the respondent, both for himself and in the petitioner\u2019s case, all testified, the hearing court concluded that the respondent violated the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>charged. Those conclusions were based on the findings of fact made by the court, after summarizing the testimony, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">\u201c1. <em>The Incident of May 10,2002</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s testimony (hereinafter \u201cLink\u201d) is best summarized by his letter directed to Mr. Grossman dated July 4, 2002 introduced as Plaintiffs Exhibit 1(E)____<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201cIn addition, Link testified at the hearing that he has been a member of the Maryland Bar since 1990. He engages in a general practice working out of his home in Cockeysville. His practice emphasizes personal injury litigation. He employs no associates, paralegals or secretaries. Approximately 90% of his personal injury clients are African American. Link is Caucasian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cIn his testimony. Link alluded to \u2018problems\u2019 he previously encountered at the MVA in Towson when a clerk informed him he was not entitled to certain information \u2018because of the Privacy Act.\u2019 Following calls to one of the \u2018higher-ups\u2019 at MVA, Link concluded that the \u2018whole MVA system is imbued with violations of the Maryland Public Information Act.\u2019 He referred to another prior incident with a \u2018government employee\u2019 following which he asked to see the employee\u2019s supervisor. He indicates that his conversation with the supervisor \u201cwas not friendly.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cWhen Link went to the MVA office in Mondawmin on May 10, 2002 he was \u2018hoping\u2019 they would give him the insurance coverage information he needed but he \u201cwondered\u2019 if the MVA was \u2018persisting in its policy\u2019 of non-disclosure because of the Privacy Act. He purposely dressed causally because he wanted to see \u2018how ordinary people are treated.\u2019 He is \u2018appalled\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>by the way he and others are \u2018treated poorly.\u2019 Link admitted that he has had \u2018difficulty\u2019 with other agencies. His \u2018standard\u2019 is not to \u2018back-down\u2019 but rather \u2018go into the mouth of the beast.\u2019 Link stated in closing argument that the MVA is a \u2018criminal organization\u2019 and is \u2018acting illegally.\u2019 He argued that \u2018its all about the little guy ... taking on the government ... whistle-blowing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">\u201cAs stated in Link\u2019s July 4, 2002 letter (Plaintiffs Exhibit 1(E)), he testified that the MVA Customer Service Agent, Wilbert Myles (hereinafter \u2018Myles\u2019) was rude and curt. After being asked by Myles if he was an attorney and to produce identification. Link admits that he told Myles and his supervisor, Ms. Ryce, (hereinafter \u2018Ryce\u2019) that Myles was incompetent, didn\u2019t know the law and \u2018needs to be trained properly.\u2019 He admits that he called Myles \u2018a loathsome bureaucrat.\u2019 In his testimony, he stated Myles is \u2018rude, arrogant, incompetent and lazy____ He doesn\u2019t know the law ... he acted like a complete fool ... he was shouting ... like a complete idiot.\u2019 Link contends that his right to tell an employee how he is doing his job is protected by the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cWhen Myles refused to give Link his name, he admits that he said \u2018OK, Sparky, I\u2019ve had enough of your nonsense-let me talk to your supervisor.\u2019 Link testified that \u2018Sparky\u2019 is a \u2018meaningless term ... for someone whose name you don\u2019t know . .. it\u2019s a filler. I would usually say \u201cpartner.\u201d I am being condescending ... the term \u201csir\u201d is a form of respect and I had absolutely none.\u2019 Link denied any knowledge that \u2018Sparky\u2019 has any racial connotation or is in any way racially offensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">\u201cFinally, Link testified that he \u2018calmly answered Mr. Myles\u2019 silly questions\u2019 and never raised his voice during the May 2002 encounter but rather was verbally abused by Myles. Link contends that his conduct was \u2018impeccable.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">\u2018Wilbert Myles testified that he is 61 years old and has been a Customer Service Agent with MVA for nine years. He previously worked as a Senior Assistant Underwriter with USF &amp; G for 15 years. He has had \u201cfour major surgeries\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and takes \u2018nine pills a day\u2019 including a \u2018heart pill.\u2019 Myles is an African American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">\u201cOn May 10, 2002 Link approached Myles\u2019 work station and gave him an application for a driver\u2019s record in which he had checked off \u2018registration records.\u2019 According to MVA policy, Myles requested Link\u2019s driver\u2019s license as identification. When asked \u2018why\u2019 by Link, Myles responded that without identification, he could not give Link the requested information because of the Privacy Act. Myles explained that attorneys can get a complete driver\u2019s record including name and address. Myles then inquired as to whether Link was an attorney. Link responded \u201cwhat difference does it make?\u2019 Myles offered an explanation which was in accord with his training manual. Link then stated that Myles was \u2018breaking the law' in not providing the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cMyles described Link\u2019s demeanor as \u2018very smug and pretentious.\u2019 Based upon Mr. Myles\u2019 \u201cwork experience\u2019, he suspected that Link was an attorney because they \u2018have certain airs.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cMyles testified that when Link continued the \u2018name calling ... the maligning and the indignities that he hurled at me\u2019, Myles stated \u2018you need to see the supervisor.\u2019 Link stated \u2018you need to bring someone out here ... because obviously you don\u2019t know what you are doing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">\u201cBefore the supervisor (Ryce) was summonsed, Myles testified that Link called him \u2018Sparky\u2019 several more times. Myles took offense and protested that that was not his name and that Link\u2019s comment was demeaning, sarcastic, disrespectful and insulting. He stated that he was humiliated, upset, infuriated and embarrassed. Myles further testified that \u2018Sparky\u2019 is just another name for the N word for \u2018most people of color at my age or older.\u2019 As Myles left his work station to speak with his supervisor, he states that Link \u2018threw his driver\u2019s license\u2019 on the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cWhen Myles went to his supervisor\u2019s office, she was on the telephone with customers. She placed the customer on \u2018hold a minute\u2019 and Myles told her \u201cwhat had happened.\u2019 When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>supervisor appeared, Myles testified that Link stated \u2018what took you so long?\u2019 At the point, he stated Link was \u2018irate\u2019 and told the supervisor that \u2018Sparky over here doesn\u2019t know his job\u2019 and that he should be retrained because he doesn\u2019t know the law and is incompetent. Myles states that Link told his supervisor that \u2018... the system needs to hire folk who have a brain because everyone I have encountered throughout the system does not have one and they are completely incompetent.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u201cMyles further testified that Link asked his supervisor for his name. She gave his last name. He then asked for his first name and she replied \u2018Wilbert.\u2019 Thereafter Link continued \u2018to yell\u2019 and proceeded to refer to Myles as Wilbert which he found to be offensive and disrespectful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cIn his supervisor\u2019s presence, Link \u2018proceeded to yell across the counter and pointing his finger, Wilbert, you have broken the law\u2019 and stated that he \u2018could be brought up on charges and that type of thing.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cMyles admitted that he has not read the Privacy Act or the Maryland Public Information Act but states his training manual contains all relevant information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cAfter hearing Myles\u2019 testimony, Link later testified that Myles was \u2018a liar\u2019 and that Myles was \u2018incredibly rude, feisty, mean\u2019 and like the \u2018Energizer bunny.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cDelease Ryce has been a Customer Agent with MVA since 1988. She was Myles\u2019 supervisor at the Mondawmin office in May 2002. While she was on the telephone, Myles came to her office and told her that an attorney refused to show his identification. She had heard \u2018voices\u2019 but couldn\u2019t hear the conversations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">\u201cAbout five to ten minutes later, she left her office and went to Myles\u2019 work station. Both Myles and Link were \u2018going at it\u2019. Both were being \u2018rude\u2019 to each other. Their voices were not in a \u2018conversational\u2019 tone. She asked Myles to be quiet and \u2018let me handle it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cShe believes Link asked her-Vhat took you so long?\u2019 She replied that she was talking on the phone with two customers. She thinks Link said \u2018you need to hire a competent person.\u2019 Link said \u2018explain to me why I had to wait ten minutes.\u2019 She replied that \u2018you didn\u2019t produce any identification.\u2019 She explained to Link that everyone has to show identification. She asked Link Vhat kind of report do you need?\u2019 She then gave him the information he had requested. She testified that Link was not rude to her. She believes Myles was \u2018retaliating.\u2019 Myles only \u2018retaliated\u2019 when Link said something to him. It was \u2018back and forth\u2019 between Myles and Link.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201cShe stated that Link asked her for Myles\u2019 name. When she did so. Link referred to Myles as \u2018Wilbert.\u2019 She did not hear Link call Myles \u2018Sparky.\u2019 Ryce is an African American.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe above summary of Link\u2019s testimony includes his testimony presented at the conclusion of Bar Counsel\u2019s case. In addition, Link did state that Myles was incredibly \u2018rude\u2019 to three customers who were in fine before Link and he \u2018sensed\u2019 that Myles was \u2018going to be trouble.\u2019 He claims Myles \u2018demanded\u2019 Link\u2019s identification and gave Link a \u2018hate stare.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Link states that Myles never told him that \u2018Sparky' was a racially offensive epithet. Link claims that he \u2018gets along with black people.\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201c2. <em>Findings of Facts</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201cAfter considering the testimony presented at the hearing before this Court on July 30, 2003 and reviewing the exhibits admitted into evidence, this Court finds the following facts by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201c1. Link casts himself in the role or protector of the ordinary citizen. He believes his cause is just and necessary. His agenda is to expose what he perceives to be dual standards and unfair policies of governmental agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">\u201c2. This was not an isolated incident. Link had a pattern of past confrontations with agency personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u201c3. Link pursues his agenda with design and purposely provokes controversy utilizing tactics of sarcasm, verbal abuse, offensive and disrespectful language which is not protected by the First Amendment and had no substantial purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u201c4. Link\u2019s agenda is misguided and his conduct was unprofessional and prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201c5. Link\u2019s anger needs to be controlled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201c6. Link\u2019s testimony that he never raised his voice during this incident is not credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201c7. Myles is a public servant trying to do his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201c8. Myles was justifiably offended and embarrassed by Link\u2019s conduct, language and attitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201c9. Ryce\u2019s testimony raised inconsistencies in Myles\u2019 testimony. This Court accepts as credible Ryce\u2019s testimony that Myles had also raised his voice and was retaliating to Link\u2019s verbal abuse and sarcasm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u201c10. Ryce is a pleasant woman and credible witness. She was acting as a \u2018peace-maker.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201c11. Link did not know that the name \u2018Sparky\u2019 was racially offensive. Link did believe he was condescending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">\u201cThe undersigned has no personal knowledge of whether the name \u2018Sparky\u2019 is a racial epithet or is racially offensive. The undersigned has only heard the name in reference to a World War II radioman, electrician or the baseball manager, \u2018Sparky\u2019 Anderson. Accordingly, the undersigned is unable to make a finding of fact in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">\u201cIf indeed \u2018Sparky\u2019 is racially offensive, its use is obviously unprofessional, totally inappropriate and increases the seriousness and severity of the confrontation and the consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">\u201cWhether \u2018Sparky\u2019 is offensive or innocuous in and of itself depends upon the circumstances under which it is said, who said it and to whom it is directed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The petitioner filed no exceptions to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. It did file, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s Recommendation for Sanctions. Noting the hearing court\u2019s finding that the respondent\u2019s conduct was unprofessional and engaged in the pursuit of a \u201cmisguided\u201d agenda, in which the respondent, casting himself as the protector of the ordinary citizen, \u201cpursues his agenda with design and purposely provokes controversy utilizing tactics of sarcasm, verbal abuse, offensive and disrespectful language which is not protected by the First Amendment and had no substantial purpose,\u201d it recommends that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for thirty (30) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In support of that recommendation, the petitioner relies on <em>Florida Bar v. Martocci, </em>791 So.2d 1074 (Fla.2001), <em>Matter of Golden, </em>329 S.C. 335, 496 S.E.2d 619 (1998) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 565 A.2d 660 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In <em>Martocci, </em>the Bar charged that Martocci made \u201cunethical, disparaging, and profane remarks to belittle and humiliate the opposing party, Florence Berger, and her attorney ...\u201d and engaged in an unethical confrontation with the opposing party\u2019s father.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 791 So.2d at 1074. The offensive conduct occurred, it alleged, in separate incidents during the representation of the husband in divorce proceedings and spanned a period of two years. <em>Id. </em>at 1075. The referee concluded that Martocci engaged in the charged conduct, which consisted of directing demeaning, insulting and intemperate remarks<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the opposing party and her counsel and threatening, in open court, though court was not then in session, to beat that party\u2019s father. <em>Id. </em>The court accepted the referee\u2019s sanction recommendation, publicly reprimanding Martocci and placing him on two years probation, with conditions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Similarly the conduct for which the respondent attorney in <em>Golden </em>was sanctioned, was in connection with his representation of clients in divorce proceedings, specifically, at two depositions. In the first, the deposition of his client\u2019s former boyfriend, who apparently informed the husband\u2019s attorney of the former boyfriend\u2019s relationship with the wife after it was terminated on advice of Golden, Golden\u2019s examination displayed, the Hearing Panel determined, \u201chis total disregard and failure to show any respect for the rights of a third party.\u201d 496 S.E.2d at 622. Moreover, it was satisfied that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">\u201cThe extent, the intensity, the sarcasm and maliciousness, the unnecessary combativeness, the gratuitous threatening and intimidation, and the unequivocal bad manners of [Attorney\u2019s] conduct could have been for no purpose other than to embarrass or burden [Mr. Smith].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The second deposition, taken in a different case, was of the wife of Golden\u2019s client. After the deposition, she alleged that Golden said to her: \u201cYou are a mean-spirited, vicious witch and I don\u2019t like your face and I don\u2019t like your voice. What I\u2019d like, is to be locked in a room with you naked with a very sharp knife.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. Later, she stated, Golden commented: \u201cWhat we need for her [pointing to Mrs. Jones] is a big bag to put her in without the mouth cut out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The hearing panel concluded that Golden, in an agitated voice and without an attempt at humor, did call Mrs. Jones \u201cmean spirited\u201d and state that someone should be locked in a room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>with her naked and that he would like to put a bag over her without a hole for her mouth. <em>Id. </em>at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As to the first deposition, the court agreed that the attorney had violated South Carolina\u2019s version of Rule 4.4. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaJ\">\u201cAttorney\u2019s words speak for themselves[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] Even if we assume that the deposition witness was uncooperative, Attorney would not be justified abusing this witness in the manner illustrated above. The record further shows that Attorney interrupted Smith on numerous occasions. Moreover, the audio recording reveals the volume of Attorney\u2019s voice was repeatedly loud, and his statements were sarcastic, rude, or otherwise inappropriate. He acted in a threatening and demeaning manner. His conduct was outrageous and completely departed from the standards of our profession, much less basic notions of human decency and civility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The court concurred with the hearing panel\u2019s conclusion that Golden\u2019s conduct after the second deposition violated Rule 8.4(d), as it was prejudicial to the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>justice. <em>Id. </em>at 623. Noting \u201cthe serious nature of the issues and highly charged atmosphere of the deposition,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cAttorney\u2019s comments only served to insult an adverse party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The court imposed as a sanction for both counts a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Violations of Rules 4.4 and 8.4(d) were found and sustained in <em>Alison. </em>The Rule 4.4 violation was premised on the respondent\u2019s issuance of a subpoena to a newspaper reporter for the purpose, the hearing court found, of harassing him and preventing his reporting on the respondent\u2019s trial. 317 Md. at 539, 565 A.2d at 668. The 8.4(d) violation was premised, <em>inter alia, </em>on the behavior of the respondent toward District Court clerks. When the clerks refused, in compliance with a judge\u2019s order, to accept for filing papers tendered by the respondent post judgment, the respondent demanded, \u201cyou have to take the fucking papers,\u201d and in their presence, used other profanities, including referring to the attorney for his opponent as a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and an \u201casshole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 565 A.2d at 663-64. As he left the area, he said \u201cfuck you\u201d to the supervisor. The respondent was suspended from the practice of law for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">With respect to the Rule 4.4 violation, the Court rejected the only challenge to its inapplicability, the respondent\u2019s argument, that it did not apply due to the fact that he was not representing a client, only himself. It recognized, in connection with the Rule 8.4 violation involving the verbal abuse of the District Court clerks, that there is a difference between hurling epithets during a judicial proceeding and engaging in the same conduct outside the courtroom. 317 Md. at 536-537, 565 A.2d at 666. The Court pointed out, nevertheless, that while \u201c[attorneys are not prohibited from using profane or vulgar language at all times and under all circumstances, they are prohibited from using such language when to do so would be prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 565 A.2d at 667, citing <em>In re Williams, </em>414 N.W.2d 394, 397 (Minn.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Assuming that the respondent\u2019s words directed to the clerks were protected speech within the meaning of the First Amendment, the Court held that his speech and conduct on that occasion did not comply with the reasonable, necessary, and content-neutral restrictions imposed upon attorneys by the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 537, 565 A.2d at 666-667. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u2018We have no hesitancy in concluding that Alison\u2019s conduct in his professional dealings with the clerks was prejudicial to the administration of justice. It is not difficult to visualize the damage to the court system and to the reputation of the legal profession that would result if attorneys were free to conduct their daily business with court clerks in the manner employed by Alison. This court has not only the authority but the obligation to censure conduct of this kind by an attorney. As in the case of speech within a courtroom, the restrictions are content-neutral, reasonable, necessary, and do not contravene First Amendment rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 538, 565 A.2d at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The respondent filed exceptions to the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of the hearing court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To say that the respondent disagrees with the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact is to engage in understatement. Indeed, what he thinks of the hearing court\u2019s fact finding is summarized quite early in his submission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201c2. The blatant piece of advocacy for the Commission masquerading as a Memorandum Opinion by Judge Cadigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>is disgraceful. It goes beyond rubber-stamping and well into the realm of overt cheerleading for the Commission. It constitutes the actions of a shameless sycophant who has openly colluded with the Commission to bring about a preordained result. It is obvious that my complete testimony was disregarded by Judge Cadigan, except for those portions which could be regarded as detrimental to my case, which were ruthlessly recorded, and frequently distorted. Mr. Myles\u2019 testimony, which was riddled with inconsistencies and numerous outright lies, was treated as holy writ.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJn\">Thereafter, the respondent details at length the various deficiencies from which he believes the Memorandum Opinion suffers, characterizing them as errors, inaccuracies and intentional distortions. In addition, the respondent accuses the hearing court of abdicating its responsibility as finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Concerning the court\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 4.4, the respondent maintains that the Rule either does not apply or is unconstitutionally vague. If the Rule does apply, he submits, his speech directed to Mr. Myles and in criticism of the government,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was protected speech, that did not disrupt the operations of a courthouse and, therefore, is not sanctiona-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ble. In any event, the respondent asserts: \u201cI had a substantial purpose in criticizing Wilbert Myles\u2019 conduct. I had no intent to embarrass, delay, or burden him. If such was the <em>result </em>of my decision to criticize a government, then the fault was his and not mine. I was delayed and burdened because of his illegal actions which did not even comply with his own training manual, let alone state or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">It is well settled that, in attorney discipline cases, we review the findings of fact of the hearing court to determine whether they are based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

On the other hand, the ultimate question, whether a lawyer has violated the professional rules, what, in other words, to make of those facts, rests with this Court. <em>Post, </em>379 Md. at 74, 839 A.2d at 726; <em>Garland, </em>345 Md. at 392, 692 A.2d at 469; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In fact, there is ample evidence in the record, which we have independently reviewed, to support each of them. To be sure, the hearing court did not address expressly each of the defenses the respondent raised or specifically reject his various contentions concerning the complaining witness\u2019s credibility. As we stated recently, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Braskey, </em>878 Md. 425, 446, 836 A.2d 605, 618 (2003), that is not required. In <em>Braskey, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cWe are unable to say why the hearing judge omitted reference to respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the February calls. It may be that the judge did not believe respondent; it may have been an oversight. In any case, even if the judge believed respondent, the hearing judge is not required to recount all of the evidence presented at the hearing. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Granger, </em>374 Md. 438, 453, 823 A.2d 611, 620 (2003) (noting that \u201cit is elementary that the hearing judge \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon\u2019 \u201d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The respondent\u2019s exceptions, to the extent that they challenge the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Turning to the question of whether, as the petitioner contends, the respondent violated Rules 4.4 and 8.4(d) or, as the respondent maintains, the rules do not apply or he did not violate them, we have been referred to no case, and we have found none, in which the conduct sought to be sanctioned occurred under circumstances similar to those sub judice. In the cases on which the petitioner relies, including <em>Alison, </em>and the cases we have found, <em>see In the Matter of Weir, </em>668 N.E.2d 679 (Ind.1996); <em>In the Matter of Burns, </em>657 N.E.2d 738 (Ind.1995); <em>In the Matter of Vincenti, </em>114 N.J. 275, 554 A.2d 470 (1989); <em>In the Matter of McAlevy, </em>69 N.J. 349, 354 A.2d 289 (1976); <em>In the Matter of Mezzacca, </em>67 N.J. 387, 340 A.2d 658 (1975), the offending conduct occurred during the actual litigation process or while interviewing clients or others in connection with litigation or potential litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Thus, in <em>Burns, </em>the conduct for which the attorney was sanctioned consisted of threatening behavior and remarks made to a party to the litigation during the recess of a pretrial hearing. More specifically, the attorney said, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP8\">\u201cLet me ... let me warn you about something. If you file anything with the bankruptcy court against me, I\u2019ll be asking for attorney fees and punitive damages. You have my word on it, ... And the next time you write my client a letter, I\u2019m not going to file anything with the Court; I\u2019m going to come over to your house and I\u2019m going to hit you in the head with a baseball bat. Now, you may not be practicing law, but you know better than that. If I ever find out you wrote my client a letter again or sent him anything, you\u2019ve got me to deal with. Do you understand: You better understand it right now, because I\u2019m not going to tell you a second time. Now, that\u2019s my promise to you, right here on the record. I\u2019m going to come over to your house and beat you half to death with a baseball bat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">657 N.E.2d at 739. Later, the attorney, aware that he was speaking on the record, acknowledged that he was threatening the opposing party physically, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201cYou\u2019ll either follow the rules or you\u2019ll have to deal with me. Do you understand? And if I have to tell you that again, you\u2019re going to go out of here in a hospital van. Don\u2019t press your luck, ... Don\u2019t press your luck. Because you\u2019re not going to like me if I\u2019m angry. You won\u2019t walk away from it, I guarantee you. Don\u2019t look grave to me, because if you do, you\u2019re a ... (obscenity), swear to God.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\"><em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the respondent violated Rules 4.4 and 8.4(d), reasoning: his \u201cthreatening behavior to a defendant had no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden such person. Conduct of this nature during the course of a legal proceeding is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The conduct, described by the court as rude, intimidating and disruptive, for which the respondent in <em>Mezzacca </em>was sanctioned \u2014 he was reprimanded \u2014 as in violation of Rules 4.4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and 8.4(d), occurred before an administrative review board conducting departmental hearings in connection with misconduct charges brought against the attorney\u2019s client. 340 A.2d at 658. The court summarized the offending conduct, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">\u201cWhen respondent appeared before the review board he challenged its right to hear the matter on the ground it was in no way legally constituted. He claimed the sheriff was biased against his client and was just looking for the opportunity to get rid of him. He asserted that the proceeding was a conspiracy to violate his client\u2019s civil rights and demanded that the hearing \u201cstop right now.\u201d During the course of the hearing respondent referred to the board as a \u201cKangaroo Court.\u201d He said the hearing was \u201ca waste of county money, perpetrated by a demented sheriff that thinks he is a King or a God.\u201d He characterized the members of the board as \u201cNazis, that\u2019s what you are.\u201d He told one of the members of the board that \u201cYou may have to answer to a higher tribunal than this before this is over, including the Grand Jury.\u201d He made numerous accusations as to lying and threatened several times to go to the prosecutor and have the person indicted. At one point respondent said: \u201cIf you want Mr. Jones to be indicted put him on the stand. Because I will see to it that he will be indicted. Believe me, he will be indicted.\u201d \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 658-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In <em>Vincenti, </em>the misconduct, for which the respondent was suspended for three months and until further order of court, occurred during a trial call and at the trial of a civil personal injury action that the respondent filed on behalf of his client. It consisted of engaging in a course of harassment and intimidation in an actively-litigated case in the Superior Court against his adversary and his witness, including challenging opposing counsel and his witness to a fight on several occasions, using loud, abusive, and profane language against his adversary and opposing witness, and, on at least one occasion, employing racial innuendo. 554 A.2d at 473. According to the court: \u201cThis conduct was pervasive and recurrent, continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>from the time of the trial call until after the filing of a motion for a new trial. It indisputably was, or had the clear capacity to be, disruptive, distracting, and unsettling to persons having significant responsibilities and important roles in the handling of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The respondent in <em>McAlevy </em>was sanctioned, a reprimand, for misconduct during a criminal trial. At a bench conference out of the jury\u2019s hearing, the respondent responded to the request by the Deputy Attorney General to keep his voice down with a threat of physical violence. Subsequently, during a chambers conference, in the course of an argument concerning the scope of a sequestration order, the respondent, reacting to remarks of the Deputy Attorney General, flew into a rage, \u201csprang from his chair screaming, grabbed opposing counsel by the throat and began to choke him\u201d and a melee between the two men thereafter ensued until broken up with the assistance of the judge, his law clerk and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">There were three incidents in <em>Weir. </em>In each of them, the attorney, in the presence of a third party, in each instance a woman, fondled his genitals and or masturbated. In the first, he was meeting with a defendant in his capacity as Deputy Prosecuting Attorney to discuss resolution of her case by pretrial diversion. In the second, the woman was a client who was consulting the respondent about filing bankruptcy. The third incident also involved a client, a student, who was at the time engaged in working off the fee she owed the respondent by babysitting at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In this case, the conduct in which the respondent engaged and the remarks he made to the third party, while occurring during the representation of a client and in the course of obtaining information beneficial to that client, did not occur in the courthouse or involve court personnel. Neither were the parties to the litigation or their attorneys involved in the confrontation or the objects of the respondent\u2019s conduct or remarks. And it was not during the actual litigation process or any one of its stages that the incident at issue took place. Rather, the confrontation was with, and the resulting conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>and remarks were directed at, an agent of the custodian of the records that the respondent was attempting to obtain and was the result of the respondent\u2019s perception that the requirements for accessing the information imposed by the agent were improper and even illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">To be sure, at the foundation of the rule of law is respect for the law, the courts and judges who administer it. And the attorneys who practice law and appear in the courts are officers of the court. <em>McAlevy, </em>354 A.2d at 290-291. Consistently, as Chief Justice Benham of the Georgia Supreme Court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cThe practice of law is an honorable profession that requires a high standard of conduct of its members. It is a high calling where competence, civility, community service, and public service are integral parts of the professional standards. It is not a profession where disrespectful, discourteous, and impolite conduct should be nurtured and encouraged. Such conduct should be alien to any honorable profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">\u201cThose who hold themselves out as lawyers should realize that they help shape and mold public opinion as to the role of the law and their role as lawyers. The law sets standards for society and lawyers serve as problem solvers when conflicts arise. To fulfill their responsibility as problem solvers, lawyers must exhibit a high degree of respect for each other, for the court system, and for the public. By doing so, lawyers help to enhance respect for and trust in our legal system. These notions of respect and trust are critical to the proper functioning of the legal process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"><em>Butts v. State, </em>273 Ga. 760, 546 S.E.2d 472, 485-86 (2001) (Benham, C.J., Concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">It follows, therefore, and, indeed cannot be gainsaid, that attorneys are required to act with common courtesy and civility at all times in their dealings with those concerned with the legal process, <em>McAlevy, </em>354 A.2d at 290-291, <em>see Alison, </em>317 Md. at 537, 565 A.2d at 666, and that \u201c[c]onduct calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>to intimidate and distract those who, though in an adversarial position, have independent responsibilities and important roles in the effective administration of justice cannot be countenanced.\u201d <em>Vincenti, </em>554 A.2d at 473. Thus, \u201c[v]ilification, intimidation, abuse and threats have no place in the legal arsenal[,]\u201d <em>Mezzacca, </em>340 A.2d at 659, common courtesy and civility being expected from a member of the bar whether appearing before the State\u2019s highest court, some administrative body or proceedings ancillary to, but a necessary part of, the litigation. <em>Id. </em>This is so because the effectiveness of the adversary system depends on the effectiveness of adversary counsel and because conduct characterized by \u201cthe undue and extraneous oppression and harassment of participants involved in litigation\u201d and \u201cconsciously and intentionally engage[d] in\u201d perverts advocacy. <em>Vincenti </em>554 A.2d at 473-74. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cSuch conduct redounds only to the detriment of the proper administration of justice, which depends vitally on the reasonable balance between adversaries and on opposing counsels\u2019 respect, trust, and knowledge of the adversary system. There cannot be genuine respect of the adversary system without respect for the adversary, and disrespect for the adversary system bespeaks disrespect for the court and the proper administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 474. An attorney whose conduct in the practice of law is characterized by lack of civility, good manners and common courtesy tarnishes the image of what the bar stands for. <em>McAlevy, </em>354 A.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">As indicated, this ease does not fall within this construct. The respondent was not dealing in this case with a person \u201cconcerned with the legal process;\u201d the complainant is not a party to litigation in which the respondent is attorney, nor is he a witness or opposing counsel. Moreover, the respondent\u2019s interaction with the complainant was not during the course of litigation or court proceedings; while the respondent was representing a client, he was gathering information that may become evidence in a trial and, thus, he was engaged solely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>preparation for litigation, rather than actually being involved in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Nevertheless, it is true, this Court has interpreted the phrase, \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d broader than the practice of law, to encompass \u201cconduct the lawyer engages in outside his or her role as a lawyer.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 383, 758 A.2d 117, 122 (2000). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shein-bein, </em>372 Md. 224, 251, 812 A.2d 981, 997 (2002) (\u201cthis Court has found conduct to be prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d) when there has either been conduct that is criminal in nature or conduct that relates to the practice of law\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Richardson, </em>350 Md. 354, 368, 712 A.2d 525, 532 (1998), in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cThe respondent argues that to be conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice, the act must be one that hinders or otherwise interferes with a judicial proceeding of which he is a party or represents a party. This Court has never so narrowly defined Rule 8.4(d). We have instead recognized that conduct that impacts on the image or the perception of the courts or the legal profession, <em>see Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 536, 565 A.2d 660, 666 (1989) and that engenders disrespect for the courts and for the legal profession may be prejudicial to the administration of justice. Lawyers are officers of the court and their conduct must be assessed in that light.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>We have suggested, however, but have not tested whether, a lawyer\u2019s non-criminal, purely private conduct might be a basis for discipline under Rule 8.4(d). <em>See Childress, </em>360 Md. at 385-86, 758 A.2d 117. (suggesting that, while Rule 8.4(d) has been applied in our cases only to conduct which is related to the practice of law, directly or indirectly, or when there has been a criminal conviction or conduct which is criminal in nature, a lawyer\u2019s non-criminal, purely private conduct might be a basis for discipline under the Rule, noting specifically that \u201cthe harm, or potential harm, in a stranger soliciting sex over the Internet to young girls, after imploring them to keep the meeting a secret from their parents, is patent\u201d). Because the conduct in <em>Childress </em>was arguably criminal, the issue was not addressed in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The issue must be addressed in this case. The respondent\u2019s conduct, as found by the hearing court, was rude, boorish, insensitive, oppressive and certainly insulting, but it was not even arguably criminal. Nor was the respondent engaged in a purely personal pursuit. Although he was representing a client at the time of the incident, that fact was not readily apparent or sought to be emphasized. Indeed, the respondent resisted informing the complainant that he was a lawyer. A confrontation, with resulting similar behavior by the respondent, likely would have occurred in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">To be sure, conduct of the kind exhibited by the respondent in this case when directed toward a member of the public by a lawyer negatively affects the perception of lawyers and, in that sense, may breed disrespect for the legal profession and potentially for the courts. <em>See Alison, </em>317 Md. at 536, 565 A.2d at 666. Undoubtedly, it reinforced the complainant\u2019s already negative view of lawyers. As important as civility and professionalism are as professional standards and as desirable as it is that civility and common courtesy be the rule of the day in the interpersonal relations between citizens, it is neither feasible nor desirable that every social interaction between a lawyer and a non-lawyer be regulated to insure that the lawyer acts, in each such instance, with the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>civility and courtesy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Only when such purely private conduct is criminal or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent will that conduct be considered as prejudicing, or being prejudicial to, the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">This Court considers the respondent\u2019s conduct in this case to be most inappropriate and unfortunate, and it is conduct that we do not condone. Nevertheless, it being neither criminal nor conduct of the kind that the harm or potential harm flowing from it is patent, we hold that it is not conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice and, thus, is not sanctionable.

I am afforded protection for my activities by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. One of the most sacrosanct aspects of that law, and one of the battlefields on which so many conflicts have raged against petty, tyrannical court systems that have tried unsuccessfully to invalidate the concept, is my right to criticize my government. What the Court is going to do in this case does not merely have a chilling effect on those rights-it is a blizzard. It effectively completes the downward spiral begun in the Alison case and effectively deprives 30,000 Maryland attorneys of anything remotely resembling human dignity.

In response to the Report of the Task Force on Professionalism, chaired by the Honorable Lynne Battaglia, this Court authorized, on December 16, 2003, the formation of a Professionalism Commission. Its purpose is \u201cto develop a consensus about the definition of professionalism and to examine ways to promote professionalism among Maryland\u2019s lawyers and to provide sustained attention and assistance to the task of ensuring that the practice of law remains a high calling, enlisted in the service of client and public good.\u2019\u2019 It is not intended to, and will not, be a vehicle for the micro-management of all aspects of the legal profession, including purely private activities and conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b457-8\">WILNER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACD\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">I join in the Court\u2019s Opinion, because I believe that, however inappropriate Link\u2019s behavior was, it did not constitute a violation of MRPC 8.4(d). I write separately only to express my indignation over Link\u2019s behavior in this Court during argument on Bar Counsel\u2019s petition. On more than one occasion, he accused Deputy Bar Counsel of suborning perjury, a criminal offense in this State. He was questioned about that, whether his accusation was mere (but nonetheless grossly inappropriate) rhetorical flourish or whether he really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>meant to accuse bar counsel of criminal behavior, and he made clear that it was the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">There is utterly no basis in the record for such an accusation. Link\u2019s unsupported accusation cannot be used against him in this proceeding, but I find it inexcusable and deplorable. If Link continues to act as he has done, belittling other people and making unfounded accusations against them, he is surely headed for additional problems with Bar Counsel and with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b458-6\">RAKER, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVz\">with whom ELDRIDGE, J. joins, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">I concur in the judgment of the Court and would dismiss the petition because Bar Counsel has not sustained its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent used a means in representing a client that had no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden a third person, in violation of Rule 4.4. Respondent\u2019s conduct, although highly inappropriate and unprofessional, was not unethical subjecting him to discipline under the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that because respondent, although he was representing a client, was not dealing with a person concerned with the legal process, this case does not fall within the construct of Rule 4.4, Respect for Rights of Third Persons. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 426. As I read the majority opinion, the majority determines that in order to come within the ambit of Rule 4.4, the complainant must be a party to the litigation in which the respondent is an attorney, a witness or opposing counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 426-27. Moreover, gathering information in preparation for a trial or conduct in preparation for litigation would not fall within the Rule. It seems to me that Rule 4.4 is broad enough to cover the conduct of a lawyer who, while acting in that capacity, inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>acts with a State employee and uses means in representing a client which have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In considering whether respondent violated Rule 4.4, we look at the purpose of his actions rather than the effect. Maryland Rule 4.4 focuses on the \u201csubstantial purpose\u201d of the lawyer\u2019s actions, and not on the effect the conduct might have upon the third person. <em>See </em>American Bar Association, Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct R. 4.4 cmt. at 424 (4th ed. 1996); <em>Idaho State Bar v. Warrick, </em>137 Idaho 86, 44 P.3d 1141, 1145 ( 2002); <em>Mississippi Bar v. Robb, </em>684 So.2d 615, 621 (Miss.1996). I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis that respondent\u2019s confrontation in the matter <em>sub judice </em>\u201cwas with, and the resulting conduct and remarks were directed at, an agent of the custodian of the records that the respondent was attempting to obtain and was the result of the respondent\u2019s perception that the requirements for accessing the information imposed by the agent were improper and even illegal.\u201d Maj. op. at 425. Although respondent was rude, his purpose was not to embarrass, delay or burden a third person. Accordingly, Bar Counsel has not proven a violation of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">I also do not subscribe to the majority\u2019s construct of Rule 8.4(d). The majority sets out a two-prong test to determine if a lawyer\u2019s conduct comes within the Rule: \u201cOnly when such purely private conduct is criminal <em>or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent will that conduct be considered as prejudicing, or being prejudicial to, the administration of justice. \u201d </em>Maj. op. at 428-29 (emphasis added). I agree that the Rule covers criminal conduct. I do not agree, however, with the view that the Rule is applicable to any conduct which is so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent. The phrase \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d is not defined in the Rules of Professional Conduct, nor do the rules or our case law give guidance for application to specific circumstances. The standard embraced by the majority is ambiguous and elusive. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>smacks of \u201cI can\u2019t define it but I know it when I see it.\u201d Simply because some conduct is so obviously violative of the Rule and \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d does not, in my view, save the Rule. It is unfair to lawyers in the State to be subject simply to the moral barometer of four judges of this Court. Due process requires more \u2014 a lawyer is entitled to have fair notice of conduct which would subject him or her to discipline under the Rules of Professional Conduct. The standard adopted by the Court today fails to give fair notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">I would construe Rule 8.4(d) to apply to criminal conduct or, when dealing with private conduct, such conduct that is in some way connected to the practice of law. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheinbein, </em>372 Md. 224, 812 A.2d 981(2002) (Eldridge, J., dissenting, joined by Raker, J.). Judge Eldridge pointed out that, until <em>Sheinbein, </em>this Court has found conduct to be in violation of Rule 8.4(d) only when there has been conduct that is criminal in nature, or when the lawyer\u2019s conduct concerned his own legal practice or his relationship with his clients. <em>Id. </em>at 276-77, 812 A.2d at 1011-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In sum, I do not subscribe to the majority\u2019s two-prong description of the various types of conduct which violate Rule 8.4(d) because that description does not capture an essential element, which is that the conduct must either be criminal conduct, or conduct that has some connection, directly or indirectly, to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Judge ELDRIDGE, authorizes me to state that he joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
