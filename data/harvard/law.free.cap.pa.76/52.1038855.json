P. borrowed $1000 from S. and conveyed to .him land as security. W. recovered judgment against P. in January 1869.

These notes being unpaid, W. alleging the money due by G. belonged to P., issued an attachment execution against P., making G. garnishee ; he paid the money into court and pleaded \u201c <em>nulla bona.\u201d </em>Held, that by paying the money into court G. admitted he owed it; the contest was then between W. and S., the issue should have been formed and tried between them and G. relieved from further costs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-9\">2.

When this note became due it was renewed for six months more; at the end of that time, August 1st 1865, another note drawn by Peter Dickinson and P. T. Dickinson, payable in one day, for $1024.15, was given to witness for the second $1000 note; it was agreed that Peter should pay interest at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum for the $1000 loan. Witness was to receive the $1100, the balance of the purchase-money; Peter gave witness a note for the $400, which had been deducted from the purchase-money as owing to Good; the balance of the purchase-money, after deducting the $400, would not pay witness the amount of his loan to Peter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">The garnishee made the following offers of evidence, which were all rejected, and several bills of exception sealed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-13\">\u201cTo prove, that on the 1st of July 1870, in addition to the other indebtedness of Peter Dickinson to Samuel Dickinson, the said Peter Dickinson was indebted to Samuel Dickinson in the sum of $400, with interest from July 15th 1857, and for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Samuel Dickinson Held the note of Peter Dickinson, and which is still unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">\u201cTo prove that, on the 1st of July 1870, Peter Dickinson was indebted to Samuel Dickinson in the amount of fill, borrowed of Samuel Dickinson in 1869, and which amount was in addition to his former indebtedness, and which is still unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">\u201c To prove that when the deed was made from Samuel Dickinson to George S.

It appears from the testimony of Samuel\u2019Dickinson that a deed was executed and delivered to him by Peter Dickinson, for this lot of ground, to be held as collateral security for the sum of one thousand dollars loaned by the former to the latter, in the year 1864. This, in law, would amount to nothing more than a mortgage. The judgment of Grant &amp; Son was entered prior to the sale by Samuel Dickinson to Good, and would be a lien upon any interest that Peter Dickinson might have in the lot of ground. Out of a sale of the lot Samuel Dickinson could not claim more than the $1000, loaned by him to Peter Dickinson, with interest from October 1st 1864 to July 1st 1870. After allowing to Samuel Dickinson the full amount of his claim, viz.: one thousand dollars and the interest, there would remain a balance, out of the proceeds of the sale of the lot, of $158.17. We are of the opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>plaintiffs are entitled to recover this amount, and we therefore instruct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of $158.17.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $158.17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">The garnishee took a writ of error.

This being true, the moment that Grant &amp; Son\u2019s judgment was entered it became a lien prior to that of the Samuel Dickinson unrecorded mortgage: Friedley <em>v. </em>Hamilton, 17 S. &amp; R. 70; Manufacturers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Pennsylvania, 7 W. &amp; S. 335.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b55-10\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">delivered the opinion of the court, May 11th 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">This case seems to have been tried in a very irregular manner. The defendants in error issued an attachment execution against the plaintiff in error as garnishee of Peter Dickinson. At this time Samuel Dickinson held several judgments against Good. He admitted his indebtedness upon them. The court say in their charge, \u201c when the money became due the court directed the garnishee to pay the money into court, and this attachment execution is now being tried for the purpose of determining whether any portion of the money paid into court is the property of said Peter Dickinson.\u201d The contest then really was between the defendants in error as attaching creditors of Peter Dickinson as one party, and Samuel Dickinson as the other party. The issue should have been formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and tried between them. By paying the motey into court, Good admitted his liability to pay the judgments; although it is said the \u201c court directed \u201d him so to pay it in, we will not assume this direction to have been made without his request. The garnishee should then have been relieved from further costs. The contest should have been carried on in form, as it was in fact, between the two parties claiming the fund. Being then in fact a question between the two claimants of the fund, it raised and directly involved the question, whether Samuel Dickinson was indebted to Peter Dickinson. The right of the defendants in error to recover depended upon their establishing that Samuel was so indebted. This necessarily led to an inquiry into the business transactions between Peter and Samuel, to ascertain whether, upon the whole, Samuel was indebted to Peter. As there is no proof of any intentional fraud 'between Peter and Samuel, the same evidence should have been received as in a suit brought by Peter against Samuel. The attaching creditor occupied no higher ground than Peter would have done. The learned judge appears to have thought the attaching creditor possessed peculiar equities arising from the fact that his judgment was entered while there was a right of redemption in Peter; and that this precluded an inquiry into other distinct transactions. We are not able to see that any such exclusive equities spring from the lien of the judgment. If the fund in court had been raised by a sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate, then the question of the lien of the judgment would have been important. In this proceeding by attachment, the right of the defendants in error to recover, does not rest upon the lien, but simply upon the indebtedness. If the judgment had never been a lien on this land, or if the lien had been lost by lapse of time, the rights of the attaching creditor upon it would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"Ady\">To pay interest in excess of the legal rate is not necessarily fraudulent as to creditors. To enable the party who has paid it to recover back, the statute requires his action to be brought within six months after it was paid. In an actual good faith transaction between the parties, the attaching creditor has no greater rights than the party paying such excess. Therefore, if the payment of interest was actually so made in July 1870, this attachment which issued in February 1872, was too late to recover it back. The court therefore erred in instructing the jury to find the excess of interest in favor of the plantiff below. The errors assigned are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
