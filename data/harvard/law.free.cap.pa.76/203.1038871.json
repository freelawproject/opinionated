The account before the auditor is not a final one, and should' it hereafter be made to appear, that any moneys have been, or ought to have been realized by the assignee, from the outstanding debts due the association, the exceptants will have their day in court to call the accountant to an account of such moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-15\">\u201c For these reasons, the auditor overrules the first \u00a9f the foregoing exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-16\">\u201cThe second is also overruled, because the account does not exhibit any balance in the hands of the assignee, to form the basis of an interest calculation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-17\">\u201c The third exception is also without merit, and therefore overruled.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-18\">As to the exception of the Gettysburg Bank, he reported:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-19\">\u201c It cannot be denied, that the defendants in the judgment referred to, in the above exception, have always had, since th<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>execution of the judgment-bond, ample property out of which it could have been collected by legal process. \u2019 Neither can it be denied, that more than enough of time has long since elapsed for the accomplishment of this object. But it is strenuously contended by the accountant, <em>that as assignee, </em>he has no control over the collection of this judgment, and no duty to perform, with regard to it. This is the hinge upon which the exception turns. If as assignee, it was his duty to collect that judgment, he was derelict in not doing so long ago, and ought therefore to be charged with so much thereof, as may be necessary to liquidate the claims of the creditors, who consented to the arrangement. But if, <em>as assignee, </em>he had no such duty to perform, and incurred no responsibility with regard to the money nominated in the bond, then the exception is baseless, and must fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\">\u201c The auditor is of the opinion, and so decides, that the accountant <em>as assignee </em>was not bound to collect the judgment, and was charged with no duty in respect thereto. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">\u201cInasmuch as we discover no error in the account, there is no necessity to restate it, and as there is no fund in the hands of the assignee for distribution, the auditor has therefore nothing to distribute, and cannot see that any good purpose would be answered by ascertaining the balances due the creditors at the present time,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">On the 11th of September 1869 the report of the auditor came in, and the court ordered that if exceptions to it were not filed within ten days, it should be confirmed. No exceptions were filed, and it was accordingly confirmed. The balance appearing to be due the assignee on his second account was $799.51.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">On the 15th of April 1872, the court made the following order:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">\u201c In pursuance of a petition of the stockholders of the Chambefsburg Saving Fund Association, to show cause why the judgment No. 38 of April Term 1862, for the sum of $50,000, in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county, and revived by William McLellan to No. * * *, should not be satisfied; upon report of said proceedings by the auditor, it is now ordered that the assignee, William McLellan, do, within thirty days hereafter, file a third and full account of his trust, up to this date, and that therefore a rule issue upon all the stockholders of the Ohambersburg Saving Fund to come in and show cause why the said account should not be confirmed, or be precluded from further objection.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">On the 5th of.dune 1872, in pursuance of the foregoing order, the assignee filed.a third account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-12\">He charged himself with moneys received on the 2d of August and 22d and 21th .of December 1869, from William Gr.

Reed\u2019s, one of Bickell\u2019s, and an indebtedness of Anspach\u2019s own of an unknown shape, which notes, with interest then due, made $14,466.60, and took instead the obligation of John Anspach (obligation \u201cA\u201d), for that sum, secured by $8000 of U. S. bonds and two builder\u2019s mortgages of $3000 each, given by Daniel Haviland, of Philadelphia, to John M. Bickell, which, with the interest due on them that day, and the accrued interest on the bonds and $286.44 of cash that day paid by Anspach, were regarded as precisely securing the obligation. On the 11th April 1863, Anspach and McLellan again met for the same purpose, when the assignee surrendered the four notes of Repplier &amp; Bro., and five notes of Anspach, Reed &amp; Co., making, with interest computed, $18,330.54, and received in exchange the obligation of John Anspach (obligation \u201cB\u201d), secured by 205 shares of .Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company stock at $10,250, and three other similar builder\u2019s mortgages, made by same parties, of $3000 each, as collaterals. On that day also the assignee returned to Anspach the $8000 U. S. bonds, held by him since 16th Feb. 1863, as collateral to obligation \u201c A,\u201d and received for them $8135.22. A controversy arises touching the date and manner of Anspach\u2019s payment for these bonds, which will be hereafter noticed, Davis (the assignee\u2019s attorney in Philadelphia) continuing his collections from McCoy, Linn &amp; Co., until by his remittance of $2000, on 20th February 1864, he closed the account of McCoy, Linn &amp; Co., and Anspach having paid the interest on the mortgages and the dividends on 205 shares of Locust Mountain stock for the year 1863, and also having made one payment of $4000, on general account, on 22d February 1864. The assignee obtained as the next payment, on 31st March 1864 three drafts of $5000 each, from Anspach, at thirty, sixty and ninety days, on his general account, which drafts the assignee discounted, and which were met by Anspach. On 18th June 1864, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the assignee and Anspach met for a final settlement. The \u2018 financial account\u2019 of Anspach was then, for the first time, taken up by name, and a formal statement of it \u2014 the balance of $88,426.28 and interest \u2014 made, and such credits as were due Anspach on this account, admitted. The 205 shares of Locust Mountain were then surrendered to Anspach and their value, $10,250,-added to the balance due by Anspach on his financial account stated, making the sum of $28,085.69. Paying the $85.69 in cash, Anspach gave the assignee four drafts, payable at three, four and five months, for $7000 each, and thus closed this part of his account. He also paid the assignee in cash $502.19, the estimated discount on the drafts, thus making them of their face value in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">\u201c Now, by the payment for the $8000 U. S. bonds, Anspach had reduced obligation \u201cA,\u201d so that on 3d October 1863, it amounted to $6235.80. On 3d October he paid in cash the $235.80, and gave a new obligation for $6000 \u2014 cancelling <em>\u201c </em>A\u201d and lifting it \u2014 for which new obligation he permitted the two builder\u2019s mortgages to stand as collateral. Upon this new obligation he had paid nothing up to 18th June 1864, when the settlement of <em>\u2018 </em>account stated\u2019 was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-6\">\u201c The payment of the four drafts of $7000 each was so deemed a certainty when they were given, that the assignee credited the value of the 205 shares of Locust Mountain, $10,250 on obligation \u201cB,\u201d to which they had been as collaterals, thus leaving a balance of about $8000, with interest from 11th April 1863, also due on that obligation on 18th June 1864. This sum of upwards of $14,000 remained unmet by Anspach, and the four drafts of $7000 each having been taken care of, became .the only indebtedness of Anspach to the fund, except a note for $2500, given by Anspach in payment of his stock in the fund, which note was not drawn in to. any of the settlements, but remains unpaid to this day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-7\">\u201c To September Term, a. d. 1865, the assignee entered suit on these remainders against Anspach in the District Court of Philadelphia, and on 20th of February 1866, obtained a judgment against him on a verdict for $17,131.95, on which a fi. fa. was issued and levy made by the sheriff on property; this property being claimed by a second party, was under a sheriff\u2019s inter-pleader awarded to the claimant. On sci. fa. the judgment was revived 22d April 1871, for want of an affidavit of defence, for $22,418.56. A fi. fa. having been issued to March Term 1871, which was stayed, an alias was issued to December Term 1871, under which, 3d January 1872, the sheriff filed a rule of inter-pleader, James Anspach being claimant of the property, which rule, 17th January 1872, was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-8\">\u201c The assignee accordingly holds to-day a barren judgment against John Anspach for $22,448.56, with interest from 22d April 1871. Now it is apparent, and the auditors so find, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>this deficiency in the payment of Anspach\u2019s debt to the fund is ultimately wholly due to the worthlessness of the five builder\u2019s, mortgages, which the assignee accepted; two of them as collateral to the obligation \u201cA,\u2019\u2019and again as collateral to the obligation of 3d of October 1863, and three of them as collateral to obligation \u201cB\u201d ; for had they, .when resorted to, proved to be good, the whole of the Anspach debt would have been amply secured. But Mr. McLellan then found that they were laid on lots in Philadelphia, on which there were no buildings newly erected, as Anspach had told him there were, and that the lots besides were encumbered by a prior mortgage to their value. Mr. McLellan accepted these mortgages upon the mere assertion of Anspach that they were valuable ; the properties about to be improved by the erection of' five new tenement-houses. He did not visit the premises before taking the mortgages or inquire into their condition and value, but, sometime after he became the holder of these mortgages, visiting the locality with Mr. J. A. Eyster, and seeing new buildings in progress on that block, he was satisfied that these were the buildings secured by his mortgages. After holding the mortgages over two years, at the suggestion of his attorney, he went on the ground with a plot of the square and discovered the deception, the lots mortgaged to him being adjacent to those built on, but themselves unimproved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Recurring now to the general line of the, assignee\u2019s conduct, we find him during this same period collecting other moneys due the fund from its debtors, and paying by instalments from day to day, the debts due the certificate-holders, the depositors, and the banks. * * * Believing, as was the case, that a large saving to the fund and to the partners, who were liable to pay any deficiency of assets, could be made by purchasing certificates at a discount for ready money, the stockholders gave their promissory notes, beginning in April 1862, for in all $12,500, which notes were discounted and the proceeds used, at first by the assignee and afterwards by Judge Kimmell as the agent of the partners, in the buying up of the certificates and deposits. * * * These cer'tificates and deposits, purchased by the assignee or agent, were in all cases assigned to them by the holders. When the funds arising from these stockholders\u2019 notes were expended, the buying up was continued with the proper funds of the association, both by the assignee and Judge Kimmell, until the majority of the certificates and deposits were in the hands of the assignee and agent. * * * The stockholders never lifted any of these notes given by them, but constrained the assignee to redeem five of them, the sixth remaining unpaid this day in the Bank of Chambersburg; three of the five notes were received by the assignee from John Anspach, into whose hands they had fallen as cash upon his indebtedness, and two of them from William G. Reed, also as cash upon his indebtedness to the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>\u201c </em>It will be remembered also that among the collaterals in hand when the assignee was appointed, were the lands in Schuylkill county; these lands, by operation of law, because of the deeds from Anspach to Reed and the deed of assignment, instantly vested in the assignee upon his acceptance of the trust, and the endorsement by Reed of all of the Anspach notes in the fund. Although the assignee never read the deed of assignment, nor did Reed turn over to him the deeds for the lands, yet both the assignee and the stockholders knew of the lands and that they belonged to the fund as collaterals. Mr. Reed had recorded both deeds 21st February 1861, in Schuylkill county. The assignee, in May 1862, with several of the partners, visited the land at Anspach\u2019s invitation, met him there, and were shown the lands by him. A colliery, then in operation on the lands, was seen by them. Although the visit convinced them of the great value of the lands, yet they returned home disheartened because of the discredit thrown by two persons whom they' accidentally met while there, upon Anspach\u2019s title to the land, and Mr. McLellan\u2019s assurance that he had been advised by counsel that the title was not good. The assignee, prior to this visit, consulted F. W. Hughes, Esq., of Pottsville, and had been told by him that Anspach had no title to the lands, and his counsel, Mr. Davis, of Philadelphia, had also so advised him. Upon what information Mr. Davis based his opinion, the auditors have no means of now telling. Mr. Davis was not called as a witness, but the opinion of Mr. Hughes, who was offered by the exceptants, was based on a casual conversation with Mr. McLellan, who exhibited to him no papers, but led him to take up the belief that the lands inquired of were those well known in Schuylkill county as the \u00a3 Deborah Grant tract,\u2019 to which Anspach in fact had no title, and touching which Mr. Hughes says he must have said he had none. But the auditors find that the deed to Reed expressly designates the land conveyed as the then \u00a3 Wm. Kichner \u2019 tracts, and whether the deed was given to the assignee or not, by Reed, so that he might learn this fact from it, the deed had been recorded in Schuylkill county, in which the assignee was when he saw the lands, and was readily accessible to him as a lawyer and the assignee. To this land the auditors find as a fact that Anspach had, in the language of Mr. Hughes, an indisputably good legal title. Mr. Hughes further says that, being intimately acquainted with these lands, he having been concerned in the compromise, as attorney for the Foulkes and others, and adversely to Anspach, which quieted Anspach\u2019s title to these lands, he would have told Mr. McLellan that Anspaeh\u2019s title was indisputable, had Mr. McLellan correctly informed him what lands had been vested in him under the deed of assignment. After this visit, seemingly with the assent of the stockholders, the assignee took no further steps to follow the lands. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>He never recorded his deed of assignment in either Schuylkill or Columbia counties, but after the settlement of 18th June 1864, at the request of Anspach, told and advised Mr. Reed to reconvey both tracts to Anspach, which Reed did by his deed of 21st of July 1864, and the lands passed from the fund.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The auditors then referred to the assignee\u2019s first account and the auditor\u2019s report on it. They proceeded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">\u201c The auditor\u2019s task was a difficult one. The claims against the fund were of three classes: 1st, certificates; 2d, weekly deposits, 3d, debts due banks. Deducting a preferred debt and the expenses from the balance in assignee\u2019s hands, he had upwards of sixty per cent, to distribute to creditors. * * * Upon nearly all partial payments had been made at various times ; many of them had subsequently been bought up at a discount, and were held for the fund; many were still in the hands of the owners. The auditor, accordingly, computed interest on the face of all claims to November 1st 1864, and on all partial payments to same date, computed dividends on full claims and reported (1st) the amount of claims to November 1st 1864; (2d) dividends thereon; (3d) the partial payment with interest; (4th) balances of unpaid dividends. Such of the dividends as were due to actual holders, the confirmation of the report made it the duty of the assignee to pay out; the dividends upon such of the certificates and deposits as were in his own hands and Judge Kimmell\u2019s constructively remained in his own hands, though in fact paid out before the filing of the report. The sum of these remainders of dividends went over into his second account, there to be claimed credit for in the name of the certificates. In this portion of the business, the auditors think the assignee acted with great improvidence. In his first account, he had, after giving dates of receipt to all other moneys received, charged himself with a large sum, $76,345.57, as received from John Anspach without date, yet forgetting that his <em>cestui que trusts </em>and creditors who were so largely interested would desire, and were entitled to receive the fullest light, he presented a second account in which he not only charged himself, in gross, without date, with the sum of $20,639.49 as received from Mr. Sharpe\u2019s report, but in the long account footing up over $70,000 on each side, and concluding with a balance in his own favor, he does not insert a single date on either side, to the many scores of items. This account was filed 22d December 1868, and shows a balance in his favor of $799.41. Yet further to complicate the matter, during the period between 1864 and 1868, namely in 1867, the assignee had suggested to the stockholders, in response to their inquiries, when and how the trust would be ended, the propriety of their assessing themselves in sufficient sums to meet the deficiency as it then appeared. Having, with his counsel, made a calculation of the amount required, he reported to them that five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>times the amount of their stock would be required of each for that purpose, with the assurance that an ample margin had been allowed by him, that a surplus would finally result and be returned proportionately to them. Many assented, and in the fall of 1867, gave to the assignee cash, or promissory notes or judgments, to the amounts of their assessments. Upon these notes and judgments various sums were subsequently paid by the givers to the assignee portions of them yet remain uncollected, but standing in th assignee\u2019s name as collectable assets of the fund. Now, when the account of 1868 was filed and a balance shown in the assignee\u2019s favor, many debts of the fund being yet unpaid, the assurances of 1867 were recalled; the assignee then said that he had been mistaken in his calculation in 1867, and that the assessments as collected, were insufficient to pay the indebtedness.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The auditors then refer to Mr. Sharpe\u2019s second report, made September 11th 1869, and proceed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">\u201c The inventory, a year ago, forthcoming in another investigation, is now said to be lost; the dates of the second account they have been compelled to search for in the records of the courts, and throughout the voluminous testimony, or to reconstruct from the meagre data given them. The vouchers for payments of the assignee were confined at first to the certificates themselves alone, while the contradictory and varying statements of the leading witnesses, Anspach and McLellan, were often not in accordance with the testimony otherwise derived. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The exceptions filed reduce substantially to one of the following heads: 1st, failure to account for moneys received; 2d, interest on unemployed balances in his hands; 3d, undue credits taken; 4th, negligence; and 5th, costs. \u2021 * * While the auditors were aware that because of the lapse of time since the confirmation by the court, there may be doubts of the right of a reviewing authority again to pass upon the first account of the assignee, as to what it contains, yet for the purpose of determining what it does not contain, &amp;c., * * * the auditors have stated a single account embracing the whole life of the trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">The auditors reported on the exceptions <em>seriatim </em>and much in detail. The results being contained in a \u201c summary of facts\u201d which they made and which is hereafter given, it is not necessary to give any part of their report in thus examining them, except a portion of that part of it which relates to the 16th exception. With regard to this exception, after referring to the assignment and its effect in passing to the assignee the lands conveyed by Anspach to Reed, the cashier, treating the lands conveyed in each deed as one tract, they say :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">\u201c These two tracts of land lay, the one wholly in Schuylkill county, the other partly in Schuylkill and partly in the adjoining county of Columbia.- The former contained about 560 acres and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>was regarded as woodland with a possibility of coal. Its value was not great. The other tract was of smaller size, but being undoubted coal-land, developed in working order, was deemed of great value. This tract was held by the cashier in trust for the fund as well as himself. William G-. Reed, the cashier, however, when on the witness-stand, said that presently after his discovery of the embarrassed condition of the fund, that John Anspach was its chief debtor; that in Anspach\u2019s hands were most of the moneys of the fund, and that because of Anspach\u2019s insolvency, they could not be recalled for the purpose of adding to the strength of the securities held by the fund. He (Reed) individually endorsed each and every obligation given to the fund by Anspach, thus pledging his own private estate to meet the assumed deficiency, and passing to the fund whatever interest he had in the title to the other tract of Anspach land which he had been holding for his own security. This being done, the assignee was entitled to demand and receive both tracts in their entirety. The testimony fails to show clearly when the assignee first began to move in the securing of these benefits or lands. He swears that he never received from Reed, cashier, either of the deeds for these lands. Reed, however, while admitting that for a time he did retain the custody of the deed which was meant to protect himself also, says that he gave the key of the safe, which contained all the papers of the fund, to the assignee, and thus, he thinks, turned over the deeds to him. Whether the assignee received the deeds or not, the fact that lands \u2014 woodland and coal-land \u2014 in Schuylkill county were held by the fund as collaterals, was then and before then well known <em>to </em>the directors and assignee. The assignee acted upon this knowledge, and, upon the invitation of Anspach, went to Schuylkill county, accompanied by several stockholders of the fund, to inspect the lands. The company was met by Anspach, who took them on the tract of coal-land, and from the elevation of the coal-breaker thereon erected, pointed out to them the tract encircling them as the one he had conveyed in trust to the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">\u201c While on the ground, one or two of the visitors met a stranger named Brock, by whom discredit was cast upon the title of Anspach. A man named Wood, known in former years to the visitors as a resident of Franklin county, was also met by the visitors, and he also cast doubts upon Anspach\u2019s title. These declarations of Brock and Wood disheartened the companions of the assignee, and brought them to the conclusion that the tract, though plainly valuable, was yet to be of no benefit to the fund because of the insufficiency of Anspach\u2019s title to it. They reported to Anspach the speeches of Brock and Wood, and were answered that, although there was some dispute, he thought his title good. Anspach had previously, by letter to the assignee, of 28th April 1862, represented the tract as a very valuable one in itself and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the fund, saying that about 20,000 tons of coal had already been shipped. The assignee also swears.that prior to this visit he had consulted F. W. Hughes, a lawyer, long resident in Pottsville, in extensive practice, and familiar with the titles to coal-lands in Schuylkill county, about Anspach\u2019s title, and had been advised by Hughes that Anspach\u2019s title was worthless; that O. W. Davis, his counsel in Philadelphia, had also advised him to the same effect. With this advice, touching the validity of the title to these lands, and the information upon the value of the lands themselves, the party returned to Chambersburg and told the result of their inquiries to such of the stockholders as met them. Those at home seemed to fall in with the opinion of the visitors that nothing was to be expected from Schuylkill lands. No further steps were taken by the assignee in the matter. The lands v?ere left to remain from that time (May 1862) as before, in the hands and management of John Anspach, until after the settlement and adjustment between Anspach and the assignee on 18th June 1864, when Anspach gave the drafts for $28,000 to the assignee, and apparently wound up or arranged the last of his indebtedness. Then the assignee informed Reed he had settled finally with Anspach; that his (Anspach\u2019s) indebtedness was secured, ar.d that he (Reed) should reconvey the Schuylkill lands to Anspach. Reed did this by deed of 21st July 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">\u201c Now it happened that afterwards, when the assignee, who was still the holder of Anspach\u2019s obligation for $6000, and of obligation \u201c B,\u201d upon which had been realized only the $8185.22 from the U. S. bonds given as collateral to it, in all about $17,000 of obligations, desired to collect them from Anspach, who delayed payment, it proved that the five builder\u2019s mortgages, the only collaterals yet remaining, were valueless, being laid on lots in Philadelphia upon which no buildings had been erected, and upon which were prior mortgages. Suit upon the obligations, after some delay, resulted in a judgment for the assignee against Anspach for upwards of $17,000; but an execution issued returned empty to the assignee\u2019s hand, Anspach proving insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">\u201c Touching the propriety of the assignee\u2019s action in thus suffering Anspach to retain and manage for his own benefit the lands conveyed to Reed, from 1862 to 1864, and in finally advising thp reconveyance to Anspach, the exceptants offered at Pottsville testimony, oral and documentary. From this testimony it appears, first, that the assignee, when consulting F. W. Hughes, Esq., did so casually, exhibited to Hughes no papers or deeds, and in their brief interview so described the lands as to give Hughes the impression that the lands in question were those familiar to Schuylkill county men as the \u2018Deborah Grant\u2019 tract, to which in fact Anspach had no title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201c 2. That the tract upon which Anspach took the assignee and company was that upon which, being owned jointly by John Anspach and the wife of Gideon Bast, John Anspach had erected improvements, and which, being worked by Bast for his wife under a lease from Anspach, was and is known as the Bast mine or colliery; that this tract, which lies in the vicinity of the Deborah Grant tract, contained 60 47-100th acres, and was indisputably vested in John Anspach and Mrs. Bast, Anspach owning 7-16th of it when he conveyed to Reed, and drawing a royalty from the Basts for that proportion; that this land was and is of the most valuable coal-lands in the Mahanoy coal region, containing the Mammoth coal vein, and worth at that time over $400 per acre. Upon it also was a breaker, built by Anspach at a cost of $60,000, and belonging to him, thus making Anspach\u2019s interest in the tract worth in \u00cd862 over $70,000; that all of these facts were well known to Mr. Hughes, who, as counsel for the Eoulkes and others, in opposition to Anspach, had arranged the compromise by which Anspach quieted his title to the tract. Says Mr. Hughes, \u2018 had the consultation been a full and explicit one, these facts would have been communicated to the assignee, and he been informed that to this tract Anspach had an indisputably good title;\u2019 the title of Anspach moreover was recognised by the Basts, who leased from him and paid him royalty during the years 1862,1868,1864. The assignee also testifies that he did not at any time record his deed of assignment in Schuylkill or Columbia counties, and therefore never officially entered those counties in quest of these lands. The deeds from Anspach to Reed had been recorded in Schuylkill county on 21st February 1861, only six days after date of the second deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\">\u201c The assignee, in fine, seems to have suffered himself to be dissuaded from following up the lands by the loose declarations of irresponsible parties accidentally met, the hasty assertions of a lawyer, given upon incorrect data furnished by the assignee himself, and the crude, ill-considered opinions of unqualified laymen. This laxity the auditors deem a weighty element in the scales when determining, after a review of the other facts in the case, the question of the liability for costs in the proceedings of this audit, which is the last question raised by the exceptions.

But since the re-argument and re-examination of the evidence, the auditors have now somewhat modified their former finding, so far as relates to the assignee\u2019s authorizing or directing W. Gr. Reed to reconvey these lands to Anspach. We are all still of opinion that the management of these lands was unfortunate and damaging to the Saving Fund. Undoubtedly there was a lack of 'such care, caution, discernment and thoroughness as the case demanded. But a majority of us further hold that the exceptants shared in this as well as the assignee. Both he and they were undoubtedly anxious to save as much as they could for the Saving Fund, and in concurrence suggested and tried several ways to advance their interests, or rather to break the weight of their common loss. And inasmuch as the present parties were at that time in accord (the exceptants being stockholders and not creditors), and working for their common weal, no doubt mutually influencing each other, a majority of us think it inequitable, now that the vision is clear and the error apparent through later light, that the responsibility shall be cast upon the assignee alone, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>cause of a line of action, unfortunate in its issue, but shared in at the time by the live or active men of the stockholders.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">Mr. McGrowan dissented from this finding, saying :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">\u201c I have tried to, but cannot, concur in so much of this finding as imputes contributory negligence to the stockholders \u2014 holding that the final accord to which they came with the assignee as to the Schuylkill lands was produced or occasioned by the representations mainly of the assignee himself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\">The court (Rowe, J.) confirmed the report of the auditors without delivering an opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-8\">The association appealed from the decree of confirmation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-9\">They assigned thirty-one errors \u2014 being that the court did not sustain the exceptions to the report of the auditors, and confirmed the report.

In addition to some other personal securities, the appellants then held, as collateral securityifor this indebtedness, an assignment of certain stocks, and a conveyance of some lands: one piece situated wholly in SchuylkilLeounty. \u2018.The other partially in each, Schuylkill and Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>counties. The latter piece was valuable coal-land, with a mine in working order, and costly improvements thereon in Schuylkill county. These lands had previously been conveyed by Anspach to William G-. Reed, the cashier of appellant, the one to secure the appellant for advances made by it at various times to Anspach ; the other, to protect Reed, both as cashier, and for liabilities which he had individually incurred to the appellant, by endorsement and otherwise, for Anspach. Having discovered the embarrassed condition of the appellant and of Anspach, Reed had, previous to April 1862, endorsed every obligation held by the appellant against Anspach, and also transferred to the appellant all the interest he had in the tract of land which he had been holding for his own security.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In settlement and adjustment of some of Anspach\u2019s liabilities in 1868, the appellee took from him his new obligations, and as collateral thereto, five builder\u2019s mortgages of $3000 each, on certain lots in Philadelphia. Anspach failed to pay the whole of these new obligations. Suit was brought on them in 1865, and judgment recovered. On the 22d of April 1871, this judgment was revived for $22,448.56. It remains wholly unpaid, and Anspach has no estate out of which it can be collected. The builder\u2019s mortgages proved worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The auditors found that the inability of the appellee to collect the whole indebtedness of Anspach was \u201c wholly due to the worthlessness of the five builder\u2019s mortgages which the assignee accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In answer to the claim that the appellee should be charged with a sum equal to the amount of these collaterals, the auditors found \u201c that he did exchange notes held by the plaintiff for other obligations in part secured by collaterals which proved to be worthless; but whether he exceeded the bounds of that reasonable discretion which a trustee must be permitted to exercise, we cannot say, inasmuch as the comparative value of the paper surrendered was not affirmatively shown.\u201d In thus speaking of the \u201cvalue of the paper surrendered,\u201d they manifestly did not consider the additional value given thereto by the lands held as collateral security.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Considering the varied and complicated character of the transactions, as well as the conflicting evidence, we are not prepared to say there was positive error in the conclusion of the auditors not to charge the appellee with the amount of these builder\u2019s mortgages. We think, however, that the auditors went to the extreme limit of the protection which the law gives to a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The appellee failed to realize anything out of the coal-lands, but suffered them to be wholly lost to the appellants. Whether he should be surchai\u2019ged therefor, presents the most important question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">It is well settled that a trustee shall not be surcharged by a court of equity for a loss which has occurred, in case he has exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>cised common skill, common prudence and common caution; but for supine negligence, or for wilful default, be shall be held responsible : Twaddle\u2019s Appeal, 5 Barr 15; Moore\u2019s Appeal, 10 Id. 435; Springer\u2019s Estate, 1 P. F. Smith 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Then the liability of the appellee must be determined by an examination of the testimony and the ascertainment on which side of the line of separation his conduct has placed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In considering whether a trustee has made himself liable for a failure to collect and convert the assets in his hands, regard must be had to the character of the trust. Thus, a guardian would not be held to such prompt action in enforcing the collection of securities, as an executor, administrator or assignee for the benefit of creditors, would be. The duty of the former is to hold and retain; that of the latter to collect and prepare for distribution: Charlton\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 473 ; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">It was then the duty of the appellee, within a reasonable time, to make proper efforts to convert all the assets and securities into money for distribution. If he failed to make such efforts, he was guilty of gross negligence and became liable for any loss thereby sustained: Johnston\u2019s Estate, 9 W. &amp; S. 107. There an administrator, upon a sale of assets at vendue, took a note with security, payable in six months, and when it fell due, the payors were able to pay it, but the administrator made no effort to collect it within six months after maturity, and by the subsequent insolvency of the makers it was lost. The administrator was held to be chargeable with the loss. That was a case of omission only.</p>\n<p id=\"APQM\">After the appellee obtained the builder\u2019s mortgages, he told Reed, who held the legal title to the coal-lands in trust for the appellants, that Anspach had paid the debt which he had owed them. In consequence of this information, Reed reconveyed the lands to Anspach in July 1864. They were thereby wholly lost to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The appellee seeks to justify his delay of more than two years in making any attempt to dispose of the coal-lands, as well as his suffering Reed to reconvey them, on the alleged ground that he was informed Anspach had no title to them, and therefore they were of no value to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">If the appellee had obtained this information in an investigation conducted with reasonable prudence and caution, although untrue in fact, it would have protected him from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">What are the facts ? The deeds from Anspach to Reed expressly designate these coal-lands as <em>\u201c </em>surveyed on three several warrants granted to William Kichner,\u201d excepting therefrom \u201c so much of either one of the above three tracts as is supposed to interfere with an older survey in the warrantee name of Deborah Grant in 1793.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The mines being worked were not on those portions covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the Deborah Grant survey. Within two weeks after the appellee\u2019s appointment, his attention was called, by letter from Anspach, to the value of these coal-lands. He was then informed that 20,000 tons of coal had been shipped from one of the properties. He was invited to go upon the ground, and personally to examine the property. About two weeks thereafter he went to the mines in company with Anspach and some of the stockholders of the plaintiff. He went on the coal-breaker. Standing upon it, the surrounding lands were pointed out to him as those which Anspach had conveyed. He was satisfied of their value. But while on the ground they casually met two persons, one of them a stranger, the other previously known to them. Both of these persons cast discredit on Anspach\u2019s title. The appellee afterwards consulted F. W. Hughes, a well-known lawyer of Pottsville, and at some time with O. W. Davis, his counsel in Philadelphia, in regard to the title. Each of them advised him that Anspach\u2019s title was worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The deeds from Anspach to Reed were recorded in Schuylkill county in 1861. A deed in partition .conveying the lands to Anspach had been recorded there in 1858. The appellee made no examination of the records. He had never examined the deed of assignment. He remained in ignorance of the name of the tract on which the mines were located. He neither read any of the title-papers, nor, so far as it appears, did he inquire of any person the names of the tracts conveyed. He appears to have assumed, what the deed expressly denied, that the land conveyed was1 covered by the Deborah Grant survey. He submitted no title-papers to either Mr. Hughes or Mr. Davis\u00bb The testimony fails to show that he gave to Mr. Davis any information calculated to guide him in his investigations, or that Davis reported the specific investigations he had made, further than, he had gone into the county where the lands were situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">It appears by the testimony of Mr. Hughes that the appellee inquired of him in regard to Anspach\u2019s title to the Deborah Grant tract only. That nothing was said to him which led him to suppose the William Kichner tracts were the subject of inquiry. Had his attention been called to these tracts, he should have answered that Anspach had an unquestioned legal title. . The auditors therefore say, \u201c the assignee in fine seems to have suffered himself to be dissuaded from following up the lands by the loose declarations of irresponsible parties accidentally met, the hasty assertions of a lawyer given upon incorrect data furnished by the assignee himself, and the crude, ill-considered opinions of unqualified laymen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In the \u201c summary of facts,\u201d which the auditors further report to have found, a majority of them declare that the assignee \u201cmade a feeble, insufficient attempt to reduce into possession the lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in Schuylkill county, which had, under his deed of assignment, been vested in him; that these lands were of the value of $70,000 and upwards, and were sufficiently valuable to have paid, if sold, the whole indebtedness of Anspach then due the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The appellee further justifies his action in regard to the land, from the fact that some of the active stockholders of the plaintiff went upon the ground with him, and they also came to the same conclusion he did, in regard to Anspach\u2019s title. A majority of the auditors found that this fact showed concurrent negligence on the part of the plaintiffs, and therefore refused to surcharge the appellee with any proceeds of the lands. The court confirmed the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Both court and auditors appear to have overlooked the fact, that none of the stockholders in any manner participated in the consultation which the appellee had with his counsel. There is no evidence that any of the stockholders had any information as to Anspach\u2019s defective title, or that the appellee supposed they had any information, other than that which was acquired when they were on the premises together. This was manifestly so insufficient and unreliable that the appellee was not justified in predicating his final action either the facts there communicated, nor the opinion of any person known to have been formed on those facts. The appellee concedes the inadequacy of all the information there obtained, to lead to an intelligent opinion, by his endeavor to show that he afterwards consulted with a lawyer in regard to Anspach\u2019s title. He did not then rely on any opinion those stockholders formed or expressed. A lawyer himself, he knew the necessity of getting the opinion of a lawyer familiar with land-titles. He well knew the value of a lawyer\u2019s opinion depends on the fulness and entire accuracy with which the facts are communicated to him. The means of ascertaining the name of the tract on which the mines were located, were easily within his reach. His duty clearly required him to ascertain that fact and to communicate it to the lawyer whose opinion.he asked. We cannot see how any person, in the exercise of common prudence and care, would have done less. His failure so to do, united with his notice to Reed that the debt against Anspach was paid, thus causing him to reconvey, were such a dereliction of duty as clearly to constitute supine negligence and make him liable for the loss which the appellants thereby sustained. The learned judge, therefore, erred in not surcharging the appellee with such portion of the value of these lands as will equal the residue of the indebtedness due from Anspach to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We will not discuss <em>seriatim </em>the thirty-one assignments of error filed. The evidence shows the transactions to have been numerous and complicated. They extended over many years. The funds which the appellee used as assignee were mingled with those he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>held under other trusts. This appears to have been done with the assent of the stockholders, and in some cases with their active co-operation. We therefore feel unwilling to say there is any error in the conclusions to which the court have arrived, other than as to the action of the appellee in relation to the coal-lands. The decree, therefore, should be so far modified as to surcharge the appellee with a sum equal to the residue of the debt due from Anspach to the appellants, and the residue of the decree be confirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">And now, decree reversed; and it is ordered that the record be remitted, with instructions to enter a decree conform-ably to this opinion, and that the appellee pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
