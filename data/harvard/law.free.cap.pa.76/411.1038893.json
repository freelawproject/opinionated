W. Johnston, captain, effected this insurance. Previous insurances had been effected on this vessel the same way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-22\">The plaintiff offered to prove by the witness that the making and delivery of the note in this case by the captain (G. W. Johnston), for the premium of insurance effected on the steamboat \u201c Glasgow,\u201d for the owners, was done in accordance with the general custom, and in the like manner as to prior insurance on the same boat, made by the captain and James Collins, one of the owners, for all the owners of the said boat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-23\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-24\">The offer was admitted, and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-25\">Witness proceeded: \u201c Have been interested in twenty-eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>steamboats, and tbe rule always was for an owner and tbe captain to insure for owners and give note, signed by captain, as was done in this case; never knew it done otherwise. Saw Collins about this insurance before I went down to boat to deliver policy. Collins and Adams both lived here in city; knew them both.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\">David Ilultz testified: \u201c It was customary for the captain to give note when there is an insurance of boat, signing captain for steamboat and owners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">Captain Atkinson testified: \u201cBeen in insurance business since <em>\u201964. </em>Know \u2018Glasgow.\u2019 The captain almost invariably insures steamboat for boat and owners; gives note at nine months for boat and owners. The insurance on this boat was effected by Johnston as captain from the first for owners. Don\u2019t know whether in all cases the captain has been part owner or not; often they have been. I know of no case where the captain was not directed by the owner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">Chas. M. Fairman testified: \u201c It has been the custom as long as I know for the captain to insure for owners, as in this case, giving nine months\u2019 notice for boat and owners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-9\">The plaintiffs then offered the note in evidence; it was objected to, admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">The plaintiffs rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-11\">J. S. Adams, defendant, testified: \u201cThe first knowledge I had of the note was when sued. I never gave Captain Johnston nor James Collins authority to insure for me; I never authorized Johnston to give this note; I never authorized him at any time to insure for me, and never knew that he had insured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-12\">The following were defendant\u2019s points, which were refused:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-13\">1. The plaintiff has not shown any such custom as warrants the jury in finding that Captain Johnston had implied authority to effect insurance and give a note so as to bind the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-14\">2. The evidence in this ease of alleged custom is insufficient to charge the defendant with a liability to plaintiff upon the note in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-15\">8. If the jury find from the evidence that the insurance upon the \u201c Glasgow\u201d was effected and the note in suit given without the knowledge, consent or authority of the defendant, and that he had no knowledge of the same until he was sued in this case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-16\">The court charged:\u2014 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-17\">\u201c A usage which is to govern a question of right, should be so certain, uniform and notorious, as probably to be known to, and understood by the parties, as entering into their contract. The real question, in this respect, is not whether the defendant actually knew of the custom, if it existed, but was there a custom or usage so common and general as that the defendant probably knew it, and that the parties contracting with him had a right to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and assume that he actually did know it. That is, Was there a custom, and if so, was its extent and notoriety such, as shown by the evidence, as to induce the jury to believe that defendant probably knew it, and which would justify plaintiff in believing that he actually did know of it, at the time he was acting upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">The defendant took a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">He assigned for error the admission of the evidence objected to; and the refusal of defendant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-9\"><em>M.

This insurance was made and the note given without the knowledge or consent of the defendant. It is conceded that under ordinary circumstances this could not be done. But the plaintiff was permitted to go to the jury on evidence of a custom or usage of the port of Pittsburg, warranting the captain thus to bind the owners of vessels navigating the Ohio and its tributaries. It is possible that a usage such as this, though derogatory of the rights of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>owners, and not required for the advancement of commerce and trade, might he established by proper proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">But in order to establish such custom, the evidence by which it is proposed to prove it, must be clear, uncontradictory and distinct. Custom is usage so long established and so well known as to have acquired the force of law. It is obvious, therefore, that a custom not only can, but must be so proved as to leave no doubt upon the mind with reference to its nature and character.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Doubt must.be wholly eliminated from the evidence adduced, or the usage is not well proved. In view of these principles, we cannot agree that the evidence in this case was such as the court should have submitted to the jury for the purpose proposed. Four witnesses gave their evidence upon this subject. One testifies that the custom is for an owner and the captain to insure for all the owners; the captain signing the premium-note. Another states simply that it was customary for the captain to execute the note, but whether .under authority of one or all of the owners he does not say. The third, that it was customary for the captain to insure for the boat and owners, but adds upon cross-examination that he knew of no case where the captain was not directed by <em>the </em>owner. The fourth, that it was the custom for the captain to insure for the owners, as in this case. From this testimony it is impossible to say what the custom or usage is, if indeed any such exists. Has the captain power upon his own motion to insure, or does it require the joint action of a part owner and the captain ? May he insure the boat when there is but a single owner, or is he confined to cases where there are several joint owners?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">These are questions which are legitimately raised from the evidence ; and as that evidence does not clearly and definitely answer either of them, the court'should notiiave permitted it to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
