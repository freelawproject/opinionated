But in a collateral proceeding to recover the land, where the land has been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale before the attachment has been set aside or reversed, the omission of the sheriff to state that the person on whom he has served the writ in connection with the land, holds the land under the defendant in the writ, is but an irregularity, which will not render the judgment and executions absolutely void. Though voidable, they will support the sheriff\u2019s sale. There is not such an absolute want of jurisdiction in the court as will render the whole proceeding a mere nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
