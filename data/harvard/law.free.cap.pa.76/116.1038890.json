In the estate of Sarah Peterman, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-17\">On the 25th of January 1871, Lewis Peterman made an assignment to Edmund Ilershey of all his property of every kind for the benefit of his creditors, \u201c except however so much as may be exempt by the laws of this Commonwealth from levy and sale, on execution and distress for rent, to be selected by the said Lewis, and appraised for the use of himself and family, according to law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-18\">Under this exception personal property to the amount of $99.88 was appraised and set aside by the assignee to Peterman. The remainder of his property was sold by the assignee, whose account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was settled and confirmed, and duly distributed amongst, tbe creditors by the Court of Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">The mother of Peterman had died intestate previously to the making of the assignment, seised of real estate, which descended to her children, of whom Lewis Peterman was one, but had not been included in the assignee\u2019s account, Peterman, as he testified, .not having known at the time of the assignment anything about it. Afterwards under proceedings in partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court, this real estate was sold by Samuel Hay, trustee appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court for that purpose. The trustee having settled his account showing in his hands a balance of $1624.75, N. M. Wanner, Esq., was appointed auditorio report distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">Before- this auditor, Lewis Peterman claimed under the exception in his assignment so much of his share as with the amount he had already received would make $300 ; the assignee claimed the whole of the share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">The auditor found the foregoing facts and concluded his report as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">* * * \u201c The only question now is what right has Lewis Peter-man in this distribution to a part of the share which he had assigned for the benefit of his creditors ? He claims it under the exemption laws. But the mere reservation of property under a deed of assignment is not enough in itself to secure it to the debtor. He may waive the benefit of it, or he may lose it by neglect. It must be followed up by his demanding it in the manner prescribed by law. His property passes into the hands of his assignee, and then, on demand made for it, it is appraised and set aside for his use. That is the course the law has fixed, and any right Lewis Peterman may have here, must rest on claims properly made upon his assignee. The facts are that after the appraisement of certain personal property to him, he declined taking any more personal property, but demanded the balance in money, knowing at the time that no money had passed under the assignment, but expecting to get it out of the proceeds of his real estate, then in the hands of his assignee. He also says that at that time he did not know that there was anything coming to him out of his mother\u2019s estate, and did not claim any real estate as such. He is not, therefore, entitled to any money out of the proceeds of any real estate. For it is only after he has demanded real estate as such, and it has been found impossible to measure it off to him without injury to the whole, and the appraisers have so reported, that the debtor can get money out of the proceeds of its sale. The auditor therefore awards the share of Lewis Peterman in this distribution to Edmund Hershey, his assignee, for the benefit of his creditors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">The auditor awarded Lewis Peterman\u2019s share, amounting to $263.11, to his assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Lewis Peterman filed exceptions to the report of the auditor, amongst others the following :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">2. The auditor finds as a fact that at the time the assignment was executed Lewis Peterman did not know of this share in his deceased mother\u2019s estate, nor until after the assignee\u2019s account was settled and the balance distributed, and as a party is not bound to make his selection until he knows what he has to select from, the demand made upon the fund for distribution is in time, if no other demand had been made, and the auditor erred in not so deciding, and in not awarding Lewis Peterman\u2019s full share, less $99.88, to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-7\">3. The auditor erred in applying the decisions with reference to defendants in executions to the case before him, and in deciding that a demand upon the assignee was necessary to entitle Lewis Peterman to his distributive share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">7. The auditor erred in deciding that Lewis Peterman was not entitled to receive his share of the fund for distribution, and that the voluntary assignment from him to Hershey passed the whole of Peterman\u2019s property, less $99.88, notwithstanding the said assignment contains an exception as stated in his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">In delivering the opinion of the court on the exceptions, Eisher, P.

Certainly the law allowing the exemption of three hundred dollars from levy and distress to insolvent persons. Under the act relating to the exemption, real estate could not be set apart, unless it was specifically claimed and appraised. In this case the amount Lewis Peterman did not receive in personal goods, he demanded to be paid in money and not in real estate. * * * As Lewis Peterman did not demand the balance of the three hundred dollars in land, and did not demand an appraisement, and because none was made, we think he cannot claim the money in the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of his mother\u2019s estate, but that it goes into the hands of his trustee to be distributed among the creditors entitled to it under the assignment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-11\">The exceptions were dismissed and report of auditor confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-12\">Peterman appealed to the Supreme Court and assigned the confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-13\"><em>J.

July 2d 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">This is a proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court for the distribution of the fund arising from the sale of the real estate of Sarah Peter-man, deceased. The sale was made by a trustee under an order of the court, in proceedings in partition, and, upon the settlement and confirmation of his account an auditor was appointed to distribute the balance of the money in his hands. The appellant, Lewis Peterman, was entitled, as son and heir at law of the decedent, to the one undivided sixth part of the estate of which she died seised. But before the sale by the trustee, he made a voluntary assignment, for the benefit of his creditors, of all of his real and personal estate, \u201c except, however, so much as may he exempted by the laws of this Commonwealth from levy and sale on execution and distress for rent, to be selected by the said Lewis Peterman, and appraised for the use of himself and family, according to the law.\u201d He selected certain personal property, which was appraised at $99.88, and set apart for his use. The residue of the estate, with the exception of his interest in the land out of which the fund for the distribution arose, was sold by the assignee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and the proceeds distributed among the creditors. On the hearing before the auditor, the appellant claimed that he was entitled to so much of his share of the fund as would with the appraised value of the property which he had elected to retain, amount to the sum of three hundred dollars, but the auditor distributed the whole of his share to the assignee, and the court confirmed his report. Is the appellant then entitled to the portion of the fund he claims? It is clear that he is, unless his right to it was divested by the deed of the assignment. Whether it was or not, depends upon the construction to be given to the exception in the deed. He had the undoubted right to reserve for the use of himself and family, property to the value of'three hundred dollars. His right to except it out of the assignment is founded on the Exemption Act of the 9 th of April 1849, but his right to it as against the assignee, depends upon the exception of the deed. It is true that the deed does not specify or define the property intended to be excepted, but leaves it to be selected by the assignor. But his right of selection is not confined to any particular description of property, nor is it subject to any condition whatever; and his right to the property, when selected, is as perfect as if it had been specially excepted out of the assignment. It is to be appraised in order to ascertain and determine its value, and not for the purpose of enabling the assignor to exercise the right of selection. His right to select the amount, to which he is entitled under the exception, out of any part of his estate, does not depend upon its previous appraisement ; and if it did, the appraisement is not to be made under the Exemption Act, as ruled by the court below, but under the provisions of the act relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors, by the appraisers appointed by the Court of Common Pleas to appraise the assigned estate. It is manifest that there can be no appraisement of the property selected by the assignor under the provisions of the Exemption Act. The appraisement, for which it provides, can be made only by appraisers chosen by the sheriff, constable or other officer charged with the execution of a warrant, or writ for the levy and sale of the debtor\u2019s property. But the appraisers of the assigned estate must necessarily fix the value of what the assignor proposes to keep, else they cannot assess what the assignee is to account for: Mulford <em>v. </em>Shirk, 2 Casey 475. But where the assignor elects to receive the amount to which he is entitled in money, no appraisement is necessary. To appraise money is to count, and counting answers all the purpose of appraisement: Larrison\u2019s Appeal, 12 Casey 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">If then the appellant had the right to elect that the residue of the amount excepted from the assignment should be paid him out of the fund for distribution, as he undoubtedly had, and if no demand of an appraisement under the Exemption Law was neeessary in order to enable him to exercise the right, it is clear that he was guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>of no laches in making the election. He claimed that the residue of the amount, to which he was entitled, should be paid out of the fund as soon as he had the right to demand and receive it. He had an undivided interest, as already suggested, in the land out of which it arose. It was not in his possession when he made the assignment, and it was not converted into money by the act of his assignee, but by the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, because partition of it could not be made among the heirs. As soon as his right to the fund attached he asserted his claim to it, and as he had not parted with his right to the amount which he claimed, he was clearly entitled to it as against the assignee. The Orphans\u2019 Court was, therefore, in error in not awarding to the appellant the sum of two hundred dollars and twelve cents out of the fund for distribution, and directing the residue of the share in controversy, viz., the sum of sixty-two dollars and ninety-nine cents, to be paid to the appellee. The decree confirming the auditor\u2019s report must be reversed, and the record remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court, with instructions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion. The costs of this appeal to be paid by the appellee out of the portion of the fund decreed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Decree accordingly. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
