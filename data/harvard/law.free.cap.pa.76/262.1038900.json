August Kahler brought the mare then to your place ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-22\">\u201c A. He brought her there, and got tired of her, and he got at us till we bought her, and we were just to pay Daniel Keller for the mare. We have not paid that yet, but we intend to pay for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-23\">\u201c Cross-examined. \u2014 Q.

Did you not send August Kahler to buy that horse ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">\u201cA. No.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">44 Q. Had he means of his own to buy it with ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-9\">\u201cA.

Now, did not you fix any price to that horse before you sent him to Keller ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-11\">\u201cA. No; I did not. There was no conversation between Kahler and I about that, because if we had wanted the horse I would have gone and got the horse myself; but when he fetched the horse there, hi could not ride her; she was that fiery and mean that he was afraid to ride her, and he got us to buy her, and we done so. Billy Davis filled up that note; I signed that note \u2014 both the signatures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-12\">44 Q.

I signed it at Davis\u2019s store, at Shaversville. Daniel Keller lived up the valley. I was not at the sale. The note was signed a few days after the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-18\">44 Q.

I don\u2019t know how that was, but I saw Dan Keller at Shavers-ville, and says he,4 Tell August that I want security for that mare,\u2019 and I said, 4 We will go his security for the mare,\u2019 and says he, 4 The note is in at Jemmie Davis\u2019s, he has the note in his store.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-21\">44 Q.

State whether or not you and John afterwards bought that mare from Kahler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-14\">\u201c A. We did; I did not at any time hear John tell Kahler to go to Keller\u2019s to buy a horse.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-15\">The court, after instructing the jury as to the law in the case and referring to the evidence as to the other personal property, as to the mare said :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-16\"><em>\u201c </em>The defendant further urges that the claim of plaintiff to the bay mare purchased at Daniel Keller\u2019s sale has failed. You will remember the testimony of Kahler. He says, at John\u2019s request he went to the sale and bid for this mare for him, John E. Seeds ; that he took her home and John bought her from him. You will remember what John and Mrs. Seeds testify. They say Kahler bought her, and they bought her from him; that Kahler gave his note, and they went his bail to Keller. It is not alleged that Kahler paid Keller, or that they paid Kahler. If the testimony of Kahler be believed, that he bought her for John, of course she is John\u2019s property. If Seeds and wife purchased her from Kahler jointly, she would still be subject to levy and sale for John\u2019s debts, unless the property was acquired afterwards by Mrs. Seeds, in one or other of the methods by which a married woman acquires title to property. It is not alleged that Mrs. Seeds bought and paid for this mare ; that Kahler sold to her, or that she acquired this portion of the property in any other way than by a joint purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>with her husband; therefore the evidence, it seems to us, fails to establish her claim to this mare, and we so instruct you. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">* <em>\u201c </em>As to the bay mare bought at Keller\u2019s sale you will find for the defendant, whatever may be your verdict as to the other property levied on; and the products of the farm you will find for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">The jury found for the plaintiff specifically, a number of articles contained in the sheriff\u2019s levy, including some articles of furniture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">\u201c And find for the defendant, the bay mare bought at Keller\u2019s sale, one corner cupboard, chairs, tables, and all household and. kitchen furniture not above named as found for plaintiff included in the sheriff\u2019s levy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-9\">The plaintiff took a writ of error and assigned for error, amongst other things, the parts of the charge above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-10\"><em>B.

Goods purchased on her personal credit are not her separate estate: Robison <em>v. </em>Wallace, 3 Wright 129.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b266-12\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AjB\">delivered the opinion of the court, June 1st 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The plaintiff in error was the unquestioned owner of the farm on which she and her husband resided. She was engaged in its cultivation. The jury has found that she owned the stock, farming implements and crops, upon it. Her husband acted as her agent in overseeing the farm, and in conducting her business generally. He had been for many years, prior tO' the-purchase of the mare in question, and then was, notoriously insolvent. She had good pecuniary credit, he had none. The note given on the purchase of the mare of Keller, indicated upon its face, that her credit, not her husband\u2019s, was pledged for its payment. Whether her name was signed as surety or as principal, it professed to bind her only, and not him. Hence whether the purchase was made of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>fendant, as claimed by the plaintiff, or -whether it had previously been made of Keller for her husband, as the defendant testified, the fact remains that the husband signed the note in behalf of ELis wife. It is well settled that when the wife has a separate estate, and she buys property on the credit of that separate estate, she may hold it against the creditors of her husband: Wieman v. Anderson <em>et al., </em>6 Wright 811; Rush <em>v. </em>Vought, 5 P. F. Smith 437; Brown <em>v. </em>Pendleton <em>et al., </em>10 Id. 421; Musser <em>v. </em>Gardner, 16 Id. 242. It is not necessary that she shall have paid for it at the time of her purchase. She is not precluded from buying upon credit, provided it be upon the credit of her separate estate. It is incumbent upon her to- establish the fact that the purchase was so made, to protect her title against the creditors of her husband. The fact is to be established by proof which satisfies the jury. As already shown, she had a separate estate; her husband had none. The question then is, was there \u2022 sufficient evidence to leave to the jury to find whether the mare was purchased for the plaintiff and on the credit of her separate estate ? Both the plaintiff and her husband distinctly testify that the purchase was made of the defendant some time after he had purchased from Keller. In answer to the direct question put to the husband whether it was bought for him or for his wife, he answered, \u201cit was bought for Mrs. Seeds, for her use.\u201d He also testified that his wife acknowledged her liability to pay. This then was a ratification of his authority to bind her in the purchase. It is true, in the course of his testimony, he said, \u201c we bought \u201d and \u201cwe have not yet paid,\u201d but this language does not necessarily imply, that he and his wife jointly purchased. The language \u201cwe bought,\u201d or \u201cwe sold,\u201d is that which every wife and every child frequently uses in speaking of a purchase or a sale made by or for the husband and father. It is the familiar expression of every clerk in speaking of the business transactions of his employer. With fully equal reason and propriety may it be used by a husband who is acting as agent for his wife, without conveying the idea he is acting for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It was for the jury and not for the court to put a construction on this language, yet the learned judge said to the jury \u201c it is not alleged that Mrs. Seeds * * * acquired this portion of the property in any other way than by a joint purchase with her husband, therefore this evidence, it seems to us, fails to establish her claim to this mare, and we so instruct you.\u201d The testimony of the defendant that he did not sell the mare to the plaintiff, but purchased, her of Keller for the husband in his own right, created an issue of fact for the jury. Under proper instructions the court should have, submitted the evidence to the jury to find by whom, and on whose credit, the purchase was made. The learned judge therefore erred in directing the jury to find for the defendant as to the mare.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
