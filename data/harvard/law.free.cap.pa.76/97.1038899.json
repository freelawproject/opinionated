W. Harnish (plaintiff) testified :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">\u201cIn 1867, the latter part of December, Mr. Bowers and I talked over about castings for the building of horse-rakes; he said that he was going to build some the coming season, and wanted some castings ; he said we should make some and bring same to the shop; we commenced making castings and delivered some the forepart of January 1868; after we had delivered the first or second lot, I met Mr. Bowers in Lancaster, he told me he had entered into an agreement with Eshleman &amp; Herr, and showed me a copy of it \u2014 I read over this agreement \u2014 and upon the strength of that, we delivered these castings, hauled them down to the shop in Beaver street; a little before the 1st of April 1868, I met Bowers again here in town, and spoke about getting some money from the parties ; in consequence of what Mr. Bowers then said, I applied to Messrs. Eshleman &amp; Herr, in company with Mr. Bowers, and asked them for some money on account of the castings which had been delivered; first, they asked me if I had a bill; I told them I had not; they then asked me if I had any idea what the bill would be for the castings delivered; this was the 9th of April, the time this note was given; I told them as near as I could tell, it was somewhere between eight hundred and one thousand dollars; one of them said that money was a little scarce with them at that time, and they asked me, if I would be willing to take a note for $800 for sixty days, if they would pay the discount on it; I told them that I would; they executed a note and gave it to me and I realized the money from the Lancaster Bank; before we parted there they said we should hurry up the balance of the castings for the remainder of the rakes; that they would settle for the balance after they were delivered \u2014 the balance of the castings; Mr. Herr, I think it was, said to me that they had given me now a pretty good part of this money and we would have to give them a little time for the rest of this money; that we would have to be easy on them for the balance. Then we talked over the matter and one thing or another, and before w'e separated, they made the emphatic request that we would be particular in hurrying up these castings to enable them to finish the rakes; and in pursuance of that, we did hurry and finish the castings and delivered them at the shop in Beaver- street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">Plaintiffs then produced their book of original entries ; the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>entry was January 4th 1868, to Bowers &amp; Eckman; the next January 24th to Bowers &amp; Co.; next January 30th to Bowers alone ; the next February 7th to A. K. Bowers &amp; Co.,; the next February 15th to A. K. Bowers; following which were a very large number of entries of different dates up to July 2d, all to A. K. Bowers &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">Witness (plaintiff) then was asked: \u201cWhy are some to Bowers &amp; Eckman, some to A. K.

K. Bowers during that time; the balance was $563.24 due on the 6th of July 1868. The castings were all delivered at that time \u2014 at the date of that bill; at the time over here at Mr. Sprecher\u2019s, they said I shall hurry and deliver all the castings, and when they were all delivered, they would settle and pay for the balance; I spoke sometime afterwards to Mr. Eshleman about this, and he said they could not pay, they had lost money enough by Bowers. We sent no castings to Mr. Bowers\u2019s shop except for these rakes ; there was a man of the name of Frantz for whom Bowers was making or repairing a corn-sheller; he told me to send the castings to Bowers\u2019s shop, which we did and charged them to Mr. Bowers; Mr. Frantz afterwards called and paid for the castings; I made the addition of \u2018 <em>Co.,\u2019 </em>for my own satisfaction, after I found that.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-15\">Bowers, recalled, testified: \u201c Beecher &amp; Harnish delivered no other castings during the year 1868 than. those for these rakes, except for the corn-planter, as mentioned by Mr. Harnish.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-16\">The plaintiffs\u2019 point and answer were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201c The court is respectfully asked to charge that, if the jury find the promise by defendants to pay to plaintiffs for the castings in question, and also find that the main purpose and object of such promise was not to answer for another, but to subserve some purpose of their own, such promise is not within the Statute of Frauds and the defendants are bound to pay to the plaintiffs the price or value of the castings sold and delivered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">\u201c Answered in the affirmative, adding to \u2018 some purpose of their own\u2019 the words \u2018as <em>virtual owners of the property.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">The defendants\u2019 points were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">1.

K. Bowers and not to the defendants; Bowers was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the manufacturer of the horse-rakes, and the plaintiffs began to furnish the castings for them before Bowers entered into the contract with the defendants to advance him the money. That contract gave the latter no control over the rakes. Bowers was to sell them and hand over the proceeds only in payment of their advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The plaintiffs knew nothing of this arrangement until Bowers exhibited the article to Harnish to show him that he would be provided with the means of payment. They charged the castings to A. K. Bowers, and it was only, as Harnish testifies, \u201c after he knew Messrs. Herr &amp;'Eshleman were in combination with A. K. Bowers, he then added the <em>\u2018 </em>&amp; Co.\u2019 to the entries of the charges made and delivered for the horse-rakes.\u201d It is evident he thought the agreement constituted Bowers and Eshleman &amp; Herr partners. Then it was not until the 9th of April, when he had already finished about two-thirds of the castings, he had the conversation with the defendants out of which this action grew. After some reluctance Eshleman &amp; Herr advanced for Bowers $800 \u2014 in their note, and took his receipt, referring to their agreement. It was at this time the alleged promise was made. Up to this moment it is clear the relation of debtor and creditor between Bowers and the plaintiffs existed, and not between the defendants and them. How was the relation changed? The burden of proving a change of relation clearly and satisfactorily lay then on the plaintiffs; if not so proved, Bowers continued to be their debtor and the promise of the defendants was to pay his debt, and not being in writing, fell within the Statute of Frauds, 26th April 1855, sept. 1. This alternative was fairly presented to the jury in plain language, by the learned judge below. The only question, therefore, is, whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the change of relation, and make the defendants the principal debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Bowers says, referring to the meeting to obtain the further advance of $800 : \u201c They (defendants) gave him the note and told him to hurry on with the rest of the castings, to finish the eight hundred rakes.\u201d \u201c I heard them tell Harnish to hurry up the balance,\u201d again, \u201c at that time about two-thirds of the castings were finished. I ordered the goods to make the rakes, and they paid for them when they had the money. I sold the rakes and gave them orders to pay.\u201d Harnish testified to the same conversation as to the advance of $800 to Bowers. He says: \u201cBefore we parted there, they said we should hurry up the balance of the eastings for the remainder of the rakes; they would settle for the balance after they were delivered.\u201d Again, \u201cthey said I should hurry and deliver all the castings, and when they were all delivered they would settle and pay for the balance.\u201d Now in all this there was not a word expressing or even indicating a change of the relation between the plaintiffs and Bowers, or that the defendants took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>debt upon themselves as them own. When all was delivered they would settle and pay for the balance. Delivered to whom\"? Clearly to Bowers. They would settle and pay what? Clearly Bowers\u2019s debt. As a promise to pay, it was entirely consistent with their own relation to Bowers to advance him money to finish the eight hundred rakes. Harnish had not refused to continue to furnish the castings to Bowers. Then the plaintiffs gave their own interpretation to the promise of the defendants. They not only continued to furnish the castings to Bowers, but they charged them to him and company. It is evident Harnish thought the liability of the defendants grew out of thir agreement with Bowers. It was this <em>combination, </em>as he terms it, which caused him to add the sign <em>Co. </em>to the charges in the book, and to continue the charges in that form.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">But when a change of relation is alleged for the purpose of taking the case out of the Statute of Frauds, it lies upon the plaintiff to prove it by clear and indubitable evidence. The promise here must be attributed to the existing relations of the parties, in which Bowers was the purchaser of the castings from Harnish &amp; Beecher, and Eshleman &amp; Herr were mere loaning creditors of Bowers, under their written agreement and judgment against him. When the latter advanced the $800 they were reluctant and told Harnish they had advanced about all they were to under the agreement. Bowers Avas then becoming slow, and there is no probability that they would step out of their agreement and judgment to assume a new and worse relation; besides, there was a manifest reason for their expressions to Harnish to hurry up the castings. The eight hundred rakes were to be finished by the 1st of May, and this Avas the 9th of April. The season for making sales was rapidly approaching and the rakes should be in the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">They were straining a point in raising the $800 for Harnish, and nothing was more natural when they were doing him a favor than to say to him now hurry up and we will settle the balance, without intending to change their position in the case. Their conduct was entirely consistent with existing relations, Awhile there was nothing to justify the conclusion that they became the principal debtors of the plaintiffs. There was no suflicient evidence therefore to take the case out of the statute requiring a writing to answer for the debt in default of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">We think there was error also in admitting the book of the plaintiffs as a book of original entries, to prove the charges for the castings. It was not competent evidence of the performance of a special contract with Eshleman &amp; Herr, and could have been received only as a memorandum of the items, to refresh the memory of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
