A scire facias was issued on this mortgage by Samuel M.

Allison testified that he and Guthrie had an interest in a vacant piece of land: a warrant was issued to witness July 11th 1851; witness wishing to dispose of his interest, Guthrie proposed to take the whole, and witness at his request transferred his interest to N. A. Lowry, November 5th 1851. Guthrie paid him $50, but Lowry paid him nothing. On the 27th of October 1852 W. H. Lowry, executor, &amp;c., of N. A. Lowry, conveyed to Arnold Plumer; a patent was issued to Plumer January 28th. 1854. Plumer afterwards sold the land for $2750. Guthrie, when he requested witness to convey to Lowry, said that it was to secure advances that Lowry was making to him; Lowry assented to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-7\">W. II. Lowry, son and executor of N. A. Lowry, testified : that his father and Guthrie had extensive dealings and lumber contracts for the delivery of lumber at Cincinnati; his father had judgments against Guthrie during the life of the contract, taken as collateral security for its performance and to secure advances made by N. A. Lowry, who died February 1851, before a settlement was made; witness proposed to Guthrie to cancel the contract and surrender the securities on payment of the balance due N. A. Lowry. \u201c I afterwards met Arnold Plumer and the defendant at Clarion, in pursuance of that arrangement, and I was there offered $15,000 by Mr. Plumer, and he was to take the position occupied by the estate with reference to those securities; I refused to take it, and separated without any settlement; by subsequent agreement I afterwards met the defendant and Mr. Plumer at the Monongahela House in Pittsburg, and there made an arrangement, by a writing I gave at that time, that on the payment to us of $11,000 within a certain time, I would transfer all of our securities to the party paying or securing to us that amount of money; at the time this proposition was made there were doubts as to whether the judgment against the Bingham trustees would be affirmed; that was my reason for making the proposition I did, for if I had been certain of its affirmation, I would not have made the proposition I did; the proposition was made sometime in the fall of 1852 ; this proposition was consummated, I think, within thirty or sixty days afterwards at Warren, by the transfer of the lumber contracts and all securities received from the defendant, to Arnold Plumer, for $11,000, in negotiable paper; the first payment was made in hand, or a short payment, and the balance on time, extending through several years; the defendant brought Mr. Plumer to me, and it was through the defendant I negotiated with Mr. Plumer; if we had acquired any title to lands from or through the defendant, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>transferred them and all contracts and securities that we held, growing out of the transactions, to Mr. Plumer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">Being cross-examined, he said: \u201c The assignments of judgments and collaterals spoken of in my examination in chief were absolute; I suppose they were absolute on their face; I have no recollection whether the word collateral was used or not; I only inferred from my father\u2019s general custom of doing business that they were absolute; I have never found any thing' among my father\u2019s papers to show that they were held by him as collateral; I was more or less cognisant of the transactions between my father and Mr. Guthrie; I have no recollection of any contract in writing between my father and Mr. Guthrie, as to how these securities were held by my father; I know that Mr. Guthrie was largely indebted to my father at the time these judgments and collaterals spoken of were assigned to him; my impression is that sums of money were advanced by my father to defendant after the date of the assignments, but cannot be positive as to that without reference to my books and papers; there had been some lumber delivered on the contract before the assignment was made to Plumer, but cannot say how much; at the time these assignments were made to Plumer, we pretended to own the lumber and material at the mills at that time; do not remember whether the mills were running or not; the man in charge of the mills was put there by my father to represent his interest; I think my father furnished the .superintendent money from time to time to carry on the mills; I furnished money more or less after my father\u2019s death to Mr. Davis to run the mill, and Davis paid me some $3000 out of the avails of lumber sold; the Guthrie debt, including advances and everything else, at the time of my father\u2019s death, amounted to about $24,000, and was inventoried by the appraisers at $12,000; Mr. Guthrie first approached me; he came to Jamestown, I think, to see on what terms I would settle; I cannot say positively whether I first approached Guthrie or he me, in regard to a settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">\u201c I had been to Clarion two or three times, and was determined to close the matter up; but, as I said before, my impression is that he, Guthrie, first approached me on the matter; I cannot tell how much money had been delivered on these contracts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">Examination in chief resumed: \u201c For some years previous to the time of his death, my father had been in delicate health; I was thoroughly acquainted with his business, and was sort of a confidential clerk, and there were but few transactions at that time but what I was thoroughly cognisant of; these assignments, if they were absolute on their face, I always considered as collateral.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">In answer to the question, \u201c Do you know the fact that these assignments were held as collateral, from conversations had between you and your father, prior to his death ?\u201d he said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">\u201c I know at the time father had made large advances to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Guthrie, and became alarmed as to his securities, and considered them very doubtful up to the time he received the assignment of the Bingham and other judgments, and even then he considered himself far from safe, as he had very great doubts as to whether the Bingham judgment would be affirmed; he thought if the judgment was paid he would get out whole; at that time Guthrie\u2019s title to some of the lumber property was not perfected, as there were large sums due for purchase-money; I know that these assignments were deemed collateral by my father; I considered that if the Bingham judgment had been paid and the lumber contracts fulfilled, my father would have been made whole, and made a margin of profit on the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">C. B. Curtis testified: <em>\u201c </em>After N. A. Lowry\u2019s death an arrangement was made between- his executors and A,rnold Plumer, by which the executors were- to transfer all their claims and securities to Arnold Plumer, for a sum which was agreed upon; that arrangement was .consummated at Warren, I think, in October 1852; all the parties being present \u2014 Guthrie, Plumer and the executors. These transfers were in writing ; I was acting attorney all the time, first for Nathaniel A. Lowry, in his lifetime, and afterwards for his estate, and was present at Warren when the arrangement was made; William H. Lowry was the principal man acting for the estate, and Plumer was acting for himself, of which he was capable; the amount agreed upon was closed up by Arnold Plumer\u2019s bank notes; it was talked by and between the parties just what the interest of Lowry was at the time; I mean to say, that by conversations between the parties, during the negotiations, they knew what the interest of Lowry was, and the relations he bore to Guthrie concerning these advancements; when I say parties, I mean to refer to Plumer and the executors of Lowry ; I recollect that the Burdick judgment was talked about as a security, but I do not know the particulars in regard to it; the defendant in this suit seemed the most anxious to consummate the arrangement; the object of the arrangement, as I learned it from the parties, was to put Arnold Plumer in the position which the .estate of Lowry occupied. This was about twenty years ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">S. P. Johnson testified: \u201cIn 1852 I was attorney for James W. Guthrie in a suit against C. R. Burdick, in the recovery of'a judgment for $1425.80; subsequently, in October of that year, this judgment was assigned by J. W. Guthrie to Arnold Plumer ; I continued to be the attorney for the plaintiff for the collection of this judgment until the fall of 1860; between January 12\u00a3h 1854 and July 15th 1857, inclusive, I find credits on my books to Arnold Plumer $915.53, as collected upon the judgment against Burdick. * * * While acting as attorney for Mr. Plumer in the collection of this judgment, he stated to me in conversation that he had received the assignment and held the same either as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>bonus or as collateral security for the assumption of certain liabilities of Mr. Guthrie, which he had made; the substance of what he said was that it had cost him nothing and professed a willingness to reassign the same to Mr. Guthrie at any time, which he did do, I think, at my instance; in 1852, and prior to that time, as attorney for Mr. Guthrie, I was familiar with his affairs and embarrassments, and knew the fact that Mr. Plumer about that time undertook to assist Mr. Guthrie through 'his financial embarrassments, and as his security for so doing obtained from Mr. Lowry and Mr. Guthrie the assignment of judgments and other securities to a large amount as collateral, the particular items of which I cannot now name, <em>except </em>the one above mentioned and a large judgment which Mr. Guthrie had against the trustees of the Bingham estate; I frequently urged, in later years, both Messrs. Guthrie and Plumer to have a settlement of their matters; both promised me it should be done, each claiming that th\u00e9 other was probably indebted to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">Being cross-examined, he said, under objection: \u201c The conversation I had with Mr. Plumer in regard to a settlement with Guthrie was in 1860, and again in 1865; I do not think Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Plumer were together when I had these conversations with either; I think Mr. Plumer claimed that Guthrie was indebted to him, but he did not deny that he was holding property in trust, both real and personal; I was on confidential terms with them both; I was attorney for both. * * * Mr. Plumer admitted to me that' he had taken N. A. Lowry\u2019s place in his relation to Mr. Guthrie, and had received from him the securities that Guthrie had placed in his (Lowry\u2019s) hands, and that he had assumed certain liabilities for Mr. Guthrie; I can\u2019t recollect that Mr. Plumer ever specified any securities that he held- in trust other than those referred <em>to; </em>I can\u2019t say that Mr. Plumer ever told me anything about his purchase of real estate owned by Guthrie, or of his holding any in trust for Guthrie; our conversation was usually upon the hypothesis or supposition that each of us knew the facts in the case, and I recollect of no specific declarations of Mr. Plumer on the subject.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">The defendant gave in evidence the deposition of S. M. Lane : the parts in brackets were objected to, admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-8\">The deponent testified: \u201cIn the spring of 1851, Judge Bredin, Samuel A. Purviance, A. N. Meylert and myself, purchased from the Bingham estate their unsold lands in Clarion, Jefferson, Forest and Venango counties, with the unpaid purchase-money on contracts on lands sold, and mortgages, judgments, &amp;c., all their interest in said counties; included in the purchase was a mortgage given by James W. Guthrie to the Bingham estate on certain farms in Clarion county, town property in the town of Stratton<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ville, and in the town of Clarion, Clarion county; some years afterwards (probably three or four), Mr. Purviance,- who was the attorney of the company, and myself, who was attending to the business at the time, got Mr. Guthrie to give a judgment on an amicable scire facias on the mortgage; some time afterwards, a year or two more or less, I can\u2019t tell how long, it was entered of record; the property was sold, judgment was entered on this paper whatever it was, and afterwards the property was sold and bid in for us; I presume it was on that judgment; it remained in that way, Mr. Guthrie still having possession of his property; Mr. Guthrie commenced writing to me then; I received letters from him with regard to this property; [I went to Clarion on some business in the summer of 1858, I think ; while there Mr. Guthrie sent a messenger down from Strattonville, with an urgent request that I come to see him; I went to see him; he commenced immediately to talk about this mortgage property;] he said to me that he understood we were going to make a division, or I told him that; [Mr. Guthrie wanted me to get this property that he had owned in my division ; he said that he had a friend who would pay a certain amount of money for the mortgage property; either then or afterwards he named the amount of $9000, that his friend would pay, and take this property for him if I could get it; I told him that I wanted the entire balance of my interest there to net me $12,000; I reserved my interest in the Fox and Beaman bonds, which amounted to $2500 about, leaving $9500 to make it $12,000; Mr. Guthrie said he would pay the $500, as his friend would only pay the $9000, as that was all he had arranged for, or spoken about.] I think when I returned from Mr. Guthrie\u2019s to Clarion I met Arnold Plumer on the street at Clarion ; he spoke to me and said that Mr. Guthrie had been at him to get this property for him; he supposed he would have to arrange it. [Then I believe was the first time I knew who Mr. Guthrie\u2019s friend was ; he had never told me ; I had told Mr. Guthrie that if I could arrange it to get this property in the division I would, to meet his views; the matter was in negotiation between Judge Campbell, James Bredin and myself, for some time; we finally agreed upon a division, giving me this property and a certain contract, together with my interest in the Fox and Beaman bonds; I did not want to take it till I should see Mr. Plumer and see if he would take it from me.] Early in the summer of 1859, I think, I met Mr. Plumer at the Monongahela House in Pittsburg; Mr. Plumer said to me there, \u2018 About that Guthrie business, or about that property of Guthrie\u2019s, I might as well fix it up one time as another: if you will get the papers prepared I will do it at once;\u2019 I got the papers ready; Mr. Plumer paid me the money at the Monongahela House ($9000), for the mortgage property and a certain contract of about $1500 ; he got the deed and that is about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>all of it. [Mr. Guthrie told me to make the title to Mr. Plumer. This mortgage, property and the contract did not make up the amount I had agreed to take by $500; he told me to close it up with Mr. Plumer and he would pay the $500 ; I saw Mr. Guthrie afterwards and he gave me his note at six months; I sent the note to Mr. Reed and he collected the money ; I took this mortgage property and this contract entirely at the instance of Mr. Guthrie and to oblige him: all the bargaining and contracting in this transaction was with Mr. Guthrie, except what I have stated that Mr. Plumer said; the arrangement that I made with Mr. Guthrie concerning this property was carried out by Mr. Plumer in good faith.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">Being cross-examined, he said : \u201c I was to get in my division the Guthrie mortgage, this contract and my share of the Fox and Beaman bonds, then these arrangements with Mr. Guthrie referred more especially to the mortgage and the contract; in my division I took the premises which had been mortgaged; the property was bid in for us and was then the property of our company; my conversations with Mr. Guthrie were after the property had been sold and bid in for us; I never had but two conversations with Mr. Plumer about this property ; at neither of these conversations did Mr. Plumer say that he was purchasing this property for Mr. Guthrie ? At the first conversation in Clarion he said that Mr. Guthrie wanted him to get this property for him;. he said that he supposed he would have to arrange it; I am not certain that he wanted him to get it for him, but I think he did; * * * he never stated in so many words that he purchased this property in trust for Mr. Guthrie; * * * I understood that Mr. Plumer was buying this property for Mr. Guthrie, although he did not tell me that; that was my impression ; * * * from Mr. Guthrie\u2019s negotiations in the first place, followed up and consummated by Mr. Plumer; I had no doubt about it; that made the impression on my mind and I had no doubt about it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">F. B. Guthrie, a son of defendant, testified as to Plumer furnishing money to his father, of their joint transactions in timber, &amp;c.; he further testified: \u201c Plumer resided at Franklin and did not see to the business only to take the money; my recollection is that my father sold the mill property to Burnell &amp; Wheeler, in 1854 or 1855, think in 1855; in 1866 and 1867, I was living in Titus-ville and practising law there; I had an interview with Mr. Plumer at his house, but can\u2019t remember the time; it was in cold weather; it was after the death of Burnell; in January or April 1867, I had frequently urged my father to get this matter settled up; Mr. Burnell had died; I went to Mr. Plumer\u2019s house; went in and sat down; said to Mr. Plumer that I wanted that thing settled up ; that my mother and brother were dead and I wanted it settled during the lifetime of my father; that I cared nothing about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>it myself as I could take care of myself, but that I had a sister whose interest I thought I should look after; I told him that I understood that he held the title to my father\u2019s property or a large-portion of it, in him; he said that he did; I told him that my father alleged that he had paid him for all the money that he had ever advanced to run the mills and buy the lands, the title to which he had; I told him that if that was the case, that the matter should be settled up during the lifetime of both of them; that my father was getting old as well as he; that Mr. Burnell and Mr. Davis, two of the men that knew most about the matter, were dead; I asked him then about the state of the accounts between them, and he said, You know, Mr. Guthrie, that I will have to charge for my time, trouble and the risk I had to run; I said certainly; he said that he did not think there was a great deal of difference in the money or accounts, either way ; he said he did not know exactly how they did stand; that he had received moneys from judgments and from notes, and had advanced money to run the mills and to buy the mills; had been talking about the old homestead at Strattanville, and the old farm that I did not like to see go away; he said, I will see that these things are fixed up before I die, and that the property should be reconveyed if my father had got out of his financial difficulties, so that he could hold it; I heard the conversation at Strattanville, 1st June 1858, at the time the money and notes were delivered to Plumer; Plumer said, You know, Mr. Guthrie, that I want to hold collaterals enough to keep me safe, and that he would advance money to Mr. Davis as he would need it.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The defendant gave much testimony as to the value of the land in dispute and covered by the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">The plaintiff in rebuttal gave in evidence the record of a bill of discovery in the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion county, of December Term 1856, in which Thomas Mellon was plaintiff and J.

If Arnold Plumer was indebted to James W. Guthrie on an unsettled and uncertain account, at the time he bought the land in controversy, and in consideration thereof, he made ,a parol agreement with him to buy the land for him and hold it in trust; and Arnold Plumer bought it and took the deed to himself, absolute on its face, and paid for it with his own money, although in violation of his contract, it would not raise a resulting trust, but would.be merely a parol sale, and void under the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>2. In order to establish a resulting trust, the evidence must be <em>\u201cclear, explicit and unequivocal,\u201d </em>that the land in controversy was paid for with Guthrie\u2019s money at <em>the time of the sale, </em>and in the absence of such evidence, it is the duty of the court to give binding instructions to the jury to find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">3. James W. Guthrie, by taking a lease from the plaintiff\u2019s testator in 1866, for the premises in dispute, has surrendered any trust or equitable estate he may have had, and by his deed is estopped from setting up any title in hostility to his landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">4. If the jury should find, under the evidence in this case, that there was a resulting trust in favor of J. W. Guthrie, such trust would be barred by the statute of 22d April 1856, more than five years having elapsed after he acknowledged himself to be the plaintiff\u2019s tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">5. By the article of agreement between N. A. Lowry\u2019s executors and Arnold Plumer, and the assignment of all his claims on J. W. Guthrie to Plumer, he, Plumer, became invested with the absolute right to the entire indebtedness of Guthrie to Lowry, precisely as Lowry held them before the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-9\">6. If at the instance and by the procurement of J. W. Guthrie, Arnold Plumer purchased the lands in controversy, and held the same by deed absolute on its face, though secretly in trust for Guthrie, to conceal them from his creditors, such concealment would be fraudulent, and Guthrie could not resist the legal title of his alleged trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-10\">7. Conceding all the testimony on behalf of the defendant in this case, it raises no trust, either <em>ex maleficio </em>or resulting from payment of purchase-money, that authorizes the court to submit to' the jury; but, as a chancellor, the court is bound to take the evidence from the jury, and give binding instructions to find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-11\">8. There is no- evidence in this suit that the consideration of the deed from S. M. Lane to Arnold Plumer,was a pre-existing indebtedness of Plumer to Guthrie; nor of money loaned by Plumer to either Guthrie or Lane. Nor was any indebtedness admitted by Plumer as the basis of his purchase, or any evidence of agreement to reconvey to Guthrie on payment to him of the consideration of that purchase; and if there was an unsettled account, or even indebtedness to Guthrie by Plumer, it being unsettled and indefinite in amount, it is too remotely connected with the conveyance by Lane to Plumer to justify the court in submitting it to the jury upon which to find a mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-12\">The defendant\u2019s points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-13\">1. If the jury believe from the evidence that by an arrangement between Nathaniel A. Lowry and James W. Guthrie, there was an agreement by which Guthrie was to obtain a satisfaction of the whole debt due by him to Lowry\u2019s estate, and to have a return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the collaterals by him transferred to Lowry in his lifetime, in consideration of $11,000; and if Plumer, understanding this arrangement, and acting under it for Guthrie\u2019s benefit, advanced $11,000 in notes to Lowry\u2019s executors, and took assignments of the col-laterals merely for his own security, any sum of money he might realize over the said advancements and interest from said col-laterals, he would hold and be accountable for as Guthrie\u2019s trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\">2. If at the time Plumer received the deed from Samuel M. Lane, he received the same under a purchase made by Guthrie, and for his benefit, under a previous arrangement with Lane, he, Guthrie, paying a part of the consideration, and Plumer the balance, he having at the time money in his hands of Guthrie, sufficient to pay the sum in full, this would be a resulting trust in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">3. If Guthrie made the bargain with Lane, by which he was to have the benefit of the transfer from Lane, on his paying the sum of $9500, and Plumer, either by his acts or declarations, induced Guthrie to believe that he would hold for his benefit, and thus obtained from him an advantage, <em>inter </em>alia, the payment of $500, the consideration which he could not otherwise have obtained from him, it would create a resulting trust in favor of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-8\">4. The lease executed by Guthrie to Plumer in 1866 can have no greater effect than evidence, <em>inter alia, </em>to show the nature and design of the original contract, or to show the intention of the parties in making the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-9\">5. If the jury believe from the evidence that the deed of Lane to Plumer, conveying the premises in dispute, with the mortgage and bond, along with the article of agreement between Bingham\u2019s trustees and Guthrie, was made under previous arrangement between Lane and Guthrie, and for Guthrie\u2019s benefit, he, Guthrie, paying $500 of the consideration, and retaining the possession, and that the $9000 paid by Plumer was an advancement which the deed was intended to secure, the mortgage-debt, which would otherwise have been extinguished, surviving to the use of Plumer, the whole arrangement would only operate as a mortgage in favor of Plumer, which the subsequent lease could in no wise affect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-10\">The court answered the points in the general charge, reading to the jury each point before answering it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-11\">The court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-12\">\u201c1.

In addition to this it is alleged that Guthrie was largely indebted to the estate of William Bingham.

That this mortgage was assigned to Lane, Meylert and others. That upon a judgment foreclosing this mortgage the property in controversy was sold and title thereto, ultimately became regularly vested in S. M. Lane. That negotiations were opened, looking to the purchase of this property from Lane, in which Guthrie and Plumer participated, and which finally resulted in a transfer of Lane\u2019s interest to Arnold Plumer for a consideration in the deed mentioned. Out of these transactions, extending over a period of more than twenty years, this controversy has arisen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-8\">\u201c The facts and principles supposed to be important in determining the rights of the parties have been referred to by the counsel for plaintiff and defendant, in certain written propositions submitted, and the instruction of the court requested thereon, with the view, under such instructions, to enable you rightly to determine this controversy.

If this was the nature of the transaction, we answer the plaintiff\u2019s third point in the negative, and defendant\u2019s fourth point in the affirmative.

The facts and circumstances proving this, must be clear, explicit and unequivocal. Whether the relation above stated be thus proven we leave to the jury.

Also find the time in which it ought to be paid. In the event of such finding, the time ought not to be unreasonable. If you come to this last conclusion, we will mould your verdict upon your finding the facts.

The proof, however, of the agreement necessary to so change its character must be clear, explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and unequivocal. It should not rest on the subsequent admissions and declarations of the alleged mortgagee only, but must establish an agreement substantially contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of the deed. Less than this would not only conflict with the rules of evidence which prescribe the manner in which a written instrument may be changed by parol, but also defeat the wise provisions of the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On and before the 8th of May 1857, the defendant was the owner of the lands in question. On that day all his title therein was divested by a sheriff\u2019s sale. There was no agreement by which the defendant was to retain or acquire any equities therein. The purchasers took a clear and unquestionable title. By means of subsequent conveyances and devise this title was regularly transmitted to the plaintiff. The plaintiff further proved that nearly seven years after the land was conveyed to her devisor, and while he held it, the defendant entered into a written lease with him for these lands for the term of one year, in consideration of the defendant\u2019s agreeing to- pay $100 and one-third of all the hay and grain produced on the premises, to pay all taxes, to cut no timber, and to surrender possession, &amp;c. Thus the plaintiff showed a clear paper title.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The defendant sought to convert the deed given to the plaintiff\u2019s devisor into a mortgage by an alleged parol agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The first assignment of error is to the admission of certain parts of the deposition of Samuel M. Lane. He was one of the purchasers at sheriff's sale, and after acquiring the estate of his co-tenants, conveyed to Arnold\u2019Plumer, under whom the plaintiff now claims. The portion of the deposition admitted under exception relates to conversations and negotiations between the defendant and the witness. They were not in the presence of the plaintiff\u2019s devisor. They were not proven to have ever been communicated to him. They occurred some ten months prior to the execution and delivery to him of the deed. They cannot therefore form any part of the <em>res gestee. </em>It was, then, manifestly wrong to admit. the declarations of the defendant and negotiations between him and the witness, not communicated to the devisor of the plaintiff. This assignment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The second assignment is not according to the rules and must be disregarded. The third and fourth were not pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">We discover no error in the fifth and eighth assignments. We think the answers of the learned judge were correct; but a failure to connect these transactions with Plumer\u2019s purchase of the land make them irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The eleventh assignment relates to the effect which should be given to the lease executed between Plumer and the defendant. The. point submitted by the defendant and the qualified affirmance thereof by the court, seems to declare that no greater effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>shall be given to the lease than as evidence, indicating the nature and design of the original contract between the parties, and their intention in making it. In so restricting its effect to that particular time, we think the court erred. There was no evidence of any fraud or imposition in procuring the lease. Hence if it was admitted that Plumer originally acquired the title in trust for the defendant, yet inasmuch as this lease was executed so many years thereafter, it was at least evidence of the termination of that trust and the abandonment by the defendant of all interest in the land other than that of lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The remaining assignments may be considered together. The defendant seeks by oral testimony to convert into a mortgage, a deed absolute on its face. To do this he must prove a contract to that effect: Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, 7 Harris 471. It was, however, said in Rhines <em>et al. v. </em>Baird, 5 Wright 256, that the agreement need not be express, but it may be inferred from facts and circumstances inconsistent with its being an absolute conveyance. We will add, that knowledge of those facts and circumstances must be brought home to the owner of the legal title before he shall be affected thereby. A careful examination of the evidence fails to show any conversation between the defendant and Plumer in relation to the latter\u2019s purchasing or taking a conveyance of the land for his benefit. None such is shown to have either preceded, or to have been cotemporaneous with, the execution of the deed. The parties to the alleged agreement were never brought face to face. \u25a0 No communication either verbal or written ever passed between them indicating it was a mortgage, although Plumer lived ten years after he procured the conveyance. The defendant however relies mainly on facts and circumstances shown, after this great lapse of time, and after the death of Plumer, to prove the conveyance was a mortgage only. Such testimony should be received with caution. When received, if it fails to satisfy the court as well as the jury \u2014 if it does not make out a case in which a chancellor would decree a conveyance, it should not be submitted to the jury: Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, <em>supra; </em>Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell <em>et al., </em>8 Casey 250; DeFrance <em>et al. v. </em>DeFranee <em>et al., </em>10 Casey 385; Bennett <em>et ux. v. </em>Fulmer, 13 Wright 155; McGinity <em>v. </em>McGinity, 13 P. F. Smith 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The defendant showed there were other large and unsettled business transactions between him and Plumer. He claims that the latter was, at the time of the conveyance, indebted to him in an amount equal to the $9000 which he paid for the land, or if not, that it was a loan by Plumer to him. Ho settlement of those transactions was ever made by the parties. It is not shown that Plumer admitted the existence of such an indebtedness, or of any indebtedness, or that the $9000 was a loan. It is true, Lane thinks, but will not be certain, that about a year before the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>veyance to Plumer, the latter said the defendant wanted him to get this property for him, the defendant. Nothing however was said at the time of the conveyance to Plumer by any one indi-, eating any such purpose. The fact that a jury may now find that if a settlement had been made between the defendant and Plumer at the time of the conveyance, the latter would'have fallen in debt to the former, or that at Plumer\u2019s death he was indebted to the defendant in other business transactions, is insufficient of itself to prove that he accepted the conveyance as a mortgage. Nor does the fact that the defendant, unknown to Plumer, paid Lane $500 change the character of the written instrument. It cannot with any show of reason be said that the action of Plumer was influenced by the acts of others of which he had no notice. The burden of proof rests on the defendant.' It will not do to establish a mere dim probability only of the correctness of his theory. He must go further and make the proof clear and explicit. If such proof had been given of an agreement at the execution of the deed, then the testimony of F. B. Guthrie would have been strong evidence of its continuance, and of the- payment of the money. All his testimony as to Plumer\u2019s declarations made after he procured the deed, fails to establish a previous agreement. Neither in the conversation had in 1853, before the execution of-the lease, nor in 1867, when the defendant was in possession under it, did Plumer admit that he had accepted the deed as a mortgage. He admitted a present willingness or intention to convey at some future time, from which it is claimed a legal inference may be drawn that he had so agreed many years before. Such effect cannot be given to his declarations. It would be fraught with great mischief and injustice. Every unexecuted intention of making a gift of real estate might be distorted into a previous valid agreement, and the Statute of Frauds be defeated. It will not do to permit a legal title in the hands of an heir or devisee to be destroyed by such vague and uncertain testimony; neither doubt, nor suspicion, nor uncertainty, nor all of them in regard to the circumstances under which the ancestor or devisor acquired title to the property, will convert it into a mortgage. As lands become more Valuable the temptation to commit fraud and perjury will be increased. Hence the requirement of clear and explicit evidence of the alleged agreement should not be relaxed.
