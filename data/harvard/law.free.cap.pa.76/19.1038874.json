Two of his children died in the lifetime of the widow, to wit: Caleb Cresson, Jr., leaving one child, Sarah Emlen Cresson; and Annabella C. Wistar, leaving four children, Dillwyn Wistar, C. Cresson Wistar, Emma Wistar, and Bartholomew Wistar. The widow of the testator died March 28th 1870. Most of the estate of the testator had been divided amongst the children by an amicable arrangement whilst all were living.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-11\">After the widow\u2019s death, her executors settled her account as executrix of her husband. This account was referred to William H. Ruddiman, Esq.,*as auditor, for adjustment,. &amp;c., and to report a distribution of the balance. He reported that the balance for distribution, after deducting costs and expenses of audit, was $28,710.42.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-12\">After an elaborate discussion of many authorities, and application of their principles to the will, he concluded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-13\">* * * \u201c Following the line of reasoning into which he has thus been necessarily conducted, the auditor is of the. opinion, that by the words 11 all my children who then shall be living,\u2019 the testator had reference only to his children who should be living at the death of his widow, and not to the issue of any deceased children ; that \u2018 all my children who shall <em>then be living,\u2019 </em>cannot be made to describe all his children who should be living at the time of his own death; that the estate in remainder did not vest at that period, but upon the happening of that event upon which it was contingent as to the parties who were to take; and that therefore, the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of Caleb Cresson, Jr., and Annabella C. Wistar, cannot claim any share as belonging to their deceased parents; their said parents not being in the class described as residuary legatees of the testator. The claim made by them is accordingly disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-6\">\u201c The auditor therefore finds in favor of the children of the testator, who were living at the period of the death of their mother, to wit: Mary Emlen Smith, Emlen Cresson, William P. Cresson and Charles C. Cresson; and reports distribution among them in equal proportions, of the balance in the hands of the accountant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-7\">The children of Caleb Cresson, Jr., and Annabella C. Wistar, filed exceptions to the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-8\">After hearing the exceptions, the Orphans\u2019 Court (Peirce, J.) delivered the following opinion :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-9\">* * * \u201c The question which arises under this will is to what period of time do the words in the residuary clause devising and bequeathing the remainder of his estate to all his children \u2018 who shall then be living \u2019 refer ? There are three periods of time mentioned or referred to in the will to which they may be applicable, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-11\">\u201c 1. The death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-12\">\u201c 2. The termination of the minority of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-13\">\u201c 3. The death of the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-14\">\u201c The auditor has found that the words refer to the last of these events, the death of the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-15\">\u201c In reading the will it will be perceived that none of these periods are referred to in express terms, but are only inferable from the use of other terms expressed in the will. Thus the words, \u2018 I give, devise and bequeath \u2019 imply the death of the testator before the devise or bequest can take effect. . And the words, \u2018 for and during all her natural life,\u2019 imply a termination of that life. And the words, \u00a3 during their minority,\u2019 imply a termination of the minority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-16\">\u201cThe word \u2018then\u2019 is-an adverb of time and usually relates to some antecedent period or event. Thus A. devises to B., and on the death of B. <em>then </em>to C. The word <em>then </em>in that case clearly refers to the death of B. Sometimes it indicates an order or succession of events. Thus a testator bequeaths to his son a sum of ten thousand dollars, and proceeds by will to say: \u2018 Then I give and bequeath a like sum of ten thousand dollars to my daughter.\u2019 The word <em>then </em>in that case indicates an order of giving.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-17\">\u201c It* is one rule of the interpretation of language that the relative word refers to its nearest or immediately preceding antecedent; this rul\u00e9 of course has its qualifications, as where the relative word and the nearest antecedent are so manifestly incongruous that they cannot relate to one another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-18\">\u201c To apply this rule to the residuary devise in this will, it will be perceived that the nearest antecedent to which the word <em>then </em>can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>refer is the devising words, \u2018 I give, devise and bequeath,\u2019 which are immediately followed by the words, \u2018to all my children who shall then be living.\u2019 When living ? If there are no other words to control the intention clearly, then the will and devise are to take effect as a testamentary disposition, to wit, at the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">\u201cBut supposing these words do not relate to the death of the testator, the next preceding period of time referred to is the minority of the children. Do the words \u2018who shall then he living \u2019 relate to this period or the termination of it ? The testator had made provision in part at least for his children during their minority, by directing that the annuity of $4500 to his wife, should be for the support of herself and the board of the children during their minority. Were the children at the termination of their minority to he cut off from all support until the death of their mother ? It will be observed that no provision was made for the clothing or education of the children during their minority by the bequest of the annuity to his wife. It was limited to the support of herself and the <em>hoard </em>of the children during their minority. It will be remembered also that two of these children were daughters, and little capable, probably, of providing a maintenance for themselves. Would it then in view of these facts be a safe construction of this devise to say that the testator intended that his children should have no clothing or education during their minority, and that they should not come into possession of the very large residuary estate which he left them until after the death of their mother, and only then contingent on their surviving her ? If he meant this, he is supposed to have foreseen the possibility of his wife surviving him nearly half a century; during which time his children would he wholly unprovided for, except for their hoard during their minority. To give this construction to the will, the words of it should he so direct and decisive, or so clearly referable to no other construction of it, as to enable the court to say with reasonable certainty that this was the intention of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">\u201c If the death of the mother was the period of time to which the word <em>then </em>refers in the structure of the language of the will, it is the remotest antecedent of the three which have been referred to; and to reach it the construer must pass over the two others, which are more nearly proximate to it. In a doubtful case, surely, this is not a reasonable mode of construing the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">\u201cBut if all three of these constructions be equally doubtful, what then is the rule of law for construing a devise and bequest of this character ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">\u201c The law always inclines to treat the whole interest in property as vested and not as contingent, and therefore in cases of doubt, it declares the interest vested: Letchworth\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 175.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-10\">\u201cIn cases of doubtful construction of wills, the law leans in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>favor of an absolute rather than a defeasible estate; of a vested rather than a contingent one; of the primary rather than the secondary intent; of the first rather than the second taker, as the principal object of the testator\u2019s bounty; and of a distribution as nearly conformed to the general rules of inheritance as possible : Amelia Smith\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">\u201c Where the meaning of a devise is uncertain, the law adopts the principles of the intestate law; for whoever claims against the laws of descent must show a satisfactory written title. The rule of equality of descent to relatives of the same degree, is so just, that the law adopts it when the law is to govern, and prefers it when the law is called on to interpret: Lippman\u2019s Appeal, 6 Casey 180.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">\u201c For reasons above given, we think that the remainder of the estate of the testator vested in all his children living at his death, and that the heirs and legal representatives. of such of them as are dead are entitled to such share as the deceased children would have taken if living.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-8\">The court accordingly decreed * * * \u201cthat the remainder of the estate of the said testator is vested in all the children of the testator who were living at his death, and the heirs and legal representatives of such of them as were dead; the latter to take such share as their respective parents would have taken if living,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-10\">Emlen Cresson and William P.

A few of the reasons leading to this conclusion are these. The word \u201c <em>then </em>\u201d in the clause refers to no distinct time by grammatical construction or manifest intention. Its reference is to be discovered rather by the subject of the item, and the intention drawn from the whole will. Had the subject of the fifth item been wholly the same property devised and bequeathed to the widow for life, the subject itself would have indicated her death as the period of vesting in the children. But it is obvious that the property disposed of in the fifth item embraced the entire remainder of the testator\u2019s estate. When he determined to settle his worldly affairs, he purposed to dispose of all his estate. He began by providing for his_ wife, and when he had finished that provision his mind evidently turned in the fifth item to making a provision for his children. They were very young; he himself was a young man, in good health, and with a prospect of much longer life than that which awaited him. It was natural he should think it would be years before his own death, while some of his children might die before him. His mind taking in the scope of these circumstances would naturally run forward to the distant period which rose to his view, and he would seek to settle his estate according to the circumstances as they thus appeared to him, by willing all the \"remainder of his estate, not given to his wife, to those of his children who should be living at his death ; and therefore he devised and bequeathed this remainder to all of his children who should be then living. The sentence is evidently elliptical, not coming up to the fulness of his thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">This intent is strengthened by the clear intent found in the sixth item, that his children should have an estate immediately at his death, for he appoints a guardian of their <em>estate, </em>while he appoints his wife guardian of their persons in accord with the evident intent drawn from the fourth clause, that she and they should remain together a.s a family, and their boarding be provided for out of the annuity. The intent in the fifth item interpreted along with the sixth item, to provide an immediate estate for his children at his death, is inconsistent with an intent to suffer their estate to become ambulatory until the widow\u2019s death, if that be the period referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>to by the word \u201cthen.\u201d The expression \u201cthen\u201d being obscure in reference, all the other considerations arise which give a preference to a vested estate instead of one that is contingent, and to furnish a substantial provision for the education and clothing of his children in addition to their boarding: otherwise his provision for them would be illusory, and a large amount of his estate left without any useful or proper disposition of it during the lifetime of his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Upon the whole we think the Orphans\u2019 Court came to a correct conclusion, and the decree is therefore affirmed with costs, and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
