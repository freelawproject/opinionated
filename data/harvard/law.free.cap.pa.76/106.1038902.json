In the issue, John E. Tawney, the executor of the will, was plaintiff and Henry Long and Hannah Long, his wife, and daughter of the decedent, were defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">The questions in the issue were: whether the decedent was of sound mind, &amp;c., when he executed the paper; whether its execution was pi\u2019ocured by duress; whether it was procured by fraud and imposition on the decedent; whether it was procured by undue influence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\">The writing was dated October 28th 1871, at which time the decedent\u2019s wife was living, and also an only child Hannah, the wife of Henry Long (the defendants in this ease); decedent\u2019s wife died in the early part of 1872 at the age of eighty-five years, and he died in August 1872 at the age of eighty-seven years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\">By his will he bequeathed to Jacob Bowman, a nephew, $200, and the remainder of his estate, after payment of debts, he gave to John E. Tawney, whom he made executor of his will. \u2022 Tawney was a nephew of decedent\u2019s wife, but otherwise in no way connected with him. His estate was wrorth from $1500 to $2000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-9\">The case was tried February 9th 1873, before Fisher, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-10\">Plaintiff gave evidence by the subscribing witnesses of the execution of will; these witnesses testified also that he was then of sound mind, memory and understanding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-11\">The defendants gave evidence that about 1871, he and his wife had been living with the defendants and that the husband and he had difficulties about the payment for his boarding ; that he left Long\u2019s house, boarded in several other places and finally became an inmate of the plaintiff; that his wife commenced a proceeding against him for her maintenance, in which the plaintiff became surety for his appearance at the Court of Quarter Sessions; on the 25th of October 1871, he was sentenced by the court to pay a monthly sum for the support of his wife, and on the 28th, the day the will was executed, Tawney entered into recognisance with him for the performance of the order of the court. About the same time suit was brought against him by Long for payment for hoarding him, in which he confessed judgment November 4th 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-12\">The defendants gave evidence that the decedent constantly asserted that his wife maintained improper relations with Long, his son-in-law; that Mrs. Long was not his child; that she and his wife were prostitutes and treated him with great unldndness; and gave evidence generally for the purpose of showing that he was monomaniac as regarded them ; they gave evidence also for the purpose of showing that his mind and memory had become impaired and that he was incompetent to make a will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-13\">For the purpose of establishing undue influence by Tawney the plaintiff, they gave evidence, that the decedent lived with the plaintiff ; that plaintiff was with him in all the litigation, attended to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>business for him, accompanied him to the office of his counsel, &amp;c.; that in a conversation about the management of his farm which was occupied then by Long, he said that Tawney was his agent, he had nothing to do with it, and that Tawney told him Long was too dumb to manage his own affairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">Long, the defendant, testified, under objection and exception:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF\">\u201c About a year before he left me he came from Tawney\u2019s, and he said it is nothing but ding dong all the time, by Tawney and his family, for me to make a will and leave all I have to them. He said Mr. Tawney went further than he had any business to do, and I told him so to his face; them papers are destroyed now; and I made the old man no answer to this. He added, he could not catch me, as long as I have my senses; I will never make a will; he cannot catch me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">Mrs. Long testified, under objection and exception: \u201cIn the year 1871, between spring and harvest, I can\u2019t state particularly, but before the lawsuit, the old man said John E. Tawney was dingdongitig at him to make a will, and he said he was not going to make one as long as he had his senses. He said Tawney said he should will it to him, and that he had a family and we have none. At another time, but the same time he was there, he said Mrs. Tawney would take him around the neck, kiss him and say: Dear uncle, will me all you have; Hannah does not need it and did not work for it; Aunty worked for it. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">\u201c About a month or so before the lawsuit he said Tawney had gone further than he had any business to do, and he told him so to his face, and Tawney owned to it, and that he had all now in his own hands and was going to keep it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-9\">Michael Deener testified: \u201c Sometime .since Bowman died Tawney told me, in the shop, the old man wanted to make a will and he would like to give Jake some and hardly knew how to fix it. Then Tawney said he told him, pay your debts and afterwards you can do what you please.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-11\">The plaintiff gave evidence in rebuttal. He testified amongst other things, speaking of the proceedings against decedent for the maintenance of his wife, * * * \u201c We came back on the 20th. Mr. Wills prepared the papers; we came out to the office. Mr. Bowman paid from 1st of April to 1st of November the allowance, and the costs were not paid. After that Bowman called me back into the office and told me he had made up'his mind to make a will. He always thought he might give Jake something. He told me the way he was fixed he did not know what to do about it. He asked me wffiat he ought to do about it. I told him if he wanted to give Jake something he could make it so that his debts and funeral expenses should be paid first, and then he could give Jake whatever he had a mind to ; if nothing was left, there would be no harm done. He then went over into the prothonotary\u2019s office. He told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>me if I had any business to attend to I should do it and meet him at Mr. Ramer\u2019s hotel. I left then and met him at Ramer\u2019s hotel about two hours after. Then we started home. I did not, at that time or at any other time, ask him to make a will in my favor. I never asked him to make a will at all. On the way home he handed me the will to take care of. He told me I should keep it, and he wanted me to take care of him, and he supposed if there was anything left I would get it. It was in an envelope, not sealed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">On cross-examination plaintiff testified: <em>\u201c </em>John Snyder and I had a conversation outside of the court-house about the trouble the old man had about his suit, and he seemed to be very much confused, and then I said in answer to Snyder, who said he was not fit to make a will, that he was not. Mr. Snyder broached the subject to me. Mr. Snyder and I met on the court-house steps, and he said to me that this thing, meaning the suit, seemed to trouble the old man uncommon. I replied that it did, and that his mind was much confused or out of fix. Mr. Snyder then said if the old man would want to make a will he did not believe it would stand. I told him I thought not. We spoke in reference to his condition that day. I did not say to Michael Deener, I told the old man to give Jake $200. The day before we came to town, I had a conversation with the old man about making the will. He told me in front of his room he had been thinking about making a will and fixing his things; he did not know whether he could make a will or not; that if he got like old Mr. Slagle his property might not reach to keep him. I told him if I was in his place I would take the good of what I had while I lived, and if there was anything left it was his own and he could do with it as he pleased.\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">The foregoing is all the evidence which bears upon the question of undue influence by the plaintiff upon the decedent in connection with his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s sixth point and its answer were :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">Point: \u201c The defendants have given no sufficient evidence to sustain their allegation that the will was obtained by duress, fraud, imposition or undue influence, and therefore the jury cannot find in favor of the defendants on these issues.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">Answer: \u201c There has no evidence been given in this case to prove that the alleged will of the testator was made under duress or by fraud or imposition, but whether it was obtained by undue influence is a matter submitted by the court to the jury under the evidence given in this case, and the instructions of the court as to what in law will constitute undue influence sufficient to destroy the validity of a testamentary instrument.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\">The defendants\u2019 fourth and sixth points and their answers were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>4th: <em>\u201c </em>In ordinary cases the undue influence necessary to invalidate a will is a constraint operating upon the testator at the time of the testamentary act which destroys free agency; hut less influence is required to control the mind of a testator and avoid a will, when the testator is enfeebled in mind, and very aged and infirm, than is required to control the will of one of mental vigor. And if the jury believe the testator was very aged and infirm, and enfeebled in mind, and that John E. Tawney, no relation by blood to testator, importuned him to make a will and leave all his property to him, and was his confidential agent and conducted his business for him, and encouraged him in his conduct towards his wife, and controlled the old man, his papers and effects, shortly before the alleged will was made, and brought him to the attorney where the will was written, and the principal part of the estate is devised to him, this raises a presumption of undue influence, and direct proof of it at the time of the execution of the will is not required to render the will invalid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">Answer: \u201c If the facts are as stated in the point, they are circumstances that are to be taken into consideration by the jury in considering the question of undue influence, but alone do not raise a conclusive presumption of undue influence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">6th: \u201c Where the party to be benefited by the will has a controlling agency in procuring its formal execution, it is universally regarded as a very suspicious circumstance and one requiring the fullest explanation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">Answer: \u201c This is not correct, but is to be considered as a circumstance amongst others tending to prove undue influence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-9\">The court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">\u201c This case is an issue directed by the Register\u2019s Court to the Court of Common Pleas of Adams county to try whether or not. certain instruments in writing, alleged to be the last will and testament of John Bowman, deceased, late of this county, is his will or not. It is contended that Mr. Bowman, from age and infirmity and weakness of mind, had not the capacity to make a will at the time he signed the instrument in question; that the instrument asked to be established was obtained by duress, fraud, imposition and undue influence, and that the testator was under an insane delusion as regards the relations existing between his wife and son-in-law, Henry Long, one of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-11\">\u201c Before we say anything about the facts of this case we will state to you our views of the law relating to testamentary capacity and what is required to constitute an ability to make a valid last will and testament. A disposing mind and memory is one in which the testator is proved to have had, at the time of executing the will, a full and intelligent knowledge and understanding of the act he is engaged in, a full knowledge of the property he possessed, and an intelligent perception and understanding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>disposition he desires to make of it, and the persons he wishes to he beneficiaries of his will and the recipients of his bounty. His mind and memory may be impaired by age or disease, but if enough intellect remains to fill the requirements above stated; advanced age, and infirmity of body, or impairment of the original mental force, will not incapacitate a man from making a valid disposition of his property by a testamentary instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\"><em>\u201c </em>By law every person has the right to dispose of his or her property as he or she thinks best, if they are of proper age and disposing mind and memory, and it is not so much the disposition that is made,as the fact that it was freely and voluntarily done, which constitutes the inquiry, in cases in which it is contended the will was procured by undue influence. There can be no invalidation of a will for undue influence, if the party is a free agent; if he has a will to act, and an ability to act in the matter as he desires and pleases, and does so act. The undue influence which will invalidate a will, is such as destroys the testator\u2019s free agency, and prevents him from making any other disposition of his property, than that which the person who exercises the control over him chooses to dictate. The influence must be operative at the time the will is made and must be the effect of, and be produced by, undue influence. Solicitations to make a will, persuasions to make a will in a particular way, will not constitute undue influence, so long as the party making it remains a free agent and acts as he desires to act in the matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">\u201c A man may be of sound mind in regard to his dealings in general, but may be under an insane delusion, and whenever it appears that the will was the direct offspring of the partial insanity or monomania under which the testator was laboring at the very time the will was made, that it was the moving cause of the disposition, and that if it had not existed the will would have been different, it ought to be considered as no will, although the general capacity of the testator may be unimpeached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">\u201c The wife and children of a man are the natural objects of his affections, and where they are disinherited by a husband and a father, when he comes to dispose of his estate, the reasons for doing so are a proper subject to enter into the consideration of a jury, in considering a case like the present, and any person will naturally inquire, why was this thing done ? Was the testator under an insane delusion, or has some powerful cause induced him thus to act ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">\u201c If a monomaniacal delusion is unalterably entertained by a testator against a wife or -a daughter, who otherwise would have been his legatee or devisee and who would seem to be the natural objects of a man\u2019s regard when he came to make a final disposition of his estate; and such delusion is shown to have been the operating motive which excluded' them; and if the supposed act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>misconduct on the part of the wife or child, or both, had no existence in fact, and was a creature of the diseased imagination of the testator, and the will was engendered by this delusion and was its offspring, and made under its influence operating at the time and in the testamentary act; if, in short, the will was dictated by the delusion, it cannot be sustained as a last will and testament, because it is the production of a mind incapable of correct reasoning as to the object of his bounty and the character of his wife and children, and their relations towards himself. * * * \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The court then referred to the evidence and continued:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">[\u201cAs regards the undue influence said to be exercised by Mr. John E.

If the testator, at the time he made the will in question, without any foundation to rest it upon, labored under the idea that such a state of facts existed, it was a most monstrous assumption and could only be the creation of an unsound mind, and any testamentary disposition made under the influence of such a delusion is not worth the paper it is written upon, and ought not to be established as a last will and testament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-12\">\u201c The jury will then inquire, was the paper in question the offspring of such an insane delusion?

At all events there was evidence thereof sufficient to submit to a jury. On this branch of the case the ruling of the court was strictly correct. Not so, however, on that which relates to the question of undue influence, as an operative cause affecting the old man in the disposition of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The evidence offered for this purpose was wholly insuflicient, and should have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In treating of this branch of the case, we must treat of it as a distinct issue, for if it be found that the testator was of unsound mind, then the question is determined against the will, and we proceed no further ; but if on the other hand this question be determined in favor of the testator\u2019s testamentary capacity, then, and then only,do we consider the proposition involving the subject of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"AT4\">However, then, the fact may be, and that fact is hereafter to be determined by a jury, we must, for the present purpose, treat the case as though the testator\u2019s sanity were proved. What then is there in the evidence to show that John E. Tawney improperly influenced John Bowman in the disposition of his property ? That he treated the old man, who by marriage was his uncle, with kindness ; that he permitted him to remain at his house; that he bailed him and assisted him when sued by his wife and son-in-law, indicates but ordinary acts of friendship, towards a frail old man, rendered necessary from the very circumstances thrown around him by the defendants themselves, but in nothing does it exhibit that corrupt and unlawful influence which amounts to constraint, and which substitutes the will of another for that of the testator. So we have no evidence, except that of Tawney himself, that Bowman ever spoke to him, or he to Bowman, about a will. We give <em>in extenso </em>what he says upon that subject. \u201cThe day before we come to town, I had a conversation with the old man about making the will. He told me in front of his room he had been thinking about making his will and fixing his things. He did not know whether he could make a will or not, that if he got like old Mr. Slagle, his property might not reach to keep him. I told him if I was in his place, I would take the good of what I had while I lived, .and if there was anything left it was his own, and he could do with it as he pleased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Again: \u201c After that Bowman called me into the office and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>me he had made up his mind to make a will. He always thought he might give Jake something. He told me the way he was fixed he did not know what to do about it. He asked me what he ought to do about it. I told him if he wanted to give Jake something, he could make it so .that his debts and funeral expenses should be paid first, and then he could give Jake whatever he had a mind to; if nothing was left, there would be no harm done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">This testimony does not even raise the idea of solicitation, much less that of improper or fraudulent conduct upon the part of Tawney. It contains but the advice one prudent and cautious neighbor might give to another under like circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Then we have the declarations of the testator himself, as found in the testimony of Henry Long and his wife; <em>\u201c </em>that John E. Tawney was dingdonging at him to make his will, and leave all he had'to him and his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">But these declarations prove nothing but such solicitations as do not affect the validity of a will. Even importunate persuasion from which a delicate mind would shrink, will not invalidate a devise: Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 S. &amp; R. 267. But beyond this these declarations are too remote from the time of execution, and are not so connected with other facts and circumstances indicating circumvention or fraud in the procurement of the will as to make them part of the <em>res gestee, </em>and are therefore not evidence: 2 Greenl. Ev., part 4, sec. 690 ; McTaggart <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 Harris 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">We cannot think, therefore, that all this evidence taken together was sufficient to raise such a question of undue influence as should have been submitted to the jury. Undue influence, of that kind which will affect the provisions of a testament, must be such as subjugates the mind of the testator to the will of the person operating upon it, and in order to establish this, proof must be made of some fraud practised, some threats or misrepresentations made, some undue flattery, or some physical or moral coercion employed, so as to destroy the free agency of the testator, and these influences must be proved to have operated as a present constraint, at the very time of making the will. But constraint is not to be inferred from mental weakness alone, though the weak mind may be more readily constrained and deceived than the strong one; and though it is to be considered as a fact in determining the question of constraint, nevertheless, as is said in McMahon <em>v. </em>Ryan, 8 Harris 329, that undue influence, which suffices to destroy an alleged will, is distinct from weakness and has no necessary connection with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">So it has been held that general bad treatment furnishes no evidence of such influence, and we may add, neither does general kindness, though this may have a powerful influence upon a weak mind, unless it is shown to be part of a crafty arrangement to procure the testamentary disposition: Thompson <em>v. </em>Kyner, 15 P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>F. </em>Smith 368; Rudy <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 19 P. F. Smith 177; Eckert <em>v. </em>Flowry, 7 Wright 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Erom the above statement, it is obvious that the case in hand is utterly barren of evidence tending to show undue influence as the cause which operated on the mind of John Bowman to produce the disposition of his property complained of' by the defendants. It follows that the court erred in not answering the plaintiff\u2019s sixth point in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
