When it reached the hands of the trustees appointed to take Matthew\u2019s share, it came to them as an entirety, and not as part Blanche\u2019s and part Matthew\u2019s. Consequently, the trust attached to the whole devise and bequest. Eor the same reason the codicil to the testator\u2019s will operated on the whole of Matthew\u2019s estate as an entirety. The words are large enough to receive the whole, and the death of Blanche before the codicil took effect, just as in the original will, struck out of it all that related to Blanche. The whole estate vesting in Matthew, is therefore governed by the codicil in connection with the will, and vests in the trust until the time fixed by the testator for payment to Matthew. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
