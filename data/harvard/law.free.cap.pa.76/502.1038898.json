Modes and others. Doninick Betchetter issued execution No. 37 to the same term against William F. Modes; John Miller issued an execution No. 38 to the same term against William F. Modes. These executions were all put into the hands of the sheriff at the same hour and a levy made on the real and personal property of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-9\">John B.

The next execution in the order of time is that of J. B. Canfield, which, it appears, was received by the sheriff on the 8th day of January 1873, at 12 M.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-14\">\u201c The proceeds of sale are claimed by Henrici &amp; Lenz, Dominick Betchetter and John Miller, by reason of their several executions having been first issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff. An effort was made to show that Henrici &amp; Lenz, through their agent and attorney, Mr. Hice, had made an agreement or arrangement with W. F. Modes the defendant, not to enforce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>collection of their judgments against him ; and that in pursuance of that agreement, John B. Canfield had endorsed notes and made advancements to Modes, and that the executions of Henrici &amp; Lenz were issued in violation of that agreement, and were postponed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">\u201c It appears, by an article of agreement between John B. Can-field and <em>W. </em>E. Modes, offered in evidence, that Canfield was to furnish soda-ash and other material, advance money, accept drafts, and otherwise assist him in carrying on his business in the glass works, and in consideration therefor, the said Modes was to give Canfield \u2018 a lien, by way of security therefor, upon all the products of the glass works, at the rate of one dollar in value of said goods, for every seventy-five cents of material furnished, money advanced, and liability incurred by Canfield.\u2019 * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">The auditor stated the evidence of the agreement between Henrici &amp; Lenz and their attorney and proceeded :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">\u201c In view of these facts, the auditor is of the opinion that the alleged agreement between Mr. Hice and W. E. Modes is not sustained, and therefore the auditor is relieved from any inquiry as to its effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-9\">\u201c The property of W. F. Modes, consisting of manufactured glassware, material, &amp;c., sold by the sheriff on the above-recited writs of fi. fa., for the sum of $14,866.66, which is the fund for distribution in this proceeding, and is, in the opinion of the auditor, liable for the claims for wages of clerks, mechanics and laborers in the employ of said Modes, for labor and services which accrued within a period of six months prior to the date of the levy and sale by the sheriff, not exceeding two hundred dollars each. It appears from the testimony, that the employees of W. F. Modes were generally paid to November 1st 1872, and that more than two hundred dollars of those not so paid accrued within six months prior to the date of the levy. * * * The auditor holds that the fund is applicable, first, to costs and expenses of audit; second, to claims of the laborers, mechanics and clerks, and third, the balance is applied to fi. fas. Nos. 35, 36, 37 and 38, of March Term 1873, <em>pro rat\u00e1; </em>said writs having all been placed in'the hands of the sheriff at the same time, and the fund not being' sufficient .to pay them in full.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-10\">The auditor, in accordance with the principles of his report, after deducting expenses, &amp;c., awarded to the laborers, the amount of their claims, viz., $9926.30, and the remainder <em>pro raid </em>to executions No. 35, 36, 37 and 38.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-11\">Exceptions were filed to the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-12\">The court overruled the exceptions, confirmed the report and decreed distribution accordingly. Canfield appealed from the decree of the court. He assigned for error, decreeing to the laborers, &amp;c., the amount of their claims, awarding to Henrici <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>&amp; Lentz any part of the fund; and not awarding the fund to Canfield. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">The claim of laborers for preference in the distribution was under the Act of April 9th 1872, sect. 1, Pamph. L. 47, 2 Br. Purd. 1464, pi. 1. It provides that the wages of any laborer, &amp;c., for any period not exceeding six months immediately preceding the sale, &amp;c., of works, mines, manufactories or business, &amp;c., shall be a lien upon such manufactory, &amp;c., and shall be preferred and first paid, not exceeding $200 out of the proceeds of the sale of such manufactory, &amp;e., \u201c provided that this act shall not be so construed as to impair contracts existing or liens of record vested prior to its passage.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-7\"><em>D.

This contract was perfectly good between the parties, though invalid as to execution-creditors, who might levy on the goods before they passed into Canfield\u2019s possession. But mechanics and laborers do not, under the Act of 1872, occupy the position of execution-creditors. Their lien is dependent upon the act, and subject to its provisos. It, however, provides that such liens shall not impair contracts existing before its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">The money in court for distribution was raised from the wares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>which were to furnish Canfield\u2019s security, and the amount so raised is insufficient, were it paid over to him, to meet the amount he advanced to manufacture those wares. Now treating the intervening executions as out of the case, it is clear that if we prefer the liens of these laborers, we impair Canfield\u2019s contract just to the extent of the money it will take to satisfy them. The apparent difficulty is, that parties, not preferred by the Act of 1872, are thus let in upon the fund which they otherwise might.not reach. This, however, is Canfield\u2019s misfortune. Were it not for these he would take the whole fund. We cannot see, therefore, that the laborers are at all prejudiced by this condition of affairs. We perceive no other error in the proceedings of the court below, and upon a redistribution of the fund, the only material alteration of the auditor\u2019s report will be the omission therefrom of the $9926.80 awarded to the liens of clerks, mechanics and laborers.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The decree of the court is reversed, and it is ordered that the record be remitted, and redistribution be made of the fund in said court, also that the appellee pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
