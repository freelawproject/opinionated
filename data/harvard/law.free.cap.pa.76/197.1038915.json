If this was shown it would fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>rule <em>Falsa demonstrate non nocet. </em>But it is very plain that this was a question for the jury. However clearly the parol evidence might establish the fact that the McKinstry farm occupied and farmed by William Brown at the date of the will contained nine fields \u2014 and not eight, as described \u2014 the credibility of that evidence, and the application of it to the case, must be determined by the jury, under instructions as to its legal effect by the court. We think, therefore, that the learned judge below fell into an error in directing a verdict for the plaintiff, which established that the McKinstry farm did consist of nine fields, and not eight, as described in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The case came on for trial again on the 24th of January 1874, before Rowe, P. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The evidence was substantially the same as on the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s third point, which was affirmed, was :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The words \u201c <em>containing eight fields,\u201d </em>will not control the more specific designation which Adam Hoke used to describe the land devised to the plaintiff, embodied in the <em>languageii that part of the McKinstry farm at present occupied and farmed by William Brown,\u201d </em>and these latter words, if they correctly described the land in dispute, at the date of the will, must prevail to give the plaintiff the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The defendants\u2019 2d and 3d points, which were refused, were:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">In the devise under which the plaintiff claims, the testator, has given a clear and unmistakable description of the land which he intended to give to the plaintiff by his will, namely, eight fields of the McKinstry farm then in the tenancy of William Brown, and as the plaintiff has failed to show that the testator was acting under a mistake, when he made that description, the plaintiff is limited to the eight fields and cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">When the jury come to apply the devise to the land, doubtful and ambiguous expressions must give way before those which are clear and unambiguous, and if the jury from the evidence find that the eight fields in the description are found in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, witho'ut the one in dispute, then this fills the description and gives the plaintiff all he has any right to claim, and he cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">The court charged:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\"><em>\u201c </em>The language of the will is : \u2018 I give and bequeath to Charles Adam Eberly (the plaintiff) that part of the \u2018 McKinstry farm \u2019 at present occupied and farmed by William Brown, containing eight fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-16\">[\u201c Now the construction of this devise is for the court, and we say that under this devise the plaintiff took all that part of the McKinstry farm at the date of the will occupied and farmed by William Brown, whether eight fields or more. The words, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>taining eight fields, do not limit the previous clause, but are a descriptive addition, as if the testator had said containing 200 acres.]</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201c All we have to do is apply the description in the will to the subject of the devise, and give to the plaintiff this field if it was a portion of that part of the McKinstry farm occupied and farmed by William Brown on the 21st of May 1867, and to refuse it to him if it was not. That the testator describes the tract devised to the plaintiff as containing eight fields is a fact in the case bearing on the question of whether this ninth field was in the occupancy of Brown at the date of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u201c First, then, was this field in dispute, part of the \u2018 McKinstry farm ?\u2019 For the testator gives the plaintiff only \u2018 part of the Mc-Kinstry farm,\u2019 and under these words he cannot take lands which were not part of the McKinstry farm.\u2019 How did the testator use the words 4 the McKinstry farm ?\u2019 The plaintiff contends that he used them to describe the whole body of land conveyed by Mc-Kinstry to Hoke; and I think this is the most easily accepted interpretation. In another clause of the will he speaks of the \u2018 Stewart farm\u2019 as including a portion of the McKinstry farm. Now it is not disputed among counsel that this 18-acre field, indeed, the whole of the \u2018Old Wilkey field,\u2019 was conveyed by McKinstry to Hoke. This field in dispute then was a part of the McKinstry farm, if these words \u2014 the McKinstry farm \u2014 were used by the testator to mean the tract bought by him of McKinstry. But the defendants contend and have tried to show that this field is part of a larger field called by the testator the \u2018 Old Wilkey field,\u2019 which though bought with the other lands from McKinstry, was not regarded by the testator as any part of the McKinstry farm, as he was accustomed to use fhe words\u2018the McKinstry farm.\u2019 This position of the defendants has not been established very satisfactorily to me, but may have been established to your satisfaction, and if you find it to be sustained by the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u201cI incline to think that the testator used the words \u2018McKinstry farm \u2019 to mean all the lands he had bought of McKinstry; and if so, then this field was part of the McKinstry farm, and the plaintiff will have taken one step toward a recovery. But only one; for he must go on and show that not only was the field a part of the McKinstry farm, but that it was, at the date of the will, occupied and farmed by William Brown. \u2018 Occupied \u2019 is defined by Webster as \u2018 held in possession.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u201c The plaintiff has called William Brown and others. The substance of their testimony is* * * After stating it the court proceeded:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\u201c The defendants, on the other hand, have endeavored principally to. show that Hoke was familiar with his farms; that this field was not previously used in connection with the Eberly farm, which con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tained' the eight fields not in dispute; that it was not contained in the tract leased to Brown by the written agreement; that Hoke had given him another field for oats in the spring previous, but only temporarily; that Hoke and Anderson pastured this field in the fall of 1867, and that Anderson repaired <em>the </em>fences that year ; that this field was always used in connection with the <em>\u2018 </em>Home,\u2019 or \u2018 Stewart \u2019 farms; that in 1866, when Hoke allowed Brown to take it for corn, it was under lease to Miller, and at the date of the will, was under lease with the <em>\u2018 </em>Home \u2019 farm, to Anderson. And so I understand the testimony of Miller and Anderson to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\"><em>\u201c </em>If the evidence of these two witnesses is to the effect that defendants contend for, they may argue that at the date of the will this field was under lease to Anderson, and that he had therefore the possession and occupancy of it, though it was planted in corn at the time, by Brown; that though Brown was permitted to put a crop of corn in the field \u2014 for he says that it was given to him for that purpose only, and that though he pastured it, he did not think he had any right to do so \u2014 yet that Miller under his lease was in possession in 1866, and Anderson under his lease in 1867. This is a very strong point made by defendants. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u201c The case turns very much upon the word \u2018 occupy.\u2019 That this field was, at the date of the will, <em>farmed </em>by William Brown, is not a matter of contention among the counsel, but was it then in a proper sense, occupied \u2014 held in possession \u2014 by him ? To farm land is not necessarily to occupy it. If, for instance, the testator or his tenant had had a crop growing in this field, ready to harvest, and Brown had been permitted to cut it only, and had been so engaged at the date of the will, it could be said he was, at the date of the will, farming the land, but it could not be said that he occupied it. So in the same way, the question arises whether one who merely puts a field in corn for one crop, though he farms the land, can be said to occupy it. If the testator, in your opinion, attached this field to the other lands leased to Brown, so as to make it a part of the farm occupied by him, and i.t was so attached to and made a part of that farm at the date of the will, then it was occupied by Brown. But if Mr. Hoke, without attaching it to Brown\u2019s land, only permitted him to use it for a special and temporary purpose, then, though <em>farmed, </em>it cannot be said to hare been <em>occupied </em>by Brown.\u201d * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The defendants sued out a writ of error and assigned for error: the answers to the points and the part of the charge in brackets.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-10\">The case was heard in the Supreme Court, on this writ of error, May 12th 1875, before Agnew, 0.

B. 341. If all the references to the devise are true, the court can not reject any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>J. Me.7). Sharpe </em>(with whom was <em>F. S.

A devise of that part of the McKinstry farm containing eight fields, would not define the devise at all unless the McKinstry farm had but eight fields upon it in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u25a0 It is clear therefore when there were more than eight fields in this farm, the devise could be determined only by ascertaining what part of the farm was occupied and farmed by Brown. If he occupied and farmed more than eight fields and we confine the devise to eight, what fields shall they be? Neither court nor jury could determine this, for it would be to make a will not to interpret it. It is manifest that the two descriptions cannot stand together, and we must take that which will give the will effect, which is by giving the devisee the part of the farm occupied and farmed by Brown. This was necessarily a fact for the jury, and was fairly submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
