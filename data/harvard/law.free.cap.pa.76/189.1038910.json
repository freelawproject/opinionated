To the October sessions the viewers reported that they had laid out a road substantially as prayed for; the report was confirmed nisi. At the January sessions 1870 an order for review was issued; reviewers reported the same road, which was confirmed nisi June 21st 1870. Exceptions were filed to the report by Joseph Isenberg.

The viewers must not be controlled in any way by the order in respect to the intermediate points of the road: McConnell\u2019s Mill Road, 8 Casey 285; Road in Lower Merion, 8 P. F. Smith 66. If the viewers fail to describe the termini of the road it is fatal: Id.; Bean\u2019s Road, 11 Casey 280; Road in Lower Salford, lid. 524...</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-14\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"AIb\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 12th 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">In this case a view was ordered at the July sessions 1869 to view and lay out a road from a point on the Etna Iron Works and Cove Forge road, near the barn of Joseph Isenberg, through lands of Joseph Isenberg, John Clark and John K. Sissler, to a point on the road leading from Etna Iron Works to John K. Sissler\u2019s, near the barn of John Clark. On this order there was a report to October 13th 1869, which was confirmed nisi October 25th 1869. An order of review was issued March 28th 1870. The report of reviewers was confirmatory of the original view. At the instance of John Clark and Joseph Isenberg, the court altered one of the termini of the road and confirmed the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Two errors are apparent in these proceedings: First, intermediate points are indicated in the petition and orders. This is fatal: McConnell\u2019s Road, 8 Casey 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Second, the court altered one of the termini, which it had no power to do: Beigh\u2019s Road, 11 Harris 302. The proceedings of the Quarter Sessions are therefore reversed and set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
