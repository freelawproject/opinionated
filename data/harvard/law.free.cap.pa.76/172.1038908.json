in 1860 we cut and hauled the last of the crops away; I left the field fenced; the balance of the tract had been cut and coaled before I knew; I made rails on the Burke Improvement for David McCormick some four or six years before 1858 ; they were hauled to Sarah Furnace ; the land was known as Shoenberger land, attached to Sarah Furnace; I live within the lines of the Evans; this land was cut and coaled in 1839; all cut off when I came there;

If tbe jury believe from tbe evidence of David Dickey and Matthew Morehead that Peter Sboenberger bad no title to tbe land in dispute, but only claimed tbe same and took possession thereof, to secure tbe timber growing thereon and then abandoning tbe land, then plaintiff bad no title and tbe verdict must be for tbe defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-15\">Tbe court charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-16\">[\u201c I think that tbe decision of two questions by tbe jury will make an end of this controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-17\">\u201c The first question is: Were tbe McCormicks whose title tbe plaintiff has, in tbe actual possession of tbe tract of land in dispute at tbe time of tbe entry of Sboup upon this tract for tbe purpose of appropriating it to himself, whose right tbe defendant Burke acquired ? Now tbe principal facts, material to tbe solution of this question, as I understand the evidence, are as follows: \u2014 Tbe tract in dispute is part of tbe James Johnston survey, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>itself a part of a stretch of mountain side called the Pine Ridge. On the Johnston tract, as far back as 1819, a small field of three or four acres was cultivated, which is within the limits of the tract in dispute. From about 1830 to 1858, this field was not cultivated, nor was it enclosed before 1858. It lay an open commons. In 1832 and 1883, Dr. Peter Schoenberger, whose title plaintiff has, cut off all the timber growing on the Johnston tract and the Pine Ridge, for Sarah Furnace. There was no building on the land in dispute or on the Johnston\u2019s, outside the lines of the Evans tract, at any time. In 1858, one Samuel Bice got permission from the owner of Sarah Furnace to clear off the small field and to fence it up. In 1858 and 1859, it was farmed by Bice, then in possession under the McCormicks, and in 1860 he cut and hauled away the crop. \u2018 I left the field fenced,\u2019 says Bice. Then, in 1861^ Shoup entered upon the land in dispute, which includes the field, and put up a cabin. The war called him away for a year or two. When he returned, he made some arrangements with Burke, the defendant, who entered upon the tract and held it as his own. The evidence seems to me to show also, and it can hardly be doubted, that the owners of Sarah Furnace, the predecessors in title of plaintiff, were claiming and treating the Johnston tract as part of the Sarah Furnace lands, from the time of the erection of the furnace until the entry of Shoup.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">\u201c If these facts are established by the evidence, and it seems to me they are, we have at the time of the entry of Shoup this state of things, namely: The cultivation of an enclosed field on the Johnston, by persons in under lease or license from the McCormicks,'who were claiming the whole of the Johnston tract, which included the land in dispute. This would amount to actual posses sion by the McCormicks of the land in dispute. It will not do to say they were not in the actual possession of the enclosed field in 1861, merely because they did not farm the field in 1860 or 1861, but had only cut and carried away the crop in 1860. An owner of an enclosed field must surely be permitted to allow it to lie idle a year or two years, without rendering it liable to be appropriated by any one coming along.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">\u201c If you should be of opinion that the McCormicks whose title the plaintiff has, were in the actual possession of the land in dispute when Shoup entered, such possession merely, without showing legal title, is sufficient to enable plaintiff to recover against the defendant, a mere intruder showing no title. But if you should hold otherwise, then plaintiff cannot recover, unless it be upon this other ground that the title under the warrant to James Johnston became vested in him or his predecessors in title.] * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">The court then gave a synopsis of the evidence and said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">I think there is in all this enough to raise a presumption of a conveyance of the right under the James Johnston warrant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>survey to Shoenberger or the McCormicks, by deed which has been lost.] But if you are of a different opinion upon this question and also think there was no actual possession of the land in dispute by the McCormicks in 1861, when Shoup entered, your verdict will be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">\u201c It is not necessary to read and answer the points presented by counsel.

Ogle, </em>2 Binn. <em>468; </em>and an intruder entering <em>on </em>warranted land is entitled to no favor: Taylor <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 1 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 324; Hastings <em>v. </em>Wagner, 7 Id. 215; Fox <em>v. </em>Thompson, 7 Casey 172.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-14\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"ANu\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 12th 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">The testimony in this case does not raise the question of title under the Statute of Limitations. The evidence does not show that either of the parties maintained such an actual and continuous possession of the land in dispute as would bar the right of the warrantee. The case therefore turns upon two distinct propositions : First, wererbhe plaintiff\u2019s vendors in the actual possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the land in controversy, either by themselves or their tenants, when the defendant settled upon it ? In determining this question the occupation of the land by John Croyle, from 1819 to 1829, is not to be considered, forasmuch as that occupation was abandoned at the latter date, neither does it in any way appear to be connected with the plaintiff\u2019s title. In like manner must we exclude the coaling operations of Dr. Shoenberger, for they lack both the permanency and continuity of that kind of possession which, for the time being, is equivalent to title.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The matter then narrows itself down to the inquiry whether, at the time the defendant entered upon the disputed premises, he intruded upon the actual possession of those under whom the plaintiff claims. It will be observed, in the determination of this proposition, that we are to regard the fact of possession alone, and this must be evidenced by acts indicating permanency of occupation, such as residence or cultivation. Where the possessor leaves the premises, his intention to return, of itself, will not avail to continue his possession ; there must, in order to produce this effect, be. some indication left in or upon the property which will give notice of such intent; otherwise abandonment will be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">What those indications are which signify an intent to continue the occupancy will readily suggest themselves even to a casual observer. Buildings kept in a good state of repair, though not occupied, and fields properly fenced, so as to exclude marauding cattle, though not under immediate cultivation \u2014 these, and many other things of a like character, notify us unmistakably that the possession has not been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">We have thus been particular in stating the governing principles of cases like the present, in order that the court may have as clear a view as possible of our ideas, and thus avoid a resubmission to the jury of such facts as the Croyle improvement, the timber-cutting by Dr. Shoenberger, and the claiming of the Johnston tract as part of the Furnace property, as indications of actual possession. The two latter facts would be pertinent in connection with the Bice improvement, to show the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but for no other purpose. This evidence is admissible under the rule, that where one enters upon a tract of land, claiming the whole, though he occupies only a part of it, nevertheless his possession will be treated as co-extensive with his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The second proposition presents the following question: Taking the whole of the evidence together, was there such a long-continued assertion of title, by user of the products of the land in dispute, payment of the taxes, &amp;c., as would raise a presumption of a grant from the warrantee to those under whom the plaintiff claims? The cases cited by the learned judge who tried this case are in point: Taylor <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 1 W. &amp; S. 824 ; Hastings <em>v. </em>Wagner, 7 Id. 216; Fox <em>v. </em>Thompson, 7 Casey 174. A continuous claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and payment of taxes for twenty-one years, have been held to raise such a presumption as against an intruder. \u201c The rational ground for presumption,\u201d says Chief Justice Tilghman, in the case of Kingston <em>v. </em>Lesley, 10 S. &amp; R. 383, \u201c is when the conduct of the party out of possession cannot be accounted for without supposing that he has conveyed to the one in possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">So in Warner <em>v. </em>Henby, 12 Wright 18T, it is said by Chief Justice Thompson: \u201c These presumptions, when ripened by time and the silence of the warrantee, supply the place of a conveyance where there have been continuous acts of ownership on part of the claimant. That period is not less than twenty-one years.\u201d And again, on the same page: \u201c In other words, no presumption runs in his favor more than that of anybody else, if he does not entitle himself to claim it by sufficient acts for a sufficient length of time.\u201d From these authorities we learn that this presumption of grant arises only in favor of him who persistently and continuously claims the land f\u00f3r a long period of time, exercising over it from time to time such acts of dominion as the character thereof warrants and paying the taxes thereupon assessed. Occasional invasions of the property, which may amount to mere trespasses, will not suffice to raise this presumption, neither will the occasional payment of taxes. Whether the plaintiff and his predecessors in title brought themselves within this rule, was a question properly submitted to the jury. The court, however, committed an error in admitting the evidence of Michael Reed, to prove that at one time he saw among the papers of Dr. Shoenberger a deed to him for the James Johnston tract. The defect in this testimony is that it does not inform us when or by whom it was executed, or indeed whether or not it was ever executed by any one. This was clearly not evidence, as it neither showed title nor served to raise a presumption of grant. The proof amounted only to evidence of an unexecuted paper that could avail' for no legitimate purpose whatever, and should therefore have been excluded. We discover nothing else that needs correction, but for the errors indicated the judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
