Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1383, 1413 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en banc), </em>and which the majority applied in the instant case, is incompatible with the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985). To date, this court has not resolved this potential conflict. Although the majority of the <em>Bowen </em>panel, in its denial of panel rehearing, makes the cursory assertion that there is no conflict between the two standards, it furnishes no analytical basis for such a conclusion. The court has not yet squarely addressed the issue and reconciled the language of <em>Brooks </em>and <em>Caldwell. </em>I therefore dissent from the denial of Bowen\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
