We may well rely on the reasons expressed in Judge Colie\u2019s opinion for affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\"> In addition to the reasons stated by Judge Colie, we think the judgment may he affirmed on the further ground of the invalidity or the assignment of the lease made bjr Samuel E. Linden, to his co-partner, Morris B. Mandelbaum and the subsequent assignment made by Mr. Mandelbaum to the defendant, Martin Packing Corporation. The assignment from Linden to Mandelbaum was a breach of the fourth paragraph of the lease, requiring the prior written consent of the landlord for the assignment to be endorsed thereon, and which would not be unreasonably withheld. No request for such an assignment was made by the tenant to the land-. lord, nor was any consent ever given or endorsed upon the lease. Similarly, the assignment from Mandelbaum to the defendant corporation was invalid in that it breached the' provisions of the twenty-eighth paragraph of the lease providing that the tenant may assign the lease \u201cand consent for such purpose is hereby given upon proof of the sale of the assets to the said corporation.\u201d This latter assignment was made without the knowledge of the landlord and without any proof of the sale of the assets to the said corporation having been submitted to the landlord. <em>A fortiori, </em>the <em>assignment </em>to the defendant corporation was invalid and the defendant corporation never acquired any right to the possession of the demised premises or to a renewal of the lease. 32 <em>Am.
