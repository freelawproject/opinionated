J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AT7\">The defendant City of New Brunswick advertised for bids for Lie construction of a 30-inch pipe line, approximately 14.000 feet in length, including pipe, excavation and other miscellaneous items. The defendant A. Oestone Company made its bid, in the total sum of $526,338.50, to furnish all materials and to perform all the required work according to the specifications. This was the lowest bid of the six bids made on the entire contract, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>awarded. The plaintiff, Prank Stamato &amp; Co., submitted a bid in the total sum of $526,590, which was next to the lowest bid. On February 5, 1952, defendant City of New Brunswick passed a resolution accepting the. bid of defendant A. Cestone Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Prank Stamato &amp; Co. then brought suit in the Superior Court, Law Division, in which.it sought a judgment setting aside the resolution of the City of New Brunswick awarding the contract to A. Cestone Company, and requiring the City of New Brunswick to award the contract to plaintiff. Defendants answered and both sides made motions for summary judgment on the pleadings and affidavits. The trial court entered summary judgment setting aside the resolution of February 5, 1952, and the defendant A. Cestone Company appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">' The complaint alleged that A. Cestone Company had made an \u201cunbalanced bid\u201d on Items 7 and 8 of the specifications and demanded that the award of the contract to A. Cestone \u25a0 Company should be set aside because (1) Cestone\u2019s unbalanced bid-violated the specifications which prohibited an obviously unbalanced bid, and (2) the city\u2019s failure to reject Cestone\u2019s unbalanced bid and its action in awarding the contract to Cestone \u201cconstituted unfair competition, partiality, privilege, and discrimination and plaintiff was not put on an equal footing or basis to compete with said defendants to bid said work according to said specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The pertinent parts of the specifications provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">\n<em>\u201c0.11\u2014Basis for Comparing Bids</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">All bids will be compared on the basis of the Engineer\u2019s estimate of the quantities of work to be done.

The mere fact that a bidder .has submitted an unbalanced bid, does not automatically operate to invalidate an award of the contract to such bidder. There must be proof of collusion or of fraudulent conduct on the part of such bidder and the city or its engineer or other agent, or proof of other irregularity of such substantial nature as will operate to affect fair and competitive bidding. <em>Phifer v. Bayonne, </em>105 <em>N. J. L. </em>524 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929); <em>Walter v. McClellan, </em>113 <em>App. Div. </em>295, 99 <em>N. Y. S. </em>78 <em>(App. Div. </em>1906), affirmed 190 <em>N. Y. </em>505, 83 <em>N. E. </em>1133 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1907). In the absence of fraud, corruption or abuse of discretion, the determination of the proper officers.in making an award of a contract will not be disturbed by the court. <em>Fisher v. Longport, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>217. <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947); 10 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3rd ed. </em>1950), \u00a7 29.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-31\">The only provision in the specifications concerning unbalanced bids is: \u201cBids which are obviously unbalanced may be rejected.\u201d This is not a prohibition against unbalanced bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Since the quantities of rock excavation and timber sheeting were not such as could be definitely ascertained before the awarding of the contract, the city had its engineer make an estimate of the amount thereof, and required all bidders to bid on such estimated quantities in order that the lowest bidder on the whole contract could be ascertained. Prior to the preparation of the plans and spccifi cations, the city had borings made along the entire pipeline right of way. The city\u2019s engineer, a hydraulic and sanitary engineer of 30 years\u2019 experience, made the estimate of 5,000 cubic yards of. rock excavation under Item <em>7 </em>and of 50 M Ft. B. M. of sheeting under Item 8, based on his study of these borings, cores, logs of the borings, and conferences with various people familiar with the terrain and who had previously done work in this same area. The results of these borings were made available to all contractors to aid them in the preparation of their bids. The specifications put all bidders on notice that before submitting bids they should \u201cexamine the site of the work and make all necessary investigations in order thoroughly to inform themselves as to the character and magnitude of all work involved in the complete execution of the contract\u201d and that the estimated quantities were \u201csolely to serve as a basis for comparing bids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Here, there was no showing of any fraud, corruption or abuse of discretion, nor a showing of any substantial irregularity which affected fair and competitive bidding. The prospective bidders could not be misled by the specifications. Fair and competitive bidding was not hindered or restricted in any way. Consequently, neither the validity of Cestone\u2019s bid nor the award of the contract to Cestone can be successfully challenged. <em>Phifer v. Bayonne, </em>above; <em>Walter v. McClellan, </em>above.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
