J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AB2\">On September 18, 1951, the defendant made a written application to Judge August Ziegener, of the Hudson County Oourt, to correct the alleged illegal sentence imposed upon him. Judge Ziegener denied Phillips\u2019 application on September 25, 1951. Ho appendix was filed with this court by the defendant, thereby necessitating an examination of the file. We find therein an application by Phillips, dated October 2, 1951, addressed to the Appellate Division \u201cfor leave to appeal the denial for the writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus\u2014Indictment No. 63, 1949 Term, Accusation of Indecent Exposure.\u201d This application, entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d evidently intended as an appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Judge Ziegener\u2019s denial, was filed in the office of the Clerk of Mercer County on March 27, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In the aforementioned \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d the defendant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cIt is the contention of the defendant, that the statute of limitation has/had expired at the time of the imposition of sentence and therefore, the term of imprisonment was null and void due to the expiration of such statute of limitations denial of \u2018speedy trial\u2019 <em>Rule </em>2:12-4 (b) ; <em>Rule </em>48, <em>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, </em>1950, <em>Title </em>18, <em>U. S. </em>Code:.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">On September 27, 1949, the Hudson County grand jury returned an indictment against Phillips, charging him with having committed a notorious act of public indecency, in violation of <em>R. 8. </em>2:140-1. On October 13, 1949, he was arraigned and entered a' plea of not guilty. On March 14, 1951, the indictment was placed upon the calendar for trial. The defendant was represented by .counsel, with whom he consulted, and thereupon retracted his former plea of not guilty and entered a plea of <em>non vult. </em>In the affidavit of his counsel, James FT. Pappas, made a part of the State\u2019s appendix, Mr. Pappas states that he \u201crepresented and advised the defendant in the above matter, at which time a plea of <em>nonvult </em>was entered. This plea was explained by me to him and to his sister. The Court also explained the plea to him.\u201d Before imposing sentence upon Phillips, the court, under authority of the provisions of <em>L. </em>1949, c. 20, now <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:16U-3 <em>et seq., </em>made an order providing for a mental examination of the defendant. On June 26, 1951, after receipt of the report of that examination, the court imposed a sentence of not less than two and one-half years nor more than three years in State Prison and a fine of $1,000, besides the costs of prosecution. From the time of Phillips\u2019 indictment to the time of trial, he was at all times at liberty on bail in the amount of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u25a0 In view of the fact that the State has not interposed any. objections to the procedure adopted by the defendant in the presentation of his application to Judge Ziegener and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>prosecution of his appeal from Judge Ziegener\u2019s determination, we will proceed to a consideration and determination of the questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"> In the first place, the validity of the sentence imposed upon the defendant cannot be successfully assailed. The defendant entered a plea of <em>non vult </em>to the indictment charging him with open lewdness in violation of <em>R. 8. </em>2 :140\u20141, now <em>N. J. 8. 2A </em>:115\u20141, a conviction thereof being denominated a misdemeanor. Such a plea is equivalent to a plea of guilty. <em>Kravis v. Hoch, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>161 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1947); <em>State v. Griffith, </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>77, 82 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). <em>R. S. </em>2:103-6, now <em>N. J. S. </em>2A:85-7, <em>N. J. S. A., </em>provides that one found guilty of a crime declared by statute to be a misdemeanor, and for which no punishment is specifically provided, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both. It thus appears that the sentence was clearly within the statutory limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Nor do we find any merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy and public trial and, therefore, the statute of limitations had expired at the time of the imposition of sentence and the sentence was null and void. The applicable <em>Rule, </em>2 :12-4(S) (4:2-6) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201cAt any time after six months following the return of an indictment or the filing of an accusation, the Assignment Judge may direct that the trial of the indictment or accusation shall be moved upon a day specified. Upon failure of the prosecuting attorney to comply with such order the court may order the indictment or accusation dismissed, which dismissal shall be the equivalent of a judgment of acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In commenting upon this rule, Mr. Waltzinger. in 1 <em>New Jersey Practice </em>242, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201cParagraphs <em>(h) </em>and (c) of this rule should be read in conjunction with <em>Hules </em>2:9-1 (Z&gt;) and 2:9\u20141 <em>(e) </em>relating to bail on failure to try or failure to indict. The Assignment Judge can force a case on for trial and if the trial is not held he can dismiss the indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>or accusation. <em>* </em>* * The application of the rules in paragraphs (5) and (c) are entirely discretionary. A defendant should under this rule have the right to apply for relief under paragraphs (6) and <em>(c) </em>although the rule does not specifically so state * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Here, the trial court did not direct \u201cthat the trial of the indictment or accusation shall be moved upon a date specified.\u201d Such action by the court being a discretionary matter, it will be presumed that the court exercised its discretion in a proper judicial spirit, and that such reasons were before the court to justify the delay. Hor does it appear that the defendant was- prejudiced or harmed in any way thereby. Phillips, although free on bail from the time of his indictment until the time of his sentence, never made any application to the court for a trial of the indictment returned against him. The historical legislative enactments pertaining to the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>are extensively reviewed in the cases of <em>State v. Garthwaite, 23 N. J. L. </em>143 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1851); <em>Patterson v. </em>State, 50 <em>N. J. L. </em>421 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1888) and <em>In re Thompson, </em>85 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>221 <em>(Ch. </em>1915). In the <em>Patterson </em>case, wherein the court considered the defendant\u2019s contention that he \u201cwas entitled to his discharge because his trials were unreasonably delayed,\u201d the court held, <em>inter alia,:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201c* * * The right under the <em>habeas corpus </em>act becomes complete upon the prisoner\u2019s duly petitioning to be brought to trial and the failure to try him for two terms after commitment. The right under the other act becomes complete upon the failure to try the prisoner for two terms, after issue joined upon the indictment, and the omission of the court to allow, for just cause, further time for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">It seems clear from the <em>Patterson </em>case, that to entitle a prisoner to his discharge under the statutes then existing and now presently controlled by <em>Buie </em>2:12-4, he should preliminarily make application to the court at the appropriate time for his discharge because of the lack of .prosecution and show an unreasonable denial thereof by the court. In the case of <em>Pietch v. United </em>States, 110 <em>Fed. 2d </em>817, 819, 129 <em>A. L. R. </em>563 <em>(C. C. A. </em>10 1940), construing the federal rule, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201cA person charged with a crime cannot assert with success that his right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States has been invaded unless he asked for a trial. In the absence of an affirmative request or demand for trial made to the court it must be presumed that appellant acquiesced in the delay and therefore cannot complain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><em>Cf. State v. Dilts, 76 N. J. L. </em>410 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In a one-page memorandum filed by the defendant entitled \u201cMy Briefs,\u201d he argues that the evidence does not warrant his conviction. He asserts also that \u2018Te signed no statement conserning my case.\u201d However, in the State\u2019s appendix, there is a purported confession of the defendant, wherein he admits the commission of the crime and furnishes details thereof. In view of his plea there was, of course, no trial. Had there been, the weight of the evidence and trial errors could have been raised only by appeal\u2014not through the medium of a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>In re Graham, </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>449 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), certif. den. <em>7 N. J. </em>582 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
