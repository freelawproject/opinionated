A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AtB\">This case arises under , our Unemployment Compensation Law, <em>R. 8. </em>43 :2l-l <em>etc. </em>The appellant conducts a large plant in which employment varies greatly with the seasons. The respondent Jesse Tomlinson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was one of appellant\u2019s employees who were laid off in April, 1950. He filed a claim for unemployment compensation and received benefits each week to and including the week ending Thursday, July 6. But on July 5, 1950, he had reported back to work. Later, the agency determined that he must refund the benefits for that week. The only benefits received by him that are still involved in this proceeding are the payments allocated to the last two weeks in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Relations between appellant and its employees were the subject of a contract in which the company had agreed to give all employees who had the requisite seniority \u201cas of the eligibility date of July 1st, two weeks\u2019 vacation with pay.\u201d \u201cIt is the Company\u2019s prerogative to determine when the vacation period shall take place.\u201d ' The agreed \u201cvacation payment\u201d was not two weeks\u2019 pay at the rate which the employee received when working, but was four per cent of his total earnings for the year ending in the preceding April. The company considered that employees, like Tomlinson, who had been laid off before July 1 and were not called back till after that date, were not entitled to vacations or vacation payments. The union held the view that they were entitled io vacation pay. By the end of August, the company accepted the union\u2019s position and in a letter dated September 1, 1950, said: \u201cWe will pay to employees laid off on or after March 22, 1950, who were not actively employed on the eligibility date of July \"1st and who were reinstated thereafter with seniority before January 1, 1951, their vacation payment.\u201d Pursuant thereto, the company gave to Tomlinson on September 15 its check for $59.59. It was in form an ordinary payroll check for \u201cWeek ending 9-10-50\u201d but was stamped \u201cVacation.\u201d In addition, the company paid Tomlinson his earned wages for the week ending September 10, 1950. Such are the bare facts on which the appellant relies. How as to the proceeding before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The company, under date of September 7, 1950, addressed a letter to the agency\u2019s office in Camden, saying, \u201cWe are forwarding pertinent information on our employees who will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>receive vacation pay for the vacation period which covered the first two full calendar weeks in \u00abJuly. All of these employees returned to work on or before July 17, 1950. Kindly advise ns what disposition will he made on any unemployment benefits paid to tlio claimant during the period which they received vacation pay.\u201d This letter was, perhaps, the cause of an inquiry made by the agency, in which the fact was developed that Tomlinson worked two days in the last week for which he liad received unemployment compensation, liad been paid for those two days and was not entitled to unemployment benefits for that week. The agency so determined and on November (5, 1959, notified Tomlinson and, pursuant to <em>B. 8. </em>43:21-16(\u00e1), demanded that he refund the benefits which he had received fox that week. The wages paid Tomlinson for those two days early in July were entirely disjunct from the vacation pay mentioned in the letter of September 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Also that letter was accepted by the appeal tribunal of the agency as an appeal \u201cfrom the payment of benefits for auv part of the first two calendar weeks of July, 1950.\u201d Since the agency had demanded a refund of all benefits received by Tomlinson for any part of July, the appeal tribunal decided that \u201cTherefore, there is no issue before the Tribunal.\u201d Within the 10-day period allowed by <em>B. 8. </em>43:21-6(e), the company appealed to the board of review, and urged for the first time that the vacation payment made in September, 1950, should be applied to the \u201clast two weeks preceding the claimants\u2019 recall to work.\u201d Lt argued that those two weeks should be considered Tomlinson\u2019s vacation. The board rendered its decision September 14, 1951, that \u201cThe claimant was eligible for benefits through June 29, 1950. He was ineligible thereafter.\u201d Erom that decision, the company appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The company points out that its contract gives it the \u201cprerogative to determine when the vacation period shall take place.\u201d The meaning of this clause is not uncertain. The right to set the time for an employee\u2019s vacation was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the company so that it could fix a time that would not interfere with the company\u2019s operations. The company in the spring could direct Tomlinson to take the last two weeks in <em>June; </em>but under the contract it had no right in February or in September to tell him that the two weeks of the preceding June had been his vacation. The idea of asserting that those particular weeks had been his vacation seems not to have occurred to the company until February, 1951, vfhen it appealed to the board of review. In September it had advanced what may be' called the theory of a constructive vacation, and it suggested that the first two weeks in July be considered as the vacation, probably because the company annually shut down its plant for those two weeks and gave everyone a vacation except maintenance crews and the like. But in August, 1950, in the negotiations with the union, the parties seem to have reached an understanding that the men who had been laid off in the spring would not have any- vacations that year but nevertheless would receive vacation pay calculated in the manner prescribed by the contract. If the company had told the union that in exchange for vacation pay the men would lose their unemployment compensation for two weeks, a settlement might have been harder to reach. The last two weeks preceding Tomlinson\u2019s return to work were not a vacation. He was actively hunting for work, out of a job, wondering whether and when he would be recalled by appellant. <em>Nor did </em>he ever receive vacation pay that was allocable to those weeks. Wo find no merit in the company\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Even did we agree with the company\u2019s contention respecting the allocation of the September payment, we doubt if the appeal could be sustained, since there would still seem to be no basis for holding Tomlinson liable under <em>B. S. </em>\u00e93:3116(d) to refund the benefits or to give credit against future benefits, and, at best, a doubtful basis.for deciding that the company\u2019s account should not be charged with the.benefits paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The determination of the board of review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
