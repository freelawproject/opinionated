It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, consistent with the purposes of the legislation. Delaney v. Moraitis, 4 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 129; Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 1932, 285 U.S. 1, 52 S.Ct. 275, 277, 76 L.Ed. 587; cf. United States ex rel. Mensevich v. Tod, 1924, 264 U.S. 134, 44 S.Ct. 282, 68 L.Ed. 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\"> The Supreme Court has pointed out that \u201cthe word \u2018country\u2019 \u25a0 * * * is ambiguous. It may be taken to mean foreign territory or a foreign government. In the sense of territory, it may embrace all the territory subject to a. foreign sovereign power. When referring more particularly to a foreign government, it may describe a foreign State-in the international sense * * * or it. may mean a foreign government which has authority over a particular area or subject matter, although not an international person * * *.\u201d Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">Since Formosa is a well-defined geographical, social and political entity and since there is a government on Formosa which has undisputed control of the is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>land, we think it is a \u201ccountry\u201d within the meaning and purposes of the statute. This construction comports with Congress\u2019 evident purpose to reduce the number of \u201cundeportables\u201d by increasing the number of places to which an alien under a final order of deportation may be sent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would \u25a0open to doubt the Attorney General\u2019s power to deport aliens to areas of the world where diplomatic status is unsettled, such as various trusteeships, protectorates or colonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We attribute no significance to the fact that the 1917 predecessor to \u00a7 243 (a) permitted aliens to be deported to the \u201ccountry whence they came or the foreign port at which such aliens embarked for the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under this provision, appellees would be deport-able to their point of embarkation on Formosa. The corresponding section now reads \u201cthe country in which is located the foreign port at which such alien embarked for the United States \u25a0* * *,\u201d \u00a7 1253(a) (2). Congress gave no reason for the change, and we are unable to find that it was intended to be \u25a0one of substance running counter to the congressional purpose of tightening the deportation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Since we conclude that the word \u201ccountry\u201d as used in \u00a7 243(a) is not limited to national sovereignties in the traditional diplomatic sense, see United States \u25a0ex rel. Moon v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 316, the possibilities of foreign affairs embarrassment which the District Court feared do not arise. Nor \u25a0does this construction involve judicial intervention into political matters entrusted to the Executive and Legislative Branches. The judgment is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to grant summary judgment for the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-17\">. The circumstances giving rise to the deportation order are set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, D.D.C.1959, 177 F.Supp. 281, and in Cheng Fu Sheng v. Barber, 9 Cir., 1959, 269 F.2d 497, where appellees obtained the right to seek congressional relief under \u00a7 6 of the Refugee Relief Act. 67 Stat. 403 (1953), 50 U.S. C.A.Appendix \u00a7 1971d. Congress subsequently refused to grant them permanent residence. 105 Cong.Rec. 17586 (daily ed. Sept. 11, 1959) ; H.R.Rep. No. 1176, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.

But in the view of our State Department, no agreement has \u201cpurported to transfer the sovereignty of Formosa to [the Republic of] China.\u201d At the present time, we accept the exercise of Chinese authority over Formosa, and recognize the Government of the Republic of China (the Nationalist Government) as the legal Government of China. That Government has its provisional capital at Taipei, Taiwan (Formosa).

According to subsection (7), \u201cif deportation to any of the foregoing <em>places </em>or countries is impracticable, inadvisable or impossible * * * \u201d (emphasis supplied) then the alien may be deported \u201cto any country willing to accept [him].\u201d Appellees contend that the word \u201cplaces\u201d in this subsection was not intended to be synonymous with \u201ccountries\u201d and thus does not broaden the meaning of \u201ccountries.\u201d Rather they contend, \u201cplaces\u201d was used to refer to \u201cforeign territory-contiguous to the United States or any island, adjacent thereto.\u201d This phrase is used in \u00a7 243 to describe \u201cplaces\u201d which an alien may not designate as the preferred site of deportation. We note,, without deciding whether \u201cplaces\u201d and \u201ccountries\u201d wore intended to be used as equivalents, that appellees\u2019 argument does not stand scrutiny. The portion of \u00a7 243 (a) to which they refer would seem to-equate \u201ccountry\u201d and \u201cplace.\u201d It states that deportation shall be to \u201ca <em>country </em>promptly designated by the alien\u201d but \u201cno alien shall * * * designate as the-<em>place </em>to which he wishes to be deported, any foreign territory contiguous to-the United States or any island adjacent thereto.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)See also United States ex rel.
