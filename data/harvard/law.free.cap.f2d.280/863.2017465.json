KIRKPATRICK.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-15\">. United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28, United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b912-13\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">The Assistant Commissioner (118 U. S.P.Q. 378) reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and held that Registration No. 565,410 of the mark \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d for \u201cHair tinting and coloring preparations\u201d granted to appellant on the Supplemental Register should be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">Appellee\u2019s petition for cancellation was filed under section 24 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1092, and alleges that the mark \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d is descriptive of the goods and was not used as a trademark at the time the registration was secured. Section 24 gives any person who \u201cbelieves that he is or will be damaged by the registration of a mark on this [supplemental] register,\u201d the right to apply to the Commissioner to cancel such registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">Section 23 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1091, permits registration of \u201call marks capable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods.\u201d The issue is whether \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d is such a mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-19\">The generic name by which a product is known is not a mark which can be registered on the Supplemental Register under section 23 because such a name is incapable of distinguishing applicant\u2019s goods from goods of the same name manufactured or sold by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">The record herein establishes the following facts which show that \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d is the generic name of, rather than a trademark for, the goods on which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">1) \u201cColor Bath\u201d was used by appellee as early as April 1948 as a generic name for a color bath for hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">2) Appellant, nearly two years later, beginning March 1, 1950, took the generic term \u201cColor bath\u201d and added the word \u201chair\u201d to it. The product was sold as \u201cMiss Clairol\u201d hair color bath.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>3) The label filed in support of appellant\u2019s application for registration contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201cMiss Clairol (R) A quick, youthful Hair Color Bath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">4) Appellant\u2019s advertising for its <em>\u201cMiss Clairol </em>hair color bath\u201d contains the statement <em>\u201cMiss Clairol </em>is a hair color bath that colors your hair beautifully, lastingly! In just 5 to 20 minutes your beautician bathes glorious lasting <em>Miss Clairol </em>color through your hair\u2014 without even the need of first bleaching and shampooing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The exhibits and testimony convince us that the only significance of \u201chair color bath\u201d to the consuming public is that these words are the generic name for the product and that as such they do not indicate the source or origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">The record shows that \u201chair col- or bath\u201d tells the potential purchasers <em>only </em>what the goods are, what their function is, what their characteristics are and what their use is. Even though \u201ccol- or bath\u201d may have been a novel way of describing a liquid for coloring hair, the words were, as used by appellee, nevertheless descriptive of its hair coloring liquid at the time when appellant, to more fully describe the goods, added the common word \u201chair\u201d thereto. The resultant expression is nothing but the normal use of the English language. The same merchandise may, and often does, have more than one generic name.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Upon the facts of record, it is our opinion that the words \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d constitute a generic name, were not used as a trademark at the time they were registered, and hence the registration under section 23 was improper and should be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">The decision of the Assistant Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">MARTIN, Judge with whom KIRKPATRICK, Judge, joins (concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">I do not believe that \u201cHair Color Bath\u201d has been used as a trademark to identify appellant\u2019s product, but rather it has been used solely for the purpose of describing the function of this particular product. For this reason I agree with the result reached by the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
