The indictment was in six counts. We are here concerned only with counts 3, 4 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-23\">Count 3 alleged, in substance, that on or about November 24, 1958, in Los Angeles County, California, Claypole transferred to John A. Gjertsen and Michael Gullon 6 pounds and 4 ounces of marihuana not in pursuance of a written order of Gjertsen and Gullon on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Count 4 alleged, in substance, that on or about November 25, 1958, in Los Angeles County, California, Claypole and Shapiro transferred to Gjertsen and Gullon 11 pounds and 6 ounces of marihuana not in pursuance of a written order of Gjertsen and Gullon on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. Thus each of counts 3 and .4 charged a violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4742(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Count 6 alleged, in substance, that on or about December 9, 1958, in Los An-geles County, California, Larson, with intent to defraud the United States, knowingly concealed and facilitated the concealment of 17 ounces of marihuana, knowing the same to have been imported and brought into the United States contrary to law: Thus count 6 charged a violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Claypole, Shapiro and Larson were arraigned, pleaded not guilty and had a jury trial. Shapiro moved for and obtained a judgment of acquittal on count 4. Claypole was found guilty on counts 3 and 4. Larson was found guilty on count 6. Judgments of conviction were entered, sentencing Claypole to be imprisoned 15 years on each of counts 3 and 4, his sentences to run concurrently, and sentencing Larson to be imprisoned five years on count 6. Claypole and Larson have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The brief of appellants (Claypole and Larson) does not contain a specification of errors<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denominated as such. It</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">does, however, contain two statements which we shall treat as specifications\u2014 (1) that the court erred in instructing the jury that \u201cthe law provides that if there is proof that a person shall have had in his possession marihuana, such proof is sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless such possession is explained to the satisfaction of the jury,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury that \u201cthe testimony of an accomplice should be considered with caution.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">No other error or alleged error is mentioned or referred to in appellants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\"> As indicated above, the specifications relate to (1) a portion of the court\u2019s charge to the jury and (2) an omission from the charge. Appellants did not, nor did either of them, object to any portion of the charge or omission therefrom before the jury retired to consider its verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence we are not required to consider the specifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, we have considered them and find no merit in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Appellants contend that 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 176a, which appellant Larson was convicted of violating, is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no merit in this conten-iion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Appellants\u2019 brief states: \u201cThis court should establish that an accused cannot be convicted solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The question thus attempted to be raised is not before us. In this case, there were nine Government witnesses. None of the nine was an accomplice of Larson. One of the nine \u2014 Salvatore Greco \u2014 was an accomplice of Clay-pole, but not of Larson. Greco testified against Claypole, but not against Larson. Nor was Claypole convicted solely upon Greco\u2019s testimony. Greco\u2019s testimony was corroborated. No other accomplice of Claypole testified against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Except as indicated above, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain appellants\u2019 conviction is not here challenged. The record discloses no basis for such a challenge. The evidence was amply sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Appellants were admitted to bail pending appeal. In view of the affirmance, we now regard the bail then fixed as inadequate. Therefore, the orders admitting to bail are revoked. This is without prejudice to new applications being made in the district court for bail in the light of changed circumstances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-14\">.
