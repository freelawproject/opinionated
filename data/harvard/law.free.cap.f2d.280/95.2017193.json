Bernstein, Asst. Atty. Gen. of the State of New York, New York City (Louis J. Lefkowitz, Atty. Gen. of the State of New York, New York City, Paxton Blair, Sol. Gen., Albany, N.

He did not appeal his conviction, but in 1948, and again in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>1951, he sought relief in a state county-court by way of motions in the nature of <em>coram nobis, </em>and in 1959 by writ of habeas corpus, wherein the Appellate Division denied leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>People of State of New York ex rel. Williams v. Martin, 9 A.D.2d 635, 193 N.Y.S.2d 607. Appellant did not press these cases further. The practice followed in appellant\u2019s indictment here was expressly approved in People v. De Santis, 305 N.Y. 44, 110 N.E.2d 549, certiorari denied 345 U.S. 944, 73 S.Ct. 839, 97 L.Ed. 1370. But in 1957 the legislature enacted N.Y.Code Crim.Proc. \u00a7 275-b, providing that the indictment should not allege prior convictions. See also the 1959 amendments to id. \u00a7\u00a7 482, 717, upon recommendation of the Law Revision Commission, 1959 McKinney\u2019s Sess.Laws of N.Y., pp. 1625-1630. Hence the present practice is to allege and prove such prior convictions only following a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The question raised appears to be one of state practice, presenting no issue of federal due process. Gryger v. Burke, 334 U.S. 728, 731, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 92 L.Ed. 1683; Vanderwyde v. Denno, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 113 F.Supp. 918, affirmed 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 105, certiorari denied 347 U.S. 949, 74 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed. 1096. Moreover, relator has- failed to exhaust state remedies and thus is barred from relief here under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. United States ex rel. Cuomo v. Fay, 2 Cir., 257 F.2d 438, certiorari denied 358 U.S. 935, 79 S.Ct. 325, 3 L.Ed.2d 307. And since New York will not now consider the contention, as it was not raised on direct appeal, People v. Noia, reported <em>sub nom. </em>People v. Caminito, 3 N.Y.2d 596, 170 N.Y.S.2d 799, 148 N.E.2d 139, certiorari denied Noia v. People of State of New York, 357 U.S. 905, 78 S.Ct. 1149, 2 L.Ed.2d 1156, it is outside the reach of the federal writ. Daniels v. Allen, reported <em>sub nom. </em>Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 482-485, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469. For each of these several reasons the order below is</p>\n<p id=\"Aae\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
