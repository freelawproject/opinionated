He filed a timely application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, which the District Court denied. Later, he moved to vacate his sentence, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1958). The motion was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">Whether this case be considered as a belated direct appeal from the judgment of conviction, cf. Blunt v.

We have reviewed the entire record, and perceive no prejudicial error as to any of the counts of which appellant was found guilty, or in the denial of the motion under Section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AK9\">. We express no opinion as to whether on the facts here appellant is entitled to have his ease so considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
