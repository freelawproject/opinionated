Suit for a declaratory judgment and restoration of status was thereafter brought in the District Court. That court granted the appellees\u2019 (defendants\u2019) motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-18\">The function of the courts in cases like this is not to review the merits of a dismissal, but to determine whether the employee was accorded his statutory and procedural rights. See Hargett v. Sum-merfield, 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 85, 243 F.2d 29. Such rights were fully accorded here.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
