Appellant, after a trial before a judge sitting without a jury, was convicted and sentenced. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">The record shows that appellant appeared before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. After stating her name and occupation, she refused to answer five \u2022questions propounded to her, the first of these being \u201cHave you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\u201d She \u25a0replied: \u201cI will not answer any other \u25a0question I am asked about membership in organizations, associations, societies, people I have met with, or anything -else.\u201d She explained that such questions in her view were \u201cin violation of -my constitutional rights,\u201d and that she particularly relied on the First Amendment. Four more questions were asked, along similar lines to the first, receiving a similar response from appellant. The indictment was in five counts, specifying refusal to answer the five questions. She was found guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">No attempt was made by the subcommittee or its counsel to explain to appellant the basis for asking these questions, the nature and scope of the subcommittee\u2019s inquiry, or the pertinency of these questions to the inquiry. The Chairman simply said that the hearing was being held as a continuation of one held some months earlier. There is no showing that appellant was apprised of (or knew) the nature of these earlier hearings, or that the subject matter under inquiry on the day she appeared was conveyed to her in any fashion. \u201c[Kjnowledge of the subject to which the interrogation is deemed pertinent * * * must be available [to the witness] with the same degree of explicitness and clarity that the Due Process Clause requires in the expression of any element of a criminal offense.\u201d Watkins v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 178, at pages 208-209, 77 S.Ct. 1173, at page 1190, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273. And see Baren-blatt v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 109, at pages 116-117, 79 S.Ct. 1081, at pages 1087-1088, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">At the trial, the Government endeavored to show that the subject under inquiry was \u201cCommunism in Education.\u201d It argues to us that appellant was admittedly a school teacher, and that the subject matter of the inquiry appeared from the reference by the Chairman to the earlier hearings, and from the nature of the proceedings themselves. We are unable to agree. It is entirely possible that appellant knew exactly what was going on, and that she took a calculated risk in adopting an uncooperative attitude. But that possibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ty is not enough. The requirements of due process are not so easily satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">For these reasons, the conviction must be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">. The circumstances under which the appeals in this case and seven other contempt of Congress cases came on for hearing in this court appear in footnote 2 of the opinion, in Gojack v. United States, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. -, 280 F.2d 678.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-16\">. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahn\">\u201cProsecution for contempt of Congress presupposes an adequate opportunity for the defendant to have awareness of the pertinency of the information that he has denied to Congress. And the basis of such awareness must be contemporaneous with the witness\u2019 refusal to answer and not at the trial for it. Accordingly, the actual scope of the inquiry that the Committee was authorized to conduct and the relevance of the questions to that inquiry must be shown to have been luminous at the time when asked and not left, at best, in cloudiness. The circumstances of this case were wanting in these essentials.\u201d Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. at page 217, 77 S.Ct. at page 1194 (concurring opinion).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
