The action was filed on May 16, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">The district court\u2019s Rule 14, West\u2019s Ann.Code, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-21\">\u201cAt a time fixed by the Court at least every six months, the Clerk in open court, under the supervision of the Master Calendar Judge, shall call all civil actions pending in which no steps have been taken for six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-22\">\u201cNotice of the calling shall be mailed to all attorneys of record. If none of the parties nor their attorneys appear, or if good cause for the lack of prosecution is not shown, the Court may dismiss the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">On this appeal, necessarily the meaning of the word \u201cstep\u201d is involved. The record shows that the last activity in the case prior to the dismissal proceedings was the taking by the plaintiff on October 16, 1958, of a deposition of the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ment physician allegedly responsible for some damage to plaintiff\u2019s body. This \u25a0deposition was not transcribed and filed until December 29,1959</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">We take judicial notice of the fact that the district court concerned here \u25a0ordinarily proceeds according to docket \u25a0entries (thus, one finds an interpretation \u25a0of \u201csteps\u201d) before calling up cases under Rule 14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 6, 1959, the clerk of the district court sent counsel a notice that Jarva\u2019s case would be on the dismissal calendar on August 13, 1959. On this date, an associate of plaintiff\u2019s counsel made an appearance and so did government counsel. Neither offered the court any proof, but supplied the court \u25a0casually with conversation, both purporting to state some facts which were challenged argumentively. Dismissal was \u25a0entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\"> Chief counsel for Jarva was back in San Francisco in September, 1959, and moved to vacate the order of \u2022dismissal. In support thereof he made a rather strong showing by affidavits. However, due to the absence from San Francisco of the judge who granted the \u25a0order of August 13,1959, he could not get the motion heard before October 21,1959. This presented a dilemma on the time for appeal. To get within the requirement \u25a0of appealing within 60 days,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> counsel filed .a notice of appeal on October 9, 1960. Thus, he deprived the district court of further jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">On October 21, 1959, the hearing of the motion to vacate was heard. During the hearing there was much discussion of the effect of the appeal. But the court heard the motion and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Inasmuch as the court was willing to further consider the matter on its merits, we think it should do so when it has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">It would appear that generally a litigant in the particular court might have filed (if he were ready) a certificate of readiness any time<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before June 29, 1959, and thus have been within the ambit of the practice of the court. If it should appear that from January 1, 1959, to May 1, 1959, there was scarcely any time, as plaintiff claims, that he could or should have attended his trial because of his hospitalization, it does seem rather severe to dismiss the case on August 13, 1959. Of course, the case may be different if the government suffered some particular prejudice in the period June 29 to August 13, 1959. If such prejudice is claimed, some proof should be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\"> But for the fact of the illness during the winter and spring of 1958-1959, we would affirm the district court as having properly exercised its discretion. Below there was some discussion of there being a factual issue which could have been tried without plaintiff\u2019s presence. Possibly so, but during the time he was hospitalized, it would seem grossly unfair to force him to trial during such a period unless the government was suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>fering some unusual prejudice at the time. And if so, it could have moved for trial of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The order of dismissal is vacated and the cause is remanded for further consideration consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. Of course, tlie mere filing date indicates no activity of counsel, but is apparently a fortuitous credit for a \u201cstep\u201d given all litigants in tlie court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">.
