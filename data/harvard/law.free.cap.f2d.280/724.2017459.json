Customers would select their vegetables and carry them to a point 5 to 8 feet distant from the outside counter to the inside of the store to be weighed and wrapped. There was testimony that portions \u2022of leafy vegetables were dropped and \u25a0often observed at and about the entrance to the store near the outside vegetable \u25a0counter. Mrs. Foy was a regular customer who had visited the store about twice a week for some time and another witness observed that there was usually vegetable debris in front of the vegetable counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Mrs. Foy slipped on a collard leaf and was injured in a fall on the concrete just at the entrance of the store. Her claim is that appellees negligently failed to keep the passageway in a reasonably safe condition. Appellees contended first, absence of negligence and second, contributory negligence. The jury returned a verdict for the appellees, defendants in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">The points on appeal involve certain requests for jury instructions made by appellant and denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Appellants requested an instruction to the effect that the store proprietor was under a duty to take \u201cmore than the usual precautions\u201d to keep the approaches to the store in a safe condition, and that a \u201chigher degree\u201d of care may have been necessary due to the nature of the area. Instead, the Court instructed that the proprietor of a store owes his customers \u201cthe duty of exercising reasonable care to keep the store in a reasonably safe condition for their use.\u201d Enlarging on that he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-13\">\u201cNegligence is not an absolute term but a relative one * * * an act that is negligent under one set of circumstances, might not be so under another. Therefore, to arrive at a fair standard, we ask what conduct might reasonably have been expected of a person of ordinary prudence under the same circumstances. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-14\">\u201cDealing further with this question of the duty of the defendants, in using the outside of their store in connection with their grocery market business, they assumed the duty of using ordinary care and diligence in maintaining the area so used and the area immediately adjacent thereto in a reasonably safe condition for the safety of their customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">He also instructed that in passing on the issue of appellee\u2019s negligence, \u201cthe conduct of the party must be considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\"> Plaintiffs\u2019 request to the effect that a \u201chigher degree\u201d of care was required is not a correct statement of the law. See Hecht Co. v. Jacobsen, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 180 F.2d 13. The standard of \u201creasonable or ordinary care in the circumstances\u201d is a constant standard, though it possesses needed flexibility to cover differing situations. \u201cOrdinary care\u201d means \u201creasonable care\u201d in the particular circumstances. The greater the hazard created by the acts or omissions of one charged with a duty, -the greater is the duty to afford protection reasonable in the circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\">\u201cThe care required is always reasonable care. This standard never varies, but the care which it is reasonable to require of the actor varies with the danger involved in his act and is proportionate thereto. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>greater the danger, the greater the care which must be exercised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\u201cAs in all cases where the reasonable character of the actor\u2019s conduct is in question, its utility is a matter to be weighed against the magnitude of the risk which it involves. * * * The amount of attention and competence required varies with the magnitude of the harm likely to be done if care is not exercised, and with the utility of the act. Restatement, Torts \u00a7 298, comment a (1934).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">See also S. S. Kresge Co. v. McCallion, 8 Cir., 1932, 58 F.2d 931; Gilbert v. Duluth General Electric Co., 1904, 93 Minn. 99, 100 N.W. 653. But to characterize this difference as one of standards is to fragmentize the law of negligence and confuse the jury in its deliberations. The standard is constant; it is the circumstances which dictate whether the standard has been met. See Hecht Co. v. Jacobsen, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> Requested instruction No. 7 to the effect that the store proprietors were under a duty \u201cto keep that area clean from vegetable debris <em>at all times </em>and to guard against the creation of a dangerous condition\u201d was properly denied. (Emphasis added.) Such an instruction would, in effect, charge appel-lees with the duty of insurers and impose a duty substantially beyond \u201cordinary care.\u201d F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Williams, infra; Brodsky v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 1945, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 301, 152 F.2d 677; Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Preston, 1959, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 269 F.2d 781. The latter part of the requested instruction on the duty to guard against dangerous conditions was correct but that, too, was adequately covered by the court in his statement that appellants were obliged to show that appellees had \u201cactual or constructive notice of the presence of the collard leaf on the pavement in time to have discovered its presence and to have taken precautions against it * * [and] in time to take action to guard against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">We conclude that while the instructions might well have contained a more complete discussion of the elements of the duty of reasonable care, they were not erroneous.

Miller, 1940, 71 U.S.App.D.C. 376, 110 F.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
