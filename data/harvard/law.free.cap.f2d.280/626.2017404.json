The appeal is also from an order of the Commission adopted July 22, 1959, denying Interstate\u2019s petition for reconsideration of the order of November 5, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">In a stipulation entered into by counsel for all the parties and approved by order of this court dated November 25, 1959, it was agreed that the following question is presented by this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_1\">\u201cWhether Appellant\u2019s allegations of economic injury, which would result solely from adjacent channel interference causing loss of listeners outside the contour within which Appellant\u2019s station is normally protected against such interference but within the contour normally protected against co-channel interference, were sufficient to establish that, as a matter of law, Appellant is a person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected within the meaning of Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended [47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405], so as to bring this matter within the rule of Metropolitan Television Company v. Federal Communications Commission, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 221 F.2d 879.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axt-dedup-0\">Interstate alleged in its petition for reconsideration, and argues here, it would lose an unspecified number of listeners outside the contour within which its station is normally protected because of interference from the proposed new station which will operate on an adjacent channel. This allegation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the claim of resultant economic injury are not sufficiently factual to constitute an averment of aggrievement within the meaning of the Metropolitan Television Company case.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
