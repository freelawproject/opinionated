As was said by Judge Parker in Barber v. United States, 4 Cir., 142 F.2d 805, 807: \u201cThe only purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence against an accused to warrant his being held for action by a grand jury; and, after a bill of indictment has been found, there is no occasion for such hearing.\u201d Cf. Garrison v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 104 F.2d 128; James et al. v. Lawrence, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 176 F.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-27\">The order of the district court is affirmed. . . .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
