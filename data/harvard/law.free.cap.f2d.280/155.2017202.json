United States Senior Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O'Connell, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-19\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Patents, 120 USPQ 91, reversing the decision of the Examiner of Interferences and sustaining the opposition filed under section 13 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1063, by appellee, to an application, serial No. 699,061, filed November 29, 1955, by appellant to register the name \u201cCool Sip\u201d under section 2 of said act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052, as a trademark for a liquid concentrate and a preparation in powder form for making dietary beverages or soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">Appellee is the owner of the trademark \u201cKool-Aid\u201d for \u201cprepared powders * * * for making non-alcoholic beverage in the home\u201d upon which Registration No. 317,955 was issued October 9, 1934, renewed, republished February 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>1949 under section 12(c) of the Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1062(c), and is now incontestable under section 15 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1065. Appellee also owns Registration No. 623,164, issued March 13, 1956 on the trademark \u201cKool-Aid\u201d for \u201cPowders for making soft drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The issue here presented arises particularly under section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 and requires us to determine whether appellant\u2019s mark \u2018,\u2018Cool Sip\u201d so resembles appellee\u2019s registered mark \u201cKool-Aid\u201d \u201cas to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Appellant\u2019s use of the mark \u201cCool Sip\u201d on soft drink powders commenced in 1954, some 27 years after appellee, began using its \u201cKool-Aid\u201d mark on soft drink powders. Appellant\u2019s first use of the mark \u201cCool Sip\u201d on a liquid concentrate was in 1935, a date subsequent to appel-lee\u2019s 1927 use of its mark, \u201cKool-Aid.\u201d Priority is not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The record is silent as to the extent of sales by appellant under its \u201cCool Sip\u201d mark and about the amount of advertising, if any, of its products on which the mark is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">By contrast, the record with respect to appellee\u2019s mark establishes that beginning in 1927 appellee has supplied soft drink powders which have been sold in large quantities, and advertised extensively under its mark \u201cKool-Aid.\u201d In the 28 years prior to the filing of appellant\u2019s application, appellee\u2019s sales of its \u201cKool-Aid\u201d product totaled more than $135 million. For the three years prior to September 30, 1956, appellee each year sold more than 580 million packages of \u201cKool-Aid\u201d soft drink powders. In the year 1955 alone such sales totaled more than 760 million packages. Dollar sales in 1953 reached nearly $16 million; in 1954 they exceeded $19 million; in 1955 they totaled almost $25 million; and in 1956 they exceeded $23 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Appellee\u2019s \u201cKool-Aid\u201d product is sold nationally and it is available to consumers through, among other outlets, a majority of America\u2019s retail grocery stores. In 1955, 96 percent of all retail chain grocery stores in the country handled appellee\u2019s product. It also was handled by 97 per cent of large independent grocery stores; by 92 per cent of medium independents; and by 87 per cent of small independents.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Appellee has expended large sums in advertising and promoting sales of its product under its \u201cKool-Aid\u201d mark by radio, television, newspapers, magazines, comic books, outdoor billboards, and store displays. Advertising expenditures for the year 1956 totaled more than $1.9 million; for 1955, $1.7 million; for 1954, $1.4 million; and for the period of 1953-1956, $5.7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The foregoing summary of the facts of record respecting appellee\u2019s large sales and extensive advertising are such as to have made appellee\u2019s trademark \u201cKool-Aid\u201d something of a household word and a distinctive symbol of opposer\u2019s goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Appellee\u2019s goods and appellant\u2019s goods are both of the same general class of preparations for making soft drinks. As is apparent from the specimen labels of record, the goods of both parties include powdered preparations for use with water in making soft drinks; both of these powders are sold in assorted flavors; and the packages of both recommend<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> using the goods for making frozen suckers.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">We agree with the statement of the examiner, \u201cHence it seems apparent that while the products of the parties may be specifically different in composition, they are nevertheless essentially similar soft drinks products susceptive of similar use; and that as such are of a nature that if marketed under the same or similar marks they might readily be assumed to emanate from a single source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">In determining the issue before us, we consider the respective marks as a whole. When so considered it is our opinion that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCool Sip\u201d is confusingly similar to appellee\u2019s mark \u201cKool-Aid.\u201d The meaning and suggestive connotation of both marks are nearly identical. This fact when coupled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>with the similarities of the marks in sound and appearance, necessarily results in evoking the same psychological reactions and mental impressions in the minds of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Appellant has argued that while the respective marks have the terms \u201cCool\u201d and \u201cKool,\u201d which admittedly look and sound alike, these terms are descriptive terms of little or no trademark significance and, as such, are so modified by the distinctive suffixes \u201cSip\u201d and \u201cAid\u201d that purchaser confusion is not likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u201cCool\u201d and \u201cKool\u201d are precisely the same in meaning and suggestion; they are identical in sound; and the slightly variant spelling of the two words does not serve to distinguish them. The words are not deemed to be descriptive of the goods sold, i. e., packaged powders for making soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The second syllables of the marks, \u201cSip\u201d and \u201cAid,\u201d are commonplace words that suggest the nature of the goods but are not features which are used alone to distinguish the goods of the parties. The marks are used in their entireties. When so used, \u201cCool Sip\u201d suggests a cool beverage. The suggestive significance of \u201cKool-Aid\u201d is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The goods appellant offers under its \u201cCool Sip\u201d mark are, as already noted, not only preparations for use in making soft drinks, as are appellee\u2019s \u201cKool-Aid\u201d goods, but they are in part sold in a form indistinguishable from appellee\u2019s goods, i. e., as multi-flavored powders packaged in envelopes for use with water in making soft drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Soft drink preparations are inexpensive products and are thus of that class of goods in which trademarks receive little or no painstaking scrutiny by purchasers. Appellee\u2019s advertising has featured its trademark \u201cKool-Aid\u201d and has included comic books, and radio and television programs. While such advertising admittedly reaches adult purchasers, much of it appears to be aimed at creating the purchaser\u2019s demand at the child level. In this connection, it strikes us as more than a mere coincidence that the goods of both parties are recommended for making \u201cfrozen suckers,\u201d a commodity particularly in demand by children.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">It is our opinion that \\he purchasers of the goods of the parties are not likely to distinguish between \u201cKool-Aid\u201d and \u201cCool Sip\u201d when used on substantially the same goods. The fact that appellant\u2019s goods are designed for sale through dietetic stores is not controlling. There is nothing to prevent it from changing its sales program nor from embarking on the same types of comic book, radio and television advertising as appellee has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Our consideration of the facts supports the conclusion that appellant\u2019s use of \u201cCool Sip\u201d on its goods will be likely to cause purchaser confusion, mistake and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Another likely source of purchaser confusion, mistake and deceit has been adequately considered by the Assistant Commissioner, whose opinion on this point we quote with approval as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aux\">\u201c * * * it seems to me that the fact that the products are likely to be sold in different sections of the same stores enhances the probability of confusion, because it is believed that persons familiar with opposer\u2019s powdered beverage base widely sold under its well-known trademark \u2018Kool-Aid\u2019 are likely, upon seeing applicant\u2019s \u2018Cool Sip\u2019 powdered beverage base in dietetic stores or dietetic sections of departments of food stores, to associate the product with opposer\u2019s and to assume that it is a dietetic product being put out by opposer. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">One who enters a field in competition with \u2022 another must do so fairly and should select as his trademark a mark which will distinguish his goods from the goods of the other. As this court had occasion to comment in Weco Products Company v. Milton Ray Company, 143 F.2d 985, 31 CCPA 1214, at page 1216, 987,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">\u201c * * * there is no such poverty in the English language or paucity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of signs, symbols, numerals, etc., as to justify one who really wishes to distinguish his product from those of all others in entering the twilight zone of a field already appropriated by another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">For the foregoing reasons we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Assistant Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, dissenting, in which KIRKPATRICK, Judge, joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In my opinion the differences in sound, appearance, and meaning of the marks \u201cCool Sip\u201d and \u201cKool-Aid,\u201d when considered in their entireties, are such that their concurrent use on the instant goods would not be likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
