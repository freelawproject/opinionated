Title 28 United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b217-17\">MARTIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">This appeal is from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board affirming the refusal of the examiner to register on the principal register for \u201cSynthetic Resins\u201d a design consisting of a cloud and a lightning flash superimposed thereupon. The application for registration was filed on October 10,1955 and alleges October 1,1917 to be the date of first use of the mark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The specimens filed with the application show that the cloud and lightning flash design are actually used in conjunction with the word \u201cSchenectady,\u201d which word appears in large letters across the central horizontal section of the lightning flash.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">The board found that the design presented for registration was always used on applicant\u2019s labels and in its advertising in association with the word mark \u201cSchenectady.\u201d It also found that certain letters and \u201cpoll\u201d evidence, about which more will be said later, were insufficient to show that the design itself had trademark significance. The board said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-20\">\u201c * * * the background material presented here for registration plus the word mark \u2018Schenectady\u2019 so blend together that they are inherently incapable of creating more than a single commercial impression, and we do not think the average customer of applicant\u2019s product will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>regard the so-called cloud and lightning background design standing alone as an unmistakable, certain and primary means of identification pointing distinctly to the commercial origin of such product. This holding is consistent with the opinion in the case just cited [E. J. Brach &amp; Sons, 1958, 256 F.2d 325, 45 CCPA 998], as well as with those in In re Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 1953, 204 F.2d 287, 40 CCPA 990; Ex parte Dole Refrigerating Co., 111 USPQ 282 (Comr., 1956); In re Swift &amp; Co., 1955, 223 F.2d 950, 42 CCPA 1048; and Marcalus Manufacturing Co. Inc. v. Watson, D.C.D.C.1957, 156 F.Supp. 161, affirmed 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 258 F.2d 151.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Also of record is appellant\u2019s prior registration, Registration No. 120,466, February 5, 1918, for \u201cvarnishes, enamels, stains, and colors in oil\u201d which embodies a cloud and lightning bolt design. That registration was renewed for 20 years on February 5, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is the position of appellant that the design is not <em>mere </em>background display. It is alleged that the board erred in failing to consider whether the design was \u201cinherently distinctive.\u201d Appellant contends that since the design itself is \u201cinherently distinctive,\u201d and identifies its goods and distinguishes them from those of others, it is registrable, none of the prohibitions of Section 2 of the Lanham Act being applicable, and that a showing of secondary meaning ,is unnecessary, since nothing more is required to secure registration of a distinctive design than is necessary to procure the registration of an arbitrary word mark. Furthermore, it is argued that there is ample evidence to prove that the design has become distinctive of appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Patent Office argues that only a single meaning is imparted by the design and word mark superimposed thereupon and that the design itself is \u201cmere background display,\u201d and is not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">It is unnecessary to pass upon the question of whether appellant's design is intrinsically distinctive since sufficient evidence has been introduced to convince us that its design, apart from the word mark \u201cSchenectady,\u201d has become distinctive of appellant\u2019s goods in commerce. Lanham Act, Sec. 2(f), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Presumably at the request of appellant, eleven of its industrial customers addressed letters to the Commissioner of Patents all of which were similar except as to the number of years of association between appellant and the responding companies. A typical letter reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201cKennecott Wire and Cable Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">Subsidiary of Kennecott Copper Corporation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">Phillipsdale (Rumford 16.)

Barney</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW0\">Vice-President\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-20\">\u201cWGB :rmb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">Ten other companies respondent to questionnaires prepared by appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>which were accompanied by letters from appellant\u2019s vice president. Those letters are exemplified by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cSchenectady Varnish Company, Inc. P. O. Box 1046 Schenectady 1, N. Y.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cJanuary 27, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cLouis Allis Co.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">427 E. Stewart Ave.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Milwaukee, Wis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">\u201cAttn: Mr. Ken A. Larson,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\">Buyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">\u201cDear Mr. Larson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-13\">\u201cWe have in process, patent [sic] application for registration of our trademark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-14\">\u201cTo substantiate our claim that this is \u2014 and has been for many years \u2014 well known throughout the trade, we have been asked to contact, at random, various accounts and request that they fill in the attached questionnaire, without prompting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-15\">\u201cIn view of our long business association with your company, may we ask your help in this matter? You may be sure your return of the enclosed executed questionnaire to us will be very much appreciated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-16\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-17\">Schenectady Varnish Co., Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-18\">Vice-President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-19\">\u201cJB Emans:j Enel. (1)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-20\">The questionnaire presented appellant\u2019s and two other designs and requested their identification. Nine chose appellant\u2019s design as the trademark with which they associated appellant\u2019s products. The tenth undoubtedly intended to do likewise but mistakenly placed its own name where appellant\u2019s was supposed to have been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">Although those twenty-one companies all have a business relationship with appellant and the form which the responses took were conceived by appellant, there is no reason for us to believe that the officers of those companies failed to tell the truth in order to help appellant prove its case. There is nothing in the record to indicate that any of the questionnaires were not returned, or if returned milk-1 tated against appellant\u2019s cause, or that any requests for answers were not responded to. We will not speculate as to these matters since it is our function to consider the record as presented. When we follow that course here we can only conclude that appellant has satisfactorily shown that its mark has acquired secondary meaning within the purview of section 2(f) of the Lanham Act. Even though the number of questionnaires and letters is not great, since there is no evidence to the contrary and the results of the survey do not seem unlikely when the design itself and the length of time it has been used by appellant are considered, we are satisfied that appellant has shown secondary meaning and as such is entitled to have its design registered upon the principal register.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-24\">We have considered our previous cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which were cited by the board and find nothing in them inconsistent with our holding here since we do not consider this device to be merely background display.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-25\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-26\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-27\">WORLEY, C. J., and KIRKPATRICK, J., concur in result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-14\">. The board appears to be correct in stating that :\u201cIt is .questionable that applicant has used the mark on synthetic resins since 1917, * * The board properly noted that \u201cif applicant ultimately prevails in this case, the Examiner of Trademarks should require a ' showing of such use, or applicant should' appropriately amend its application, before registration issues.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-21\">.
