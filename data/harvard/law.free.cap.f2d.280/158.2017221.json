Appellant is unquestionably the first user. The sole question presented for our consideration is whether \u201cEasytint\u201d so resembles \u201cEasy,\u201d as to be likely, when applied to appellee\u2019s goods, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers (Lanham Act, Section 2(d), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Appellant\u2019s touch-up enamel is designed specifically to be used in repairing blemishes in the enamel finishes of domestic appliances of its manufacture. At the time testimony was taken it was produced only in white, although it was argued by appellant that it will also be made in colors for colored appliances which are becoming more popular. Appellant\u2019s enamel is sold principally to dealers handling its household appliances. However, there is evidence that these dealers may be hardware companies where other items besides \u201cEasy\u201d appliances, such as paints, are sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">The \u201cEasytint\u201d mark is used in connection with quart and gallon containers of white and gray base paints of several different textures adapted to have colorants added to them whereby hundreds of different colors of the various textures may be produced at the retail outlet from a limited stock of the bases. \u201cEasytint\u201d is sold through paint stores, lumberyards, department stores, furniture stores, hardware stores and general stores to the general consuming public. Although appellee manufactures and sells a large variety of paint products, including some in aerosol containers, \u201cEasytint\u201d is not now marketed in aerosol cans.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">A number of third party registrations for paints, lacquers and enamels are of record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this case. Also in evidence is the \u201c1953 Trade-Mark Directory,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a portion of its 1955 supplement issued by the Trade-Mark Bureau of the National Paint, Varnish and Lacquer Association, Inc. The Directory states \u201cThe Trade-Mark Bureau has on file all trade-marks listed with it by manufacturers in the paint industry as well as all marks pertaining to the industry that are registered in the United States Patent Office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">No reference to the third party marks was made by the Assistant Commissioner in her decision. It was her opinion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cConsidering the nature of and differences in the marks, the differences in goods, the differences in trade channels, and the differences in average purchasers, it is concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion. There is no opportunity for confusion of purchasers under the circumstances of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Appellant points out that the parties\u2019 goods are of the same general class, paints, and argues that there is a substantial overlapping in the trade channels wherein those products are sold. Appellant further contends that purchasers are likely to think that \u201cEasytint\u201d paints are tinted products of its manufacture and that the addition of the descriptive word \u201ctint\u201d is insufficient to avoid likelihood of confusion. As to the third party registrations, appellant contends that they do not have the same connotation that \u201cEasytint\u201d does and that in any event there is no need to compound confusion by adding to the Principal Register another confusingly similar mark. With respect to the Trade-Mark Directory marks, appellant states that there is no indication that they have even been used as much as once.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Appellee argues that the goods of the parties are for specifically different purposes and that the trade channels in which they are sold are different, appel-lee\u2019s products being sold through various retail outlets while appellant\u2019s products, specifically designed to be used in repairing its own appliances, are sold principally through its appliance dealers. Even if the products were sold to the same stores, appellee continues, they would be sold in different departments or sections thereof since one is specifically a repair product. Appellee' states that its mark is highly suggestive and that the sole similarity between it and \u201cEasy\u201d is in the word \u201ceasy\u201d which is not arbitrary in the paint industry and consequently not entitled to extensive protection. The connotations of the two marks are said to be specifically different.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Appellant does not contend and we do not find that it has proven use of its \u201cEasy\u201d mark on paints other than those for which the mark was registered, i. e., \u201cTouch-up Enamel supplied in self-spraying containers for application to domestic laundry and other appliances.\u201d Although one of appellant\u2019s witnesses stated that a very small quantity of \u201cEasy\u201d enamel was sold in bulk, its \u201cBuyer of Finished Parts\u201d who has been in the purchasing department for over thirty years testified that he knew of no purchases of \u201cEasy\u201d touch-up enamel in other than spray or aerosol cans. This contradictory evidence is insufficient to show any extension in the use of the mark for touch-up enamels. Neither is there evidence which shows that appellant manufactures or sells any paint products other than its \u201cEasy\u201d touch-up enamel.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\u201cEasy\u201d and \u201cEasytint\u201d are broadly both paints. With respect to the manner in which the goods are sold, \u201cEasy\u201d enamel is most likely to be found with \u201cEasy\u201d appliances, for it is those with which it is designed to be used. \u201cEasy-tint\u201d would be found in the paint or hardware sections of stores. Therefore, even though the products of the parties might be sold in the same store, they would probably be sold in different sections thereof. However, since it is possible that purchasers of \u201cEasy\u201d may well be the same as those who purchase \u201cEasytint,\u201d it is necessary to consider whether likelihood of confusion or mistake within the meaning of Section 2(d) exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Before we consider the third party registrations and their effect upon this controversy, we shall turn to the \u201ceasy\u201d marks in the \u201c1953 Trade-Mark Directory.\u201d That Directory is dated August 1, 1953. While there is no evidence that the marks listed were ever used, they constitute an indication that the word \u201ceasy\u201d and its phonetic equivalents have \u201ca suggestive significance as applied to [paints] and hence would be taken primarily as describing or suggesting some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>quality of the [paints] rather than as pointing to their origin.\u201d Shoe Corp. of America v. Juvenile Shoe Corp. of America, 266 F.2d 793, 797, 46 CCPA 868. Likewise, the third party registrations which incorporate the word \u201ceasy\u201d and its audio equivalents would have this same significance. As we stated in the Shoe Corp. case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">\u201c * * * In determining whether a word or syllable has a descriptive or suggestive significance as applied to merchandise it is proper to take notice of the extent to which it has been used in trademarks by others on such merchandise. If it has been frequently so used, the inference is warranted that it is not purely arbitrary ; that it would be likely to be understood by purchasers as identifying or describing the merchandise itself, rather than the source thereof, and hence as having little or no trademark significance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Therefore, \u201cEasy\u201d being suggestive, we are of the opinion, on the record before us, that appellant is not entitled to preempt the use of this word generally and certainly not in this case just because appellee has joined \u201cEasy\u201d with a word that connotes color and is descriptive of its goods. Furthermore, although appellee\u2019s mark embodies appellant\u2019s entire mark,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when considering those marks in their entireties, as we must, in the light of the factors we have discussed, we are of the opinion that the likelihood of confusion; mistake or deception contemplated by Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">RICH, J., sat but did not participate in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">.
