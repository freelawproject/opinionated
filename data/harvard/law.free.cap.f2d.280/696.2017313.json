Tried by the District Court, a jury having been waived, appellant was found guilty on 52 counts of an indictment charging her with refusal to answer certain questions put' to her by a Senate Subcommittee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She has appealed from the judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this court, the Government has abandoned some of the counts of the indictment. It now claims that appellant was properly convicted under Count 1 of failing to answer the question \u201cDid you, or do you, know Herbert Phil-brick?\u201d at a hearing held on July 29, 1955, and under some 27 other counts for failing to answer certain questions at a hearing held on September 15, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">In convicting appellant on these counts, the trial judge found that the questions contained therein were pertinent to the subject under inquiry and that appellant \u201cwas fully apprised\u201d of that subject. It appears that the trial judge believed the Committee was investigating \u201cthe Communist movement in New England,\u201d and that he considered she was sufficiently apprised of the subject because the Committee was not obliged \u201cto proceed in the execution of its duties by a series of inquiries on precise topics embraced within the express subject matter delegated to it by the enabling resolutions.\u201d Appellant argued at trial and continues to urge that neither the subject under inquiry nor the pertinency of the questions was indisputably clear at the time of the Committee hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">The facts, briefly, are these: Appellant had on two earlier occasions, in 1953, appeared before the same Subcommittee. She was at that time advised by the Subcommittee that one Herbert Philbriek had, at a previous hearing, identified her as a member of the Communist Party. Appellant was then asked questions concerning Mr. Phil-brick and others, and refused to answer by reason of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. After the 1953 hearings, appellant was discharged from her position as a librarian in Norwood, Massachusetts, but obtained similar employment at a library maintained by a Quaker group in Pennsyl~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>vania. That group became subject to considerable pressure in the community to dismiss appellant from her position as librarian. It resisted this pressure, and was later presented with an award of $5,000 by the Fund for the Republic for the stand it had taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">After these occurrences, which aroused much public interest, appellant was called again before the Subcommittee, appearing on July 29, 1955. At this hearing, no statement was made as to the Subcommittee\u2019s purpose in calling her, or as to the subject matter of the inquiry. The questions asked were of the same general nature as those appellant had refused to answer at the 1953 hearing, together with some concerning the events of the intervening years. When asked the Count 1 question (\u201cDid you, or do you, know Herbert Philbrick?\u201d), appellant replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u201cOn this matter of acquaintances or nonaequaintances, or anything to do with Communist affiliations or nonaffiliations, I would like to tell the committee here what I have told my employers at the Plymouth Meeting Library Committee, that for many years now I have had no connection, formal, or any other way, with any organization that would be either on the Attorney General\u2019s list or would be a so-called subversive organization or left-wing organization. And I think that any other questions, including this question here would, in my opinion, and upon the advice of counsel, be beyond what I understand to be the jurisdiction of this committee and of its resolutions.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Appellant was directed to answer. She made a further objection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACk\">\u201cThe reason I feel that I cannot answer this question about Herbert Philbrick is that I think it invades constitutional rights as under the first amendment,' and I feel even more strongly that these questions; have no pertinency to the question of national security at the moment, and any relationships or nonrelation-ships are not valid points of inquiry at this time.\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The Chairman again directed her to&gt; answer, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">\u201cThe objections as to pertinency are overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-13\">\u201cWe are charged by a Senate resolution to conduct a certain type of investigation. We are doing so. I must warn you that you may be cited for contempt if you do not answer.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">Appellant persisted in her refusal to-answer the Count 1 question, and similar questions, but did answer questions not involving her association with other persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">Some two months later, on September 15, 1955, appellant again was called upon to appear before the Subcommittee. After being asked a number of routine questions, which she answered, she was. asked what her address was when she lived in Malden, Massachusetts. She replied :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-17\">\u201cI would like at this time \u2014 tell me if you can hear this \u2014 I would like at this time to say that this is the third time that I have been called to Washington, and that on this occasion, as on the other occasions, I have the same thing to say: First, that I am not a Communist; that I am not a member of the Communist Party, and that for many, many years I have had no connection, direct or indirect, with any organization on the Attorney General\u2019s list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-18\">\u201cFurther than that I have no knowledge of any matters concerning national security; I have no knowledge of any matters concerning the Internal Security Act of 1950 [50 U.S.C.A \u00a7 781 et seq.]; I have no knowledge of any matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\u25a0of subversion, sabotage, or espionage, of infiltration, of violent overthrow of the Government, of any acts concerning any foreign powers or any other illegal act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cIn view of these things and the fact that I am a private citizen employed in a private institution under the care of a religious organization, I feel that I have no information that would be within the power \u25a0or the jurisdiction of this duly organized committee to ask of me.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The presiding officer then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201cMrs. Knowles, you were called before this committee, I think, one time before. As I look back at the record I believe it was on May 21, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201cAt that time this committee was inquiring particularly into your association and affiliation with the Communist Party. We asked you at that time if you were a member of the Communist Party, and you declined to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">\u201cNow certain matters have come to the information of this committee, and we are now seeking to bring up to date our record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">\u201cWere you ever a member of the Communist Party Mrs. Knowles ? \u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Appellant declined to answer, on the basis of the objections she had previously made. Nearly three hundred other questions were asked. Again, appellant refused to answer those which probed into her associations. She answered the numerous questions which related to her work in Pennsylvania and to the award made by the Fund for the Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">At neither of the hearings here involved \u2014 that of July 29 and that of September 15 \u2014 did appellant receive any clear explanation of the Subcommittee\u2019s purpose in questioning her, let alone what was the subject of the investigation. She indicated that she believed the subject under inquiry at the July 29 hearing was \u201cnational security,\u201d and as to Count 1 \u2014 the only count remaining which relates to that hearing \u2014 her objection was based in part on its lack of pertinency \u201cto the question of national security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">Assuming, however, that the trial court could have rightly interpreted appellant\u2019s objection and her testimony as indicating awareness, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Subcommittee at its July hearings was investigating \u201cthe Communist movement in New England\u201d, surely the Government has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the per-tinency of the question was so indisputably clear that she perceived or should have perceived the likelihood of criminal prosecution. Watkins v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 178, 217, 77 S.Ct. 1173, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273. Appellant said to the Subcommittee that \u201cfor many years now I have had no connection, formal, or any other way with any organizations that would be either on the Attorney General\u2019s list or would be a so-called subversive organization or left-wing organization.\u201d Her claim was that any of. her associations with persons whose activities might interest the Subcommittee were too remote in time and too insubstantial to be pertinent to the legislative purposes which she understood the Subcommittee to be then pursuing. Cf. id. at 204. The conduct of the witness before the Subcommittee was at all times respectful, and the Government offered nothing at the trial which would tend to prove that she was not in fact seeking to be enlightened on the per-tinency of the question in Count 1. Absent any such proof, the witness was entitled to an explanation which would serve to disabuse her of any mistaken notions about subject matter and per-tinency. The Subcommittee did not offer such explanation. Cf. id. at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">At the subsequent hearing on September 15, 1955, Mrs. Knowles suggested similar uncertainty as to subject under investigation and pertinency of the questions. As we have noted, her objections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>at the opening of the September hearing disclaimed any knowledge about \u201cnational security * * * matters concerning the Internal Security Act of 1950 * * * matters of subversion, sabotage, or espionage, of infiltration, of violent overthrow of the Government, of any acts concerning any foreign powers or any other illegal act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\">The witness may thus have revealed knowledge of the terms and breadth of the resolution under which the Subcommittee was proceeding, and perhaps that all of these matters were possible subjects of inquiry. At no stage, however, did the Subcommittee make plain to her which of these topics it was pursuing. Perhaps it was pursuing them all. But the pertinency of any particular question to any particular topic was not explained to the witness, though her objections invited explanation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Many of the questions asked of her (which she answered) related to the Fund for the Republic and are not in any obvious way within the scope of the Subcommittee\u2019s enabling resolution. The Government does not argue that they were. They were not, of course, the subject of any of the indictment counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">At the trial, the Government did not attempt to prove that any particular topic was the subject under inquiry. On the contrary, the Government witness \u2014 Mr. Sourwine, the Committee counsel \u2014 testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cMrs. Knowles, like every other witness before the committee, was called under the committee\u2019s full authority in connection with the entire scope of the committee\u2019s power to investigate, arid she was asked, as every witness will be asked, all of the questions that the committee thought would produce information in any area of any of its inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">In this court, the Government takes the position that the subject under inquiry was \u201can investigation into Communism\u201d; \u201cthe Subcommittee\u2019s authority under S. Res. 366\u201d. But no one told this to appellant at the hearings. Her counsel informed the Subcommittee at the start of the July hearing that he had just been given a copy of the resolution, and that he had not previously had a copy or been familiar with its contents. There is little to indicate that Mrs. Knowles had any clear understanding of it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She probably had read the resolution by the time of the September hearing; her objections at that hearing may, as we have said, indicate as much. But no one related the questions asked to the resolution, or to any specific portion of it, in answer to her objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The Government has thus failed to establish the subject matter of the inquiry, much less that it was made to appear with \u201cundisputable clarity\u201d to appellant. Watkins v. United States, supra, 354 U.S. at page 214, 77 S.Ct. at page 1193; Bar-enblatt v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 109, at page 117, 79 S.Ct. 1081, at page 1088, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115. The judgment of conviction must therefore be reversed and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-16\">.
