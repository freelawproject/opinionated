The government\u2019s contention that the burden rests on the taxpayer is founded on legal analysis and legislative history; taxpayer\u2019s contention that the burden rests on the government relies primarily upon authority and on what taxpayer asserts to be good sense. We believe the considerations advanced by taxpayer to be the weightier and therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Paddock did not file income tax returns for any year from 1947 through 1951. \u25a0In March 1952, the District Director of Internal Revenue for the Northern District of New York assigned an agent to audit Paddock\u2019s income tax liability. Paddock thereupon filed returns reporting income for 1949 through 1951 in amounts which, in the light of the claimed exemptions, resulted in no tax liability. After completion of the audit, the Commissioner made a determination showing total deficiencies for tax, penalties and interest of $3,175.77 for the five years. Of this $1,386.04 consisted of penalties, and $779.37 comprised the fraud penalty. Paddock paid the sum so assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Later Paddock brought an action against the United States in the District Court for Northern New York under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a) (1) to recover the entire amount so paid. The parties stipulated the facts recited above and certain others. Among these were that the Commissioner had erroneously included $2,700 as income in 1950 and 1951; that correction for this error would reduce the total deficiency by $1,106.64 to $2,069.13, including $867.97 of penalties of which the fraud penalty was $529.84; and that the only issue remaining for determination was whether plaintiff was entitled to a refund of this latter amount. The stipulation also recited that the occupation set forth by Paddock on his returns was \u201cMinister\u201d; that he was not an ordained minister but served as pioneer-missionary for the Jehovah Witnesses, for which he received no compensation; that the sources of his income were rents and fees for services as a tax consultant; that plaintiff offered no proof to contest the total amount of his adjusted gross income as corrected but that \u201cHe does deny, however, that he has ever, failed to report any of his income deliberately with intent to avoid payment of his proper income tax.\u201d Neither the taxpayer nor the government offered any other evidence, and the question of burden of proof was thus sharply raised. The government moved for a directed verdict save with \u25a0respect to the conceded error of $1,106.-.64; plaintiff moved for a directed verdict in that amount plus the fraud penalty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>$529.84. The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion and denied the government\u2019s and subsequently denied a motion by the government for a new trial. The government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Section 1112 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, which is in \u2022Chapter 5, entitled \u201cThe Tax Court of the United States,\u201d provides that \u201cin any proceeding involving the issue whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax, the burden of proof in respect of such issue shall be upon the Commissioner.\u201d This provision first came into the law in the Revenue Act of 1928, e. 852, \u00a7 601, 45 Stat. 791, discussed below. Because of its inclusion in Chapter 5 and its reference to \u201cthe Commissioner,\u201d \u00a7 1112 does not literally apply to refund suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The government supports its argument that a taxpayer maintaining such a suit to recover a fraud penalty has the burden of showing the absence of fraud, by an impressive legal analysis: A suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) to recover taxes alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected \u201cis the lineal successor of the common count in <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money had and received,\u201d Stone v. White, 1937, 301 U.S. 532, 534, 57 S.Ct. 851, 852, 81 L.Ed. 1265. In such an action \u201cThe claimant, to prevail, must show that the money was received in such circumstances that the possessor will give offense to equity and good conscience if permitted to retain it. * * * The question no longer is whether the law would put him in possession of the money if the transaction were a new one. The question is whether the law will take it out of his possession after he has been able to collect it.\u201d Atlantic Coast Line R. R. v. Florida, 1935, 295 U.S. 301, 309-310, 55 S.Ct. 713, 716, 79 L.Ed. 1451. Since the government will not be unjustly enriched through retention of the penalty if the taxpayer has in fact been guilty of fraud, a court should not order the government to restore this money unless the taxpayer carries the burden of persuading the court of his freedom from fraud. In addition to these considerations peculiarly applicable to the action for money had and received, the government says the general rule is that the plaintiff has the burden of proof with respect to all elements of his claim, citing Johnson v. Johnson, 1948, 229 N.C. 541, 50 S.E.2d 569, 572, and other authorities. The only exception is where \u201call the proof on the subject is within the control of the defendant who, if the negative is not true, can disprove it at once,\u201d Great Western R. R. v. Bacon, 1863, 30 Ill. 347, 352 cited with approval in United States v. Denver &amp; Rio Grande R. R., 1903, 191 U.S. 84, 92, 24 S.Ct. 33, 48 L.Ed. 106. Since the issue with respect to the fraud penalty concerns the taxpayer\u2019s own acts and mental state, the case falls within the rule rather than the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The government argues that the history of the statute placing the burden of proof as regards the fraud penalty upon the Commissioner in proceedings in the Tax Court confirms the government\u2019s position that the burden of proof in a refund suit is upon the taxpayer. The Board of Tax Appeals, the predecessor of the Tax Court, was created by \u00a7 900 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 336.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A new \u00a7 907 (a) added to that Act by \u00a7 1000 of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 107, 26 U.S.C.A.Int. Rev.Acts, page 307, provided that the proceedings of the Board \u201cshall be conducted in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure (other than rules of evidence) as the Board may prescribe and in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in courts of equity of the District of Columbia.\u201d The Board prescribed a general rule of practice that \u201cThe burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except that in respect of any new matter of fact pleaded in his answer, it shall be upon the respondent,\u201d and applied this to the fraud penalty, e. g., Budd v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1930, 43 F.2d 509; S. W. Parish, 1928, 9 B.T.A. 1236, 1241. By \u00a7 601 of the Revenue Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 872, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 455, Congress reversed this <em>in futuro </em>by adding a new sentence to \u00a7 907(a) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"apv-dedup-0\">\u201cIn any proceeding involving the issue whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax, where no hearing has been held before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1928, the burden of proof in respect of such issue shall be upon the Commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The Senate Committee report, Sen.Rep. No. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 38, explained this amendment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\"><em>\u201cBurden of proof in fraud </em>cases.\u2014 In all proceedings before the Board of Tax Appeals under the present law it is provided that the burden of proof shall be borne by petitioners. This is true even though the Commissioner in his deficiency letter raises the issue that the petitioner has been guilty of fraud. Proceedings before the Board involving that issue in some respects resemble penal suits. The committee feels that the Commissioner should be placed in the position of party plaintiff and compelled to carry the burden of proving fraud whenever it is an issue in the case. As to all other issues, however, the burden of proof remains on the petitioners, except to the extent provided in section 602.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In cases where the hearing had been held prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1928, the Board continued to state that the burden was upon the petitioner to show the returns were not false and fraudulent. Desmond\u2019s, Inc., 1929, 15 B.T.A. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">The lesson which the government would have us draw from this is that the Board\u2019s placing the burden upon the petitioner in a fraud case must have been based upon a belief that this would have been the rule of evidence applicable in courts of equity in the District of Columbia or, presumably, elsewhere, and that the 1928 amendment sanctioned that view by changing the rule solely in proceedings in the Board and there only when the hearing was held after its enactment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, an equally plausible inference is that Congress thought the Board had erred in using the power conferred by \u00a7 907 so as to place the burden on the taxpayer, as Budd v. Commissioner, supra, later held; that Congress limited \u00a7 907(a) to proceedings before the Board because that \u201cwas the mischief and defect\u201d which it \u201chath resolved and appointed to cure,\u201d Haydon\u2019s Case, 3 Coke 7a, 76 Eng.Rep. 637 (1584); and that Congress limited its explicit direction to post-enactment hearings for reasons of administrative convenience, leaving those few taxpayers who had grievances as a result of earlier errors to seek relief in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Taxpayer opposes the government\u2019s argument with the monolithic authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>seven courts of appeals. Budd v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1930, 43 F.2d 509; Jemison v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 4; Griffiths v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 1931, 50 F.2d 782; Duffin v. Lucas, 6 Cir., 55 F.2d 786, certiorari denied 1932, 287 U.S. 611, 53 S.Ct. 14, 77 L.Ed. 531; Ohlinger v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 219 F.2d 310; Hargis v. Godwin, 8 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 486; Carter v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 930; and United States v. Thompson, 10 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 165, as well as a number of district courts. The Budd case [43 F.2d 512] held that the pre-1928 rule of the Board of Tax Appeals placing the burden of proof upon the taxpayer even in fraud cases ran counter to \u201cthe general rule of evidence * * * that he who alleges fraud must prove it\u201d and thus \u201cwas made without authority and is contrary to law,\u201d and that the 1928 act corrected this unlawful assertion of power and was \u201csimply declaratory of what the law was.\u201d The government criticizes this decision, claiming that there was nothing to show that the procedure established by the Board was unlawful and that if Congress had deemed it so, Congress would hardly have limited the amendment to cases in which hearings had not been held when the 1928 act became effective; we have discussed this argument above. Jemison v. Commissioner, likewise dealing with a case heard before the Board of Tax Appeals prior to enactment of the 1928 Act held the burden of proof of fraud to rest upon the Commissioner; it did this on the basis of general principles with respect to assertions of fraud, without considering the 1928 statute and in reliance on F. Vitelli &amp; Son v. United States, 1919, 250 U.S. 355, 39 S.Ct. 544, 63 L.Ed. 1028, which the government seeks to distinguish on the basis that a contrary ruling on burden of proof in that case would have rendered meaningless the one-year limitation upon the conclusiveness of the payment of duties \u201cin the absence of fraud\u201d in \u00a7 21 of the Act of June 22, 1874, 18 Stat. 186, 190. Grif-fiths v. Commissioner, again dealing with a fraud case heard by the Board of Tax Appeals before the effective date of the 1928 act, held the burden on the Commissioner on the authority of Jemison, without discussing the language of the amendment. Duffin v. Lucas, the first of these cases dealing with a refund suit, made no reference to the 1928 act; the government seeks to distinguish it both on this basis and as predicated on views with respect to the nature of the fraud penalty rendered obsolete by Helvering v. Mitchell, 1938, 303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917. These four decisions, which the government claims to be ill-reasoned, lie at the basis of the statement in Ohlinger v. United States, like Duffin v. Lucas a refund suit, that \u201csection 1112, Title 26 U.S.C.A. is a statutory declaration of what has always been the law, not only in the Tax Court, but in the District Court as well,\u201d 219 F.2d at pages 311-312, and the still more recent decisions in Hargis v. Godwin and Carter y. Campbell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, in turn, underlay United States v. Thompson, all refund suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We see no sufficient practical basis for a difference in the rule as to burden of proof in a taxpayer\u2019s attack upon a fraud penalty by petition to the Tax Court and in a suit for refund under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a) (1). In either the taxpayer has the burden on most issues, in the Tax Court because he is attacking an administrative determination of presumed correctness and in a refund suit because he must show it would be inequitable for the government to retain monies that he has paid. If this general rule as to burden of proof is subject to an exception when the issue relates to fraud, as Congress has directed it to be in the Tax Court for the past 32 years, why should it not be in a refund suit? The government answers that a petition in the Tax Court must be filed within 90 days after the notice of deficiency, Internal Revenue Code of 1939, \u00a7 272(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 272(a), when the Commissioner may be expected still to have his evidence available, where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>as a taxpayer may wait two years before filing a refund claim and two years after disallowance before filing a refund suit, \u00a7\u00a7 322(b) (1), 3772(a). If there must be a difference in burden of proof as between the two types of proceeding, this would be persuasive that the easier rule on the taxpayer should apply in the Tax Court and the harder one in a refund suit; but it is scarcely enough to show that Congress intended different rules to apply. Whether the decisions against the government are put on the basis that the Board of Tax Appeals had erred in its initial view that equity would place the burden of disproving fraud upon the taxpayer or on the ground that when Congress established a statutory rule in 1928, it expressed \u201ca change in the policy of the law\u201d although using words referring only to \u201cthe specific cases most likely to occur to the mind,\u201d Johnson v. United States, 1 Cir., 1908, 163 F. 30, 32, we think they have reached the right result. It should not be hard to secure legislative correction of the alleged judicial error if the courts have in fact misread the Congressional purpose and the consequences to the revenue are as serious as the government says.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\"> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">. The government also relies, although much less heavily, on \u00a7 7422(e) of the 1954 Code, 26 \u00dc.S.O. \u00a7 7422 dealing with cases where a taxpayer who has brought a refund suit in the district court receives a deficiency notice as to the tax which is the subject matter of the suit. He may then file a petition for re-examination with the Tax Court whereupon the district court loses jurisdiction to the extent that the Tax Court acquires it; or he may choose to proceed with the refund suit, in which event the government may counterclaim or intervene in the district court. If the government does this, \u00a7 7422(e) provides that \u201cthe taxpayer' shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issues raised by such counterclaim or intervention of the United States except as to the issue of whether the taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax.\u201d Standing alone this statute would be quite as consistent with the taxpayer\u2019s contention that the burden of proof with respect to fraud in a refund suit is normally with the government as with the government\u2019s contrary contention. The government notes the statement in the House Committee report that the purpose of the insertion was to bring it about that \u201cupon such counterclaim or intervention the taxpayer will have the same burden of proof as he would bear as if he had appealed the case to the Tax Court,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1337, 83rd Cong. 2d Sess. p. A 481; we do not find the inference from this particularly compelling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. The government disputes the accuracy of the statement in Carter v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 264 F.2d at page 938, that \u201cthe Government does not question that the same burden is on it in either forum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
