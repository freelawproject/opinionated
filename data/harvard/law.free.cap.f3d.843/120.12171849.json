The \u2018 United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Loma G. Schofield, <em>J.) </em>held that the dollar amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d section of the certificates unambiguously caps the amount that Global can be obligated to pay Century for both \u201closses\u201d and \u201cexpenses\u201d combined. Century contends that Global is obligated to pay expenses in addition to the amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision and that, at a minimum, the district court erred in concluding that the certificates were unambiguous. Because this case presents an important question of New York law that the New York Court of Appeals has never directly addressed, we certify to the New York Court of Appeals the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">Does the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Excess Insurance Co. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co., </em>3 N.Y.3d 577 [789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768] (2004), impose either a rule of construction, or a strong presumption, that a per occurrence liability cap in a reinsurance contract limits the total reinsurance available under the contract to the amount of the cap regardless of whether the underlying policy is understood to cover expenses such as, for instance, defense costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Between 1971 and 1980, Century issued nine reinsurance certificates with Global.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certificates provided that Global would reinsure specified portions of general liability insurance policies that Century had issued to Caterpillar .Tractor Company. In such an arrangement, Century is known as the \u201cceding insurer\u201d because it is \u201cceding\u201d or spreading its risk of loss among one or more reinsurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Beginning in 1988, thousands of lawsuits were filed against Caterpillar alleging bodily injury resulting from exposure to asbestos. A coverage dispute then arose between Century-and Caterpillar, and both companies filed suit in Illinois seeking declaratory judgments concerning their obligations under the insurance policies. As a result of the Illinois litigation, Century became obligated to reimburse Caterpillar for defense expenses in addition to the indemnity limits of the policies. Global alleges that Century has already paid more than $60 million to Caterpillar and has agreed to pay an additional $30.5 million. Global further alleges that only about 10% of this amount represents what Century refers to as \u201closs,\u201d whereas about 90% represents what Century refers to as \u201cexpenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Century then sought reimbursement from Global for portions of its payments to Caterpillar pursuant to\u2018'the reinsurance certificates. One of those certificates, which the parties call \u201cCertificate X,\u201d provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">[Global] [d]oes hereby reinsure [Century] in respect of [Century\u2019s liability insurance policy with Caterpillar] and in consideration of the payment of the premium and subject to the terms, conditions, and amount of liability set forth herein, as follows: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Item 1 \u2014 Type of Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6e\">Blanket General Liability, excluding Automobile Liability as original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Item 2 \u2014 Policy Limits and Application</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdG\">$1,000,000. each occurrence as original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Item 3 \u2014 [Century] Retention</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZg\">The first $500,000. of liability as shown in Item #2 above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">Item 4 \u2014 Reinsurance Accepted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS5\">$250,000. part of $500,000. eaclf occurrence as original excess of [Century\u2019s] retention as shown in Item #3 above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Item 5 \u2014 Basis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGR\">Excess of Loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">App\u2019x at 88.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The certificate goes on to state that \u201cthe liability of [Global] specified in Item 4 above shall follow that of [Century] and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be subject in all respects to all the terms and conditions of [the underlying liability insurance policy].\u201d App\u2019x at 89. The certificate also provides that \u201c[a]ll claims involving this reinsurance, when settled by [Century], shall be binding on [Global], who shall be bound to pay its proportion of such settlements, and in addition thereto, in the ratio that [Global\u2019s] loss payment bears to [Century\u2019s] gross loss payments, [Global\u2019s] proportion of expenses ... incurred by [Century] in the investigation and settlement of claims or suits.\u201d App\u2019x at 89. Though not all of the certificates are in the record before us, the parties suggest that other eight certificates are materially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In Global\u2019s'view, the amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d section caps the maximum amount that it can be obligated to pay for both loss and expenses combined. Thus, Global contends that the maximum amount that it can be required to pay under Certificate X is $250,000. Century contends that the amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision applies' only to \u201closs\u201d and that Global must pay all expenses that exceed that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">In the district court, Global moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that its interpretation of the certificates was correct. The district court granted Global\u2019s motion and held that- the certificates unambiguously capped Global\u2019s liability for both losses and expenses. <em>See Glob. Reins. Corp. of Am. v. Century Indem. Co., </em>No. 13 Civ. 06577, 2014 WL 4054260, at *4-7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2014), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>2015 WL 1782206 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2015). In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied primarily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bellefonte Reinsurance Co. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>903 F.2d 910 (2d Cir. 1990), which considered a similar reinsurance certificate. The <em>Bellefonte </em>court affirmed a judgment declaring that the reinsurers \u201cwere not obligated to pay ... any additional sums for defense costs over and above the limits on liability stated in the reinsurance certificates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910. The district court also relied on this- Court\u2019s decision in <em>Unigard Security Insurance Co., v. North River Insurance Co., 4 </em>F.3d 1049 (2d Cir. 1993), which applied <em>Belle-fonte </em>to conclude that a reinsurer was \u201cnot liable for expenses beyond the stated liability limit in the [certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1071. Century timely appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Global.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">' DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact,\u201d <em>Baldwin v. EMI Feist Catalog, Inc., </em>805 F.3d 18, 25 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In <em>Bellefonte, </em>we considered a reinsurance certificate that provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtH\">Provision 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAe\">Reinsurer does hereby reinsure Aetna (herein called the Company) in respect of the Company\u2019s contract hereinafter described, in consideration of the payment of the premium and subject to the terms, conditions and amount of liability set forth herein, as follows[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Provision 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Reinsurance Accepted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">$500,000 part of $5,000,000 excess of $10,000,000 excess of underlying limits[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">Provision 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">The Company warrants to retain for its own account the amount of liability specified above, and the liability of the Rein-surer specified above [i.e., amount of reinsurance accepted] shall follow that of the Company,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">Provision 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">All claims involving this reinsurance, when settled by the Company, shall be binding on the Reinsurer, which shall be bound'to pay its proportion of such settlements, and in addition thereto, in the ratio that the Reinsurer\u2019s loss payment bears to the Company\u2019s gross loss payment, its proportion of expenses .incurred by the Company in the investigation and settlement of claims or suits[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">903 F.2d at 911 (brackets in Provision 3 in original). The district court in <em>Bellefonte </em>had held that, under this certificate, the reinsurers \u201cwere not obligated to pay Aetna, any additional sums for defense costs over and above the limits on liability stated in the reinsurance certificates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">Aetna raised two arguments on appeal. First, Aetna argued that the third provision of-the certificate contained a \u201cfollow the fortunes\u201d clause and that the \u201c \u2018follow the fortunes doctrine\u2019 of reinsurance law obligates a reinsurer to indemnify a reinsured for all of the reinsured\u2019s defense expenses and costs, even when those expenses and costs bring the total amount to more than the explicit limitation on liability contained in ... [the] reinsurance certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, Aetna argued that the phrase \u201cin addition thereto\u201d in the fourth provision of the certificate \u201cindicates that liability for defense costs is separate from liability for the underlying losses sustained by [the insured].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913,</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">. We rejected both of Aetna\u2019s arguments. First, we held that \u201callowing the \u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clause to override the limitation on liability ... would strip the limitation clause and other conditions of all meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201c\u2018follow the fortunes\u2019 clauses in .the certificates,\u201d we reasoned, \u201care structured so that they coexist with, rather than supplant, the liability cap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo construe .the certificates otherwise,\u201d we held, \u201cwould effectively eliminate the limitation on the reinsurers\u2019 liability to the stated amounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Second, we rejected Aetna\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cin addition thereto\u201d in the fourth provision of the certificate indicated that liability for defense costs was separate from liability for the underlying losses sustained by the insured. We read the phrase \u201cin addition to\u201d \u201cmerely to differentiate the obligations for losses and for expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, noting that-Provision 1 of the contract explicitly made reinsurance under the certificate \u201csubject to the amount of liability set forth therein,\u201d we held that the \u201cin addition to\u201d language \u201cin no way exempts defense costs from the overall monetary limitation in the certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">These were the only two; arguments that were addressed in <em>Bellefonte. </em>Significantly, although we described the amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision as an \u201cexplicit limitation on liability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 912, we never explained why this was so.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In <em>Unigard, </em>we again confronted the issue of a reinsurer\u2019s liability for expenses. <em>See </em>4 F.3d at 1070-71. There, the ceding insurer, North River, raised two arguments as to why the reinsurer, Unigard, was required to pay expenses that exceeded the \u201climits\u201d of liability of the certificate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>First, North River noted that the certificate at issue contained a \u201cfollow the form\u201d clause that was not considered in <em>Bellefonte </em>and argued that this clause required Unigard to pay expenses in excess of the policy limit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1070. Second, North River argued that \u201cpast practices\u201d demonstrated that Unigard \u201cexpected to pay expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">As in <em>Bellefonte, </em>we again rejected the ceding insurer\u2019s arguments. Regarding the argument based on the \u201cfollow the form\u201d clause, we noted that the clause stated that the liability of the reinsurers would be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying policy \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by th[e] [certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1070 (emphasis omitted). We held that the certificate \u201cotherwise provide[d] for the policy limits\u201d because another provision of. the certificate, \u201clike the certificate in <em>Bellefonte, </em>provide[d] that Unigard agreed tq reinsure North River \u2018in consideration of the payment of the reinsurance premium and subject to the terms, conditions, <em>limits of liability, </em>and [certificate provisions set forth herein.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1071 (citation omitted). We noted that <em>Bellefonte </em>stated that \u201cthe limitation on liability provision capped the reinsurers\u2019 liability under the [certificate\u201d and that \u201c[a]U other contractual language must be construed in light of that cap.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1071 (quoting <em>Bellefonte, </em>903 F.2d at 914). We also rejected as irrelevant Unigard\u2019s expectations or past practices, holding that \u201cBellefonte\u2019s gloss upon the written agreement is conclusive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">As noted, the district court in this case held that, under <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard, </em>Global\u2019s \u201ctotal liability for both loss and expenses is capped at the dollar amount stated in the \u2018Reinsurance Accepted\u2019 section of each [c]ertificate.\u201d <em>Global, </em>2014 WL 4054260, at *5. The court concluded that the relevant language in the certificates at issue in this case was \u201cnearly identical to the language\u201d in <em>Bellefonte. Id. </em>The court rejected Century\u2019s argument that <em>Belle</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>fonte </em>was distinguishable on the ground that, here, the insurer on the underlying policies pay expenses above and beyond limits for loss, noting that, in <em>Unigard, </em>this court \"followed the reasoning of <em>Bellefonte </em>when dealing with underlying, policies that pay expenses above and beyond the limits for loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Century now argues, with the support of four large reinsurance brokers, that <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>were wrongly decided. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13, 20; Brief for Aon Benfield U.S.; Guy Carpenter <em>&amp; </em>Co., LLC; JLT Re (N. Am.) Inc.; and Willis Re Inc. as Amicus Curiae Supporting Appellant at 15-17 (hereinafter \u201cBrief for Reinsurance Brokers\u201d) (noting <em>that'\u201cBellefonte </em>and its progeny have been roundly criticized in the insurance industry\u201d). Their argument is not without force. In particular, we find it difficult to understand the <em>Bellefonte </em>court\u2019s conclusion that the reinsurance certificate in that case <em>unambiguously </em>capped the reinsurer\u2019s liability for both loss and expenses. Looking only to the language of the certificate, we think it is not entirely clear what exactly the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision in <em>Bellefonte </em>meant. Evidence of industry custom and practice might have shed light on this question, but the <em>Bellefonte </em>court did not consider any such evidence in its decision, although it is unclear if any was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The purpose of reinsurance is to enable the reinsured to \u201cspread its risk of loss among one or more reinsurers.\u201d <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>96 N.Y.2d 583, 587, 734 N.Y.S.2d 531, 760 N.E.2d 319 (2001). If the amount stated in the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision is an absolute cap on the reinsurer\u2019s liability for both loss and exp\u00e9nse, then Century\u2019s payments of defense costs could be entirely unrein-sured. This seems to be in tension with the purpose of reinsurance. Further, Century and amici note that the premium Global received was \u201ccommensurate with its share of policy risk.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10; see <em>also </em>Brief for Reinsurance Brokers at 8. Thus, under Certificate X, Global \u201creceived 50% of .the net (risk) premium\u201d because it \u201creinsured a 50% part of the [underlying policy] risk,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br, at 10 (internal quotation marks-omitted). Interpreting the \u201cReinsurance Accepted\u201d provision as a cap for both losses and expenses, as we did in <em>Bellefonte, </em>could permit Global to receive 50% of the premium while taking on less than 50% of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Amici warn that continuing to follow <em>Bellefonte </em>could have \u201cdisastrous economic consequences\u201d for the insurance industry. Brief for Reinsurance Brokers at 16. They contend that \u201cpotentially massive exposures to insurance companies throughout the industry would be unexpectedly unreinsured[,]\u201d thereby, in amici\u2019s view, \u201ccreate a gaping hole in reinsurance for many companies, and potentially threaten some with insolvency.\u201d Brief for Reinsurance Brokers at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We find these arguments worthy of reflection. But there are other considerations as well. For example, the principle of stare decisis counsels against overruling a precedent of this Court, especially in cases involving contract rights, where \u201cconsiderations favoring stare decisis are at their acme.\u201d <em>Kimble v. Marvel Entm\u2019t, LLC, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2401, 2410, 192 L.Ed.2d 463 (2015) (italics and internal quotation marks omitted). H\u00e9re, reinsurers may have relied on this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>in estimating their exposure and in setting appropriate loss reserves. If the interpretive rule set out in those opinions were to shift, such reinsur-ers would be exposed to unexpected claims beyond their current reserves. Granted, the ceding insurers who are now being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>required to cover defense costs they apparently never contemplated at the time the policies were issued may currently be experiencing the same shift in expectations, Nonetheless, the economic impact of a reversal of the <em>Bellefonte-Unigard </em>rule may counsel in favor of retaining the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Ultimately, as we noted in <em>Unigard, </em>\u201c[t]he efficiency of the reinsurance industry would not be enhanced by giving different meanings to identical standard provisions depending upon idiosyncratic factors in particular lawsuits.\u201d 4 F.3d at 1071, Our intention, therefore, is to seek the New York Court of Appeals as to whether a consistent rule of construction specifically applicable to reinsurance contracts exists; we express no view as to whether such a rule is advisable or what that rule should be. The interpretation of the certificates at issue here is a question of New York law that the New York Court of Appeals has a greater interest and greater expertise in deciding than do we, Accordingly, we conclude that it is prudent to seek the views of the New York Court of Appeals on this important question.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We may certify a question to the New York Court of Appeals where \u201cdeterminative questions of New York law are involved .., for which no controlling precedent of the Court of Appeals exists.\u201d <em>See </em>N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. Tit, 22, \u00a7 500.27(a), Global contends that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Excess Insurance Co. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co., </em>3 N.Y.3d 577, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768 (2004) controls this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In <em>Excess, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether a reinsurer was obligated to pay expenses that exceeded the limit provided for in the reinsurance policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 579, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768. In <em>Excess, </em>however, the parties agreed that the reinsurance policy contained a liability cap. See <em>id. </em>at 582, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768 (\u201c[T]here is no dispute that the reinsurance agreements set the policy limit at $7 million per occurrence\u201d). Having assumed that a such a cap existed, the Court of Appeals then followed <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigmd </em>to hold that subordinate clauses could not expand reinsurer liability \u201cbeyond the stated limit in the policy\u201d because doing so-would \u201crender meaningless the liability cap negotiated in the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768. The <em>Excess </em>court never addressed, much less decided, the antecedent question of whether the stated limited represented an absolute coverage limit for losses and expenses combined, which is the question that is presented in this case. Moreover, in <em>Excess, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether a reinsurer was required to cover the ceding insurer\u2019s loss adjustment expenses \u2014 the costs of litigating with the insured \u2014 in excess of the policy limit, not whether \u00e1 reinsurer was required to cover the insured\u2019s own defense costs. <em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768. But whether a reinsurer is responsible to reimburse the ceding insurer for the cost of litigating with the insured over the insured\u2019s claim is a potentially different question than whether an insurer who has been held liable on the underlying policy for the expenses of\u2019 defending claims against the insured may then demand that its reinsurers share their proportional cost of the underlying coverage. Thus, <em>Excess </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Although <em>Excess </em>does not directly control this case, the decision of the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>of Appeals to expand on our holding in <em>Bellefonte </em>and <em>Unigard </em>might fairly be taken to imply a rule of construction governing the interpretation of reinsurance policies. In other words, we are uncertain whether <em>Excess </em>imposes a rule (or, potentially, creates a rebuttable presumption) that, where a reinsurance contract is subject to a per occurrence liability cap, the cap limits the total reinsurance available regardless of whether the underlying insurance policy is understood to include expenses other than losses, for instance, defense costs. If <em>Excess </em>imposes a clear rule (or a presumption) with respect to these reinsurance policies, the rule would guide our interpretation of this and substantially similar policies. If, on the other hand, the standard rules of contract interpretation apply, we would construe each reinsurance policy solely in light of its language and, to the extent helpful, specific context. Because this is ultimately a determination to be made by New York, we certify<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the following question to the New York Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">Does the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Excess Insurance Co. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co., </em>3 N.Y.3d 577 [789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768] (2004), impose either a rule of construction, or a strong presumption, that a per occurrence liability cap in a reinsurance contract limits the total reinsurance available under the contract to the amount of the cap regardless of whether the underlying policy is understood to cover expenses such as, for instance, defense costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">For the foregoing reasons and pursuant to New York Court of Appeals Rule 500.27 and Local Rule 27.2 of this Court, we certify the following question to the New York Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">Does the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Excess Insurance Co. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co., </em>3 N.Y.3d 577 [789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768] (2004), impose either a rule of construction, or a strong presumption, that a per occurrence liability cap in a reinsurance contract limits the total reinsurance available under the contract to the amount of the cap regardless of whether the underlying policy is understood to cover expenses such as, for instance, defense costs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">In certifying this question, we do not bind the Court of Appeals to the particular question stated. The Court of Appeals may modify the question as it sees f\u00edt and, should it choose, may direct the parties to address other questions it deems relevant. This panel will resume its consideration of this appeal after the disposition of this certification by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">It is hereby ORDERED that the Clerk of Court transmit to the Clerk of the New York Court of Appeals this opinion as our certificate, together with a complete set of the briefs, the appendix, and the record filed in this Court by the parties. The parties shall bear equally any fees and costs that may be imposed by the New York Court of Appeals in connection with this certification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">, The certificates were entered into by Century\u2019s predecessor in interest, the Insurance Company of North America, and Global\u2019s predecessor in interest, the Constitution Reinsur-anee Corporation. For simplicity, we use the names of the current parties in interest: Century and Global.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\">. Century suggests that later agreements modified the total dollar amounts covered by the reinsurance certificate. Such modifications do not affect the issues in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-14\">, The district court concluded that the substantive law of New York applies to this diversity action because Global is located in New York and because the certificates were issued in New York. <em>See Global, </em>2014 WL 4054260, at *3-4. Neither party challenges this conclusion on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-15\">. <em>In Bellefonte, </em>we described the \"follow the fortunes\u201d doctrine as \"meaning that the rein-surer will follow the fortunes or be placed in the position of the insurer.\u201d 903 F.2d at 912 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), .\"[T]he doctrine burdens the reinsurer with .those risks which the direct insurer bears under the direct insurer\u2019s policy covering the original insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. Again, in <em>Unigard, </em>we described the amounts stated in the certificate as \u201climits\u201d on liability, though we did not explain why this was so. <em>See </em>4 F.3d at 1070.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AuI\">. The \u201cfollow the form\u201d clause stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AduK\">The liability of Unigard shall follow that of North River and, except as otherwise provided by this [c]ertificate, shall be subject in all respects to all the terms and conditions of North River\u2019s policy except such as may purport to create a direct obligation of Uni-gard to the original insured or anyone other than North River.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00e1t 1055.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\">. The provision at issue in <em>Excess </em>was titled \"Limit,\u201d as opposed to \u201cReinsurance Accepted.\u201d 3 N.Y.3d at 580, 789 N.Y.S.2d 461, 822 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">. The parties did not request certification. However, even where the parties do not request certification, \"we are empowered to seek certification nostra sponte.\u201d <em>10 Ellicott Square Court Corp. v. Mountain Valley Indent. Co., </em>634 F.3d 112, 125 (2d Cir. 2010) (italics omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
