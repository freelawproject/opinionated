Zicarelli v. New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, 55 N.J. 249, 261 A.2d 129 (1969); United States ex rel. Catena v. Elias, 465 F.2d 765 (3d Cir. 1972). In <em>Zicwrelli; </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey, after reviewing the enabling legislation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> held that the statute created a commission with investigatory powers \u201cto the end that helpful legislation may be proposed and receive needed public support.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Furthermore, the court stressed that the SCI \u201cis in no sense an \u2018accusatory\u2019 body\u201d and is not empowered \u201cto make and publicize findings with respect to the guilt of specific individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, it was because of this essentially investigatory character of the SCI that we held in <em>Catena </em>that the statutorily prescribed procedures of the SCI, while not providing for the full panoply of procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>accorded a criminal defendant, comports with due process as that concept was interpreted in Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In view of <em>Catena, </em>which we reaffirm, we disagree with the apparent position of the district court that due process requires that any individual referred to adversely in SCI hearings must remain anonymous so long as no legislative purpose can be shown for divulging his name. As noted in <em>Catena, </em>any person who feels adversely affected by evidence submitted at a public hearing, has at minimum an absolute right under the rules of the SCI to file a personal statement for incorporation into the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, merely because evidence received by the SCI at public hearings may adversely affect certain individuals, may disclose wrongdoing or may be used in a criminal prosecution, neither alters the essentially investigatory nature of the SCI nor requires judicial imposition of anonymity of those being investigated. Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973); Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 443, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960); Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263, 295, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692 (1929); McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135, 179-180, 47 S.Ct. 319, 71 L.Ed. 580 (1927). <em>Cf. </em>Anonymous v. Baker, 360 U.S. 287, 79 5. Ct. 1157, 3 L.Ed.2d 1234 (1959); In re Groban, 352 U.S. 330, 77 S.Ct. 510, 1 L.Ed.2d 376 (1957). Nor does it offend due process for the New Jersey legislature to empower the SCI Commissioners to determine whether testimony received in executive session should be heard at a public hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Insomuch therefore as the order of the district court applies to the adverse public reference to named individuals not parties to this action, it is without basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">As to appellees, Freeman and Bass, however, we are keenly aware that in any investigation of this kind there is potential for abuse and harm to one\u2019s reputation, since the informing function of a commission presupposes the possibility of its uncovering improprieties, abuses or wrongdoing. New commissions such as the SCI would be established if there were not reason to believe that state programs have been functioning inadequately or improperly. The very purpose of the SCI is to ascertain the state of affairs in New Jersey\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation program to the end that the public and the legislature might be awakened to possible needs for reform. The resulting conflict between private rights and the public interest is precisely what confronted the Supreme Court in <em>Hannah </em>and again in Jenkins v. Mc-Keithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), where the Court, while reaffirming <em>Hannah, </em>held that when an inquiry goes beyond an investigation in aid of a valid legislative function and becomes \u201caccusatory\u201d in nature, due process requires certain procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Conceivably, a commission such as the SCI might conduct its inquiry vis-a-vis an individual or association in bad faith with the purpose of harassment and of ultimately making and pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>licizing findings with respect to the guilt of such individual in transgression of its statutory mandate and in violation of .42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In such event, a court is not without power to protect a person whose civil rights are being violated. <em>Jenkins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">On the record before us, however, it is difficult to discern the basis for the district court\u2019s order of May 14, 1973. In numerous colloquies before the bench with counsel for appellants, the district court sought in vain to be persuaded of a legislative purpose for allowing adverse public disclosures with respect to named individuals. Yet a court must first focus its inquiry on whether the SCI has transgressed its investigatory function and become accusatory<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and then shape its relief in response to what due process requires.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Although appellees have alleged several incidents from which the district court may have concluded that the inquiry had been transformed into an accusatory proceedings against appellees, no findings of fact and conclusions of law were made in support of its order as required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 65(d). Nor did either party present any testimony or evidence on this critical issue on either May 14 or May 22, when appellant\u2019s motion for a stay of the order was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">It is true that the district court, on April 9, 1973, characterized certain actions by the SCI as \u201cGestapo-like tactics\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and on May 22 alluded to \u201cwitch-hunting\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by the SCI. Moreover, the district court on May 22 very carefully and quite properly provided both parties the opportunity to adduce any evidence in their support.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Though neither party availed themselves of this opportunity, we nevertheless cannot justify continuance of the order without a more sufficient record<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to support a showing of irreparable harm and probability of success and without the clarity afforded by specific findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the order of the district court of May 14, 1973 will be vacated, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Insofar as paragraphs 4 and 5 are concerned, the appeal is moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. The order of the district court provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">1. That there being no legislative purpose served in divulging the name of Freeman-Bass in public hearings, the law firm of Freeman &amp; Bass shall not be mentioned either directly or indirectly in the public hearings presently being conducted by defendants ; and it is Further Ordered</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">2.

That two weeks notice shall be given to the firm of Freeman &amp; Bass in the event that they are to be mentioned in any public report; and it is Further Ordered</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">4.
