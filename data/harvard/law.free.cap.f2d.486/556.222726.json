Jameson, United States District Judge for the District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b632-22\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b632-23\">This diversity case presents the question: Which statute of limitations applies to the liability of a surety to a third party for the tortious act of its principal? Is it the statute applying to the tort of the principal, or is it the statute applying to the surety\u2019s contract with the principal? We hold it to be the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-24\">Oregon securities laws, ORS \u00a7 59.005, et seq., require dealers in securities to secure an indemnity agreement or \u201cblue-sky bond\u201d in form satisfactory to the Commissioner of Corporations. Pacific Industrial Underwriters (\u201cPrincipal\u201d), secured one from appellee. The bond covered both statutory securities fraud as defined by Oregon securities law and common-law fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>brought suit in state court against Principal charging fraud. One count was for securities fraud, which, by Oregon securities law, has a three-year statute of limitations applicable to recovery against either a principal or a surety. A second count was for common-law fraud which, under Oregon law, has a two-year statute of limitations. Appellant secured judgment against Principal on both counts and demanded payment from appellee. Appellee brought this suit in interpleader to determine its liability on its bond. By the time of suit the three-year statute of limitations had run on the statutory securities fraud and it is conceded that appellee\u2019s liability as surety for the statutory securities fraud of Principal was barred. The question remains as to liability for Principal\u2019s common-law fraud. The District Court held recovery barred by Oregon\u2019s two-year statute. Appellant contends that Oregon\u2019s six-year statute, applicable to contract liability (which had not run), should apply. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">. It is the contract that the bond constitutes that is the source of appellee\u2019s liability. Its contract obligation is to respond when liability of the principal is duly established. It makes little sense to hold that the surety\u2019s obligation for a principal\u2019s tort is barfed by the statute applicable to the principal\u2019s liability when that liability has already been reduced to judgment and continues to exist. The authorities on which appellant relies are distinguishable. In each of those cases the statute had run on the principal\u2019s obligation and precluded the securing of judgment against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under these circumstances the surety\u2019s freedom from liability is due not to the running of the statute against the surety\u2019s obligation but to the fact that with the principal free from liability, the obligation of the surety was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Reversed and remanded for vacating of judgment and further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-16\">.
