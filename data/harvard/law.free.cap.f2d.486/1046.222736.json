Allen, United States District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1123-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">This is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment affirming the Secretary\u2019s denial of a claim for disabled widow\u2019s insurance benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e). This provision authorizes the award of benefits to a widow of a fully insured individual if she is unmarried and has attained age 50, but has not attained age 60, and is under a disability, as defined in \u00a7 423(d) of the Social Security Act. Benefits may be awarded within a period beginning with the month of the death of the wage earner and concluding with the close of the 84th month following the month when the period began.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">Disability for this purpose is defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary as a level of physical or mental impairment sufficient to preclude engaging in any gainful activity, and the Secretary has adopted regulations listing impairments preclusive of any gainful activity. The regulations also permit the award of benefits for an impairment that is the equivalent in severity and duration of a listed impairment. Social Security Administration Regulations, Chapter III, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">Although it is apparent to us, as it was to the district court, that appellant experiences substantial physical impairment, nevertheless, the record affords substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions of the Secretary, affirmed by the district court, that appellant\u2019s impairment is not of a severity that meets or equals any described in the listing of impairments in the applicable regulations. The findings of the Secretary are made conclusive as to any fact if supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Rose v. Cohen, 406 F.2d 753 (6th Cir. 1969). Accordingly, noting that the period during which appellant may establish that she is under a disability as defined in the statute extends through June 30, 1974, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
