We further hold that plaintiff\u2019s arguments gain no greater credence by casting the dispute in terms of a breach of an implied-in-fact contract (counts II and III). Thus, our legal conclusions in favor of the Government under Wunderlich review equally dispose of plaintiff\u2019s breach claims. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts 1, II and III should be granted, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Having so concluded, it is unnecessary for the court to discuss plaintiff\u2019s fifth amendment argument (counts IV and V). Only if the contract had been held unenforceable or the reprocurement erroneous would plaintiff possibly have had an argument that its performance under such conditions resulted in a taking without just compensation. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts IV and V should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">FEC responded to an Air Force Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production and delivery of five types of mobile generator sets of varying sizes and capacities. The RFP called for an indefinite quantity contract with a minimum of 453 and a maximum of 3600 generators to be ordered within a 12-month period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 17, 1965, the contract (AF 04(606)-15369) was approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary of the Air Force. Thereafter, on December 20, 1965, the Air Force mailed an official acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s proposal and at the same time issued the first delivery order for the minimum quantity. On January 11, 1966, the Air Force issued a second delivery order for an additional six generators. Subsequent to receipt of the first two orders, plaintiff realized that^ it had made some substantial errors in its response to the RFP which were resulting in unanticipated losses. Plaintiff had anticipated a small loss on the contract, but not to the extent that became apparent once production began. After meeting with the appropriate Air Force officials, plaintiff notified the Government by letter dated March 29, 1966 that it considered the contract unenforceable with respect to all future unordered goods. The contractor further asserted that its offer to supply the Government up to 3600 generators constituted a revocable offer by plaintiff for those units not yet ordered by the Government. In accordance with this position the contractor advised the Government as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-18\">1. Federal Electric Corporation hereby withdraws its offer to supply the unordered generators under Contract AF 04(606)-15369 at the prices quoted in the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-19\">2. Notwithstanding the above, should the Government <em>deem </em>that the offer of Federal Electric Corporation, as contained in Contract AF 04(606)-15369, is irrevocable and, as a result thereof determines to place additional orders for generators, then Federal Electric Corporation will promptly pro-' ceed to manufacture the unit so ordered under protest and without prejudice to its rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-20\">3. Should, as a result of subsequent actions by FEC and/or the Government, it be determined that FEC\u2019s position is correct, as defined above, an equitable adjustment shall be made in accordance with the \u201cChanges\u201d and/or \u201cExtras\u201d clauses of the aforementioned contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-21\">4. Production under future orders for additional generators will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>deemed as a waiver of FEC\u2019s rights to recover the losses it experiences in supplying the generators because of mistakes made by FEC in bidding contract AF 04(606) \u2014 15369.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-4\">5. FEC further asserts that its actions herein are taken solely for the purpose of protecting FEC\u2019s legal rights and that nothing herein should be deemed in any manner whatsoever as a refusal to perform pending resolution of the dispute or disputes between the parties hereto or in any way serve as grounds for terminating the contractor\u2019s right to proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">Subsequent to FEC\u2019s letter of March 29, 1966, the Air Force issued the following orders:</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">\n<em>Order number Date Quantity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">3 March 30, 1966 292</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">4 April 15, 1966 662</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">5 May 10, 1966 .................... 8</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">6 June 13, 1966 101</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">7 June 14, 1966 199</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">8 August 17, 1966 .................. 43</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-14\">9 November 7, 1966 ................. 443</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-15\">10 December 9, 1966 ................. 426</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-16\">Plaintiff objected to receipt of each of these and, with the exception of orders number 9 and 10, individual appeals were taken from adverse decisions of the contracting officer regarding plaintiff\u2019s obligation to deliver the items.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, plaintiff objected to orders four and six on the separate basis that they had been expressly made to cover generators ordered but never delivered under a different contract with the Bogue Electric Company (Bogue) and, therefore, intended to mitigate that defaulting contractor\u2019s damages. Throughout this period, plaintiff adhered to its position, as outlined in the March 29, 1966 letter, that it would continue to perform, but under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-20\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeals from the decisions of the contracting officer were consolidated before the Board. The Board decided for the Government, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-21\">(1) That the FEC contract came into effect on December 20, 1965, simultaneously with defendant\u2019s placing of the minimum order and, hence, was enforceable <em>ab initio. </em>Plaintiff was thus bound to supply all orders placed under the contract at the prices set forth therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-22\">(2) The contracting officer was entitled to issue orders under the subject contract to accomplish the reprocurement for the account of Bogue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-23\">We will deal with these two issues separately in the sections which follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-24\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-25\">\n<em>Enforceability of the Indefinite Quantity Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-26\">In deciding for the Government with regard to the enforceability of the FEC contract, we depart from the Board\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-27\">An indefinite quantity contract provides for the furnishing of an undetermined quantity of supplies or services during a specified period. The advantages to the Government of this type of contract are clearly set forth in the applicable Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-28\">(i) Flexibility with respect to both quantities and delivery scheduling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-29\">(ii) Supplies or services need be ordered only after actual needs have materialized ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-30\">(iii) The obligation of the Government is limited; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-31\">(iv) It permits stocks to be maintained at minimum levels and allows direct shipment to the user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.409(c)(2) (1965). In order to avoid an attack upon this type of contract for lack of mutuality of obligation <em>(i. e., </em>one party to the contract being obligated to perform while the other is not<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>), the contract must obligate the Government to order a stated minimum quantity. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.409-3(a) (1972). <em>See </em>Willard, Sutherland &amp; Co. v. United States, 262 U.S. 489, 493, 43 S.Ct. 592, 67 L.Ed. 1086 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Although the instant contract did provide for a minimum order of 453 generators, the contractor contends that, since the Government did not place the minimum order until three days after the effective date of the contract, the entire contract is unenforceable <em>ab initio </em>due to lack of mutuality of obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">The Government counters that the contract was enforceable because the minimum order was incorporated in or issued contemporaneously with the execution of the contract, and that plaintiff was entitled only to compensation provided for in the contract. In the alternative, the Government contends that, if the contract was unenforceable, plaintiff is barred from seeking additional relief because plaintiff performed and an unenforceable contract is enforceable to the extent that it is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-7\">We deem it unnecessary to resolve the issue of enforceability <em>ab initio </em>since we accept the Government\u2019s alternative contention. The present case is governed by the Supreme Court decision of Willard, Sutherland &amp; Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>where the Court held that an indefinite quantity government contract, unenforceable at its inception due to a lack of mutuality of obligation, became valid and would be enforced to the extent it was performed. <em>Id. </em>at 493-494, 43 S.Ct. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">This court applied the <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>rule to hold enforceable an indefinite quantity contract to the extent that orders had been placed by the Government under it, without determining whether or not the contract was valid <em>ab initio. </em>Tennessee Soap Co. v. United States, 126 F.Supp. 439, 441, 130 Ct.Cl. 154, 158 (1954). This precedent squarely governs the situation at hand. The required minimum order having been satisfied, FEC\u2019s entitlement to compensation for supplying 2633 generator units, including the 2174 supplied following plaintiff\u2019s purported revocation, is governed by the terms of the subject contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">Nor is this result affected by the fact FEC continued to perform after March 29, 1966 under protest. The contractor in <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>clearly stated that it was \u201cdoing this <em>[i. e., </em>performing despite the unenforceability of the contract] under protest which can be straightened out later.\u201d The protest issue was also raised in Early &amp; Daniel Co. v. United States, 271 U.S. 140, 46 S.Ct. 457, 70 L.Ed. 874 (1926), which involved an indefinite quantity contract to deliver hay. When a dispute arose over an alleged breach by the Government, the contractor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-11\">[W]e want it distinctly understood that we are doing this under protest and are going to put the matter up to proper authorities in Washington; and if they rule in our favor, [we] want settlement at fair market price for amount we overfill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-12\">271 U.S. at 141, 46 S.Ct. at 457. This language is strikingly similar to that used in FEC\u2019s letter of March 29, 1966. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court held in <em>Early &amp; Daniel </em>that the contractor had the option of delivering or not delivering. Having chosen to deliver, even under protest, the <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>rule applied and the contractor was bound to the contract price to the extent that the contractor performed. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 46 S.Ct. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-13\">In an attempt to avoid the effect of the <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>rule, plaintiff raises two arguments which we feel are without merit. First, plaintiff contends that \u201cunder the contract\u201d the Government\u2019s actions constituted a \u201cchange\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>and that the disputes clause compelled continued performance under protest by plaintiff while pursuing an administrative adjustment. <em>See </em>Dynamics Corp. of America v. United States, 389 F.2d 424, 182 Ct.Cl. 62 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">In <em>Dynamics Corp. </em>we held that plaintiff\u2019s performance under protest in order to comply with its contract\u2019s standard disputes clause distinguished its situation from the <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>and <em>Early &amp; Daniel </em>precedents, in which disputes clauses were not present. No challenge was made, however, to the enforceability of the indefinite quantity contract in <em>Dynamics </em>Corp.; the dispute involved only performance by the contractor subsequent to the termination of the admittedly valid agreement. In the present case on the other hand, FEC seeks first to disavow the existence of the subject contract and then, by citing the <em>Dynamics Corp. </em>precedent, to take advantage of the disputes clause which is a part of that very agreement. We cannot abide this effort by the plaintiff to \u201ccome up under\u201d the same contract' it seeks to have nullified. Plaintiff \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Secondly, under its breach-of-contract theory, plaintiff contends that the <em>Willard, Sutherland </em>rule has been modified by recent cases which allow continued performance despite a pre-existing breach. <em>See, e. g., </em>Northern Helex Co. v. United States, 455 F.2d 546, 197 Ct.Cl. 118 (1972). Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Northern Helex </em>is misplaced. Although the court there allowed continued performance without prejudice after a breach had occurred, the court emphasized that it takes \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d in \u201cspecific cases\u201d to warrant such action. The special circumstances of <em>Northern Helex (i. e., </em>the processing and storing of helium, a valuable national resource, as a by-product of another chemical process) clearly distinguishes that ease from the instant one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">Though we might find persuasive the contemporary view of performance under protest as restated in section 1-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and accepted by the court under the special circumstances of the <em>Northern Helex </em>case, we hesitate to extend this view in the face of a clear, contrary rule established and affirmed, albeit a half century ago, by the Supreme Court. We are reminded in this connection of the Court\u2019s recent expression of \u201cdifficulty in comprehending how decisions by lower courts can ever undermine the authority of a decision of [the Supreme] Court.\u201d United States v. Mason, 412 U,S. 391, 93 S.Ct. 2202, 37 L.Ed.2d 22 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">In summary, we hold that the subject contract was enforceable to the extent that it was actually performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">\n<em>The Bogue Reprocurement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">Having concluded that the instant contract was enforceable to the extent that it was performed irrespective of the contractor\u2019s protests, it is necessary to discuss plaintiff\u2019s secondary contention \u2014 that the Air Force was not entitled to place orders under the contract for the account and benefit of a defaulted contractor. We find that the Board\u2019s decision for the Government was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-12\">Prior to the execution of the instant contract, the Air Force was having difficulties with Bogue, another supplier of the same generators. A contract with Bogue was terminated for default on November 19, 1965, thus necessitating a re-procurement to satisfy the requirements of that agreement. Accordingly, the Government on January 31, 1966 issued a reprocurement RFP. FEC responded to this new RFP. The bid price was substantially higher than the one which resulted in the FEC December 1965 contract, yet was still the lowest bid submit-mitted in response to the reprocurement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>RFP. Rather than issue a new contract, the Government on or about February 21, 1966 offered FEC additional consideration to permit the Government to repro-cure the Bogue units under the original FEC contract. FEC rejected this proposal. The Government then decided to utilize the existing contract to satisfy its reprocurement needs. Accordingly, the Air Force issued the fourth and sixth delivery orders under the original contract on April 15, 1966 and June 13, 1966 for 763 units which had been ordered but not delivered under the Bogue contract. Plaintiff delivered these units, as all others in question, under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-4\">FEC contends that the Government was not entitled to reprocure the Bogue requirements under the instant contract, since it was clear that a substantial loss to FEC would result from said reprocurement. The grounds for this position are first that the Board erred in interpreting 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.602-6(a) (1965), requiring that the contracting officer reprocure at \u201cas reasonable a price as practical,\u201d to mean the \u201clowest practical price.\u201d Secondly, plaintiff cites the \u201cmistake in bid\u201d cases for the proposition that its original contract was a mistake and thus could not be utilized as the basis for the reprocurement. <em>See </em>Royal Pioneer Paper Box Mfg. Co., 69-1 BCA \u00b6 7631; Octagon Process, Inc., 65-2 BCA \u00b6 5168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\"><em>We </em>deem it unnecessary to reach these difficult questions in this case because we hold that, as far as FEC was concerned, orders four and six were subject neither to reprocurement nor new-contract guidelines because they were merely additional orders under a pre-existing contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">Admittedly, it appears harsh to place the financial burden of Bogue\u2019s default upon plaintiff. Nevertheless, by the terms of the FEC contract the Government was free to order up to 3600 generators within one year, regardless of the reason why said generators were needed. As long as orders four and six did not result in the quantity limitations of the original contract being exceeded and were consistent in all other respects with the specifications of the contract, there was nothing to prohibit the Government from placing the orders under the original contract. The fact that these were reprocurement orders is relevant only to the Government\u2019s duty to mitigate damages to the defaulted contractor. In an effort to accomplish this goal, the contracting officer is not limited to specific methods of reprocurement, but rather is given broad discretion. Astro-Space Laboratories, Inc. v. United States, 470 F.2d 1003, 1017, 200 Ct.Cl. 282, 308 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">Plaintiff finally contends that the parties\u2019 negotiation for reprocurement under the FEC contract (but at a higher consideration) represented a contemporaneous interpretation by the parties that defendant was not entitled to accomplish the Bogue reprocurement under the subject contract according to its original terms, an interpretation that should be given great weight by the court. <em>See, e. g., </em>Dynamics Corp. of America v. United States, supra, 389 F.2d at 430, 182 Ct.Cl. at 73. We reject this assertion because of its speculative nature. The fact that defendant initially considered increasing plaintiff\u2019s compensation does not necessarily mean defendant felt it could not procure under the original terms of the FEC contract, especially since defendant ultimately did exactly that. Hence, we do not feel the alleged contemporaneous interpretation merits sufficient weight to rebut our decision that the procurement of 763 generators under the FEC contract was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Board\u2019s decision withstands Wunderlich review, though we reject some of the Board\u2019s reasoning in reaching this result. Because the subject contract is found enforceable to the extent performed and the Bogue reprocurement was proper, plaintiff\u2019s breaeh-of-contract arguments are without merit. For the same reasons, we find it unnecessary to reach plaintiff\u2019s fifth amendment allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts I, II and III is denied; defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment on counts I, II and III and its motion for summary judgment on counts IV and V are granted; and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-27\">.

Its handling of the contentions also made here I find simple, sound, and convincing. One beauty (among many) of the Board\u2019s opinion is that it avoids the Scylla and Charybdis between which this court, on its chosen course, must pass: that is, either we must ignore what we call \u201cthe contemporary view of performance under protest\u201d or we must presumptuously overrule some elderly Supreme Court decisions. Since we can\u2019t \u201cundermine\u201d their authority, I hope it is true we can\u2019t add to it either.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1460-6\">DAVIS, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AWT\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">I join Parts I and II of the court\u2019s opinion, but on the Bogue reprocurement (Part III) I differ. In my view the parties did not contemplate, when they made this contract, that the Government would be able to use the agreement as a vehicle for reprocuring items under someone else\u2019s defaulted contract, where FEC would suffer a loss through such an order (and therefore objected to it). It seems to me most unlikely that, if the question had been raised during the negotiations, FEC would have agreed that it was obligated to fill the order. To do justice, I would construe the contract, despite its all-embracing language, as not covering this particular situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-8\">To sanction what was done here is to permit the defendant to elect to bail out Bogue at the expense of FEC \u2014 which had, of course, nothing to do with Bogue\u2019s transgression. The defendant was not obligated to Bogue to use FEC as the reprocurement vehicle. The ASPR regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.602-6 (a) (1965), calling for reprocurement at \u201cas reasonable a price as practical,\u201d does not direct that the reproeurement order must be given to a low offeror who finds out he has bid too low because of a mistake. Octagon Process, Inc., ASBCA No. 10371, 65-2 BCA \u00b6 5168. Similarly, this standard of \u201cas reasonable a price as practical\u201d would not require reprocurement under plaintiff\u2019s contract which likewise had set the price too low because of mistake. On this basis that the Government was legally free to reproeure elsewhere, I would hold it overreaching, and not within the parties\u2019 reasonable contemplation, to insist on reprocuring under the FEC \u2019 contract although it was by then known to be a loss arrangement. Bogue, not the innocent plaintiff, should bear that portion of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-9\">The rationale of <em>Willard, Sutherland &amp; Co., supra, </em>does not, in my view, control this aspect of the case because the two Bogue reprocurement orders were an authorized constructive change in the original coverage of the contract, entitling plaintiff to an equitable adjustment. With respect to a changes claim \u201cunder the contract,\u201d the contractor is required to continue performance, and by doing so does not forfeit his claim for additional payment. There is no problem of invalidity on this portion of the ease. The defendant affirmatively asserts the full validity of the contract, and the plaintiff assumes it, and must assume it, for this facet of its claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
