He was given an indeterminate sentence of six years and eight months to 20 years in prison. On appeal, the case was remanded by the Appellate Division to the trial court for further proceedings to determine if appellant had waived his right to counsel at a lineup. People v. Cannon, 33 A.D.2d 641, 305 N.Y.S.2d 106 (4th Dep\u2019t 1969). Waiver having been found,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Appellate Division affirmed the conviction without opinion, People v. Cannon, 33 A.D.2d 1104, 309 N.Y.S.2d 894 (4th Dep\u2019t 1970), and the New York Court of Appeals denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Subsequently, appellant twice petitioned the United States District Court for the Western District of New York for a writ of habeas corpus. He now appeals from orders of Chief Judge John O. Henderson and Judge Harold P. Burke denying the applications without a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For reasons stated below, we remand to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-16\">Appellant first contends that the state court erroneously permitted the prosecution to refer to a suppressed typewritten confession and indirectly reveal its contents. The issue arose in the following context: Five days after the rape of Mrs. Rippel, the police picked up appellant for questioning. At a <em>Huntley </em>hearing shortly before trial, Detective Mahoney testified as follows: From 8:30 to 8:45 A.M., Cannon made oral admissions concerning both the Rippel incident and unrelated attacks on Marilyn Stevens and Rose Sprague. At 8:45 <em>A. </em>M., the police took a question and answer statement transcribed by a stenographer, which we will call the stenographic statement, relating to the Stevens case. At 9:15 A.M., a typewritten statement was prepared concerning the Sprague complaint, and signed by Cannon. Between 9:40 and 10:00 A.M., a typewritten statement was made dealing with the rape of Shirley Rippel, and was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-18\">Because the stenographic statement showed that Cannon twice requested a lawyer before making it, the trial judge suppressed that statement and the later two signed statements as well. However, the judge refused to bar evidence of Cannon\u2019s earlier oral admissions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> made before any request for counsel. The \u201ccut-off\u201d point was 8:45 A.M., the time when the stenographic statement was started.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>At the trial, Detective Funk, who had not been called at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing, corroborated Detective Mahoney. (The latter also testified, in substance repeating his earlier account given at the <em>Huntley </em>proceeding.) On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel sought to impeach Detective Funk by reading from his testimony at a preliminary hearing where he had stated that Cannon was first questioned on the Rippel case at 9:30 A.M., 45 minutes after the crucial cut-off time. Detective Funk affirmed the accuracy of the preliminary hearing version and said: \u201cThat was the first statement we took in regards to this [Rippel] incident.\u201d On redirect, the officer testified that the word \u201cstatement\u201d referred to a signed typewritten statement and that an oral statement had been obtained at 8:30 A.M. The prosecutor then showed the signed statement to Detective Funk. After various remarks identifying it (to which appellant\u2019s counsel took a continuing objection) , the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Q. And in sum or substance does that document relate what the defendant previously told you orally ?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">A. [Detective Funk] Yes sir, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Appellant\u2019s primary argument is directed to this exchange. According to him, even if reference to the suppressed typewritten statement can be justified as an attempt to rehabilitate Detective Funk (a point he does not concede), the \u201csum or substance\u201d comment clearly exceeded this purpose and permitted the jury to consider the statement\u2019s contents in violation of due process. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Furthermore, appellant contends, the judge enhanced the prejudicial effect by allowing the jury to hear the detectives\u2019 testimony again<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and by refusing to charge that the jurors should ignore the typewritten statement and anything connected with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The judge, however, did give a limiting instruction. A few hours after the jurors retired, they returned and asked the court whether they could consider the typewritten statement as evidence. The judge responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">Reference was made to [the statement] on one or more occasions, that one was typed, where it was typed and some of the circumstances concerning it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">Now these references are testimony and may be considered by you. However, the statement itself was never introduced into evidence, and therefore you may not consider it as evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">The jury again retired and several hours afterward returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Appellant argues that the sequence of events recited above resulted in reversible constitutional error. However we might feel if these were the only relevant facts before us, another portion of the trial record is crucially important. Appellant took the stand in his own defense and denied that he had ever attacked, or even seen, Mrs. Rippel or that he had orally admitted committing the rape. In cross-examination, the prosecution tried to use the suppressed statement to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility, but the trial judge barred this tactic. The trial antedated the decision of the Supreme Court in Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), which held that a Miranda-violative statement could be used to impeach the accused\u2019s credibility, so long as it had not been coerced and a limiting instruction was given. See also Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954) (impeachment on collateral matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">With the 20-20 hindsight afforded by <em>Harris, </em>we now know that the prosecutor, with the requisite foundation, could properly have utilized the typewritten statement under an instruction that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>jury could consider it on credibility alone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. United States v. Briggs, 457 F.2d 908 (2d Cir.1972), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 986, 93 S.Ct. 337, 34 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973). Here the prosecutor\u2019s, witness testified only obliquely to the contents of the writing by stating that in \u201csum or substance\u201d the typed statement incorporated the earlier oral admissions. Furthermore, the judge charged the jury, in effect, that it could not consider the statement itself as evidence <em>on any issue. </em>Cf. United States v. Kahan, 479 F.2d 290 (2d Cir. 1973) (no limiting instruction). Although the prosecutor should not, in his case in chief, have placed before the jury even indirectly the substance of the statement, the mistake would have had no independent significance had the trial judge allowed the prosecutor proper latitude in cross-examination. Nonetheless, appellant urges this court to reject the implications of <em>Harris </em>because of the chance that \u201cappellant would not have taken the stand if the existence and contents of the typewritten statement had not been revealed to the jury. . . .\u201d The present circumstances, however, render this possibility very remote. Given the verbal admissions, which were properly before the jury,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the lack of direct reference to the matter in the People\u2019s closing argument, the \u201csum or substance\u201d remark could have added only marginal strength to the prosecution\u2019s ease. We are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that this evidence was not a substantial factor in inducing appellant to testify, and that therefore its admission did not prejudice Cannon by unreasonably burdening his right to remain silent. Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In addition, it is worth noting that the jurors showed every indication of being thoughtful and receptive to the court\u2019s guidance. No less than four times, the jurors returned to the courtroom to seek further enlightenment. On one of these occasions, as indicated, they asked for instructions regarding the appropriate use of the very statement in issue. Therefore, one may realistically assume that the jury obeyed the judge\u2019s charge \u2014 a charge that, in light of <em>Harris, </em>was overly favorable to appellant \u2014 and declined to consider the substance of the statement as evidence. On these facts, we decline to rule that appellant was denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Appellant further contends that he was denied due process by Mrs. Rippel\u2019s identification of him at trial and by admission of evidence of her prior lineup identification. Specifically, he claims that the lineup was unduly suggestive and violated the fourteenth amendment. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); see also Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 89 S. Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969). At a <em>Wade </em>hearing held just before trial, appellant testified that Lieutenant Reiss, who picked him up at home in the early morning five days after the rape, told him to wear a green sweater.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He did so, and later that morning at a lineup was named by Mrs. Rippel as her assailant. This fact assumes significance because of the Lieutenant\u2019s prior testimony given at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing. There, he stated that before picking up appellant, he had read the complaints of the women in the three cases in which he suspected Cannon, noted that in two of the incidents the attacker wore a green shirt and further recalled that Cannon had on a similar garment at the time of their initial meeting earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The victim testified at the <em>Wade </em>hearing that she had viewed appellant at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>lineup and selected him from among five Negro males. By the time of the hearing, she could not recollect what the others had worn; she did, however, remember that appellant \u2014 like her attacker\u2014 had been wearing a green shirt. In addition, her testimony at trial revealed that she had never seen her assailant\u2019s face. (Mrs. Rippel\u2019s observations were understandably limited since she was assaulted at night on the street, grabbed from behind and raped with her skirt held over her head.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Detective Mahoney, too, gave evidence at the <em>Wade </em>hearing. He was the only one to describe the other men in the lineup in relationship to Cannon. According to the officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">They were all of within an inch or two or approximately the same height and approximately the same in weight. <em>And one or two approximately the same in dress. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgH\">Detective Mahoney did not, however, testify \u2014 indeed, he was never asked \u2014 about the color of the clothing of the other men in the lineup or whether any of them wore green.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In confrontations of this kind, the Supreme Court has held that due process is violated whenever an identification device is \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The test is extremely general, and in each case one must examine the totality of circumstances to determine whether the challenged procedure infringed constitutional rights. See, e. g., Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); United States ex rel. Gonzalez v. Zelker, 477 F.2d 797 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Assuming arguendo that appellant was the only man in the lineup wearing a green shirt, we might well be disposed to hold that the identification method was impermissibly suggestive. See Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 443, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969) (among other things, defendant only man in \u201cleather jacket similar to that worn by the robber\u201d). But cf. United States ex rel. Anderson v. Mancusi, 413 F.2d 1012, 1014 (2d Cir. 1969) (defendant\u2019s red shirt \u201cstood out like a neon sign\u201d). This conclusion would be fortified by the indication of police complicity in arranging an unfair lineup. Cf. United States ex rel. Gonzalez v. Zelker, supra, 477 F.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">However, even a finding of unnecessary suggestiveness need not require the exclusion of identification evidence. One must then assess the likelihood of misidentification by weighing such external factors as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">At the end of the <em>Wade </em>hearing, the state judge held that the lineup was constitutionally valid. He therefore denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress Mrs. Rip-pel\u2019s lineup and in-court identifications. We are commanded to accord great weight to the findings of the state trial judge, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), \u201cwho saw and heard the witnesses,\u201d United States ex rel. Phipps v. Follette, 428 F.2d 912, 915 (2d Cir. 1970). Cf. United States ex rel. Miller v. LaVallee, 436 F.2d 875, 876-877 (2d Cir. 1970). As noted previously, however, the <em>Wade </em>hearing did not elicit any comparative evidence on the colors worn by the other men at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>lineup. If all were dressed in green the inference of undue suggestion would clearly fail. If one or two had on green shirts, the inference would .weaken very considerably. On the other hand, if the inference remained, it would acquire great importance in a case where the victim\u2019s \u201copportunity ... to view the criminal at the time of the crime\u201d was limited, as appears to be the case here. Neil v. Biggers, <em>supra, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Apparently, neither the state trial court nor the federal district court focused on this aspect of appellant\u2019s claims. Moreover, as already indicated, the record on a significant factual question is sparse. Under these circumstances, we decline to decide the ultimate issue of taint. Because \u201cthe material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(3), we remand to the district court to conduct a further <em>Wade </em>hearing, taking into account the factors which we have cited, or, in the alternative, to hold the case in abeyance so as to allow the state tribunal to oversee such proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Appellant raises two additional points in his brief. He challenges the state court\u2019s finding at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing that, as to the oral admissions, appellant voluntarily and knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. On this issue, however, appellant had a full and fair hearing on the facts. The trial judge determined the matter adversely to him on the merits. We see no reason to substitute our judgment for his and, therefore, hold that the oral statements were properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Finally, appellant contends that his conviction in the absence of any admissible evidence violated his right to-due process. Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654 (1960). Under New York law, the complaining witness\u2019 testimony in sexual offense cases must be corroborated by other evidence tending to prove the crime. N.Y.Pen.L. \u00a7 130.15 (McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 40 Supp.1972). Here, Mrs. Rip-pel\u2019s account at trial was bolstered by appellant\u2019s oral admissions which, as we have held, were properly before the jury. Accordingly, there is no such failure of evidence as would invalidate appellant\u2019s conviction under the <em>Thompson </em>rationale.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We commend Frederick A. Provorny, as appointed counsel, for his splendid representation of appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\">. People v. Cannon, 61 Misc.2d 171, 305 N. Y.S.2d 108 (Monroe Cy. Ct. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\">. Appellant filed his first petition in November 1970. Chief Judge Henderson denied it, without prejudice to renewal upon a showing of exhaustion of state remedies. Thereafter, Cannon filed a certificate of the New York Court of Appeals declining review of his case; in June 1972, Judge Henderson denied the petition on the merits. Appellant submitted his second application for relief in October 1972. In February 1973, Judge Burke refused to issue the writ on the ground that Cannon\u2019s petition was the same as the one already denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-20\">. Appellant also disputes the failure to strike these oral admissions. This issue is discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">. After several hours of deliberation, the jury returned to the court and asked to hear for a second time the entire testimony of Detectives Mahoney and Funk. The request was granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">.

At tlie trial, appellant reiterated this evidence with the added fact that he had originally been getting ready to put on a different sweater.

See part III <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">. See also Stovall v.

Of course, if a new <em>Wade </em>hearing should invalidate the lineup and in-court identifications, a problem of insufficient evidence\u2014 though not necessarily one of due process dimensions\u2014might conceivably arise. N.Y. C.P.L. \u00a7 60.50 (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 11-A, 1971) (necessity for corroboration, of confession).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b344-11\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A01\">(dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">This is the rare state prisoner <em>habeas-</em>appeal where there is reasonable doubt whether petitioner committed the crime. At the time of the alleged rape the victim did not see her assailant\u2019s face; she caught only a glimpse of his clothing and noticed that he was wearing a green upper garment. In direct testimony she claimed to have seen Cannon standing across the street from her while she was walking home and to have seen him walking through a gas station across from her shortly before she was attacked, but this was substantially weakened on cross-examination. While I agree that, at minimum, there must be a determination whether the lineup was impermissibly suggestive, I would go further and direct that even if this investigation should be concluded favorably to the State, the writ should nevertheless issue on the usual conditions because the prosecution was improperly permitted to introduce evidence of the contents of the typewritten statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s use of the typewritten statement to rehabilitate Detective Funk was highly questionable from the first. In the preliminary hearing, Funk testified unequivocally that Cannon was first questioned about the Rippel incident at about 9:30 a. m. This would be logical since the first written statements, each preceded by oral questioning, related to the Stevens and Sprague attacks. At trial, however, Funk changed his story and said that Cannon had been questioned orally about the Rippel incident at about 8:35 or 8:40 a. m. in between the oral and written statements on the Stevens attack. The difference, of course, was critical \u2014 and highly suspect \u2014 since the trial judge had found that Cannon requested an attorney in the course of the stenographic statement taken at 8:45 a. m. and had therefore properly excluded any of Cannon\u2019s admissions made thereafter. On cross-examination, defense counsel read at length from Funk\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing. Funk insisted that this testimony was accurate, in spite of the clear conflict between it and his testimony on direct examination at the trial. Defense counsel concluded his cross-examination with the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">Q. Well, at that time, fifteen days after the questioning, was that a true statement you made that at about 9:30 you questioned him about this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">A. Yes, sir. That was the first statement we took in regards to this incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">Q. At 9:30?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">A. At 9:30, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Immediately thereafter, on redirect examination, the prosecutor seized upon the word \u201cstatement\u201d in Funk\u2019s penultimate response and utilized the latent ambiguity in the word as a wedge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">Q. What do you mean by \u201cstatement,\u201d Detective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">A. Statement would be something which was transcribed onto paper. In other words, a stenographic statement or a statement which we would type ourselves in response to our questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">Q. So, you\u2019re referring to these later questions, or statements as you call them, after nine o\u2019clock to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">A. To the statement which we took from Mr. Cannon on the typewriter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-20\">While it hard to avoid believing that the detective and the prosecutor had prepared this \u201crehabilitation\u201d by arranging for the detective to use the word \u201cstatement\u201d on cross-examination, we need not go on that ground. Once the ambiguity about the word \u201cstatement\u201d was established and Detective Funk asserted he had been referring to the later typewritten statement, the rehabilitative purpose of the redirect examination was achieved. Yet the prosecutor did not rest at that point but proceeded to introduce as much evidence about the <em>contents </em>of the statement as he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-21\">The prosecutor first asked Detective Funk to describe how the statement was taken; he then elicited the testimony that Cannon had signed the statement; and finally, and most important, he asked, \u201cAnd in sum or substance does that document relate what the defendant previously told you orally?\u201d Funk answered, \u201cYes, sir, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-22\">This testimony brought out critical information about the contents of the typewritten statement, which went well beyond any legitimate rehabilitative purpose. Coming in the wake of detailed accounts of Cannon\u2019s alleged oral admissions, Funk\u2019s testimony amounted to far more than an \u201coblique\u201d reference to the contents of the typewritten statement, as the majority characterizes it. In effect, it constituted direct evidence that Cannon had signed a written confession of guilt, which the jury could use to convict him or to buttress testimony about his alleged earlier oral admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">The majority concludes that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury were sufficient to cure any error in admitting evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>of the contents of the statement. I disagree. After having deliberated for about two hours, the jury asked the court, \u201cCan we consider the typewritten statement of Cannon as evidence?\u201d The court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">My response to that ... is that a typewritten statement of Cannon was alluded to during the trial and was marked for identification. Reference was made to one on one or more occasions, that one was typed, where it was typed and some of the circumstances concerning it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">Now, these references are testimony and may be considered by you. However, the statement itself was never introduced into evidence, and therefore you may not consider it as evidence. All right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The jury\u2019s question makes it clear that they were seeking advice whether they* could consider the testimony about the contents of the typewritten statement as evidence of Cannon\u2019s guilt. The natural interpretation of the court\u2019s answer would be that they could consider all the testimony about the statement <em>for any purpose, </em>but they could not consider \u201cthe statement itself,\u201d since the piece of paper containing the statement had never been introduced into evidence. Under this direction, it seems entirely likely that the jury understood that it could consider Funk\u2019s testimony that the typewritten statement and the oral statement were identical in \u201csum'and substance,\u201d and that it could rely on Funk\u2019s characterization of the contents of the typewritten statement in determining guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Partly on the basis of its erroneous analysis of the court\u2019s instruction, the majority proceeds to conclude that Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), rescues the conviction. The argument is that since the judge could have allowed the prosecutor to introduce the typewritten statement to impeach Cannon, his error in admitting evidence of the contents of the statement \u201cwould have had no independent significance had the trial judge allowed the prosecutor proper latitude in cross-examination.\u201d However, use of the contents under <em>Harris </em>would have had to be strictly limited to impeachment. Assuming, as the Court did in <em>Harris, </em>that a properly instructed jury can distinguish between use for impeachment and use in the case in chief, the introduction of the typewritten statement solely for impeachment would have had no such destructive effect as it did. Although the majority appears to doubt a jury\u2019s power to make such fine distinctions, the belief in this ability lies at the heart of <em>Harris. </em>Moreover, the jury in this case seemed exceptionally receptive to limiting instructions. The question to the trial judge invited an instruction that they must ignore the contents of the typewritten statement. Unhappily, while that instruction was required, it was not given.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
