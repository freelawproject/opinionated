Appellant Gilbert, who signed a retail installment contract for the purchase of a used automobile from Southland Motors, Inc., (Southland) contends that the contract fails to disclose several items of information allegedly required to be disclosed by Section 128(a) (2) and (8) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638 (a)(2) and (8), and subsection 226.8 of the Regulation. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640, he seeks a judgment for a penalty of $197.72, twice the finance charge due under the contract. The defendants are Southland and Wood Acceptance Co. (Wood), the assignee of the installment contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, holding that even if all of Gilbert\u2019s allegations were taken as true the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-18\">The complaint alleges that on March 6, 1971, Gilbert, a \u201cconsumer,\u201d entered into a retail installment contract with Southland, a \u201ccreditor,\u201d for the -purchase of a used automobile; that on or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>March 6th, Southland assigned the contract to Wood, a \u201ccreditor\u201d; that South-land and Wood are owned by the same persons; and that Wood had actual knowledge of all aspects of the March 6, 1971, transaction. The complaint further alleges that the contract, although reciting on its face that it includes \u201cdisclosures required by Federal law,\u201d fails to comply with the applicable law: (1) the contract falsely states that plaintiff paid a \u201ccash downpayment\u201d of $350, when in fact the \u201ccash downpayment\u201d was only $100 and Gilbert was obligated to pay the $250 balance in four weekly installments ($100 on March 8, 1971, and $50 thereafter through March 29, 1971) to one \u201cM. Wishner,\u201d an agent of the defendants; and (2) the contract also states that the \u201ctotal of payments\u201d was $948.86, payable in 38 weekly installments of $24.97 each, beginning April 5, 1971, but the total of payments was really $1198.86, payable in 42 weekly payments beginning March 8, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The first \u201cfalse statement\u201d supposedly violates subsection 226.8(c)(2) of Regulation Z, which requires that a creditor disclose \u201c[t]he amount of the downpayment itemized, as applicable, as down-payment in money, using the term \u2018cash downpayment,\u2019 downpayment in property, using the term \u2018trade-in\u2019 and the sum, using the term \u2018total downpayment.\u2019 \u201d The second asserted misstatement allegedly contravenes Section 128(a)(8) of the Act and subsection 226.8(b)(3) of the Regulation. Those provisions require a creditor to disclose \u201cthe number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments scheduled to repay the indebtedness and . . . the sum of such payments using the term, \u2018total of payments.\u2019 If any payment is more than twice the amount of an otherwise regularly scheduled equal payment, the creditor shall identify the amount of such payment by the term \u2018balloon payment\u2019 and shall state the conditions, if any, under which that payment be refinanced if not when due.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">In his brief, Gilbert further particularizes the charges he made in his complaint. The most important of these points \u2014 the one on which the validity of plaintiff\u2019s other contentions hinges- \u2014 is defendants\u2019 supposed failure to disclose accurately in the contract the \u201camount of downpayment itemized\u201d and the \u201ccash downpayment.\u201d On the date the parties executed the contract, Gilbert paid Southland $100 in cash. He characterizes this amount as the \u201cdownpayment in money\u201d or \u201ccash downpayment.\u201d The \u201ctotal downpayment\u201d agreed upon was $350 (which fact, plaintiff admits, the contract reveals). Because the $250 difference between the \u201ctotal downpayment\u201d and the $100 Gilbert gave to Southland on March 6th was to be paid in four weekly installments, Gilbert argues that the $250 cannot accurately be deemed part of the \u201ccash downpayment\u201d and should not have been noted as such in the contract. The crucial inquiry, therefore, is whether the applicable law requires that the contract disclose expressly the $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">No provision of the Consumer Credit Protection Act directly addresses this issue. Subsection 226.8(c)(2) of Regulation Z seems to be of help, for it speaks, <em>inter alia,, </em>of disclosing \u201c[t]he amount of the downpayment itemized, as applicable, as downpayment in money, using the term \u2018cash downpayment,\u2019 downpayment in property, using the term \u2018trade-in\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>and the sum . . . However, as the parties\u2019 differing interpretations of this provision of the Regulation indicate, it is somewhat ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The defendants read the provision as establishing exclusive subclassifications. That is, when disclosing in a contract the items of which the downpayment consists, a creditor is limited to the terms \u201ccash downpayment\u201d and \u201ctrade-in.\u201d If that is so, then \u201ccash downpayment\u201d supposedly more aptly describes the $250 that Gilbert was to pay than \u201ctrade-in\u201d does. Presumably the $250 is properly considered part of the downpayment not only because the parties characterized it as such but because Gilbert was allowed to pay it in installments without a finance charge and prior to the commencement of the 38 uniform, \u201cinterest-included\u201d installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The plaintiff, in contrast, maintains that \u201ccash downpayment\u201d and \u201ctrade-in\u201d are merely examples. He points out that the \u201csection does not state that these are the only items or ingredients of the \u2018total downpayment.\u2019 \u201d He calls to our attention the following official interpretation of Regulation Z issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on September 11, 1969:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\u00a7 226.504 <em>Treatment of \u201cPick-up Payment\u201d in an Instalment Contract</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">In some instances involving an in-stalment contract arising from a credit sale, the purchaser may not pay the full amount of the required downpayment at the time he signs the contract or otherwise enters into the credit transaction. In such cases, the creditor may include in the instalment contract or accept a separate obligation for the unpaid portion of the down-payment, commonly called a \u201cpick-up payment,\u201d the amount of which usually carries no finance charge and is to be paid on or before a specified date independent of the other scheduled payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">The question arises whether the \u201cpick-up payment\u201d must be treated as part of the \u201camount financed\u201d for purposes of disclosure and determination of the \u201cannual percentage rate\u201d or whether it may be treated as a deferred portion of the downpayment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">In determining the \u201camount financed\u201d the creditor may exclude the amount of the \u201cpick-up payment\u201d provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">(1) The amount of the finance charge applicable to the transaction does not exceed the amount that would have been imposed had the required down payment been paid in full upon consummation of the transaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">(2) The due date of the \u201cpick-up payment\u201d is not later than the due date of the second payment otherwise scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">In making the disclosures required under \u00a7 226.8(b)(3), if such \u201cpick-up payment\u201d is more than twice the amount of an otherwise regularly scheduled equal payment, the creditor shall state the conditions, if any, under which such \u201cpick-up payment\u201d may be refinanced if not paid when due; and such \u201cpick-up payment\u201d may be identified using that term or the term \u201cballoon payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">It is obvious that the primary aim of \u00a7 226.504 is to clarify when a creditor must include the pick-up payment in the \u201camount financed.\u201d However, it is not so certain that the section supports the plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201cdeferred downpay-ments\u201d must be separately listed in a contract. Gilbert asserts that, in the final paragraph of the Interpretation, the Board was construing the disclosure requirement of subsection 226.8(b)(3) as including the \u201cunpaid portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>downpayment\u201d or \u201cpick-up payment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In rebuttal, the defendants emphasize the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the Interpretation and cite the grammatical usages provision of the original Act, Section 503. They also argue that it is illogical to construe subsection 226.8(b)(3), which involves repayment of the \u201cindebtedness,\u201d to include a deferred downpayment where the downpayment is excludable, as is the case here, from the \u201camount financed.\u201d That phrase includes the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price,\u201d which is defined as the difference between the \u201ccash price\u201d and the \u201ctotal downpayment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">To resolve the central issue of this appeal, it is necessary, we think, to avoid becoming embroiled in such a verbal controversy. One purpose of the Consumer Credit Protection Act was to assure that customers will \u201cavoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. Although the disclosure of information pertaining to the finance charge imposed for a transaction is important in achieving this goal, Congress did not limit the the required disclosures to such data. Further, it delegated broad authority to the Federal Reserve Board to render the Act effective. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640. <em>See </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The retail installment contract executed by Gilbert and Southland clearly does not disclose in full the terms of the transaction between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">One cannot know from reading the contract that Gilbert was obligated to pay $250 in four installments as part of the agreed-upon downpayment of $350. That the customer was to pay no finance charge on the $250 does not mean, as we have indicated, that the Act or regulations promulgated under the Act might not require the separate disclosure of the \u201cdeferred downpayment.\u201d Further, although the Act itself does not explicitly refer to the credit sale where the purchaser does not pay the full amount of the required downpayment at the time he signs the contract, the Board in Interpretation \u00a7 226.504 acknowledged the existence of such arrangements and, correctly, decided that the Act, which, with a few exceptions, applies to the entire genus \u201cconsumer credit transactions,\u201d regulates disclosures for the \u201cdeferred downpayment\u201d type of transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">With these points in mind, we turn again to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a) (2) and subsection 226.8(e)(2) of Regulation Z. The words \u201cThe amount of the downpayment itemized\u201d in the subsection call for the particularization of the sum required to be reported by Section 1638(a)(2). Because Interpretation \u00a7 226.504 establishes that the Board treats \u201cdeferred downpayment\u201d situations as being among those transactions for which it has responsibility under Congress\u2019s mandate, it follows that subsection 226.8(c) (2) is to be interpreted as applying to those situations. By engaging in a dispute about the meaning of \u201ctrade-in,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the parties have lost sight of the purpose of (c)(2): to aid the consumer, creditors are to \u201cbreak down\u201d the downpayment the consumer is obligated to make. The items of which the downpayment consists are, therefore, the required data. The creditor is to set out the form in which the downpayment is to be made, <em>i. e., </em>cash, property, or both. To emphasize the Board\u2019s suggestion or requirement that certain phraseology be used is to focus on an incidental matter. <em>Cf. </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1632(a). Surely a legally binding promise to pay a specified amount of money in the future is a form of property to the promisee. We cannot agree that the inclusion of \u201cdeferred downpayment\u201d in the definition of \u201cdownpayment in property\u201d does violence to the common understanding of the word \u201cproperty.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cdeferred\u201d payment, therefore, should be stated separately in that part of the contract which breaks down the downpayment figure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">In sum, we do not think the semantical subterfuge of treating \u201cpick-up payments\u201d as a deferred but unspecified portion of the \u201ccash downpayment\u201d satisfies the avowed purpose of the Act \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms.\u201d This is so although we do recognize that because monthly payments, not only for necessities but for luxuries, have become a way of life in the American scene, many of those persons who periodically parcel out their paychecks are fully aware of the payments they must make. In our opinion, to conceal an unpaid part of the sales price in the category of \u201ccash downpayment\u201d is to evade both the letter and the spirit of this remedial legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court incorrectly dismissed Gilbert\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can 'be granted. The order of dismissal is vacated, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AgdG\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">. The complaint also purported to be a class action on behalf of all other customers of Wood and Southland to whom the defendants on and after March 6, 1971, had failed to make the disclosures alleged in the complaint to have been required by law. For the class action aspect of the action, Gilbert named a third defendant, Deluxe Motors, Inc., a used automobile dealership supposedly owned by the same person or persons who owned Wood and Southland. The district court did. not rule on the propriety of the action proceeding as a class action or on whether Deluxe was a proper party-defendant. Consequently, we do not treat those issues on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">. We note that Gilbert was to pay the $250 in four installments, each of which was more than twice the amount of the $24.97 weekly installment he was to make beginning April 5, 1971. Gilbert maintains that the $250 should, therefore, have been identified in the contract as \u201cballoon payments.\u201d The defendants contest this, arguing that the $250 was not part of the \u201crepay [ment] of the indebtedness.\u201d Because we have approached the central issue of this appeal \u2014 whether the district court erred in dismissing the complaint \u2014 from a different perspective, we need not resolve this controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">. Gilbert also refers us to a letter written by Milton W. Sebober, Assistant Director, for the Board of Governors in response to an inquiry the Board received :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">This is in response to your recent inquiry regarding the method of disclosing a \u201cpick-up payment\u201d as described in our interpretation of \u00a7 226.504 issued under date of September 11, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">In order to exclude the amount of a \u201cpick-up payment\u201d from the \u201camount financed\u201d pursuant to that interpretation, the amount of the \u201cpick-up payment\u201d may be shown in the disclosure statement as a deferred portion of the \u201ccash down payment\u201d under the provisions of \u00a7 226.-8(c)(2), or it may be shown as a deduction from the amount disclosed under \u00a7 226.8(c)(5); however, in either case, it must be clearly identified as required in the final paragraph of interpretation \u00a7 226.504. [Letter dated October 28, 1969, excerpted in 4 CCH Consumer Credit Guide. \u00b630,204.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Although the letter is not free from ambiguity, it does seem to support plaintiff. However, because it is not an officially promulgated rule or interpretation by the Board, it is not binding on the parties to the present action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">. We note that combining \u201cdeferred\u201d with \u201cdownpayment\u201d might seem to present a conceptual difficulty since \u201cdown\u201d might, to some, connote immediacy whereas \u201cdeferred\u201d suggests future action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b708-17\">. If the defendants are genuinely concerned that they must use certain \u201cmagic words,\u201d we see no reason why they may not disclose the deferred downpayment information in the blanks on their form beside the term \u201cTrade In.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
