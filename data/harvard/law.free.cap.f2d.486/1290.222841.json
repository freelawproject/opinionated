His sole point on appeal is that he did not receive adequate psychiatric assistance to prepare this defense. We agree, vacate the convictions, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">By an <em>ex parte </em>letter defendant\u2019s counsel made timely requests of the trial court for psychiatric assistance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e). This was denied on the ground that the defendant had already received adequate psychiatric assistance. The trial court pointed to the lengthy 15-day examination by government psychiatrists \u2022 at St. Elizabeths Hospital, and the 50-minute examination conducted by Dr. Maguigad by order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">The trial court erred in considering these two examinations equivalent to the defendant\u2019s right to psychiatric \u201cservices necessary to an adequate defense in his case\u201d under \u00a7 3006A(e). The psychiatric examination at St. Elizabeths Hospital by government doctors, on defendant\u2019s motion under 24 D.C. Code \u00a7 301, resulting in a report that the defendant was sane at the time of the crime, could hardly be considered psychiatric assistance to the defense. Nor could the 50-minute examination by Dr. Maguigad of Legal Psychiatric Services for the benefit of the court, again pursuant to 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 301. Examination in a government hospital <em>may </em>be helpful to the defense, but here it obviously was not. Examination by Legal Psychiatric Services experts appointed to advise the court may likewise be of assistance to the defense, but here obviously one 50-minute interview by one psychiatrist, with no opportunity to consult personally with the defense attorney before trial, was hardly adequate psychiatric assistance by any test. Defense counsel recognized the true situation, and invoked defendant\u2019s rights under \u00a7 3006A(e). \u201cWhere expert services are necessary to an adequate defense the court must authorize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-17\">The appointment of two experts to investigate [defendant\u2019s] competency and sanity did not obviate the defendant\u2019s right to his own expert under \u00a7 3006A(e).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-18\">On remand the Legal Psychiatric Services psychiatrist, Dr. Maguigad, testified that prior to trial he felt that his opportunity for examination did not provide sufficient preparation for his testimony at trial, and that further examination would have been both desirable and necessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He thus seemed to concur with defense counsel\u2019s argument before the trial judge at the time he pressed his motion under \u00a7 3006A, that a 50-minute examination would not provide a professional judgment sufficiently well grounded to weigh in the scales with the 15-day observation opportunities the psychiatrists of St. Elizabeths had had.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>The trial judge was led to deny the motion because the prosecutor intervened to oppose it, arguing that the defendant indeed had received adequate psychiatric services. This was a twofold mistake. Firstly, the statute gives the defendant a right to an <em>ex parte </em>hearing on a motion under \u00a7 3006A. Secondly, the prosecutor who so lavishly sang the praises of the court\u2019s Legal Psychiatric Services psychiatrist, both as to professional qualifications and opportunity to examine the defendant, in opposing the defendant\u2019s motion, then at trial \u2014 as might have been as reasonably anticipated by the prosecutor and trial judge <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as it was by defense counsel \u2014 proceeded by cross-examination and argument to the jury very effectively to discredit the doctor testifying for the defense, on the ground that his own qualifications were inadequate and that he had had a grossly inadequate opportunity to examine and appraise the defendant. Of course, in a second reversal of position, on appeal the Government has told us that indeed Mr. Maguigad\u2019s qualifications are of the highest and that he had adequate opportunity to examine the defendant and to assist in the trial of the case. We recognize the right of the prosecutor to take an advocate\u2019s position, but two reversals of position are two too many.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">By this opinion we do not imply that every defendant\u2019s request for <em>more </em>psychiatric assistance must be granted. The trial judge\u2019s concern here for the public purse was commendable but misplaced. Two, three, or four psychiatrists for the Government and the court do not constitute adequate expert assistance for the defense. The defendant here asked for <em>only one psychiatrist of his own choice, </em>with an adequate opportunity for examination and consultation; this was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">Insanity was the defendant\u2019s sole defense. This whole record makes convincingly clear that defendant was denied psychiatric assistance sufficient to prepare an adequate defense. All convictions are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">. United States v. Walter J. Chavis, Jr., 476 F.2d 1137 (4 Apr. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">. United States v. Bass, 477 F.2d 723, 725 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1367-14\">. <em>See </em>Remand Transcript at 9-10, 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1367-15\">. Because the doctor, defense counsel, and the trial judge\u2019s staff assistants all were uncertain as to the mechanics, or even possibility, of appointing a Legal Psychiatric Services doctor under \u00a7 3006A, no further examination of the defendant was made prior to the calendar call for the case \u2014 nor after-wards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1368-20\">. The statute proviso for <em>ex parte </em>application and hearing on defense psychiatric assistance is no detriment to the Government. The prosecution cannot win (in an adversary sense) by taking a position either way. If the prosecutor argues the defense needs more expert assistance, this endorsement is really superfluous to the defense and aids the prosecution (in an adversary sense) not at all. If the prosecutor argues that the defense expert assistance is competent and with adequate opportunity to examine the defendant, as the prosecutor did here, and the defendant is denied such assistance as a result, the prosecutor should not be allowed to reverse his position and attack the credentials of the defendant\u2019s expert witness at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
