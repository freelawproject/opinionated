Among the stationary sources for which standards were set are sulfuric acid plants, subject to challenge in No. 72-1072, and coal-fired steam generators, subject to challenge in No. 72-1079. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60.1, et seq. Even when limited to the scope of review prescribed by the Supreme Court in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L. Ed.2d 136 (1971), we find that the Administrator\u2019s action as to certain aspects of the standards must be remanded for further proceedings; as to the bulk of the standards, however, we find that the Administrator has acted properly within the scope of his authority and not in abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">On March 31, 1971, pursuant to the requirement of \u00a7 111 of the Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6 (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the EPA published a list of categories of stationary air pollution sources which significantly contribute to the endangerment of public health and welfare. The list included steam generators, incinerators, sulfuric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>acid plants, nitric acid plants, and port-land cement plants. 36 Fed.Reg. 5931 (March 31, 1971). Thereafter, on August 17, 1971, proposed regulations were published establishing federal standards of performance for each new source category on the list. 36 Fed.Reg. 15704 (August 17, 1971). Issued concurrent with the proposed regulations .were documents entitled \u201cBackground Information for Proposed New-Source Performance Standards\u201d and \u201cSummaries of Test Data,\u201d which set forth the justification for the new proposed standards. In December of 1971, after receiving and evaluating more than 200 comments from interested parties,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the EPA published final regulations, 40 C.F.R. part 60, incorporating only minor changes from the proposed regulations. 36 Fed. Reg. 24876 (December 23, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">On January 21 and 24, 1972, Essex Chemical Corp., et al. (No. 72-1072), Portland Cement Association (No. 72-1073), and Appalachian Power Co., et al. (No. 72-1079), petitioned for review in this court pursuant to \u00a7 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857h-5(b) (1) (1970),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> challenging the standards set by the EPA for sulfuric acid plants, port-land cement plants, and coal-fired steam generators, respectively. Shortly thereafter this court issued its decision in Kennecott Copper Corp. v. EPA, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 231, 462 F.2d 846 (1972), concerning a national secondary ambient air quality standard promulgated by the EPA pursuant to \u00a7 109(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-4(b) (1970), wherein a remand was ordered so that the EPA might \u201csupply an implementing statement that will enlighten the court as to the basis on which [the Administrator] reached the . . . ' standard . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850. In light of the <em>Kennecott Copper </em>decision the EPA subsequently published a \u201cSupplemental Statement in Connection with Final Promulgation,\u201d 37 Fed.Reg. 5767 (March 21, 1972), in order to avoid the problems presented in <em>Kennecott Copper </em>and thus \u201censur[e] the rapid conclusion of judicial review of the validity of the [stationary source] standards.\u201d <em>Id </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">On June 29, 1973, another panel of this court issued an opinion remanding the record to the EPA for further proceedings regarding the standards of performance for Portland cement plants, Portland Cement Association v. Ruckels-haus, 158 U.S.App.D.C. -, 486 F.2d 375 (1973). While the records in the two cases <em>sub judice </em>are substantially different from that in <em>Portland Cement </em>and consequently engender differing conclusions as to the legality of the standards, several issues are so similar and so conclusively dealt with by the <em>Portland Cement </em>decision that they can be treated summarily by this court in its determinations today.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">1. <em>NEPA Impact Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\"><em>\u25a0 </em>One issue raised and extensively briefed in both No. 72-1072 and No. 72-1079 is the consequence of the Administrator\u2019s failure to file an \u201cimpact statement\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 102(2) (c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [NEPA], 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (c) (1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioners here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>allege (as was alleged in <em>Portland Ce</em>ment) that the EPA, merely because it is an environmentally oriented agency, is not exempt from the NEPA provision that in \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\u201d <em>all </em>Federal agencies are subject to the requirement that the responsible official file \u201ca detailed statement . . on . the environmental impact of the proposed action.\u201d Petitioners pointedly note that an impact statement, if filed, would have required the EPA to consider factors such as alternative adverse environmental effects and eost/benefit analyses to a considerably more significant degree than that which the record shows actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The <em>Portland Cement </em>panel, per Judge Leventhal, extensively analyzed the considerations pertaining to a general, limited, or non-existent exemption for the EPA from the NEPA impact statement requirements. <em>See Portland Cement, supra, </em>486 F.2d 379-387. The panel concluded, leaving for another time the consideration of whether the EPA was <em>completely </em>exempt from the rigors of an impact statement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the EPA was exempt at least in its action in promulgating the \u00a7 111 standards. The determination was founded upon a \u201cproper\u201d construction of the \u00a7 111 mandate that the \u201cstandard of performance\u201d reflect \u201cthe best system of emission reduction\u201d and require the Administrator to take into account \u201cthe cost of achieving such reduction.\u201d As \u201c[tjhese criteria require the Administrator to take into account counter-productive environmental effects of a proposed standard,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as economic costs to the industry,\u201d the decision that an impact statement is not required in this specific instance strikes a \u201cworkable balance between some of the advantages and disadvantages of full application of NEPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 386. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">What is decisive, ultimately, is the reality that, section 111 of the Clean Air Act, properly construed, requires the functional equivalent of a NEPA impact statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 16. Finding no good reason to divert from or expand upon the logic of the <em>Portland Cement </em>decision, we adhere to the position that no NEPA impact statement need be filed by the Administrator in making his \u00a7 111 determinations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>2. <em>Opacity Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The standards promulgated by the Administrator restrict \u201cacid mist\u201d discharge to no greater than \u201c10 percent opacity\u201d in sulfuric acid plants and \u201cparticulate matter\u201d discharge to no greater than \u201c20 percent opacity\u201d in coal-fired steam generators.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>40 C. F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60.83(b), 60.42(b). Opacity is defined as the \u201cdegree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.2(j). A 10 percent opacity standard was established for the portland cement stationary sources of pollution and the <em>Port-land Cement </em>court, impressed both by the arbitrariness of the test \u2014 it is essentially a subjective test on the part of trained inspectors who attempt'to judge the per cent of opacity present in a smoke plume \u2014 and the persuasive challenges on the part of the petitioners,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> found that further consideration and explanation of the efficiency and objectivity of the test was necessary prior to its adoption as a standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">[I]t is one thing to use a method of testing to observe possible violations of a standard; it is another to constitute that method as the standard itself. If the opacity test is to be a standard, and if violations can result in enforcement actions without further testing, the standard must be consistent with the statute and congressional intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\"><em>Portland Cement, supra, </em>486 F.2d 401. Similar opacity standards are challenged in both suits before us today and the principles requiring further consideration are unchanged. The record must be remanded for additional consideration and explanation by the Administrator regarding the reasonableness of the opacity standards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">3. <em>Startup, Shutdown, Equipment Malfunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Petitioners in both No. 72-1072 and No. 72-1079 raise objections in varying degrees regarding the EPA\u2019s failure to provide that lesser standards, or no standards at all, should apply when th\u00e9 stationary source is experiencing startup, shutdown, or mechanical malfunctions through no fault of the manufacturer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Petitioners allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>nowhere in the record has there been a showing that the standards can be equalled during periods of less than normal operation, when plant efficiency and consequently pollution emissions vary significantly from the norm. On August 18, 1972, EPA Acting Administrator Fri admitted that \u201c[a]t the time of promulgation, it was known that even in the case of sources which ordinarly complied with the standards and which followed proper operating and maintenance procedures, there could on occasion occur malfunctions or other events (process startups and shutdowns) during which emissions might temporarily exceed the standards.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 37 Fed.Reg. 17214 (August 25, 1972). Concurrent with that statement regulations were proposed providing a framework within which unavoidable excesses of the standard would normally not be considered violations of the regulatory guidelines (so long as certain reporting requirements were fulfilled). The identical issue was raised in <em>Portland Cement </em>and the court there found the challenge persuasive enough to merit a remand. The significance of the proposed regulation was fully recognized :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">If the EPA adopts, or intends to adopt, this proposed regulation, it may take the attendant flexibility into account, on remand, as pertinent to the manufacturers\u2019 objections, even though the new regulation has been proposed in a proceeding with a different docket number and caption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\"><em>Portland Cement, </em>486 F.2d 399. We agree that such variant provisions appear necessary to preserve the reasonableness of the standards as a whole and that the record does not support the \u201cnever to be exceeded\u201d standard currently in force. Thus, we remand for further consideration of this issue, noting that the proposed regulation should play an integral role in any reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The focal point of our analysis of the EPA\u2019s standard setting must be the statutory statement defining \u201cstandard of performance.\u201d Section 111 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(a) (1) (1970) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">The term \u201cstandard of performance\u201d means a standard for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">It is the system which must be adequately demonstrated and the standard which must be achievable. This does not require that a sulfuric acid plant be currently in operation which can at all times and under all circumstances meet the standards; nor, however, does it allow the EPA to set the standards solely on the basis of its subjective understanding of the problem or \u201ccrystal ball inquiry.\u201d <em>See Portland Cement, supra, </em>486 F.2d 391. An adequately demonstrated system is one which has been shown to be reasonably reliable, reasonably efficient, and which can reasonably be expected to serve the interests of pollution control without becoming exorbitantly costly in an economic or environmental way. An achievable standard is one which is within the realm of the adequately demonstrated system\u2019s efficiency and which, while not at a level that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>purely theoretical or experimental, need not necessarily be routinely achieved within the industry prior to its adoption.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In subjecting the Administrator\u2019s actions to judicial review we apply a test of reasonableness, wherein we are \u201cnot empowered to substitute [our] judgment for that of the agency\u201d but must consider whether \u201cthe decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. The judgment of the Administrator is to be weighted against his statutory function and limitations, the record searched to determine if indeed his decisions and reasons therefore are themselves reasoned, and at that point our function terminates. Our \u201cexpertise\u201d is not in setting standards for emission control but in determining if the standards as set are the result of reasoned decision-making. Yet, even this limited function requires that we foray into the technical world to the extent necessary to ascertain if the Administrator\u2019s decision is reasoned. While we must bow to the acknowledged expertise of the Administrator in matters technical we should not automatically succumb thereto, overwhelmed as it were by the utter \u201cscientificity\u201d of the expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A vast majority (97 per cent) of sulfuric acid plants in the United States produce sulfuric acid by means of a \u201ccontact\u201d process, involving these three steps:</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">(1) Elemental sulfur or other sulfur-bearing raw material is burned to obtain sulfur dioxide gas [SO(2)];</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">(2) Sulfur dioxide gas is converted into sulfur trioxide [SO(3)], upon <em>contact </em>with a catalyst, generally vanadium pentoxide;</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">(3) Sulfur trioxide gas is then absorbed in sulfuric acid [H(2)SO(4)], through combination with the water in a 98 to 99 percent sulfuric acid solution with which it is circulated in an absorption tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Any unconverted sulfur dioxide gas passes through demister equipment (to eliminate acid mist, basically sulfuric acid mist formed by the combination of sulfur trioxide and water vapor), and escapes out the stack into the atmosphere. The regulations permit sulfur dioxide emissions up to a level of 4.0 lbs. per ton of sulfuric acid produced, and acid mist emissions up to 0.15 lb. per ton of sulfuric acid produced, as measured by methods approved in the regulations. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 60.82, 60.83. Generally those plants burning an elemental sulfur feedstock \u2014 about 68 per cent of all sulfuric acid plants in the United States \u2014 are subject to greater quality control, higher efficiency, and consequently experience less emission problems than those burning only sulfur-bearing raw materials.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The latter, known variously as \u201crecycle,\u201d \u201cspent acid,\u201d and \u201cwet gas\u201d plants, serve an important environmental function, however, for among the raw materials used for feedstocks are wastes from petrole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>um refineries and other chemical processes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">There are two types of sulfuric acid plants in general use today, \u201csingle\u201d and \u201cdual\u201d absorption. The terms \u201csingle\u201d and \u201cdual\u201d refer to whether the plant uses one or two stages in steps #2 and #3 of the contact process. Dual absorption plants pass the sulfur dioxide gas which remains after a first conversion attempt through a second catalytic converter and absorption tower, thus generating a higher conversion efficiency and minimizing the ultimate gas emissions into the atmosphere. The dual absorption system is relatively new, and although it has been used extensively in Europe it has only recently emerged in the United States as a viable method of sulfuric acid production. At the time of EPA testing in preparation for the standards only one dual absorption plant was in' operation in the United States, an elemental sulfur burning plant owned by the American Cyanamid Company<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The EPA standards are applied to all types of contact process sulfuric acid plants, whether single or dual absorption and whether designed for use with elemental or recycle feedstock.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The standards are based on information and data derived from (1) inspections and stack tests of existing facilities; (2) consultations with operators, designers, and state and local control offici\u00e1ls; and (3) review of available literature on the subject. The EPA must rely upon the dhal-absorption system as the adequately demonstrated system which will meet the standards for new elemental sulfur burning plants, and on a sodium sulfite-bisulfite scrubbing system as the adequately demonstrated system which will meet the standards for the new recycle and modified existing plants which become subject to the standards.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The acid mist standard is based on a system of \u201chigh-efficiency acid-mist eliminators, including both fiber demisters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>wire and tube electrostatic precipi-tators.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">1. <em>Elemental Sulfur Feedstock</em>\u2014Sulfur <em>Dioxide Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Petitioners do not object to the EPA\u2019s selection of dual absorption as the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d which has been \u201cadequately demonstrated\u201d for use in elemental sulfur burning plants. They state in their Reply Brief :<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">Petitioners . . . object to EPA\u2019s implications that industry is unwilling to utilize the best control technologies. Industry is agreeable to using dual absorption technology, which EPA finds best for the 80% of the industry that uses elemental sulfur feedstocks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">It is the designation of 4.0 lbs. of sulfur dioxide per ton of sulfuric acid produced as the \u201climitation achievable\u201d through use of the dual absorption system that strikes the discordant note. Petitioners assert that the standard is unrealistically high, not based on the evidence in the record, and hence arbitrary and unreasonable. The bulk of the comments received by the EPA from interested parties \u2014 generally industrial companies subject to the controls \u2014 suggest a standard of 6.5 lbs./ton as a more reasonable alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The EPA bases the 4.0 lbs./ton standard on three separate sources of information: (1) EPA supervised tests at the Warners Plant of the American Cy-anamid Co. on February 17 and 18, 1971; (2) Available technical literature providing information on several of the European dual absorption plants; (3) American Cyanamid\u2019s own supervised tests at the Warners Plant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">The results of the EPA supervised tests are impressive. Three independent test runs measured sulfur dioxide emissions of less than 2.0 lbs./ton. Yet for purposes of our review the relevancy of the test results is at best minimal, for as petitioners correctly point out the test data clearly indicate that during the tests acid production in the plant was only at approximately 52% of capacity. Since the regulations specifically provide that performance tests \u201cshall be conducted while the affected facility is operating at or above the maximum acid production rate at which such facility will be operated,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.85(b), and as nothing appears in the record to indicate any direct proportional relationship between emissions and plant production levels,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we are hard pressed to find much support for the EPA standards on the basis of these test results. A similar vice affects the relevancy of the literature regarding the European plants, for while purporting to show impressive emission controls \u2014 three of the plants reportedly average emissions of less than 3.0 lbs./ton \u2014 no data are provided indicating at what percentage capacity the various plants \u00a1were operating when these results were obtained.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">Filed with the comments of the American Cyanamid Co. were summaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of many of the company\u2019s own tests of its Warners Plant,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> including the test data which prompted the EPA to state in the Background Information for Proposed New-Source Performance Standards [Background Document], J.A. at 57:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Testing by the operator showed full-load SO(2) emissions to be consistently less than 4.0 pounds of SO(2) per ton of acid, with emissions below 3.0 pounds per ton much of the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">While the test results hardly support the EPA\u2019s allegation of full-load emissions \u201cconsistently less\u201d than 4.0 lbs./ton, they do suffice to convince us of the reasoned decision-making of the Administrator. The Warners Plant is designed for a conversion efficiency (percentage of SO(2) conversion to SO(3)) of 99.5, which amounts to a design expectancy of sulfur dioxide emissions in the 6.5 lbs./ton range.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The test results, however, both as reported by the EPA and as clarified and expanded in American Cyanamid\u2019s data, show that on three occasions when production was at or near full capacity emission levels of only 2.7, 3.5, and 4.0 lbs./ton were recorded. In fact, the <em>average </em>of the nineteen readings taken when the plant was near full capacity is approximately 4.6 lbs./ton. In sum, the proposed standard was exceeded on two occasions, equalled on another, and nearly equalled on the average' of nineteen different readings. Keeping in mind Congress\u2019 intent that new plants be controlled to the \u201cmaximum practicable degree,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we find that the 4.0 lbs./ton standard based on a dual absorption system for new elemental sulfur burning plants is the result of the exercise of reasoned discretion by the Administrator and cannot be upset by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The petitioners additionally challenge what they feel to be an inadequate consideration of economic costs in the selection of the 4.0 lbs./ton standard. Essentially what they seek is a cost-benefit analysis comparing their desired 6.5 lbs./ton standard with the standard ultimately adopted.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Again, we affirmatively defer to the <em>Portland Cement </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>486 F.2d 387:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">However desirable in the abstract, such a requirement would conflict with the specific time constraints imposed on the Administrator. The difficulty, if not impossibility, of quantifying the benefit to ambient air conditions, further militates against the imposition of such an imperative on the agency. Such studies should be considered by the Administrator, if adduced in comments, but we do not inject them as a necessary condition of action. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">The record amply supports the EPA\u2019s contention that it has taken economic costs into account in selecting the best system, whether that system be dual absorption, the sodium sulfite-bisulfite scrubber, or acid mist controls.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is not unlikely that industry and the EPA will disagree on the economic costs of these various control techniques. We have no desire or special ability to settle such a dispute, but we do find that the Administrator has considered economic costs as required by \u00a7 111 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(a)(1) (1970), and that his consideration is reasoned.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>2. <em>Recycle Plants </em>\u2014 Sulfur <em>Dioxide Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In contrast to the petitioners\u2019 position concerning elemental sulfur feedstock plants and the dual absorption system, their challenge regarding recycle plants is directed more to the sodium sulfite-bi-sulfite scrubber as. the \u201cbest system . adequately demonstrated\u201d than to whether the 4.0 lbs./ton standard is \u201cachievable\u201d thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The standard as applied to recycle plants must be analyzed through the utilization of a sodium sulfite-bisulfite scrubbing system, for there exists no data in the record supporting the proposition that any other system, dual absorption or otherwise, has been adequately demonstrated for use in si .ch plants.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A scrubbing system is separate from the acid producing process and differs from dual absorption in that it achieves emission reduction not by directly recycling unconverted sulfur dioxide gas back into the system, but by extracting the sulfur dioxide gas out of the exit gas stream through exposure to a sodium sulfite solution. This produces sodium bisulfite which upon heating yields sulfur dioxide gas (then fed back into the acid producing system) and sodium sulfite (then returned to combine again with sulfur dioxide in the exit gas stream). In order to retain'high efficiency levels in the scrubbing system it is necessary to continuously add new solution and to drain off part of the old solution as \u201cpurge.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The purge is collected in significant amounts, up to 52 lbs./ton of acid produced, and thus presents noteworthy disposal problems.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Despite petitioners\u2019 protestations concerning the \u201cideal\u201d conditions under which the EPA conducted its tests, we find adequate support for the conclusion that the standard is achievable in the results of tests conducted at the Olin Chemicals Co. plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey. The tests were conducted under EPA supervision on March 26 and 27, 1971, when the Paulsboro plant was the only active recycle plant in the United States equipped with a sodium sulfite-bisulfite scrubber.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The results are impressive, reflecting sulfur dioxide emission levels of 2.59 and 2.85 Ibs./ton, well below the standard. Equally important, however, is the fact that the tests were conducted when the plant was operating at or near full capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">As we have earlier noted, \u00a7 111 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(a) (1) (1970), requires that when the Administrator makes his \u201cbest system\u201d and \u201cachievable limitation\u201d determination that he \u201ctake into account counter-productive environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mental effects.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We cannot conclude on the basis of the record before us that the Administrator met this obligation in promulgating a standard to be applied to recycle acid plants. The record evidence indicates that the standard is achievable only through use of a sodium sulfite-bisulfite scrubber, yet no consideration of the significant land or water pollution potential resulting from disposal of the 52 lbs./ton liquid purge byproduct is apparent. A 700 ton/day sulfuric acid plant operating at capacity will produce nearly twenty tons of the purge waste in only one day of operation, and while the scrubber will effectively cut air emissions from a 50 to 100 lbs./ton level its \u201ccounter-productive environmental effects\u201d cannot be ignored.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Judge Leventhal\u2019s statement in <em>Portland Cement, supra, </em>486 F.2d 386 that \u201cwe cannot imagine that Congress intended that \u2018best\u2019 could apply to a system which did more damage to water than it prevented to air,\u201d seems particularly apropos.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We realize that the only apparent alternative to the scrubbing system is no control at all.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Since recycle plants amount to only about twenty per cent of the country\u2019s sulfuric acid plants, and since collectively the sulfuric acid plants in this country account for only about two per cent of the sulfur dioxide emission, such an alternative (at least in selected instances) might prove best for the environment as a whole.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We have no way of knowing; it is something the EPA is uniquely suited to determine. We do know, however, that the feeble statements in the Background Document that \u201c[m]ethods for disposing of these products will have to be considered by plant operators,\u201d and \u201cprocess designers are investigating several means of handling these wastes,\u201d are poor substitutes for the reasoned consideration of this problem that is required.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The record is thus remanded to the Administrator for further consideration and explanation of the adverse environmental effects of requiring a 4.0 lbs./ton standard for recycle acid plants.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">3. <em>Acid Mist Emissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that ample evidence exists, in terms of both technical literature and results of EPA conducted tests, to satisfy us of the reasoned nature of the EPA\u2019s acid mist standard.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The standard, 0.15 lb. of sulfuric acid mist per ton of acid produced, is deemed achievable through the use of either electrostatic or fiber precipitator systems, both of which are certainly adequately dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>onstrated.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 objections regarding the result oriented definition of acid mist <em>(i. e., </em>whatever the prescribed method for testing detects, as opposed to the \u201caccepted definition\u201d of \u201cliquid particulate matter exclusive of gas\u201d) is considered, but we cannot say that the Administrator was arbitrary in promulgating such a definition.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Reviewing the coal-fired steam generator standards promulgated for particular matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.40 et seq,, and subjecting them to the various tests and scopes of inquiry discussed above, we find that with but one exception the record evidence supports the conclusion that they are the result of reasoned decision-making.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The evidence, including tests of prototype and full-scale control systems, considerations of available fuel supplies, literature sources, and documentation of manufacturer guarantees and expectations, convinces us that the systems proposed are adequately demonstrated, that cost has been taken into consideration, and that the emission standards are achievable.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-6(a)(1) (1970). Although in the instance of the sulfur dioxide standards and the lime slurry scrubbing system the EPA tests give results indicating that a presently installed unit approaches rather than achieves the 1.2 lbs./million B.t.u. heat input standard,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> when the results are considered in conjunction with the prototype testing data and the predictions and guarantees of domestic equipment manufacturers for plants under construction,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> we cannot say that the standard represents \u201ca clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>See </em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v.

We want to reiterate, <em>see </em>note 40 <em>supra, </em>that we express no view as to what the standards ultimately should be with regard to such plants. Perhaps some flexible standard should be adopted which recognizes that the lime slurry scrubber system should be used only where necessary to meet the EPA\u2019s primary ambient air standards, or perhaps in balance the counter productive effects of the system are outweighed by the need for cleaner air. We only want to be sure in view of the significant problem posed in the record that the Administrator has acted reasonably in promulgating the standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
