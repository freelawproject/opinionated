Talbot Smith, United States Senior District Judge, Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-20\">TALBOT SMITH, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">The appellant appeals his conviction by jury of violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871, willfully and knowingly possessing a weapon made from a rifle which had not been registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-22\">The case arose out of an altercation in, and in the parking lot behind, a bar in Omaha, \u2018 Nebraska, known as \u201cNorma\u2019s Place.\u201d A Miss Debra Gomez was playing pool therein, in the company of some of her girl friends. The appellant, who was himself accompanied by a friend, addressed certain remarks to one of Miss Gomez\u2019 friends, to which Miss Gomez took exception. The ensuing disputation was temporarily calmed by the barmaid. It was continued, however, in the back parking lot, after appellant allegedly confronted Miss Gomez with the words \u201cNow let\u2019s see what a fancy broad you are.\u201d At this juncture Miss Gomez\u2019 brother came out of the bar and the altercation widened to include both him and appellant\u2019s friend. At or about this point appellant went to a nearby car and returnecS|dth a sawed-off rifle which he pointed \u00e1t Miss Gomez, the two at this point engaging in a \u201cveritable battle of words.\u201d An off-duty sheriff happened to pass at this time, noticed the altercation, and the weapon pointed at Miss Gomez, and, drawing his own revolver, ordered appellant to drop his weapon, which he did. As the sheriff turned to the crowd, which had gathered behind Miss Gomez, words were heard to the effect that they were going to \u201ckick someone\u2019s rear end,\u201d whereupon appellant retrieved his rifle and began to operate the bolt. As the sheriff reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>for the gun, appellant released it, a .22 bullet falling from the chamber. The charges described above followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The appellant raises several points on appeal, none of which has merit. He first argues that the inclusion of sawed-off rifles in the Federal Firearms Act, <em>supra, </em>without a requirement of scienter, constitutes an irrational classification, violative of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This argument is foreclosed by United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971). The distinction appellant seeks to make, that in <em>Freed </em>the defendant was convicted of possessing hand grenades while here, of possessing a sawed-off rifle <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not persuasive, nor the assertion that a sawed-off rifle \u201cbecome just another handgun\u201d not outlawed by the Act. See Milentz v. United States, 446 F.2d 111 (8th Cir. 1971), United States v. Robinson, 448 F.2d 715 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Appellant complains, also, that the trial court erred in rejecting his <em>in lim-ine </em>motion that, in event he were to take the stand, the number (nine) of his previous felony convictions not be inquired into, though disclosure of the fact that there were \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d was not opposed. The issue thus sought to be presented is whether a felon of multiple convictions shall be' permitted to appear before the jury thus shielded, lest he be convicted for his past record, not his current offense. The problem has had much recent consideration and comment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it cannot be resolved on this record, for we have no record. The motion was made in chambers prior to trial and is \u201cnot a part of the record at that time due to the fact that the court reporter was not present.\u201d (App.Br. p. 13.) We have examined the issue heretofore in Montgomery v. United States, 403 F.2d 605 (8th Cir. 1968) and United States v. Scarpellino, 431 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">With respect to the error alleged in the court\u2019s instruction of constructive possession, and its rejection of appellant\u2019s tendered instruction on the defense of necessity, upon careful consideration of the record and the briefs of the parties we have concluded that no error of law appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-18\">. Appellant had also been charged with violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(c) and 5871, wilfully and knowingly possessing a weapon made from a rifle without payment of the tax. This count was dismissed upon motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. \u201cThe present National Firearms Act covers <em>gangster-type weapons </em>such as machine-guns, sawed-off shotguns, <em>short-'barreled rifles . </em>. ..\u201d (italics ours.) 1968 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News at p. 4434.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">.
