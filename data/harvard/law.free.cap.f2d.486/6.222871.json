In our order of August 3, 1973, we denied the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s Motion for Summary Reversal of the district court\u2019s order which had been entered August 2, 1973 and which denied plaintiff\u2019s motion to postpone the Union election from August 7, 1973, to August 22, 1973. The denial was based on the grounds (1) that we did not have the benefit of a response from defendant-appellee and the exigencies of the situation required prompt disposition, and (2) since it was evident that the Secretary had a reasonable basis for postponing the election, an election held on August 7 without his approval would not comply with the order of June 18, 1973 directing an election \u201cunder the supervision of the Secretary\u201d at the earliest practicable date, and therefore the conduct of the election on August 7 without the approval of the Secretary would merely be a useless act without adverse consequences except to the Union\u2019s treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">We now have the benefit of the defendant\u2019s argument and the transcript of the oral opinion of the district court; further reflection has persuaded us that the district court\u2019s order of August 3, 1973, should have been reversed. We now vacate that order and direct that a new order be entered setting the election on the earliest practicable date acceptable to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">We are convinced that this action is necessary because papers filed by defendant-appellee reveal misconceptions that must not be permitted to frustrate the purpose of this litigation and its further processing in an orderly fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">First: The Secretary\u2019s power to supervise an election required by a court order clearly includes the power to set the date of that election. That date should not be fixed until after the Secretary has consulted with interested parties, including the incumbent leadership of the Union, but such consultation is not in any sense comparable to a negotiation between equal parties. The decision which the Secretary makes is his decision; it must not be arbitrary or capricious, but it is not equivalent to a negotiated consent decree. The Secretary\u2019s determination of an election date is subject to revision at any time if he has reasonable grounds for concluding that a different date is necessary to ensure a fair and representative election. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>He should consider the various factors, such as expense, possible impact on impending negotiations, or any other matters that he, in his impartial expertise, deems relevant. But the weight to be accorded such factors is, in the first instance, for him to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Second: If the Union, or its incumbent leadership, or any other interested party, wishes to object to any action taken by the Secretary in his supervisory capacity, that party assumes a heavy burden of persuasion and proof. If there is procedural irregularity (such as a complete lack of any opportunity to object or to explain), evidence of bias, or if the Secretary\u2019s action is manifestly arbitrary, such an interested party may be able to demonstrate that judicial intervention in advance of the election is necessary. Otherwise, generally speaking, the Secretary\u2019s decisions taken in his supervisory capacity must be heeded. If a dispute arises over the election date, the burden \u2014 and in our opinion it is a heavy one \u2014 is on the objector, not the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Third: In this case the decision of the Secretary to postpone the election was not arbitrary or unreasonable. His action must, of course, he judged on the basis of the facts available to him when his decision was made. Defendant\u2019s proffer of evidence relating to the actual turnout at the unsupervised election on August 7 is completely irrelevant. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the Secretary\u2019s decision was erroneous or unwise; it was nevertheless a decision which he had the power to make and which the law requires affected parties to respect. The Secretary\u2019s representation\u2014 that when he originally set August 7 as the election date he had not known the plant would be shut down at that time \u2014 is not questioned. We have no doubt that the Secretary could reasonably fear that an election held when a substantial number of employees would probably be on vacation would not be representative. This conclusion is unaffected by the defendant\u2019s representations as to the actual turnout. For an election conducted in defiance of the Secretary\u2019s command is itself affected by an extraneous factor that the statute does not contemplate.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The decision of the district court as explained in his oral opinion erroneously rested on the assumption that the Secretary had the burden of proving irreparable injury and establishing the kind of extraordinary facts that would justify a modification of a consent decree. Moreover, the district court seemed to assume that the general policy of avoiding judicial interference in internal Union affairs was applicable. In our opinion, however, the stipulation that a new election be conducted \u201cunder the supervision of the plaintiff, as provided in Section 402(e) of the Act\u201d gave him the same remedial authority as if the violations alleged in his complaint had been established by proof. Since the Secretary\u2019s intervention was properly invoked in this case, the following comments by the Supreme Court in Wirtz v. Bottle Blowers Assn., 389 U.S. 463, 472-475, 88 S.Ct. 643, 649, 19 L. Ed.2d 705 are pertinent: (The emphasis and footnotes are the Supreme Court\u2019s.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cCongress has explicitly told us that these provisions were designed to preserve a \u2018maximum amount of independence and self-government by giving every international union the opportunity to correct improper local elections.\u2019 S.Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 21, I Leg.Hist. 417.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cBut it is incorrect to read these provisions circumscribing the time and basis for the Secretary\u2019s intervention as somehow conditioning his right to relief once that intervention has been properly invoked. Such a construction would ignore the fact that Congress, although committed to minimal intervention, was obviously equally committed to making that intervention, once warranted, effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>in carrying out the basic aim of Title IV.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress deliberately gave ex-elusive enforcement authority to the Secretary, having \u201cdecided to utilize the special knowledge and discretion of the Secretary of Labor in order best serve the public interest.\u201d Cal-hoon v. Harvey, <em>supra. </em>In so doing, Congress rejected other proposals, among them plans that would have authorized suits by complaining members in their own right.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And Congress unequivocally declared that once the Secretary establishes in court that a violation of \u00a7 401 may have affected the outcome of the challenged election, \u2018the court <em>shall </em>declare the election . . . to be void and direct the conduct of a new election under supervision of the Secretary . . . .\u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 482(c). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">\u201cWe cannot agree that this statutory scheme is satisfied by the happenstance intervention of an unsupervised election. The notion that the unlawfulness infecting the challenged election should be considered as washed away by the following election disregards Congress\u2019 evident conclusion that only a supervised election could offer assurance that the officers who achieved office as beneficiaries of violations of the Act would not by some means perpetuate their unlawful control in the succeeding election. That conclusion was reached in light of the abuses surfaced by the extensive congressional inquiry showing how incumbents\u2019 use of their inherent advantage over potential rank and file challengers established and perpetuated dynastic control of some unions. See S.Rep.No. 1417, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. These abuses were among the \u201cnumber of instances of breach of trust . . . [and] disregard of the rights of individual employees . . . \u201d upon which Congress rested its decision that the legislation was required in the public interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Congress chose the alternative of a supervised election as the remedy for a \u00a7 401 violation in the belief that the protective presence of a neutral Secretary of Labor would best prevent the unfairness in the first election from infecting, directly or indirectly, the remedial election. The choice also reflects a conclusion that union members made aware of unlawful practices could not adequately protect their own interests through an unsupervised election. It is clear, therefore, that the intervention of an election in which the outcome might be as much a product of unlawful circumstances as the challenged election cannot bring the Secretary\u2019s action to a halt. Aborting the exclusive statutory remedy would immunize a proved violation from further attack and leave unvindicated the interests protected by \u00a7 401. Title IV was not intended to be so readily frustrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-20\">\u201cRespondent argues that granting the Secretary relief after a supervening election would terminate the new officers\u2019 tenure prematurely on mere suspicion. But Congress, when it settled on the remedy of a supervised election, considered the risk of ineum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>bents\u2019 influence to be substantial, not a mere suspicion. The only assurance that the new officers do in fact hold office by reason of a truly fair and a democratic vote is to do what the Act requires, rerun the election under the Secretary\u2019s supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The order of June 18, 1973, specified a remedy which necessarily involves governmental intervention and supervision of a critical aspect of the Union\u2019s activities, namely its election process. In order to achieve the purpose of the statute, the Secretary must be afforded a wide range of discretion in discharging his supervisory responsibility. The leadership of the Union must respect his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The district court order of August 2, 1973, is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to enter an order directing that the election be held at the earliest practicable date to be determined by the Secretary. Said order shall require the defendant Union to prepare and mail notices under the supervision of the Secretary and to comply with all reasonable directives of the Secretary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-15\"> This ruling was originally issued as an \u201cOrder\u201d pursuant to Circuit Buie 28.'
