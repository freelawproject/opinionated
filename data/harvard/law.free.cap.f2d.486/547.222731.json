Officer Gould defended on the ground that he had entered the apartment in the good-faith execution of his duties as a police officer to arrest a felon reasonably believed to be within. The trial court directed a verdict against Officer Gould. The court reasoned as follows: (1) If the entry violated Miss Williams\u2019 constitutional rights, good faith was not a defense under this court\u2019s ruling in Cohen v. Norris, 300 F.2d 24 (9th Cir. 1962); and (2) the entry did violate Miss Williams\u2019 constitutional rights because Officer Gould should have secured a warrant before entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Good faith is a defense to liability for damages in a suit under section 1983 \u2014 at least if, and to the extent that, it would be a defense \u201c[u]nder the prevailing view in this country\u201d in common-law actions based on the parallel tort. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>see </em>Handverger v. Harvill, 479 F.2d 513, 516 (9th Cir. 1973); Dodd v. Spokane County, Washington, 393 F.2d 330, 335 (9th Cir. 1968); Notaras v. Ramon, 383 F.2d 403 (9th Cir. 1967). <em>See also </em>Joseph v. Rowlen, 402 F.2d 367, 370 (7th Cir. 1968); Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781, 788-791 (5th Cir. 1968) ; Eslinger v. Thomas, 476 F.2d 225, 229 (4th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If Cohen v. Norris were to the contrary, its authority could not have survived Pierson v. Ray; but, in any event, it is not. As the Supreme Court pointed out in Pierson v. Ray, a holding that specific intent is not an essential element of a cause of action under section 1983 does not negate the availability of a \u201cgood faith\u201d defense, 386 U.S. at 556-557, 87 S.Ct. 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In common-law actions for warrantless entry to effect an arrest, the prevailing tort law view in this country recognizes as a defense a good faith and reasonable belief that there is a felon on the premises. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 204 (1965); 1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, The Law of Torts \u00a7 1.19, at 54-56 (1956). Such a defense is therefore available in the corresponding damage action under section 1983. Rodriquez v. Jones, 473 F.2d 599, 605 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">We comment on the merits of the defense in only one respect. Because the defense rests on good faith and reasonable belief, Officer Gould need not, in order to establish the defense, prevail on the legal position that a warrant is not required to enter a home to arrest a felon. Whether a warrant is required in such a situation is an open constitutional issue. It divides the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 476-482, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1972). Either view as to its ultimate resolution might be entertained reasonably and in good faith. Moreover, warrantless entry of a dwelling by a police officer to effect an arrest is apparently authorized under certain circumstances by a California statute (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 844), upon which Officer Gould may well have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>lied reasonably and in good faith. <em>See </em>Pierson v. Ray, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 557, 87 S.Ct. 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-10\">. The trial court\u2019s premise that if plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated, the \u201cgood faith\u201d defense is not available deprives this defense of any significance, since if plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights have <em>not </em>been violated, she has no cause of action under the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
