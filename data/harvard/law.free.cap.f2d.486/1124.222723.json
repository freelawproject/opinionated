An important part of this \u201cblueprint\u201d involved abandonment of the debtor\u2019s unprofitable operations in Pennsylvania <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and reduction of the debtor\u2019s operations to six heavily populated and industrialized north-central New Jersey counties. On May 7, 1971, and thereafter the trustee, pursuant to section <em>77(o) of </em>the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 205(o)), sought the approval of the reorganization court for abandonment of various portions of lines operated by the debtor, including those in Pennsylvania, and these applications eventually resulted in Orders Nos. 410, 451, and 514 approving abandonments. As a result of the May 7, 1971, and subsequent applications, the reorganization court authorized the trustee to file requests for authorizations with the Commission for such abandonments, which requests were granted on August 20, 1971, and May 26, 1972. On December 20, 1971, the reorganization court issued Order 445, directing the trustee to suspend all CNJ operations in Pennsylvania by April 1, 1972, pending the Commission\u2019s final decision on the abandonment application, and enjoining all parties from instituting or maintaining in any other court any action affecting CNJ operations in Pennsylvania, or the abandonment thereof, without the permission of the reorganization court. This court affirmed Order 445, In the Matter of Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, Debtor, 455 F.2d 989 (3d Cir. 1972). On May 26, 1972, the ICC granted the debtor permission to abandon all its lines in Pennsylvania, subject to.cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>tain conditions. Central Railroad Company of New Jersey-Abandonment, 342 I.C.C. 277 (1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing, the reorganization court, by order No. 514 dated July 5, 1972, authorized (a) compliance by the trustee with such conditions, and (b) the abandonments of the Pennsylvania lines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No appeal was taken from such order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, by motion returnable December 11, 1972, appellants sought leave to file the action described in the first sentence of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">We have concluded that the above-quoted language of order No. 550 (note 1) should be affirmed. On the facts presented by this record, including the failure of appellant to appeal from order No. 514 and the affirmance of order No. 445 by this court (455 F.2d 989, <em>supra) </em>resulting in the abandonment of the Pennsylvania lines, the reorganization court had the authority to protect its jurisdiction by precluding review of the abandonment of the Pennsylvania lines in any other district court.

Order No. 550 dated December 20, 1972 (D.N.J. Bankruptcy No. 401-67), contained this language, <em>inter alia;</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-19\">\u201cIt is, . Ordered that the petition for leave to file an action against the United States of America in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to judicially review certain orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Finance Docket No. 26659 and in Investigation and Suspension Docket No. 8667 is denied</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1201-22\">. These operations were to be conducted by the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which operated parallel lines in Pennsylvania at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">. The Commission used this language in its \u201cConclusions\u201d at 288 and 290-291:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-5\">\u201cThe overriding factor with which we are faced, is that since 1967, CNJ has been debtor in reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act before the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Its position has continuously deteriorated, as have other railroads serving the New York metropolitan area. CNJ now may be considered <em>in extremis. </em>During and since 1970, its losses have amounted to more than $1 million per month. Under the circumstances, some form of drastic remedial action became imperative. The subject application to abandon, and its various parts, represents CNJ\u2019s election, approved by the Reorganization, to seek to terminate all .operations in Pennsylvania, and to reduce and restructure its lines and operations in New Jersey. The application is properly filed under section 1(18)-(20).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-6\">\u201c[T]he record as it stands does support our concluding that the fully distributed net income deficits in Pennsylvania have been sizeable each year, even prior to payment of the annual lease rental to LC&amp;N for operation over the lines of L&amp;S . . . Also, the record establishes, and we find, that the State of New Jersey for some years has provided various forms of railroad passenger and freight service subsidies and other financial aid to CNJ. Obviously, it sought to assure the capability of CNJ to continue in business as a railroad in New Jersey. On the other hand, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has not referred to any present or prospective program of assistance to railroads in which CNJ has been or would be able to participate as a recipient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Its \u201cultimate findings\u201d at page 304 included this paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-9\">\u201cSubject to the imposition of traffic protective conditions and employee protective conditions set forth in detail in the \u2018Conclusions\u2019 sections of this report, we find in Finance Docket No. 26659 and Finance Docket No. 26659 (Sub-Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, and 28), that the present and future public convenience and necessity permit abandonment and abandonment of operation by Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and by certain subsidiary companies, all designated hereinbefore and individually identified in title pages of the certificate and order herein, and in greater detail in <em>appendix A, </em>attached to the report.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">. It is noted that on timely application to the reorganization court at this hearing, it could have convened a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-25. <em>Cf. </em>Bondholders Protective Committee v. ICC, 432 F.2d 268, 270-271 (3d Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">. Because of the basis for the affirmance of the relevant part of Order No. 550 stated below, it is not necessary to determine whether the failure to appeal from such order and the decisions of this court on March 10, 1972 (see Matter of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, Debtor, <em>supra, </em>and related cases reported at 455 F.2d 988, 989 and 990) require affirmance of such part of Order No. 550 under the principle of law of the case and res judicata. See Antonioli v. Lehigh Coal and Navigation Co.,. 451 F.2d 1171 (3d Cir. 1971) ; 1B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 0.404(1), pp. 402-03 (2d ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1202-14\">. Although the parties have not furnished a copy of order No. 410 to this court in the appendices in this appeal, paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Petition of LC&amp;N (Docket 2018 in district court) recite at 24a-1 and 25a of the trustee\u2019s appendix, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-15\">\u201c9. On May 25, 1971, by order No. 410, this Court authorized the Trustee to file applications with the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to abandon certain lines then operated by said Trustee, which lines included the L&amp;S system located in Pennsylvania. By said order No. 410, this Court reserved jurisdiction of the subject matter and directed said Trustee to apply further to this Court for authority to abandon any lines or operations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>may be authorized to be abandoned by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-14\">\u201c10.

See Leonard Bros. Trucking Co. v. United States, 301 F. Supp. 893, 898 (S.D.Fla.1969) ; House Report 1015, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., to accompany H.R. 7508; see also ICC v. Atlantic Coast Line R.
