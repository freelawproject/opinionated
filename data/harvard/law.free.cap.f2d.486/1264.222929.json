No opposition was filed by the Government to any of the motions. When the motions came on for hearing pursuant to our <em>sua sponte </em>order for <em>en banc </em>consideration, the Government represented that its lack of opposition derived from the fact that the reports in question had in each in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>stance been made unrestrictedly available by the District Court to trial counsel before sentence was passed; and that, under such circumstances, it saw no reason for denying them to appellate counsel for inclusion in the appellate record in connection with the challenges raised on appeal to the adult sentences imposed upon appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">Ordered that the motions be granted; that the District Court, to the extent it has not already done so, make available to appellate counsel in these cases the reports in question; and that the Clerk be directed, when requested to do so, to make such reports part of the records upon which these appeals will be decided ; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">Further ordered that, to the extent that any of the trial judges in these cases shall so order, the reports shall be delivered to appellate counsel under seal for use by such counsel alone; and such reports shall be under seal if and when they are included in the appellate record.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1341-8\">BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-u\">concurring;</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">This court agreed to consider these motions <em>en banc </em>to decide whether, in Federal Youth Corrections Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cases, the section 5010(e) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the presentence reports <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should be formally included as part of the record on appeal. The court\u2019s order today does not settle these questions, and provides no guidance for several cases that have been held pending our disposition here. Rather, in the preface of its order, the court suggests that it is granting appellants\u2019 motions because \u201c[n]o opposition was filed by the Government . . . \u201d I cannot join the court\u2019s order because our power to include these reports in the appellate record derives, if at all, from the statute, and not from the consent of the U. S. Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">I do believe, however, that under the Youth Corrections Act, as it has been explained in our <em>en banc </em>decisions in United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App. D.C. 205, 476 F.2d 1152 (1973), and United States v. Reed &amp; Hoston, 155 U. S.App.D.C. 198, 476 F.2d 1145 (1973), appellants\u2019 motions should be granted. Those cases establish that when a sentencing judge imposes an adult sentence on a youth aged 18-21, he must accompany his decision with a \u201cstatement of reasons,\u201d unless he relies upon a section 5010(e) report,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which case \u201cadditional reasons need not be stated.\u201d 476 F.2d at 1157. Once a judge justifies his imposition of an adult sentence \u2014 either by relying on a section 5010(e) report or by setting forth an independent statement of his reasons \u2014 appellate review is intended only to insure \u201cthe rationality of those factors in relation to the Congressional objectives.\u201d 476 F.2d at 1150. Not to require disclosure of the section 5010(e) report in these circumstances would be to place blind faith in those who prepared it. In effect, we would be saying that once a report is made by the correction authorities, and followed by the sentencing judge, there could be no appellate review irrespective of the reasons or information contained in that report. Such a conclusion would fly directly in the face of Congressional intent as determined in <em>Coefield </em>and <em>Reed &amp; Hoston.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005 et seq. (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">. Section 5010(e) of the Act allows the sentencing court to order a youth committed to an evaluation center for assistance in deciding which of the dispositions available under the Act the judge should choose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">. Rule 32 (c) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows the sentencing court to order a presentence report in all criminal eases, not just Youth Act cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1341-20\">. Since the presentence report by itself has never been offered as the sole justification for imposition of an adult sentence, we have never decided whether it, like the 5010(e) report, may totally replace a judge\u2019s statement of reasons. To the extent the presen-tence report is offered as a justification for an adult sentence, it obviously should be treated in the same manner as is a 5010(e) report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
