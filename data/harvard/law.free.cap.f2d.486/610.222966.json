His petition for allowance of fees was opposed by the trustee who filed formal written objections to which appellant responded. The matter was set for hearing at which appellant did not appear. Following hearing the referee filed findings of fact and conclusions of law followed by an order fixing compensation at a figure which amounted to a drastic reduction from that sought by appellant. Appellant then petitioned for review by the District Court. His petition, however, was filed 11 days after entry of the order \u2014 one day late under the requirements of \u00a7 39 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this ground the petition was dismissed by the referee and that dismissal was upheld by the District Court. Appellant contends that the order was not one controlled by \u00a7 39(c), but was an administrative order subject to modification at any time by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">We agree with the referee and the District Court that \u00a7 39(c) applied to the order of the referee fixing compensation for appellant\u2019s services. This was not an administrative order entered without opposition after informal proceedings such as was before this court in Flaxman, Coleman, Gorman &amp; Rosoff v. Cheek, 355 F.2d 672 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 384 U.S. 954, 86 S.Ct. 1574, 16 L.Ed.2d 549 (1966). Here, as we have noted, the relief sought by appellant was formally contested by the trustee. Appellant\u2019s motion was made the subject of a noticed hearing followed by written findings of fact and conclusions of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Under \u00a7 39(c), ten days after entry of the order it became final and was no longer subject to review by the District Court. Appellant\u2019s petition was then subject to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-15\">. \u201cA person aggrieved by an order of a referee may, within ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time as the court upon petition filed within such ten-day period may for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition for review of such order by a judge and serve a copy of such petition upon the adverse parties who were represented at the hearing. Such petition shall set forth the order complained of and the alleged errors in respect thereto. Unless the person aggrieved shall petition for review of such order within such ten-day period, or any extension thereof, the order of the referee shall become final. Upon application of any party in interest, the execution or enforcement of the order\u2019 complained of may be suspended by the court upon such terms as will protect the rights of all parties in interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
