Relying on Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S. 29, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), the district court, 349 F.Supp. 919, ruled as a matter of law that the alleged defamatory statements were not published with knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard as to whether the statements were false. Contending that the publisher\u2019s affidavits in support of its motion for summary judgment and Gordon\u2019s opposing affidavits presented a jury question, the plaintiff has appealed. We reverse, vacate the judgment, and remand for the development of a complete record at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-13\">Max Gordon, a Philadelphia retailer of the Jewish faith, sued Random House, a book publisher, in libel for alleged defamatory statements contained in the prologue to a book entitled \u201cThe Negroes and the Jews\u201d authored by Lenora E. Berson. The book was published in, April, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-14\">The Prologue relates that Gordon had escaped the pogroms of Russia, had become a business retailer through the dint of hard work and sacrifice, and then had become a victim of the 1964 North Philadelphia black community riots. Counterposing the Gordon story is the story of \u201cEarl,\u201d a black itinerant, allegedly interviewed on a Harlem park bench, who explains why he hates Jews, especially those in the retail business who sell cheap clothes at high prices and \u201cgyp\u201d blacks. The Prologue effectively portrays a picture of metropolitan neighborhoods becoming black and Puer-to Rican, with \u201cthe Max Gordon\u2019s and their younger, more Americanized coreligionists . . . [forming] the business infra-structure,\u201d portraying Gordon as a Jewish merchant in conflict with \u201cEarl\u201d and other blacks: \u201cAs antagonists they may well hasten the nation down the bloody road of racism and reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-16\">Plaintiff grounds his libel action, brought in diversity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 with Pennsylvania substantive law governing, on the theory that the book\u2019s implication is that he is a dishonest merchant who cheats blacks and is causing trouble and difficulties for this nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-17\">It is the publisher\u2019s position that Gordon was not entitled to a trial on the substantive merits of this claim because, irrespective of whether Gordon was famous, he had become involved in a matter of \u201cpublic or general concern\u201d-by his conduct when he telephoned his 1964 Philadelphia riot experiences to the Philadelphia Inquirer, which later published an account of Gordon\u2019s experi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>enees. The publisher contends that the relationship between Jewish merchants and inner-city blacks has been the subject of widespread public interest in national news magazines and many national and local publications. It is on this basis that Random House contends that it comes within the \u201cinvolvement in an event of public or general concern\u201d protection of the plurality opinion of <em>Rosen-bloom. </em>Accordingly, the publisher argues that for Gordon to have the substantive merits of his libel claim heard, it is necessary for him to show that the \u201cdefamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Gordon does not contend that Random House published with actual knowledge of the falsehood. Rather he seems to proceed on twin theories: First, he contends that the <em>New York Times </em>rule does not apply and that Pennsylvania libel law of lack of reasonable care is the appropriate standard. Alternatively, if <em>New York Times </em>does apply, there is a sufficient issue of \u201creckless disregard\u201d: that considering the cumulative effect of the lack of investigatory efforts, of advertising the book as containing actual interviews, of the inaccuracy of the Prologue and of the inherent improbability of \u201cEarl\u2019s\u201d statements, a sufficient issue was joined to have a fact finder decide whether the publisher acted with a reckless disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-5\">The publisher filed affidavits explaining that Lenora E. Berson represented that the factual statements in the Prologue concerning Max Gordon were based on an actual interview she had with him, plus information contained in the public press. In her deposition the author stated that she talked by telephone to a man representing himself as Gordon. For his part, Gordon denies either a face to face or a telephonic interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-8\">Random advertised: \u201cThrough <em>actual interviews </em>and personal experiences, the author analyzes the complex sociological and economic pressures exerted on and by [Blacks and Jews]. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Gordon, on the other hand, showed that \u201cEarl\u201d was never interviewed by Berson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">Random House sets forth affidavits by its representatives stating that it had no reason to doubt the author\u2019s veracity and, accordingly, made no further investigation. Gordon replies in kind that because of the potential for defamation Random House should have done more than take its author\u2019s word at face value. Gordon contends that the publisher should have investigated the authenticity of the critical interviews with Gordon and \u201cEarl\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-12\">The landmark <em>New York Times </em>case held that the constitutional guarantee of freedoms of speech and press imposed severe restrictions on the state libel laws when the allegedly defamatory publications related to official conduct of a public official. The Court said that these constitutional guarantees prohibit recovery of damages \u201cunless he [the public official] proves that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019\u2014 that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d 376 U.S. at 279-280, 84 S.Ct. at 726. The Court required proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d presented with \u201cconvincing clarity\u201d or proof of \u201cthe recklessness that is required for a finding of actual malice.\u201d 376 U.S. at 285-286, 288, 84 S.Ct. at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">The protection originally granted the publications relating to \u201cpublic officials\u201d were later extended to cover \u201cpub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>lie figures.\u201d Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts and Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967). The <em>Rosenbloom, </em>plurality-articulated both the legal precept and the procedural standards utilized by the district court in the case before us: \u201c. . .a libel action . . . by a private individual . . . for a defamatory falsehood in a . . . [publication] relating to his involvement in an event of public of general concern may be sustained only upon clear and convincing proof that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d 403 U.S. at 52, 91 S.Ct. at 1824. [Footnote omitted.] \u201c[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d 403 U. S. at 56, 91 S.Ct. at 1826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">We experience some discomfort in accepting the <em>Rosenbloom </em>plurality opinion as a definitive statement of the appropriate law for this proceeding. Although the district court seemed quick to accept the opinion of three Supreme Court Justices as ruling case law, we are constrained to observe that the affirmance of this court\u2019s judgment in that case was produced by a majority coalition of Supreme Court Justices for diverse reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-12\">Justice Black concurred in the result because he and Justice Douglas \u201c[found] no room in the First Amendment for any defamation recovery whatsoever.\u201d 403 U.S. at 58, 91 S.Ct. at 1827. Justice Black is no longer on the court. Justice White concurred in the result because he found that Rosenbloom had been arrested by a police officer, a public official, and that therefore the <em>New York Times </em>doctrine was applicable: \u201c. . . discussion of the official actions of public servants such as the police is constitutionally privileged. . . .In the present case, for example, the public would learn nothing if publication only of the fact that the police made an arrest were permitted. . . . \u201d 403 U.S. at 61, 91 S.Ct. at 1828. It is open to conjecture whether Justice White would apply the <em>New York Times </em>rule to the facts in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-18\">Justices Stewart and Marshall, dissenting, suggested a remand \u201cfor a determination of whether Mr. Rosenbloom can show any actual loss.\u201d 403 U.S. at 87, 91 S.Ct. at 1841. They expressly rejected the plurality\u2019s \u201cconditional constitutional privilege for defamation published in connection with an event that is found to be of \u2018public or general concern.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 403 U.S. at 78, 91 S.Ct. at 1837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>Justice Harlan, who is also no longer on the court, expressed still a fourth viewpoint: \u201cIt is, then, my judgment that the reasonable care standard adequately serves those First Amendment values that must inform the definition of actionable libel and that those special considerations that made even this standard an insufficiently precise technique when applied to plaintiffs who are \u2018public officials\u2019 or \u2018public figures\u2019 do not obtain where the litigant is a purely private individual.\u201d 403 U.S. at 72, 91 S.Ct. at 1833, Harlan, J., Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Confronted with the foregoing diverse expressions, we are unable to share the certainty of the district court in accepting the <em>Rosenbloom </em>plurality as the law of this case. Justice Holmes\u2019 definition of law comes to mind: \u201cThe prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Confronted with such divergence on the Supreme Court level, we suggest that the accuracy of our \u201cprophecies\u201d will depend upon the yet unarticulated First Amendment philosophies of Justices Powell and Rehnquist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">Because of the absence of a complete trial record, we have concluded that this case is not ready for adjudication of the constitutional issue. Neither this court nor the district court should hazard an adjudication on this truncated record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">The necessity for a full trial record is mandated because, insofar as the courts of this circuit are concerned, the ruling case law of <em>Rosenbloom </em>is that which is contained in our opinion when that case was before us. 3 Cir., 415 F.2d 892. There we were careful to emphasize: \u201cIt is our view <em>that at least in the present factual context </em>the proper accommodation between the First Amendment protections and the state law of defamation is found by requiring a plaintiff to meet the standard of proof formulated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, <em>supra, i. e., </em>that in order to recover damages here, plaintiff must prove that the statement was made with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 either with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. In adopting the accommodation reflected in the actual malice standard we are not precluding plaintiff and others in similar situations from recovering in actions for defamation of character. We are merely establishing the quantum and type of proof required to permit recovery.\u201d 415 F.2d at 896.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">Recently in Taggart v. Wadleigh-Maurice, Ltd., 489 F.2d 434, 438 (3d Cir., 1973), this court reversed a grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>of summary judgment previously entered in favor of a defendant in an invasion of privacy case and remanded, observing :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-5\">[Judgment for defendant] . . ., if it is to be made, should be made on a record in which the facts have been fully developed. Only with such a record can the necessary balance between the conflicting rights of personal privacy and of freedom of expression properly be struck. We realize that requiring the defendants to defend in a trial rather than to obtain summary judgment puts them to additional expense, and arguably subjects their first amendment rights, should those rights ultimately be held to prevail over [plaintiff\u2019s] . . . right to privacy, to that much extra \u201cchill.\u201d In the context of the problem \u2014 their commercial exploitation of [plaintiff\u2019s] allegedly induced performance \u2014 this degree of \u201cchill\u201d seems to us <em>de minimus </em>when compared with the unsatisfactory alternative of ruling on a potentially serious conflict between legally protected rights without a complete record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">It will be the responsibility of the district court to develop a trial record sufficient to accommodate intelligently that which Justice Marshall has described as \u201ctwo essential and fundamental values. .\u201d <em>Rosenbloom, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 78, 91 S.Ct. at 1837. First, there must be a determination of whether Max Gordon can be said to have lived an obscure private life <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or whether it can be said that prior to the Random House publication, he had taken part in a public controversy. The protection of the reputation of anonymous persons \u201cfrom unjustified invasion and wrongful hurt reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being \u2014 a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty.\u201d Rosenblatt v. Baer, <em>supra, </em>383 U.S. at 92, 86 S.Ct. at 679 (1966). (Stewart, J., Concurring.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-14\">The threshold question of Gordon\u2019s private status <em>vel non </em>is of fundamental importance in determining whether he fits the mold of <em>Rosenbloom. </em>His entire lifestyle must be taken into consideration along with the evidence of the Philadelphia Inquirer story of 1964 following the North Philadelphia riots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-15\">Countervailing the right to privacy is the equally respected concept of a citizenry informed by a free and unfettered press, a concept deemed basic to our system of ordered liberty. \u201cOur citizenry has a legitimate and substantial interest in the conduct of . persons [intimately involved in the resolution of important public questions] and freedom of the press to engage in uninhibited debate about their involvement in public issues and events is as crucial as it is in the case of \u2018public officials.\u2019 \u201d Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 164, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1996, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967) (Warren, C. J., Concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-17\">With the development of an adequate record, the district court will then be in a position to strike the proper balance between these two essential and fundamental values.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-18\">In Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 88, 86 S.Ct. 669, 677, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966), the Court stated \u201cthat, as is the case with questions of privilege generally, it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show respondent to be a \u2018public official.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, in this case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>trial court must decide as a matter of law whether the subject matter of the alleged defamatory material constituted an event of \u201cpublic or general concern,\u201d Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, 403 U.S. at 52, 91 S.Ct. 1811 (plurality opinion), at 78 (Marshall, J., dissenting), and then whether there was on the part of Gordon an \u201cinvolvement in [such] an event. ...\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>403 U.S. at 52, 91 S.Ct. 1811.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this process the court will decide whether it will be appropriate to apply the test applied by this court under the \u201cfactual complex\u201d of <em>Rosen-bloom. </em>For ruling case law it will have the guidance of this court\u2019s opinions in <em>Rosenbloom, </em>and Grove v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., 438 F.2d 433 (3d Cir. 1971). Additionally, the district court will have the advantage of the four separate opinions of the Supreme Court Justices heretofore described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">Separate and apart from the foregoing, other facets of this proceeding suggest the advisability of remand for a trial. In reviewing summary judgment, the question on review is whether there was a \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact\u201d before the district court. The presence of such an issue precludes the moving party from obtaining \u201cjudgment as a matter of law.\u201d F.R.Civ.Pro. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">In the posture we receive this case, we do not have a complete trial transcript, as did the Court in <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Rosenbloom. </em>We are not called upon to evaluate the quantum of evidence adduced at trial; we therefore do not have properly before us the question of whether the evidence met the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d test of the plurality of <em>Rosenbloom </em>or the \u201cconvincing clarity\u201d test of <em>New York Times. </em>We only decide whether a material fact is controverted in the context of a genuine issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-10\">Only for the purpose of this analysis and for the remainder of this discussion we shall assume the <em>Rosenbloom </em>plurality doctrine would be applicable to this case. So postured, our inquiry perforce is confined to an extremely narrow compass: Was there a genuine issue as to \u201creckless disregard\u201d? We believe such an issue exists for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">First, we are mindful of St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 732, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 1326, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-12\">The defendant in a defamation action . . . cannot, however, automatically insure a favorable verdict by testifying that he published with a belief that the statements were true. [The defendant will not] be likely to prevail when the [author\u2019s] . allegations are so inherently improbable that only a reckless man would have put them in circulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aqr-dedup-2\">Random\u2019s affidavits state that it published with the belief that the statements concerning Gordon were true; however, it carefully avoided any statement as to whether it published with the belief that \u201cEarl\u2019s\u201d statements were true. Therefore, the reasoning of <em>St. Amant </em>applies, <em>a fortiori, </em>to this case, and the inherent improbability of \u201cEarl\u2019s\u201d statements becomes a crucial factual inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-16\">Earl\u2019s Prologue statements revealed that he viewed himself as a victim in almost every aspect of his life. The Jews were the sole cause of his victimization. Moreover, he saw the Jews as the reason for the riots. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>argues that the question of the inherent improbability of \u201cEarl\u2019s\u201d statements was an issue for the fact finder. The district court determined that there existed no genuine issue as to the inherent improbability of \u201cEarl\u2019s\u201d statements. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-5\">As the increasing amount of consumer protection legislation and executive branch activity stands witness to, merchants, be they Jews or non-Jews, are neither physically nor intellectually incapable of victimizing their customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">We believe that the district court\u2019s resolution of this question constituted an invasion into the province of the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">Second, Random relied upon Berson\u2019s representation that the factual statements in the Prologue concerning Max Gordon were based on an actual interview plus information contained in the public press. Random, however, made no attempt at corroboration. Gordon has denied any interview with Berson, telephonic or otherwise. Moreover, Random\u2019s affidavits do not reveal whether Berson represented that she interviewed \u201cEarl\u201d or whether Random sought such assurance from her. Yet Random\u2019s advertisement on the book jacket referred to \u201cactual interviews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">The publisher asserts that it was required to do no more than take its author\u2019s word at face value. The plaintiff counters that because the publisher advertised that the book\u2019s contents were based on actual interviews, it should have conducted an investigation. Evaluation of detailed evidence supporting each of these contentions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was more properly the province of the fact finder, rather than the court. Inferences to be drawn therefrom were not for the litigants, not for the court, but solely for the fact finder. Moreover, the court must then decide, in the context of \u201creckless disregard,\u201d whether a distinction may properly be drawn between the responsibility of a newspaper or radio station in the dissemination of \u201chot news\u201d and that of a book publisher in the publication of a book. (See, <em>e. g., </em>note 5, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-11\">In sum, whether this case be viewed as requiring a complete trial record in order to strike a proper balance between the right of privacy and the First Amendment or as presenting a genuine issue of material fact as to reckless disregard, we believe that this is a case for the evaluation of a fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-12\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated and the cause remanded for proceedings consistent with the foregoing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">. Mere investigatory failures, without more, have been held insufficient to constitute \u201creckless disregard\u201d. <em>New York Times, supra; </em>Baldine v. Sharon Herald Co., 391 F.2d 703, 707 (3d Cir. 1968). In this case, however, Gordon relies not only on Random House\u2019s failure to make an investigation, but also on an accumulation of various other factors. <em>Bee, ante, </em>page 1358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">. \u201cGiven this spectrum of proposed restrictions on state defamation law and assuming that MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, will continue in future cases to support the severest of the restrictions, it would seem that at least five members of the Court would support each of the following rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">\u201cPor public officers and public figures to recover for damage to their reputations for libelous falsehoods, they must prove either knowing or reckless disregard of the truth. All other plaintiffs must prove at least negligent falsehood, but if the publication about them was in an area of legitimate public interest, then they too must prove deliberate or reckless error. In all actions for libel or slander, actual damages must be proved, and awards of punitive damages will be strictly limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-20\">403 U.S. at 58-59, 91 S.Ct. at 1827, White, J., Concurring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1435-21\">. \u201cThe threats to society\u2019s interest in freedom of the press that are involved in punitive and presumed damages can largely be eliminated by restricting the award of damages to proved, actual injuries. The jury\u2019s wide-ranging discretion will largely be eliminated since the award will be based on essentially objective, discernible factors. And the self-censorship that results from the uncertainty created by the discretion as well as the self-censorship resulting from the fear of large judgments themselves would be reduced. At the same time society\u2019s interest in protecting individuals from defamation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>will still be fostered. The victims of the defamation will be compensated for their real injuries. They will not be, however, assuaged far beyond their wounds.
