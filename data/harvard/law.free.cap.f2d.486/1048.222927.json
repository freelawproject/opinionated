West, an individual, and American Beef Packers, Inc., a corporation, alleging price manipulation upon the sale of dressed hog carcasses in violation of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 181 et seq. The complaint also alleges that American Beef Packers, Inc. allowed West to own stock and control it at the same time West also owned and controlled market agencies and dealers in violation of \u00a7 201.68 of the Regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">American Beef moved to sever its hearing from the hearing relating to the other parties. It likewise moved to sever specific counts. Judge Dorothea A. Baker, an experienced and able administrative law judge, denied these motions. Judge Baker\u2019s rulings were adopted by the Secretary. American Beef brought this petition for review alleging that under the collateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), this court has jurisdiction to review the interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-14\">Assuming, without deciding, the propriety of review by this court, we determine that plaintiff\u2019s petition for review should be dismissed. Procedural decisions relating to such matters as pleadings, joinder of parties, and motions to sever, fall well within the administrative agency\u2019s discretion. There has been no showing of abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-15\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
