Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1057-9\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1057-10\">Petitioner Jesse James Roberts, Jr., appeals the denial of his Section 2255 motion without a hearing. We vacate and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Roberts pled guilty in federal district court in Georgia to a four-count indictment charging him with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 500 (forging postal money orders) and to two counts charging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2115 (breaking into United States Post Office). He had also pled guilty to two separate offenses committed in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (bank robbery with dangerous weapon). Roberts was sentenced to consecutive terms which totaled 75 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">The sole issue which we need consider in the instant appeal is Roberts\u2019 assertion that his guilty pleas were involuntary because they were induced by his counsel\u2019s representation to him that a plea bargain had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">Roberts\u2019 Section 2255 motion asserts that his attorney told him that upon pleading guilty he would be sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Roberts also alleges that his counsel told him to respond, if asked, that he had received no inducements. When Roberts filed his Section 2255 motion, the attorney involved was deceased. Roberts attached three supporting affidavits to his motion: one from the attorney who represented him in Oklahoma; one from his former wife; one from a person whose relationship to Roberts or his case is not specified. The attorney\u2019s affidavit includes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-15\">\u201cMr. Roberts and I desired that whatever sentence he received in the Oklahoma case in which I represented him would run concurrently with the sentences imposed in the Georgia cases. We, therefore, had discussions as to this feature. During the discussions, Mr. Roberts stated to me he believed that he would receive sentences in the Georgia cases of 15 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-16\">The affidavit of Roberts\u2019 former wife states that she was his legal wife at the time he was sentenced in Georgia, and that she was present at the sentencing proceedings. The affidavit continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">\u201cWhen Jesse James Roberts, Jr. was brought into the courtroom I approached to within a few feet of him and asked him, \u2018Is there anything that I can do to help.\u2019 Mr. Roberts then turned to his lawyer, Mr. H. Grady Rawls, and asked, \u2018Is there anything that she can do?\u2019, and I heard Mr. Rawls reply, \u2018No, if you go ahead and plead guilty as I told you to do and say that no one has promised you anything, I have made an agreement where you are to receive a fifteen year sentence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-17\">\u201cI remember this so clearly because I had expected Mr. Roberts to receive a fifteen year sentence and was shocked when he received a total of 75 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-18\">The third affiant, one Elzie Ross, stated that he had telephoned attorney Rawls\u2019 office to inquire about the status of Roberts\u2019 case. A portion of the affidavit states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-19\">\u201cAt that time Mr. Rawls informed me that he had made arrangements with the court for Mr. Roberts to receive a fifteen year sentence upon the condition that Mr. Roberts plead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>guilty and state in court that no kind of threats or promises had been made in regards to his cases. This information was related to me by Mr. Rawls on the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-4\">\u201cI expected Mr. Roberts to receive the fifteen year sentence as promised by Mr. Rawls and was greatly surprised when he actually received seventy-five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Roberts\u2019 motion and affidavits raise issues of fact, and Section 2255 requires that a hearing be held to resolve these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962), is controlling in the instant appeal. In <em>Machibroda, </em>the petitioner filed a Section 2255 motion and submitted an affidavit detailing factual allegations that the Assistant United States Attorney had told him that a plea bargain had been made. The Assistant United States Attorney opposed the motion and filed an affidavit denying petitioner\u2019s allegations. The lower court denied the petition without a hearing, stating that one would have been required had the court had any doubt as to the falsity of the allegations, and that the Government\u2019s affidavit and the fact that the court had not received correspondence Machibroda claimed to have sent to it conclusively indicated that the allegations were false. <em>Machibroda, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 494, 82 S.Ct. at 513. The Supreme Court stated, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-7\">\u201cWe think the District Court did not proceed in conformity with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, 28 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, when it made findings on controverted issues of fact without notice to the petitioner and without a hearing. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 220, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L. Ed. 232.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\"><em>Machibroda, supra, id. </em>The Court quoted its prior holding in Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 287, 61 S.Ct. 574, 579, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-9\">\u201cNot by the pleadings and the affidavits, but by the whole of the testimony, must it be determined whether the petitioner has carried his burden of proof and shown his right to a discharge. The Government\u2019s contention that his allegations are improbable and unbelievable cannot serve to deny him an opportunity to support them by evidence. On this record it is his right to be heard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">368 U.S. at 495, 82 S.Ct. at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">The court below stated that \u201c[t]he transcript of the sentencing proceedings clearly demonstrates that these contentions are without foundation.\u201d In parallel circumstances, the same finding was made by the lower court in the <em>Machi-broda </em>case, and the Supreme Court reversed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-13\">\u201cThis was not a ease where the issues raised by the motion were conclusively determined either by the motion itself or by the \u2018files and records\u2019 in the trial court. The factual allegations contained in the petitioner\u2019s motion and affidavit, and put in issue by the affidavit filed with the Government\u2019s response, related primarily to purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore, cast no real light. Nor were the circumstances alleged of a kind that the District Judge could completely resolve by drawing upon his own personal knowledge or recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1058-14\"><em>Machibroda, supra, </em>368 U.S. at 494-495, 82 S.Ct. at 514. The district court stated that it credited the United States Attorney\u2019s opposition to Roberts\u2019 motion, and that \u201c[i]t may be appropriately observed that if Petitioner was in fact falsely induced by his counsel\u201d he should have filed his Section 2255 petition before his counsel died, some years after Roberts was sentenced. But a Section 2255 petitioner has a right to present evidence in support of his allegations when there exist issues of fact, even though his position be \u201cimprobable and unbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-15\">Vacated and remanded for an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
