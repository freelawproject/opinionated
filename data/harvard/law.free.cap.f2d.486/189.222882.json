He was sentenced in May of 1971, to death. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Branch v. Texas, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), which outlawed the death penalty as it was then imposed in Texas, Ant-wine\u2019s sentence was commuted by the Governor of Texas to life imprisonment. Antwine petitioned the district court below seeking habeas relief and an injunction to stay all state court proceedings until a federal determination could be made as to whether this commutation of sentence was unconstitutional. The district court denied the habeas relief and found that the Supreme Court in <em>Branch, supra, </em>did not dictate a reversal of Antwine\u2019s conviction. Appellant urges this court that the court below committed two errors. First, appellant alleges that the Governor of Texas did not have the power or authority to commute Antwine\u2019s sentence after such a sentence had been ruled invalid and struck down by the United States Supreme Court and the district court should have so ruled. Secondly, Ant-wine contends that the district court should have ruled that the Governor of Texas violated Antwine\u2019s' constitutional rights to a fair appeal by commuting Antwine\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">In answer to appellant\u2019s contentions of error we need only to look to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Branch v. Texas, at 408 U.S. at 239, 92 S.Ct. at 2727, 33 L.Ed.2d 350, where the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-21\">The Court holds that the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty in these cases constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment in each case is therefore reversed insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sentence imposed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">It is obvious then that the Supreme Court did not make an all encompassing rule as regards death penalties. Therefore, appellant\u2019s contentions can be seen to be without merit. The lower court is in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"ArLx\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
