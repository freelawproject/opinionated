Burden appeals from a judgment denying his claim for refund of employee withholding taxes in the amount of $310.99 which he paid following a Government penalty assessment and the Court\u2019s judgment allowing the Government\u2019s counterclaim for $156,-016.28. The Court found that Burden was a responsible officer of CPM Constructors, Inc., (CPM), charged with a duty to remit withholding and social security taxes withheld from employees for the first and second quarters of 1967, and that he willfully failed to pay them in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6672.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction in this court rests on 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">CPM, an Oklahoma corporation, was formed in 1965 to carry on non-union construction work as a subsidiary of Universal Engineers and Constructors; Universal is principally owned by the O. R. Burden Construction Corporation. CPM entered into two construction contracts with Transwestern Pipeline Company of Texas (TPC) in 1966 to construct three compressor stations and to enlarge a fourth station in Arizona. Burden was Chairman of CPM\u2019s Bo\u00e1rd of Directors when the work began on the contracts with TPC. He was also President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of O. R. Burden Construction Corporation, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Universal Engineers and Constructors.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">CPM submitted its bid to TPC on a non-union basis. Later TPC persuaded CPM to operate with union labor without any adjustment in the contract price. Problems developed with respect to the performance under the contracts with TPC including labor union troubles with employees, erroneous and incorrect engineering and designing by TPC and numerous revisions of drawings by TPC. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>CPM began experiencing financial difficulties in November of 1966. CPM\u2019s president was terminated on March 8, 1967, at which time Burden assumed those duties. Prior to that time Burden met with TPC officials. TPC paid CPM $188,000 on March 6, 1967, as compensation for overtime wages. TPC also paid CPM $2,541,013.75 for work on the compressor stations. In addition, O. R. Burden Construction advanced CPM $200,000. CPM used these monies to meet net payroll expenses, to pay subcontractors and material suppliers, and to pay off a bank loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On April 21, 1967, TPC relieved CPM from performance under the contracts. TPC owed CPM about $400,000 and paid about $359,000 directly to CPM\u2019s creditors.' CPM failed to pay employment taxes to the IRS for the first and second quarters of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Burden alleges that: (1) his actions were not \u201cwillful\u201d under Section 6672; (2) CPM became the agent of TPC; (3) he lost control over the funds of CPM to TPC; and (4) under these circumstances he was unable to pay the subject taxes. Once TPC started paying CPM\u2019s bills, Burden argues that it was reasonable for him to assume that it would also pay the subject taxes. He also asserts that all job proceeds from TPC were assigned to the bank as security for its loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">There is no argument that under Section 6672 Burden was a \u201cperson\u201d under the duty to collect and pay the taxes withheld on the wages of CPM\u2019s employees. The issue is whether he \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to discharge this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and we will not overturn the findings of the District Court unless they are clearly erroneous. House Beautiful Homes, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 405 F.2d 61 (10th Cir. 1968); Coffey v. United States, 333 F.2d 945 (10th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> \u201cWillfully\u201d as used in Section 6672, <em>supra, </em>means a voluntary, conscious and intentional decision to prefer other creditors over the Government. Newsome v. United States, 431 F.2d 742 (5th Cir. 1970); Pacific National Insurance Company v. United States, 422 F.2d 26 (9th Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 398 U.S. 937, 90 S.Ct. 1838, 26 L.Ed.2d 269 (1970); Monday v. United States, 421 F.2d 1210 (7th Cir. 1970), cert, denied, 400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 38, 27 L.Ed.2d 48 (1970); Dillard v. Patterson, 326 F.2d 302 (5th Cir. 1963). It does not require bad motive as in a criminal case. The \u201cperson\u201d required to collect and pay over withholding and social security taxes imposed upon the wages of employees is their employer. 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3102, 3402, 3403. 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6671(b) defines \u201cperson\u201d as used in \u00a7 6672, <em>supra, </em>as <em>an officer of a corporation whose function it is to perform the acts in respect to which the violation occurs. </em>Burden was fully aware of CPM\u2019s financial difficulties and defaulted tax obligations. Notwithstanding, he chose to prefer and pay creditors other than the Government. Burden\u2019s argument that TPC controlled CPM\u2019s funds does not render him less \u201cwillful\u201d; TPC did not agree to pay the taxes, and Burden disbursed over $2,000,000 to various creditors other than the Government after he knew that CPM\u2019s employees\u2019 taxes had not been remitted to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-14\">.
