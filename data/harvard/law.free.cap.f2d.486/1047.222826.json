Before the ease could be heard in the District Court, plaintiff was transferred to the Florida State Prison. On defendant\u2019s motion the case was dismissed as moot, since the complaint did not allege that any violations had occurred at the second institution nor ask any relief from officials there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-12\">After entry of the final order of dismissal, the court received plaintiff\u2019s \u201cReply to Defendant\u2019s Response to Complaint,\u201d in which he for the first time complained of abusive treatment at the second facility. In this appeal he renews the complaint. Since these allegations have never been before any district court, we may not consider them at this time., Chunn v. Clark, 5th Cir., 1971, 451 F.2d 1005. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the other allegations as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
