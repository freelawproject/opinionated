Appellant, relying on General Interpretative Rule 10(h),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claims the proper classification to be as furniture other than chairs under item 727.35, as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-18\">The merchandise consists of wooden headboards, footboards, posts, ladders and guardrails in unassembled condition. We agree with the lower court that the record establishes that siderails, which are not imported, are necessary to make the bunk bed units usable to the ultimate consumer. The issue lies in whether the absence of these siderails necessitates classification of the imported pieces as parts of furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-19\">We find no error in the lower court\u2019s holding that parts of an article may be classified as the unfinished article itself only when the imported pieces constitute a substantially complete article, albeit in unassembled condition. We fully agree that the definition of \u201cunfinished\u2019' found in American Import Co. v. United States, 26 CCPA 72, T.D. 49612 (1938) and carried over to the TSUS in Finn Bros., Inc. v. United States, 454 F.2d 1404, 59 CCPA 72, C.A.D. 1042 (1972) can be, and has been, employed only to distinguish, in the sense of the tariff schedules, the status of an unfinished article from the material of manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>ture. The so-called \u201cdedication to use\u201d test found in those cases makes no distinction whatsoever between the unfinished article and parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Appellant argues before us that the \u201csubstantially complete\u201d test of the lower court fails to provide sufficient guidelines for determining proper classification and proposes in its stead a \u201cdedication to use\u201d test applied \u201cwith reason.\u201d Recognizing that adoption of a naked \u201cdedication to use\u201d test would effectively eliminate competing parts provisions, appellant advances a modified version, namely, dedication to use in conjunction with an evaluation of the quantum, utilitarian function, and other relevant characteristics of the imported pieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">We cannot, however, agree that such a test is more definitive than that set forth by the lower court. Nor can we find any support for this interpretation of the import of Rule 10(h), in particular with respect to the classification of furniture, in the cases cited by appellant. Both Hurricane Import Co. v. United States, 58 Cust.Ct. 541, C.D. 3046 (1967) and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. United States, 10 Cust.Ct. 382, Abs. 47958 (1943) were cases involving classification under the Tariff Act of 1930. There was no counterpart to Rule 10(h). The furniture provision itself drew the distinction between \u201cwholly or - partly finished\u201d furniture and \u201cparts thereof\u201d rather than between \u201cfinished or not finished\u201d and \u201cparts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that, even if the \u201csubstantially complete\u201d test be the proper criterion, the imported merchandise meets that standard in that the major and most significant parts have been imported and are sold as imported. It is emphasized that the side-rails necessary to hold the bed upright are often offered for sale separately or even supplied by the consumer himself and a comparison is drawn with the incomplete furniture classified as \u201cpartly finished\u201d in the <em>Abercrombie </em>and <em>Hurricane </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">Considering as we must, however, the goods in their imported form, we find the missing siderails to be an essential item. We thus find no basis for overturning the lower court\u2019s finding that the imported pieces constituted less than a substantially complete bunk bed. We consider the application of the test, whereby the absence of a substantial or essential part precludes classification as the unfinished article itself, to be well founded in the case law so ably discussed by the lower court and aptly followed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">The decision and judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1139-11\">. 10. <em>General Interpretative Rules. </em>For the purposes of these schedules</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">* * * **</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-13\">(h) unless the context requires otherwise, a tariff description for an article covers such article, whether assembled or not assembled, and whether finished or not finished ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-21\">* * * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1140-11\">MILLER, Judge, dissenting, with whom RICH, J., joins.</author>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">I believe the majority opinion not only misstates the test to be applied in determining when parts of an article cannot be classified as the unfinished article itself, but misapplies the test it states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-13\">The test is not, as the majority opinion states, the absence of a substantial <em>or </em>essential part, but, rather, the absence of a substantial <em>and </em>essential part. Twin Pin Co. of U. S. A., Inc. v. United States, 24 Cust.Ct. 430, Abstract No. 54254 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-14\">The issue is well stated by the majority opinion, namely: whether the absence of the side rails necessitates classification of the imported merchandise as \u201cparts of furniture.\u201d However, in applying the test, it proposes to consider the word \u201cessential\u201d only in the <em>functional </em>rather than the <em>commercial </em>sense, namely: that without the side rails the merchandise in question is not \u201cusable\u201d as bunk beds to the ultimate consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-16\">Following this approach, nuts and bolts to hold the parts of a bed together to make it \u201cusable\u201d would be considered \u201cessential,\u201d so that their absence</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>would preclude classification of such parts as \u201cfurniture\u201d rather than \u201cparts of furniture\u201d \u2014 a result that I cannot perceive this court permitting. The side rails here, as pointed out by appellant, act as the hardware holding the merchandise together and are analogous to nuts and bolts. Moreover, it appears from the record that in the ease of many consumers the merchandise was \u201cusable\u201d (in the \u201ccommercial sense\u201d) because they already had side rails. Thus, on cross-examination, a sales representative for appellant (and former buyer in the bedding department of Macy\u2019s, California) testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-4\">Q. Are you saying that an ordinary bed is sold without side rails?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">A. It could be sold either way. It can be sold with side rails; it can be sold without. Many times we have customers that come in who have side rails, and we sell them without side rails. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">The case of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. United States, 10 Cust.Ct. 382, Abstract No. 47958 (1943) is clearly in point. There the articles, each of which comprised only the base of a table, were held by the Customs Court to be dutiable as \u201cpartly finished tables rather than parts of tables.\u201d The court pointed out \u201cthat the greater part by far of the table to be finished is incorporated in each of the imported articles\u201d and that the addition of a glass top after importation made the articles \u201csuitable for use as tables.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">The majority opinion apparently seeks to distinguish the <em>Abercrombie </em>case by noting that it involved the Tariff Act of 1930, wherein the furniture provision itself drew the distinction between \u201cwholly or partly finished\u201d furniture and \u201cparts thereof\u201d; whereas this case involves the distinction under the Tariff Schedules, including Rule 10(h), between \u201cfinished or not finished\u201d furniture and \u201cParts of furniture.\u201d But the <em>Abercrombie </em>case cannot be so distinguished. The court there held that the articles were not <em>parts, </em>but partly finished tables, even though the tops were obviously essential (in the functional sense) to make them usable as tables. So, too, this court should hold that the merchandise in question is not <em>parts, </em>but furniture (finished or not finished), even though side rails are essential (in the functional sense) to make it usable as bunk beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">Perhaps my chief difficulty with the majority opinion is that it simply ignores the clear, corroborated, and uncon-troverted evidence before the Customs Court regarding practice in the furniture trade which, in the absence of a contrary indication by the Congress, is controlling. Nylos Trading Company v. United States, 37 CCPA 71, C.A.D. 422 (1949) and cases cited therein. That practice was to market the merchandise as substantially complete bunk beds. Thus, appellants\u2019 sales representative, again on cross-examination, further testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-10\">Judge Watson: Are you familiar with how beds are offered for sale to the ultimate consumer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-11\">The Witness: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWj-\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-12\">Judge Watson: Are side rails offered separately with bunk beds \u2014 and when I say, \u201care they offered separately\u201d: are they sold separately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-13\">The Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-14\">Judge Watson: Is there any additional price over and above that of the bed that is sold ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-15\">The Witness: Yes, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-16\">This same witness, on cross-examination by government\u2019s counsel, then testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-17\">Q. In your opinion, it is a complete bed without a side rail ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-18\">A. Using the terminology of the word \u201cbed\u201d in the trade, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">No witnesses were produced by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Pages from a Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog (appellant\u2019s Exhibit 1) fully corroborate the above testimony. On one page is the designation:</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">BUNK BEDS TO SUIT YOUR EVERY NEED</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">On the same page appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-6\"><em>Bunk Beds </em>include head and foot-boards, guardrail ladders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-7\"><em>Bunk Outfits </em>include above items plus steel link springs and your choice of 152-coil inner spring, or 4-inch Sero-foam polyurethane mattress. With cotton and rayon covers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">The distinction between \u201cbeds\u201d and \u201coutfits\u201d appears throughout the price list. Three different \u201cBunk Beds\u201d (without rails) are listed: a double-decker at $54.95; a triple-decker at $69.95; and another double-decker at $99.95. Each listing refers to the following item:</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">\n<em>Rails for Bunk Beds without springs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_9\">These are priced at $4.99 per set of two, with the notation that 1 set is needed for each bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">From the standpoint of price relationships alone, honest differences might arise over whether the rails constitute a \u201csubstantial part.\u201d But from the standpoint of the furniture trade, which is controlling, they are not so substantial as to preclude marketing the merchandise in question to dealers and the ultimate consumer as \u201cFurniture\u201d rather than \u201cParts of furniture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">In view of the foregoing, I conclude that appellant has sustained its burden of proving that classification of the merchandise in question as \u201cParts of furniture,\u201d under 727.40 of the Tariff Schedules, is erroneous and that classification as \u201cFurniture other than chairs,\u201d whether finished or unfinished, under item 727.35 of the Tariff Schedules and Rule 10(h), is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
