JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b111-23\">This action arose out of the suicide of plaintiff\u2019s husband while a patient at the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Haven, Connecticut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only question on appeal is the validity of the district court\u2019s finding that the hospital officials and staff were negligent in permitting Mr. Dinnerstein\u2019s death. Both parties agree that under the Tort Claims Act, Connecticut law applies, and that under that law the proper standard of care is that standard which other hospitals in the area have and afford similar patients. The parties disagree, however, as to whether the evidence presented at trial \u2014 most notably the expert psychiatric testimony \u2014 sufficiently supports the court\u2019s finding of negligence. Since we find the evidence to be sufficient, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-25\">For as long as six years' before his death on January 4, 1969, Howard Din-nerstein had suffered recurrent periods of depression serious enough to require voluntary psychiatric care. On January 31, 1968, he ran his car into a highway bridge abutment. Though little damage was done to the ear and none to himself, Dinnerstein told his wife that the \u201caccident\u201d had actually been a suicide attempt. The same day he was admitted \u2014again voluntarily \u2014 -to the V.A. Hospital in West Haven; he remained there under observation until February 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The hospital records indicate that at the time its staff doctors considered Dinner-stein a \u201csuicide risk.\u201d Though the records also indicate that Dinnerstein was gradually accorded greater freedom of movement \u2014 from complete restriction on January 31 to full privileges on February 2 \u2014 his release on February 12 was nevertheless \u201cagainst medical advice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In the fall of 1968, business pressures apparently drove Dinnerstein back into his depression. Dr. Gottlieb, Dinner-stein\u2019s new private psychiatrist, convinced him to admit himself to St. Raphael\u2019s Hospital in New Haven on November 5, 1968. Dr. Gottlieb testified that his reasons for hospitalizing Din-nerstein in November included protecting him from possible suicide. On November 9, Dinnerstein\u2019s condition took a turn for the worse: \u2019 He would not leave his bed nor do anything for himself. However, by November 14 he had improved enough to be granted walking privileges; and on November 28, he was again discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">But in December the cycle again turned downward, and Dinnerstein was treated by Dr. Gottlieb no less than seven times. As he was going steadily downhill, Dr. Gottlieb again recommended hospitalization. At the V.A. Hospital, the physician on duty, Dr. Tal-an, informed Dinnerstein that the individual therapy he was seeking was not available. Depressed further by this, Dinnerstein refused to admit himself. However, on the following day, January 3, 1969, he decided to accept the V.A. offer of group therapy. During the admission session, Dr. Clark of the V.A. staff diagnosed Dinnerstein\u2019s condition as a \u201cDepressive Reaction.\u201d However, he later testified that he did not consider Dinnerstein to be suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Though Dr. Clark was aware of Din-nerstein\u2019s prior history from both the V.A. records of his February hospitalization and from a telephone conversation between Dr. Talan and Dr. Gottlieb on January 2, he did not order any restrictions or special supervision for Din-nerstein in assigning him to a seventh-floor ward. Dr. Clark also discontinued a regime of anti-depressant drugs Din-nerstein had followed up to that time in order to obtain a more accurate reading of his psychological state.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The V.A. records indicate that on the evening of January 3, Dinnerstein complained to Dr. Clark that he had become even more depressed since arriving at the hospital because of the inadequacy of the group therapy program. However, despite these complaints, Dr. Clark issued no additional orders either to supervise Dinnerstein more closely or to give him anti-depressant medication. At approximately 3:00 p. m. on the following day, January 4, Dinnerstein walked to the lavatory on the seventh floor and leaped to his death from an unsecured window.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\"> The government\u2019s first contention is that as a matter of Connecticut law, the district court\u2019s finding of negligence cannot stand because no psychiatric expert testified that the appropriate standard of medical care was not satisfied. This argument misstates the law. Rather it is clear that expert medical testimony is necessary only to provide the trier of fact with the proper standard of medical care against which to measure the defendant\u2019s actions. It is the trier of fact, and not the expert witness, who must then evaluate the evidence to determine whether or not that standard was actually met. Slimak v. Foster, 106 Conn. 366, 370-71, 138 A. 153, 155 (1927). Indeed, the trier of fact may even base a finding of negligence on the expert testimony of the defendant-doctor. Snyder v. Pantaleo, 143 Conn. 290, 294, 122 A.2d 21, 24 (1956); Allen v. Giuliano, 144 Conn. 573, 575, 135 A.2d 904, 906 (1957); Console v. Nickou, 156 Conn. 268, 274, 240 A.2d 895, 898 (1968) ; Levett v. Etkind, 158 Conn. 567, 575, 265 A.2d 70, 73 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Here there was clear testimony from three psychiatric experts \u2014 Dr. Gottlieb, Dr. Talan, and Dr. Rubenstein, a government witness \u2014 that the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>should have restricted Dinnerstein <em>if </em>there was reason to believe he was suicidal. Indeed, this standard of care is so obvious that expert testimony seems hardly necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Nevertheless, when one remembers the fact that unlike blood pressures or pulse rates, emotional states cannot be calibrated with precision, medical expertise again becomes relevant. That is, the question for expert guidance \u2014 but still for ultimate determination by the trier of fact \u2014 was whether it was reasonably foreseeable on the basis of Dinnerstein\u2019s prior history that he would commit suicide. The government correctly notes that all of the expert witnesses, including Dr. Gottlieb, testified that they did not consider Dinnerstein to be suicidal on his admission to the hospital. However, despite this testimony on the narrow question of whether Dinnerstein exhibited suicidal tendencies on the day he was admitted, the trial court \u2014 relying primarily on the hospital\u2019s own records and the conversations between Dr. Gott-lieb and Dr. Talan \u2014 nevertheless found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">[T]hat the Hospital knew or should have known of the real possibility of a suicide attempt, that it failed to take appropriate measures to guard Din-nerstein against that danger, that it was its duty to do so, and that, having failed to act with due care in the discharge of that duty, the United States is liable to the plaintiff for the losses caused thereby. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">At the least, for the first few days of Dinnerstein\u2019s admission his movements should have been restricted so that he could be closely watched. As he was assigned to a ward on the seventh floor, measures should have been taken to see that he could not jump from a window. His own denial upon admission of suicidal ideation and even Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s belief that he was not imminently suicidal, cannot excuse the complete absence of precautions to insure the safety of a patient with a suicidal gesture in his past, a long history of psychiatric treatment for recurrent and severe depression, previous hospitalization to protect against possible suicide. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">In our review of this finding, the government urges that we reconsider the evidence unrestrained by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d test of Rule 52(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ever, while we agree that a finding of negligence is reviewable as a matter of law, we cannot accept the government\u2019s invitation to conduct a broad, almost <em>de novo, </em>inquiry into the basic facts of this case. As we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">The standard of review to be applied to a district court\u2019s finding of negligence is not the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard . . . for a finding of negligence is reviewable as a matter of law. Nevertheless, the lower court finding \u201c[will] ordinarily stand unless the [lower] court manifests an incorrect conception of the applicable law.\u201d Cleary v. United States Lines Co., 411 F.2d 1009 (2 Cir. June 2, 1969), citing Radovich v. Cunard Steamship Co., 364 F.2d 149, 152 (2 Cir. 1966) and Esso Standard Oil S. A. v. S.S. Gasbras Sul., 387 F. 2d 573 (2 Cir.), cert, denied, 391 U.S. 914, 88 S.Ct. 1808, 20 L.Ed.2d 653 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Hendry v. United States, 418 F.2d 774, 784 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Here there is no doubt that the trial court applied the proper legal standard: If Dinnerstein\u2019s suicide was reasonably foreseeable, the hospital staff was clearly negligent in assigning him to an unsupervised and unrestricted room on the seventh floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We further hold that even without the benefit of the clearly erroneous rule, the finding that Dinnerstein\u2019s suicide was sufficiently foreseeable to demand greater supervision is amply supported by the record. The hospital officials should certainly have been aware of</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">Dinnerstein\u2019s prior hospitalization history contained in their own records. Similarly, Dr. Gottlieb, who testified that he considered Dinnerstein\u2019s condition in late December to be the same or worse than it was in November when he was hospitalized partially to prevent a suicide attempt, informed Dr. Talan that Dinnerstein had exhibited \u201cnegativism and unpredictability\u201d as recently as November 9th. This diagnosis certainly should have been made available to Dr. Clark, the admitting physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">Moreover, Dr. Clark himself admitted that soon after his admission, Dinner-stein expressed dissatisfaction and further depression with the treatment he was receiving. Yet despite these complaints, Dr. Clark continued to deprive Dinnerstein of anti-depressant drugs he had been receiving, so as to evaluate his psychological condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">From these facts, when combined with a six-year history of deepening depression, it was not at all unreasonable for the trial court to conclude that Dinner-stein should have been supervised more closely. This is not to suggest that every potential suicide must be locked in a padded cell. The law and modern psychiatry have now both come to the belated conclusion that an overly restrictive environment can be as destructive as an overly permissive one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But while we must accept some calculated risks in order to insure the patient\u2019s legal rights and provide him with the most effective therapy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we must also admit that errors in judgment do occur and that when they do, medical authorities must assume their rightful share of the responsibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, in short, we can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>not say the trial court erred in concluding that the hospital staff was negligent in allowing Dinnerstein \u2014 an emotional unknown quantity \u2014 unrestricted movement on the seventh floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AAx\">. The government has never disputed that Dinnerstein\u2019s fall was a suicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-5\">. The government cites Mamiye Bros. v. Barber Steamship Lines, Inc., 360 F.2d 774 (2d Cir. 1966), cert, denied, 385 U.S. 835, 87 S.Ct. 80, 17 L.Ed.2d 70 (1966), for the proposition that our review of this finding of negligence must also be free of the dearly erroneous rule in order to insure a uniformity of result among the several courts in this circuit. However, <em>Mamiye Bros, </em>applied only where contrary decisions rest \u201con exactly the same facts. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Baker v. United States, 226 F.Supp. 129 (S.D.Iowa 1964), aff\u2019d 343 F.2d 222 (8th Cir. 1965), cited by the government, while strikingly similar to the case at bar does not satisfy this test. In <em>Baker </em>the patient, who had been referred to a V. A. hospital by a private physician who had noted suicidal tendencies, was also assigned to an open ward after a V. A. doctor concluded he was not a suicide risk. Three days later, Baker left his ward and jumped into a open well on the hospital grounds. The trial judge, noting that modern psychiatric theory requires some \u201ccalculated risks,\u201d found no negligence, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that we must reconcile our result here with <em>Baker, </em>a case from another circuit which may or may not be correct, there is one important point of distinction between the two sets of facts. In <em>Baker, </em>there is no suggestion that hospital officials had any reason to believe the patient\u2019s psychological condition was further deteriorating after his initial admission examination. Here, by contrast, it is undisputed that Dinnerstein told Dr. Clark that he was becoming even more depressed \u2014 apparently due to the lack of either individual therapy or anti-depressant medication, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">Two other federal decisions finding no negligence in the suicides of government patients are similarly distinguishable by the fact that in both there was no evidence of recent suicide tendencies or attempts. <em>See, </em>White v. United States, 244 F.Supp. 127, 129-131 (E.D.Va.1965), aff\u2019d, 359 F.2d 989 (4th Cir. 1966) (last suicidal \u201cgesture\u201d occurred fourteen years before actual suicide; the Fourth Circuit held that the finding of non-negligence, while \u201chighly debatable,\u201d was not reversible) ; Frederic v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>246 F.Supp. 368, 371 (E.D.La.1965) (patient, hospitalized for non-psychiatric reasons, had never previously attempted nor threatened suicide).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Perr, Suicide Responsibility of Hospital and Psychiatrist, 9 Clev.-Mar. L.R. 427, 439-40 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b114-11\">. <em>See, generally, </em>B. Ennis, Prisoners of Psychiatry (1972) ; T. Szasz, Law, Liberty and Psychiatry (1963) ; Note, Civil Commitment of the Mentally Ill: Theories and Procedures, 79 Harv.L.R. 1288 (1966). <em>Cf. </em>Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972) (due process standards applied to competency statutes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b114-17\">. <em>See, </em>Lucy Webb Hayes National Training School for Deaconesses and Missionaries v. Perotti, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 419 F.2d 704, 707-708 (1969) (Bazelon, C. J.) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-18\">The mental hospital functions in this new model as a repair shop rather than as a human junkyard. Confinement and physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>restraint are no longer the defining qualities of hospitalization. Since the emphasis is upon treatment, the atmosphere of the hospital should encourage recovery by allowing the patient to assume progressively greater and greater responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-17\">Since confinement and restraint may deny the patient the sense of responsibility and self-control essential to his recovery, the argument runs, limitations upon his freedom of movement are appropriate only when necessary for the safety of the patient or others. And since the restraint required for absolute safety may be inconsistent with effective therapy, calculated risks must sometimes be taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-29\">Real challenges and real responsibility for the patient imply the risk of real failures, however. Some patients will prove unready for responsibility, and may injure themselves or others. In a real sense these failures are the inevitable cost of any treatment program oriented toward returning patients to the community. But the law nevertheless must allocate at least the economic losses occasioned thereby.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
