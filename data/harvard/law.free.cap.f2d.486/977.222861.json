The alleged violation was the discharge of an employee for concerted activity protected by section 7. The issue presented is whether substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Douglas T. Martin was engaged in protected concerted activity which led to his discharge because he \u201cvoiced a series of complaints relating to working conditions at the job on which he was employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-22\">Douglas T. Martin was discharged from his work with C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc. (C &amp; I) on December 5, 1969, assertedly because his work had slowed down. The Board concluded the reason for his discharge was that he had voiced complaints concerning safety on the job site. This conduct amounted to protected concerted activity, according to the Board, because Martin\u2019s complaint was related to safety conditions on the job and was consistent with his rights set forth in the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>agreement his labor union had with his employer. Martin, a member of the Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Union, obtained work through the union with C &amp; I in August 1969 installing heating and air conditioning units at a construction project in San Jose, California. C &amp; I was the subcontractor on the project for MeKeon Construction. Three days before his discharge, Martin and a coworker were carrying a heating unit to an upstairs apartment when the temporary stairway they were using collapsed. Martin\u2019s co-worker sustained injuries in the accident. Martin immediately approached Stanley W. Smith, McKeon\u2019s general superintendent, and voiced his complaint about the unsafe condition of the temporary stairs. He declared that he would not carry furnaces up the stairs any more unless they were secured in place permanently. Smith replied, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to carry the furnaces up the stairs, then get off my job.\u201d (R.T. at 49). Martin agreed, \u201cOkay, I will.\u201d He did not, however, quit the job. Smith testified that he reported this incident to C &amp; I\u2019s project manager, Elwyn S. Dubey, and indicated that Martin had threatened to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">We deny the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement based on our conclusion that there was no substantial evidence to establish the employee had engaged in protected concerted activity. Section 7 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\">\u201cEmployees shall have the right . to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Our circuit has indicated that the term, \u201cconcerted activity\u201d means that the employee must be acting \u201cwith or on behalf of other employees, and not solely by and on behalf of the discharged employee himself.\u201d Pacific Electricord Co. v. NLRB, 361 F.2d 310 (9th Cir. 1966). We are unable to find any evidence that Martin\u2019s complaint was made for the purpose of mutually aiding and protecting any employees other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">We do not disagree in principle with the rule stated by the Second Circuit in NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., 388 F.2d 495, 500 (2d Cir. 1967) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH3\">\u201c[W]hile interest on the part of fellow employees would indicate a concerted purpose, activities involving attempts to enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement may be deemed to be for concerted purposes even in the absence of such interest by fellow employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-11\">Other circuits have adopted the <em>Inter-boro Contractors </em>rationale in finding protected concerted activity although the discharged employee was acting by himself. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Ben Pekin Corp., 452 F.2d 205 (7th Cir. 1971). <em>Contra, </em>NLRB v. Northern Metal Co., 440 F.2d 881 (3d Cir. 1971). We recognize the emergence of that rule but fail to see any evidence showing that the purpose of Martin\u2019s conduct was for the \u201cmutual aid and protection\u201d of other employees, or that it was an attempt to enforce the provisions of a mutual bargaining agreement. In our opinion Martin\u2019s complaint was an individual protest \u201con behalf of the discharged employee himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">A close consideration of Martin\u2019s conduct, alleged to amount to protected concerted activity, convinces us that this situation is distinguishable from those cases where courts have applied the <em>Inter-boro Contractors </em>rationale, and we therefore do not reach the problem. Edward B. Miller, Chairman of the NLRB, stated the distinction in his dissent to the Board\u2019s Decision and Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-13\">\u201cI cannot agree with the result reached by my colleagues here. In <em>In-terboro Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>cited in the majority opinion, the Board held that complaints made by an individual in an attempt to enforce the provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement were concerted activity protected by Section 7. The rationale for that holding, as expressed in an earlier case, was that \u2018implementation of such agreement by an employee is but an extension of the concerted ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>tivity giving rise to that agreement.\u2019 [Bunney Bros. Construction Company, 139 NLRB 1516, 1519.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-5\">\". . . Without at this time passing on the theory of <em>Interboro, </em>I find my colleagues\u2019 decision here to go considerably beyond the decision in that case. In <em>Interboro, </em>the discharged individual designated the collective-bargaining agreement as the source of his claimed rights. In the present case . . . [t]here is no evidence he made any reference to the collective-bargaining agreement, or even that he knew there was one, or that he was seeking in any way to implement its terms .... The majority\u2019s opinion demonstrates only that Martin <em>might </em>have taken concerted action, or <em>might </em>have made a claim under the collective-bargaining agreement, had he thought of it. But the fact is there is no evidence that he did. Under these circumstances, the finding that the employee\u2019s complaints were \u2018concerted\u2019 activity is based upon such remote and unsupported inferences that I must dissent from the majority in this respect.\u201d C.T. at 53-54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">We share the dissenting Board Chairman\u2019s view and thus refuse to enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">We might note further that Martin\u2019s complaint regarding the stairs was related to an isolated incident. Martin was never asked to go up improperly secured stairs on any other occasion. Moreover, his complaint was merely an off-the-cuff remark directed to the job site foreman of the general contractor, who was not directly related to Martin\u2019s employer, C &amp; I. That afternoon Martin talked to supervisors from his own company but he did not raise a complaint. Finally, there is not a scintilla of evidence that Martin intended to implement rights under the collective bargaining agreement. Martin\u2019s answers to questions by the trial examiner are illuminating on these matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-11\">\u201cTRIAL EXAMINER: I have a couple of questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-12\">Q. (By Trial Examiner:) How often did you carry furnaces up stairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-13\">A. In a week we just did it, in a week, roughly about 30 furnaces, I\u2019d say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-14\">Q. And how many stairs were blocked rather than nailed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-15\">A. Only about, to my knowledge, only the last three buildings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-16\">Q. And how many furnaces had you carried up those last three buildings? A. I think I only carried up the one, the building where they had fallen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-17\">Q. How many, did you carry any furnaces up any other stairs that were blocked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-18\">A. Not to my knowledge. Most of them were all in place, finished homes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajz\">Q. This was the only one, then, that was blocked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-19\">A. That I know of sir, yes, sir. There was about six of us taking furnaces up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-20\">Q. Well, you\u2019ve worked in other projects, haven\u2019t you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-21\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-22\">Q. Were they blocked or nailed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-23\">A. They\u2019re always nailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-24\">Q. Always nailed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-25\">A. Usually always nailed, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-26\">Q. This was the first time you came across a blocked stair ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-27\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-28\">Q. Well, after you told them that you wouldn\u2019t go up the stairs any more that were blocked, who did you tell that to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-29\">A. To Stan Smith, the MeKeon Construction foreman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-30\">Q. Did you tell it to Mr. Dubey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxFf\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Q. Did they ever ask you to go up those stairs again? That were blocked, stairs that were blocked, with a furnace?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-4\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-5\">Q. Did you file a grievance about the stair condition, condition of the stairs with your Union?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-6\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-7\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-8\">A. I didn\u2019t know I could. I didn\u2019t know you could do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-9\">Q. You\u2019re a member of the Union? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-10\">Q. Did you ever read the Union contract ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-12\">Q. Did you know that the contract provides for adjustments of grievances ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-13\">A. I was under the impression it was something when it was done wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As6Y\">Q. What do you mean \u2018done wrong\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6W\">A. Something like you\u2019re in an accident, or you\u2019re fired illegally, or something of that nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-14\">Q. Well, isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re alleging here? That you were fired illegally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-16\">Q. And the conditions were unsafe? Doesn\u2019t the contract provide for safe working conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-17\">A. Yes, sir. I didn\u2019t know what safe working conditions consisted of. My booklet \u2014 I didn\u2019t read through it, and didn\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-18\">Q. The point is, you didn\u2019t file a grievance ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-19\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-20\">TRIAL EXAMINER: I have no more questions.\u201d R.T. at 75-78.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-21\">We agree that, under these circumstances, Martin did not engage in conduct amounting to protected concerted activity. Not only was he acting by himself, as were the employees in <em>Inter-ioro Contractors </em>and related cases, but he was also acting <em>for </em>himself. We fail to see that his actions were meant to be for the mutual aid and protection of any others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-23\">The Board\u2019s order is set aside and will not be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
