Tyler, Jr., District Judge, releasing relator, a state prisoner, on $10,000 bail pending respondent\u2019s appeal to our Court from an order entered by Judge Tyler on July 17, 1973, 361 F.Supp. 843, granting relator\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless relator is retried by the State of New York within 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Following reversal by the New York Court of Appeals, People v. Baker, 23 N.Y.2d 307, 244 N.E.2d 232, 296 N.Y.S.2d 745 (1968), of an earlier conviction of relator of murder in the first degree, attempted murder in the first degree and attempted robbery in the first degree, relator was retried and convicted of the same offenses on April 9, 1970 in the Supreme Court, New York County. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. The latter conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division on May 23, 1972. People v. Rice, 39 A.D.2d 840, 332 N.Y.S.2d 1010 (1st Dept. 1972). Relator\u2019s appeal to the New York Court of Appeals from his second conviction is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">Judge Tyler ordered relator released on bail pending respondent\u2019s appeal to this Court on the ground that relator\u2019s \u201cbackers and friends\u201d will assert sufficient influence or control over him to prevent him from fleeing. We disagree. He was living with his mother and grandmother at the time of the two murders with which he is charged. He faces a life sentence if his 1970 conviction is affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals. We agree with respondent that relator should not be released on bail pending respondent\u2019s appeal to this Court from the district court\u2019s order granting relator\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1970). In other \u00a7 2254 cases where the district court has granted the writ, this Court has carefully refrained from granting bail, e. g., United States ex rel. Miller and Quinones v. LaVallee (Docket No. MR 4212, decided September 21, 1970); United States ex rel. Vincent Cerullo v. Follette (Docket No. 33381, decided March 3, 1969); United States ex rel. Joseph v. LaVallee (Docket No. 32950, decided December 17, 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s motion to stay the district court\u2019s order of August 3, 1973 releasing relator on bail. Our stay will remain in effect until the decision of our Court on respondent\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order of July 17, 1973. We also order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that respondent\u2019s appeal in this Court be expedited as follows: respondent\u2019s brief and appendix shall be filed on or before September 20, 1973; relator\u2019s brief and appendix shall be filed on or before October 10, 1973; and the appeal shall be heard during the week of October 15, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Motion for stay granted; appeal expedited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
