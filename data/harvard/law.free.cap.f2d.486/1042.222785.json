In this appeal, Dowdy contends that the court below improperly denied the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination enjoyed by a prosecution witness by requiring the witness to testify at Dowdy\u2019s trial, and that Dowdy has standing to protest this alleged violation of the witness\u2019 constitutional right. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">In the course of Dowdy\u2019s trial, the prosecution called as a witness Herbert Freeman, who had earlier entered a guilty plea in connection with the same offenses charged against Dowdy. Following Freeman\u2019s damaging testimony on direct examination as to Dowdy\u2019s participation in the robbery, Dowdy objected that Freeman was being forced to testify, without advice of his retained counsel, in violation of the witness\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights. Holding that Freeman\u2019s guilty plea constituted a waiver of his testimonial privilege, the court overruled Dowdy\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">Even if Dowdy\u2019s argument with respect to Freeman\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege were persuasive, the opportunity to urge his theory must be denied for lack of standing. Since he was not compelled to testify, Dowdy does not complain of violations of his own Fifth Amendment rights, but only of alleged infringements of the privilege enjoyed by another. As this court has previously held, one cannot assert in his own defense the denial of another\u2019s right against self-incrimination. \u201cSome constitutional rights are personal and may not be vicariously asserted. Among these is the right against self-incrimination.\u201d Hall v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 45, 48 (citations omitted). <em>See </em>Gissendanner v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1973, 482 F.2d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-15\">The district court properly overruled Dowdy\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
