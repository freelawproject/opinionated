Defendant-appel-lee, H. M. Farrier, is trustee in bankruptcy for Traders Compress Company, Inc. (herein Traders), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pioneer Products, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Plaintiff-appellant, National Equipment Leasing Corporation (herein National), is a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On April 28, 1969, National entered into an Equipment Lease Agreement with North America Corporation (herein \u201cold\u201d North America); a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Dallas, Texas. <em>Prior </em>to the execution of the lease agreement, \u201cold\u201d North America entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Traders. On June 16, 1969, <em>subsequent </em>to the lease agreement, Traders acquired all of the assets and <em>assumed all the liabilities </em>of \u201cold\u201d North America, and \u201cold\u201d North America was dissolved. On July 1, 1969, Argosy Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Traders, effected a change of name to North America Corporation. Thereafter, all leasing arrangements and business between National and the Traders\u2019 companies was conducted through the officers of \u201cnew\u201d North America Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">On February 1, 1970, all obligations pursuant to the lease agreement came into default. On April 12, 1971, National instituted an action for damages pursuant to a liquidated damages clause in the lease agreement against Traders in the 193rd Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas. Prior to the disposition of this action, an involuntary petition under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act was filed against Traders in the United States district court. National filed its claim in the district court for $1,266,582.35 against Traders; the claim not disposed of in the state court action. The district court ruled that those lease obligations assumed by \u201cold\u201d North America were recoverable from Traders; but those obligations assumed by the \u201cnew\u201d North America were not. Ten of the twelve lease arrangements made pursuant to the lease agreement were made with \u201cnew\u201d North America. Our jurisdiction rests in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The Equipment Lease Agreement is at the center of this dispute. It is Schedule I to Exhibit A attached to the claim filed in bankruptcy. By the terms of the agreement, National agreed to lease, and North America agreed to hire \u201cunits\u201d of farm sprinkler equipment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>be sub-let through North America to individual farmers. North America did not personally use the equipment. The arrangement is best described by appel-lee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cNorth America Corporation would seek farmers to whom they could lease farm equipment and machinery. After locating prospects, North America Corporation would refer a file concerning each prospect to National for credit' check and approval. Upon approval by National, North America would execute a sublease agreement between itself and the farmer and would at that time attach an additional schedule to the Equipment Lease Agreement. That schedule would describe the farmer and establish the relationship between National and North America as principal lessor and lessee of that equipment.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 4.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The first two obligations for which the district court held Traders liable (Schedules NA-1 and NA-2), were executed by \u201cold\u201d North America through its President, Robert Poston. Schedules NA-3 through and including NA-12 were executed by \u201cnew\u201d North America through its President, E. T. Beynon. The lease agreement provided that the schedules made pursuant to the agreement would \u201c . . .be attached hereto and to become a part hereof as same are executed from time to time by the parties hereto.\u201d (Vol. II, Record, Schedule 1, Par. 1.) The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASOM\">\u201cThat only schedules which were executed by the same parties as those who had executed the master lease agreement could, under the terms of the master lease agreement, constitute valid schedules to be attached and incorporated into the master lease agreement.\u201d (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, at 2, Par. 6, Vol. 1, Record, at 77.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Since Beynon and \u201cnew\u201d North America were not of the original parties to the agreement, the court reasoned that Traders, as the parent of \u201cnew\u201d North America, could not be obligated-on the schedules executed after the dissolution of \u201cold\u201d North America.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Traders admits that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201c . . . did assume the base lease agreement by merger, became a party to the agreement, and likewise became a party to and obligor under the base agreement, including all schedules \u2018executed from time to time by the parties hereto.\u2019 It is undisputed that \u2018the parties hereto\u2019 as identified in the base lease agreement \u2014which National rightly insists must govern all subsequent undertakings pursuant to it \u2014 are National and old North America Corporation. Upon merger, those parties hereto became National and Traders, and Traders became liable for any schedules executed by National and Traders pursuant to the base lease agreement.\u201d (Appel-lee\u2019s Brief at 5.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">However, Traders argues, neither Traders nor \u201cold\u201d North America executed Schedules NA-3 through NA-12; only \u201cnew\u201d North America was a party with National to those schedules, and Traders cannot be liable for its subsidiary\u2019s obligations in the absence of a showing of fraud or instrumentality relationship. This argument rests upon a finding that each schedule constituted a separate contract apart from the original lease agreement of April 28, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">National argues that each schedule was a part of the original lease agreement: \u201cadjuncts or exhibits to the main instrument.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13.) Traders has admitted that it became a party to the original base agreement through its acquisition of \u201cold\u201d North America. In this context, National argues Traders delegated the performance of its obligation under the original agreement to \u201cnew\u201d North America; and that in the absence of a novation of the original agreement, Traders\u2019 obligation to National was not discharged. National correctly notes that, as a minimum requirement, novation must be preceded by mutual agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ment by the original and substituted parties. There is no proof, nor is it argued by Traders, that an agreement for a novation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">From these opposing arguments and the decision of the district court, we must decide, as a matter of law, the effect of the foregoing events. The broad question is whether Traders was liable for Schedules NA-3 through and including NA-12. The narrow question is whether the schedules constituted separate contracts between National and \u201cnew\u201d North America, or whether they were amendments to the original agreement upon which Traders is admittedly liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Each schedule, Schedules NA-1 through NA-12, were two pages in length; the first page describing the property leased, and the second primarily assigning all rental payments due North America to National. Each was stated to be \u201csubject to the terms and conditions of the lease agreement and appendices.\u201d In addition, said schedules contained a clause (similar to that found in Schedule NA-12), that the schedule was \u201cto be attached to and become part of Lease Agreement dated April 28, 1969.\u201d (Schedules at 2, Par. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Traders predicates its claim that it was not a party to Schedules NA-3 through NA-12 (that is, that such schedules were <em>separate </em>contracts), on the fact that they were executed by E. T. Beynon, President of \u201cnew\u201d North America; and that Traders never gave its consent to \u201cnew\u201d North America to enter into new contracts, nor to bind Traders under the original agreement to which \u201cnew\u201d North America was not a party. We find it unnecessary to consider whether Traders gave \u201cnew\u201d North America authority to execute the schedules, because we hold that the schedules were part of the original agreement to which Traders was obligated. Although Traders has argued that the schedules constituted separate contracts Traders has not established that they were separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">The following considerations are in our opinion determinative:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">1.) Each Schedule looked to the original agreement and each stated it was \u201cto become\u201d a part of the original agreement. The original agreement provided that it would \u201cbe construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d (Section XIII of the Equipment Lease Agreement (Vol. II, Record, Schedule l.)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">In Neville v. Scott, 182 Pa.Super. 448, 127 A.2d 755 (1956), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvaina stated that where contractual instruments, by their terms, are mutually inclusive such that one instrument has no meaning without the other, the instruments \u201cwill be read together, and each will be construed with reference to the other.\u201d Neville v. Scott, <em>supra, </em>127 A.2d at 757.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">\u201c T.f contracting parties choose, they may express their agreement in one or more writings and, in such circumstances, the several documents are to be interpreted together, each one contributing (to the extent of its worth) to the ascertainment of the true intent of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from International Milling Co. v. Hachmeis-ter, Inc., 380 Pa. 407, 110 A.2d 186, 191 (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">In the matter before us, the original agreement defined the parties\u2019 obligations with respect to future lease transactions. No obligations under the original agreement were to be created until such time as the parties executed schedules in compliance with the original agreement. Accordingly, the schedules did not define the parties\u2019 rights and obligations ; rather, they defined the terms of individual transactions made in comformity with the original agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>There is no proof the schedules purported to define or create rights and obligations other than those contained on the original contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">2. ) \u201cNew\u201d North America, in dealing with National, assumed that it was operating pursuant to the original agreement as though it were a party to that agreement. No effort was made on the part of \u201cnew\u201d North America to suggest that it was not a party to the original contract. It asserted in fact, that it signed the schedule \u201cas a party to\u201d the original Lease Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">3. ) National assumed that the schedules were a part of the original contract, and that it was dealing with the original contracting party. National alleges that it did not learn that \u201cold\u201d North America had been dissolved until March 25, 1970 \u2014 almost two months after the obligations had come into default. Traders disputes this, but fails to offer any countervailing proof. Instead, Traders merely suggests that the date of National\u2019s first knowledge of the dissolution of \u201cold\u201d North America is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Page 2 of each schedule contains an assignment of rentals from \u201cnew\u201d North America to National. As an example, all schedules, like Schedule NA-12 recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\"><em>\u201cKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS </em>THAT NORTH AMERICA CORPORATION, A TEXAS CORPORATION, HAS EXECUTED THIS DATE SCHEDULE NA-12 <em>TO BE ATTACHED TO AND BECOME PART OF LEASE AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 28, 1969.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">This obviously is not the language of a contract separate from, and different than, the April 28, 1969 contract. It demonstrates an intent of \u201cnew\u201d North America to be bound by and become a party to the terms of the original April 28, 1969 Agreement between old North America and National. In turn, Traders intent to be bound under the schedule is evidenced by, and unaffected by, Traders\u2019 unilateral delegations of its obligations to perform to new North America.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">In finding that the schedules and the original agreement constitute a single integrated contract, together with Traders\u2019 admission that it is liable under the original agreement, it follows that Traders is obligated under each of the schedules. This is the only reasonable interpretation of the facts. Through the merger of \u201cold\u201d North America into Traders, Traders became obligated upon the original agreement. Traders thereby attempted to discharge its obligations by delegating its duties to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Argosy Corporation. To facilitate this, it changed Argosy\u2019s corporate name to North America. By virtue of this delegation of performance (and notwithstanding considerations of limited liability based on separate corporate entity), Traders remained obligated for performance of all duties bargained for under the lease agreement. Further, this conclusion is inescapable in view of a lack of either consent or contractual authority given by National to Traders to delegate duties. National\u2019s consent was never sought, nor was it granted to delegate its obligations. The contract prohibits assignment in the absence of written consent. (Equipment Lease Agreement, Section V(a) at 7). In considering a similar situation, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court established the following general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">\u201cWhile a party to a contract may assign his rights and benefits thereunder, he may not, unless the contract so provides, assign his liability under the contract to perform duties involving his personal ability, integrity, credit or responsibility.\u201d Saxe v. Feinstein, 365 Pa. 473, 77 A.2d 419, 421 (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">For these above stated reasons, the decision of the district court, to the extent that it found Traders not liable for all schedules made pursuant to the Equipment Lease Agreement of April 28, 1969, is reversed. The district court\u2019s Order and Partial Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Judgment of January 23, 1973, is vacated, and the case remanded with instructions to proceed to a full trial of the matter before it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">.
