A. Sheaf-fer Pen Company (Company). The Board cross-petitions for enforcement. Determining that the Company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Board ordered the Company to cease and desist from an unfair labor practice by removing from its personnel files and destroying certain questionnaires and any information derived therefrom. The Board\u2019s decision and order is reported at 199 N.L.R.B. No. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The only issue presented is whether or not the Company\u2019s use of a questionnaire <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to ascertain whether prospective employees would cross a picket line in the event of a strike was a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1), in that it interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of their \u00a7 7 rights to organize and bargain collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In September, 1968, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (Union) and the Company signed a collective bargaining agreement that contained a no-strike clause and was due to expire on October 1, 1971. In July, 1971,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Union gave notice of its intention to reopen the contract, and the first bargaining meeting was held on August 17th. Beginning August 20th and continuing through September 29th, the contested questionnaires were attached to the Company\u2019s employment applications. On September 30th, the Company discontinued using the questionnaire, because the Union had agreed to an indefinite extension of the old contract with a 10-day notice of termination provision. On October 31st, the Union gave notice it would strike November 11th, unless agreement on a new contract was reached. Use of the questionnaire was resumed November 4th and continued until November 22nd, when a new contract was signed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The administrative law judge concluded that the questionnaire\u2019s use was a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1), because no assurances against reprisal were included in the questionnaire, as required by Struksnes Construction Co., 165 N.L.R. B. No. 102, 65 L.R.R.M. 1385 (1967). The Board adopted this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On appeal, the Company argues that it had substantial justification for use of the questionnaire; that without a showing of anti-union animus, such questioning does not constitute a \u00a7 8(a)(1) violation; and that the Board improperly applied a per <em>se </em>rule in finding an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> It is established that a company has the right to hire permanent replacements for economic strikers. N.L. R. B. v. MacKay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co., 304 U.S. 333, 345, 58 S.Ct. 904, 82 L.Ed. 1381 (1938). The Company would have us extend that right to make any company conduct to locate replacements lawful under the Act. We do not believe that the right to hire replacements gives an employer automatic immunity for conduct violative of the Act. <em>See </em>N.L.R.B. v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221, 83 S. Ct. 1139, 10 L.Ed.2d 308 (1963). It is conceded that the Company did not comply with the standards set out in Struksnes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in that no assurances against reprisal were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In adopting the <em>Struksnes </em>standards in N.L.R.B. v. Harry F. Berggren &amp; Sons, Inc., 406 F.2d 239, 244 (8th Cir. 1969), this Court found they were \u201csoundly based in an attempt to balance the right of management to communicate with its employees and the employees\u2019 statutory rights to be free from interference, restraint and coercion in engaging in organizational activity.\u201d Although this Court adopted the <em>Struksnes </em>standards in a case dealing with employer interrogation to determine a union\u2019s majority status, the standards apply equally well to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The questioning in this case carried with it the inherent implication that the answer given would have affected the applicants\u2019 chances of employment. Since the questionnaire became a part of the applicants\u2019 permanent personnel records, we think that the applicants had a reasonable apprehension that their answer could have been used to affect future job security. Such an atmosphere created a fear of economic reprisal. Since the applicants knew that they were being solicited as possible replacements for striking workers, the questionnaire\u2019s use was likely to serve as an implied threat or warning to the prospective employees of possible adverse consequences of any participation in concerted activity. As was found in Berggren:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201cThese adverse effects can follow interrogation regardless of the employer\u2019s motive. Thus, if employees\u2019 rights are not to be subject to derogation by the right of management to poll employees for a legitimate purpose, all of the safeguards enunciated in <em>Struksnes </em>should be observed.\u201d (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Berggren, supra </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Requiring compliance with these standards does not constitute enforcing a <em>per se </em>rule, since these standards represent a proper <em>balancing </em>of the employees\u2019 right to organize and the employers\u2019 right of communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Viewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding use of the questionnaire and its unmistakable potential for abuse of the employees\u2019 protected \u00a7 7 rights, we think the Board\u2019s decision finds substantial support in the record as a whole. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-28\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">. The questionnaire involved was attached <em>to </em>the Company\u2019s regular employment application and no specific mention was made of the question to prospective employees when they made application for employment. The questionnaire read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">\u201cThe W. A. Sheaffer Pen Company is currently engaged in contract negotiations. In the event of a strike, the plant may be picketed. Would you be willing, under these conditions, to cross a picket line when entering or leaving the plant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">_ Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-14\">_No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-15\">(Signature and date)\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-16\">. All dates hereinafter also occurred in 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-17\">. The record shows that <em>649 </em>applicants were given applications with the questionnaire attached ; 440 made \u201cyes\u201d answers, 185 made \u201cno\u201d answers, and 14 did not answer. We note that these totals only add up to 639, but there is no explanation in the record as to the status of the missing 10 applicants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-20\">. The Board in <em>8truhsn.es Construction, Co., supra, </em>held :</p>\n<p id=\"b257-21\">\u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, the polling of employees will be violative of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act unless the following safeguards are observed: (1) the purpose of the poll is to determine the truth of a union\u2019s claim of majority, (2) this purpose is communicated to the employees, (3) assurances against reprisal are given, (4) the employees are polled by secret ballot, and (5) the employer has not engaged in unfair labor practices or otherwise created a coercive atmosphere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-22\">165 N.L.R.B. at 1063.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
