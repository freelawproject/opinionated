(Supp.1973) to acquire in personam jurisdiction over appellants who are nonresidents of Utah. Appellee is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas and with a valid permit to do business in Utah. Appellants contend that Utah\u2019s long arm stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ute by its own terms is restricted to use by plaintiffs who are citizens of Utah. On motions to quash service and to dismiss, , the trial court decided that Utah\u2019s long arm statute was available to appellee, but it allowed this interlocutory appeal since disposition here might be dispositive of the case. Thereafter this court i-estricted the appeal to the issue \u201cRelating only to non-residency of the foreign corporation and not including, at this stage of the appeal, the question of sufficiency of contacts for jurisdiction over the appellants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">\n<em>1. Background of the Litigation:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The appeal comes here on the pleadings and the stipulation of the parties. Appellee claims that appellants Meier and Suckling conspired with Anthony Hatsis, Toledo Mining Company and Globe, Incorporated, all of whom are citizens of Utah and other named parties who are nonresidents of that state but are not parties to this appeal. The gist of the alleged conspiracy was to sell ap-pellee certain mining properties, located in Nevada, for amounts of money far in excess of their value by corrupting ap-pellee\u2019s trusted agents to forsake their duties and to participate in the scheme to defraud appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Appellee brought suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1971) seeking an accounting and restitution. Meier and Suckling moved separately to quash service and dismiss on various grounds, one of which was that Utah\u2019s long arm statute could not be used by appellee because it was a nonresident corporation. However the trial court asserting jurisdiction under the long arm statute denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">\n<em>2. Utah\u2019s Long Arm Statute:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">It is true that Utah\u2019s Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> differs in one respect from the uniform long arm statute: Section 78-27-22 is devoted to a statement of legislative intent declaring its purpose in enacting the Act to be to \u201cprovide its <em>citizens </em>with an effective means of redress against non resident persons, who incur obligations to citizens entitled to the state\u2019s protection.\u201d And it further declares that \u201cto ensure maximum protection to <em>citizens </em>of this state, [the Act] should be applied so as to assert jurisdiction over non resident defendants . . .\u201d (Emphasis in each instance has been supplied.) Other states have also inserted purpose sections or clauses using the word \u201cresident\u201d rather than \u201ccitizen\u201d in their Acts (e. g. Texas, Mississippi). However, the operative or enacting section of Utah\u2019s Act, Section 78-27-24, as well as those of Texas and Mississippi, are substantially identical to the Uniform Act. See, Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act, 9B U.L.A. \u00a7 1.03 (1966). Section 78-27-24 grants state court ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>risdiction, without any restriction whatever, providing in pertinent part that: <em>\u201cAny person </em>.... whether or not a citizen or resident of this state, who . does any of the following enumerated acts, submits- himself . to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to <em>any claim </em>arising from: (1) The transaction of <em>any </em>business within this state;\u201d (Emphasis supplied). This language neither expressly nor by implication precludes nonresidents who have a permit to do business in Utah from using the Act to protect themselves against nonresidents who have incurred obligations in Utah to such persons. Indeed, the Act in no instance says that it was adopted solely for the protection of Utah citizens, residents or domestic corporations. While it is true that the motivation of the Utah Legislature was to protect its electors, Utah citizens, it specifically authorized jurisdiction, in the operating or enacting section of the Act, of <em>\u201cany </em>claim\u201d arising from <em>any </em>of the enumerated acts set out in the statute that were performed by a nonresident. Moreover, other sections of the Act support this construction. For example, Section 78-27-23 setting forth \u201cDefinitions\u201d used in the Act defines \u201cany person\u201d as being \u201cany individual, firm, company, association or corporation\u201d without specifying any limitation whatever ; and \u201ctransaction of business within the state\u201d is declared to include activities of a nonresident \u201cwhich affect persons or businesses within the state of Utah\u201d without limitation to citizens. A foreign corporation lawfully authorized by the state to do business there is clearly a \u201cbusiness within the state of Utah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">\n<em>8. The Application of the Act:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In the light of these considerations we find that the Act is available to the ap-pellee. We are supported in this conclusion by other rationales:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">(a) In both Mississippi and Texas the courts have held that their statutes are available to nonresidents despite the language of each limits service on nonresidents to those acts which cause injury to \u201cresidents.\u201d In C. H. Leavell &amp; Co. and Peter Kiewit Sons\u2019 Co. v. J. V. Doster, 211 So.2d 813 (1968) the Supreme Court of Mississippi found the nonresident plaintiffs, who were qualified to do business in the state, to be residents within the meaning of the Act; and the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas likewise has construed its statute, which is similar to that of Mississippi. National Truckers Service, Inc. v. Aero Systems, Inc., 480 S.W.2d 455 (1972, wr. ref. n. r. e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">(b) The uniform long' arm statute was patterned after that of Illinois. See 9B U.L.A. \u00a7 1.03 (1966), Commissioners\u2019 Note, at 310-313. In a New Mexico case, Clews v. Stiles, 303 F.2d 290 (10 Cir. 1960), this court held that in adopting the language of the Illinois Act, the Legislature of New Mexico also adopted the construction of that Act as an; nounced by the Supreme Court of Illinois. The Illinois Act has been used again and again by foreign corporations. Continental Nut Co. v. Robert L. Berner Co., 345 F.2d 395 (7th Cir. 1965); National Gas Appliance Corporation v. A. B. Electrolux, 270 F.2d 472 (7th Cir. 1959) cert, denied, 361 U.S. 959, 80 S.Ct., 584, 4 L.Ed.2d 542 (1960). Since the' Utah Act, Section 78-27-24, is virtually identical to the language of the Uniform Act, it would appear that the same reasoning applies in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">(c) Furthermore every state adopting the Uniform Act and having decided cases available has permitted both domestic and foreign corporations to use it: B. K. Sweeney Co. v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., Okl., 429 P.2d 759 (Colorado plaintiff using Oklahoma long arm statute); Oil and Gas Ventures, First 1958 Fund, Ltd. v. Kung, 250 F.Supp. 744 (D.C.1966) (Delaware corporation with principal place of business in New Jersey suing in New York); Wilshire Oil Company of Texas v. Riffe, 10 Cir., 409 F.2d 1277 (Delaware corporation us<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ing Kansas long arm statute). See also other cases cited in 3(a), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">(d) The Utah Supreme Court has decided cases in which it has allowed domestic corporations to sue nonresident corporations Foreign Study League v. Holland American Line, 27 Utah 2d 442, 497 P.2d 244 (1972), and Hydroswift Corporation v. Louie\u2019s Boats and Motors, Inc., 27 Utah 2d 233, 494 P.2d 532 (1972). In another case, Rudd v. Crown International, 26 Utah 263, 488 P.2d 298 (1971), the plaintiff, an individual resident of Utah, was permitted to sue a nonresident corporation under the Act. These cases indicate two things: (1) domestic corporations are allowed to use the long arm statute; and (2) it is also available to a \u201cresident\u201d as distinguished from the limitation advanced by appellants, i. e., availability to \u201ccitizens\u201d only.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">(e) This leads us to Utah\u2019s treatment of nonresident corporations with a permit to engage in business in the state. Section 16-10-103 of the Utah Code provides that such corporations shall \u201cenjoy the same, but no greater, rights and privileges as a domestic corporation . . .\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 16-10-103 (1973). This mandate would require Utah to afford appellee the same access to its courts as it allows domestic corporations. Utah\u2019s long arm statute, as we have noted, is not to the contrary. Indeed a holding to the contrary might well run <em>contra </em>to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 69 S.Ct. 1291, 93 L. Ed. 1544 (1949) where the Court held that where a state elects to admit foreign corporations to transact business \u201cthe adopted corporations are entitled to equal protection with the state\u2019s own corporate progeny.\u201d 337 U.S. 562, at 571, 69 S.Ct. 1291, at 1296. Much earlier the Court had specifically held \u201cthat they should have like access to the courts of the country for the protection of their persons and property . . .\u201d Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312, 334, 42 S.Ct. 124, 130, 66 L.Ed. 254 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">(f) It is hornbook law that where possible a statute should be construed so that it will be constitutional and in harmony with other statutes. Here Utah has not expressly limited the availability of its long arm statute to citizens of that state; to accept the appellants\u2019 contention would be tantamount to reading into the statute a provision that not only would offend the Fourteenth Amendment but also be out of step with Section 16-10-103, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">(g) We read Section 78-27-22, <em>supra, </em>as does the Supreme Court of Utah as \u201cprefatory language\u201d (See, <em>Foreign Study League, supra, </em>27 Utah 2d 442, 497 P.2d at 245) \u2014 a preamble merely setting forth the purpose of the Legislature in enacting the statute. It is, therefore, neither essential nor controlling in the construction of the Act where the operative sections are clear and unambiguous. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160 (1936); Yazoo &amp; Mississippi RR v. Thomas, 132 U.S. 174, 10 S.Ct. 68, 33 L.Ed. 302 (1889); Coosaw Mining Co. v. South Carolina, 144 U.S. 550, 12 S.Ct. 689, 36 L.Ed. 537 (1892). Also see 50 Am. Jur. Statutes, Sec. 152 (1944), 82 C.J.S. Statutes \u00a7 349 (1953); Huntworth v. Tanner, 87 Wash. 670, 152 P. 523 (1915) and Continental Oil Co. v. City of Santa Fe, 25 N.M. 94, 177 P. 742 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The order appealed from is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">.
