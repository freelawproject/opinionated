Defendant, claiming the same to be erroneous, appeals from that part of the interlocutory decree rendered upon his default and in favor of plaintiff, whereby it was adjudged that, until the further order of the court, \u201cdefendant pay plaintiff twenty-five dollars per month alimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Clearly, the trial court erred in making the order, the effect of which was to grant relief in excess of that demanded in the complaint. Not only was there an absence of any prayer for alimony, but the \u25a0 complaint contains no allegations upon which to base such prayer. Section 580 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that where no answer is filed by defendant, the relief granted plaintiff \u201ccannot exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint.\u201d As stated, the prayer was for a dissolution of the bonds of matrimony only, and the power of the court to grant such relief was not enlarged by the prayer for general relief against defendant who had made default. <em>(Staacke </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>125 Cal. 309, [57 Pac. 1012]. See, also, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>150 Cal. 99, [11 Ann. Cas. 520, 88 Pac. <em>267]; Foley </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>120 Cal. 42, [65 Am.
