The abstract does not set out the instructions, nor is there any complaint of them in the appellant\u2019s brief, but we have read them in the record and found that the jury were advised fully as to the rights of the appellant upon the theory that the appellee had failed to perform his contract.</p> <p id=\"b402-6\" pgmap=\"402\">The jury must have been satisfied of the truth of the appellee\u2019s position on this point, and as they were not misled as to the law, their verdict, in view of the conflicting evidence, should be accepted as a finality. The judgment will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
