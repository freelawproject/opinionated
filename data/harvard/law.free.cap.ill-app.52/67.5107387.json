Afterward the municipal authorities caused a survey of the city and its additions to be made. This survey, in which this strip appears as a street, was reported to the council January . 30, 1868. By an act approved March 29, 1869, amending the city charter, the General Assembly declared that this survey, upon being spread on the county records, should be the only legal and correct survey of the-city of Clinton. It was filed for record April 16, 1869. Here, then, is the highest evidence of acceptance. There was also some proof of work done on the street by the city. The judgment is right and will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
