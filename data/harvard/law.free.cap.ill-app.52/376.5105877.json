Exemptions\u2014Requisites of a Schedule.\u2014The schedule under Ch. 52, R. S., entitled \u201cExemptions,\u201d should list separately each article of a distinct kind, or of a distinct quality, grade, or description of the same kind, in order to enable appraisers the more readily to fix the value of each article contained in it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b372-12\" pgmap=\"372(18) 373(29)\">2. Appraisement\u2014Insufficiency of Waiver.\u2014When appraisers have been appointed to make an appraisement under Ch. 52, R. S., entitled \u201cExemptions,\u201d and the same is made by them and accepted by the debtor, he waives all imperfections in it and can not be heard to object to it afterward.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">3.

Exemptions\u2014Imperfect Appraisement\u2014Debtor Selection.\u2014If a schedule and appraisement, as made by the appraisers, does not enable the debtor to select specific articles at appraised values, he should seek to have them corrected.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-7\" pgmap=\"373\">5. Exemptions\u2014Mortgaged Property.\u2014A. defendant is the absolute owner of property as against the execution creditor and the officer having the execution, and as against mortgagees also, subject only to the lien of their mortgages, which they were not bound and might never be disposed to enforce. The debtor\u2019s interest, notwithstanding the mortgage, is subject to execution.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-8\" pgmap=\"373\">6. Exemptions\u2014Construction of the Statute.\u2014All the proceedings under the statute of exemptions show that it contemplates only specific, tangible articles of property, which can be taken, delivered, returned, replevied, etc. An equity of redemption, a mere lien or equitable claim, without possession, is susceptible of neither.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-9\" pgmap=\"373\">7. Exemptions\u2014Duty of Appraisers. \u2014 Appraisers are authorized and required only to fix the fair value of what they can see and at what they can ascertain by inspection and handling. They have no authority to consider and adjust equities between an execution debtor and third persons, or to ascertain whether a mortgage was given for money borrowed, for future advances, or for indemnity to the mortgagee against a liability which might or might not arise.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-10\" pgmap=\"373\">8. Exemptions\u2014Debtor's Right to Property Defined.\u2014If the execution debtor takes it as exempt, he must take it at the value fixed upon it by the appraisers, unaffected by other liens upon it. If he has given a mortgage upon it, the presumption is that he has had and enjoyed so much of its value, and there is no hardship in denying to him the claim to have it again. In this proceeding he is not authorized to set up a claim for the mortgagee that is not prejudiced by the execution.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-11\" pgmap=\"373\">Memorandum.\u2014Replevin.

Also the fixtures, consisting of bar, mirror, stoves, one safe, desk, pictures there, and all of the articles of furniture, comprising the bar in said saloon, embracing all mirrors, pictures and glassware, and any and all book accounts showing, and all articles levied on by the said Moffett, and in the building known as the Oak Palace saloon, one shot gun, two target rifles, and that said property are first subject to the two mortgages heretofore mentioned in this schedule on opposite page.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">\u201cThomas E. Sheehey.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">Appellant did not deliver the barrels and kegs of liquor mentioned, and the question is whether appellee, by the proceedings shown, was entitled to them as exempt from the execution, or more specifically, did he make, substantially, such a schedule and selection as the statute required, to entitle him to hold them.</p> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">That requirement is that the debtor shall \u201c make a schedule of all of his personal property of every kind and character, including money on hand and debts due and owing to the debtor, and deliver the same to the officer having the execution,\u201d and after the appraiser shall have fixed a \u201c fair valuation upon each article contained in said schedule,\u201d he shall \u201c then select from such schedule the articles he may desire to retain, the aggregate value of which shall not exceed the amount exempted, to which he may be entitled \u201d (which in this case was $400 worth), \u201c and deliver the. remainder to the officer having the writ.\u201d R. S., Ch. 52, Sec. 14.</p> <p id=\"b376-8\" pgmap=\"376(88) 377(90)\">The schedule should list separately each article of a distinct kind, or of a distinct quality, grade or description of the same kind, to enable appraisers the more readily to fix the value of each article contained in it. How else would they certainly know when or whether they had examined \u201c all glassware and furnishing articles,\u201d \u201c all stock in hand, consisting of cigars, liquors, wine and beer, and all manner of stock \u201d or \u201c all empty barrels and kegs\u201d in a saloon indicated ? And why should they be subjected to the labor of examining each of an unstated number of articles of the same kind,grade, quality and description? Such articles should be listed by the number of pieces, yards, gallons, bushels, or the like, so that they would need only to ascertain the number, examine a sample, appraise the lot accordingly, and leave the claimant debtor to the risk of selecting them as of such number and value. Appellee, then, did not make such a schedule as the statute contemplated.</p> <p id=\"b377-5\" pgmap=\"377\">Nor was the appraisement such. The schedule appears in the record as in the abstract, in four separate and distinct groups, each of which mentioned miscellaneous articles in a lump, and the property was appraised in the same way. There was no fixing of a \u201c fair value upon each article.\u201d The officer and the appraisers, or either, might well have objected to the schedule, and the debtor to the appraisement, but neither made an objection. The debtor accepted the appraisement as made, and so waived its imperfection. His schedule suggested, occasioned and excused it. The first fault was his own. He made his selection, if it may be so called, upon the appraisement made. But he did not limit it to articles not exceeding in aggregate value the amount exempted. He was bound, to select them at their appraised value. Finlen v. Howard, 126 Ill. 262. What he selected embraced all that Avas scheduled. It Avas appraised at $879.20, and he Avas entitled to only four hundred dollars\u2019 worth, shoAving an excess of $479.20. The officer could not select for him nor change the selection he made. If the schedule and appraisement as made did not enable him to select specific articles at any appraised value, he should have sought to have them corrected. But it is evident that if each article had been appraised and the aggregate had amounted to what it did, he Avould have demanded them all, just as he did, because he supposed the amount of the mortgages upon them should be deducted in their appraisement. Otherwise he could have had no reason for stating the fact and amount of those mortgages in his schedule.</p> <p id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377(11) 378(358)\">And the court below seems to have taken that view of the law. We do not concur in it. Appellee\u2019s interest in the property was not an undivided part, a lien, or an equitable claim. As stated in his affidavit for the writ of replevin he was the owner and entitled to the possession of the specific articles in controversy. He was the absolute owner as against the execution creditor and the officer. And as against the mortgagees also, subject only to the lien of their mortgages, respectively, which they were not bound and might never be disposed to enforce. His interest, notwithstanding the mortgages, was subject to the execution, which could be levied upon the property. All the proceedings under this statute show that it contemplated only specific tangible articles of property, which could be taken, delivered, returned and replevied. An equity of redemption, a mere lien or equitable claim, without possession, are susceptible of neither. Appraisers are authorized and required only to fix the fair value of what they can see and at what they can ascertain by inspection and handling. They have no power or authority to consider and adjust equities in it between the execution debtor and third parties, to ascertain whether his mortgage was given for money borrowed, for future advances, or for indemnity to the mortgagee against a liability which might or might- not arise (as was shown and admitted to be the case with one of the mortgages here), whether- there was usury in it and how much had been paid, or any like questions. These are beyond their fitness as well as their authority to determine. They do not affect the fair value of the property. If the execution debtor takes it as exempt, he must take it at that value, unaffected by other liens upon it. If he has given a mortgage upon it the presumption would be that he has had and enjoyed so much of its value, and there is no hardship in denying to him the claim to have it again. In this proceeding he is not authorized to set up a claim for the mortgagee that is not prejudiced by the execution.</p> <p id=\"b378-5\" pgmap=\"378\">For the reasons thus stated the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
