The court, upon exceptions to the report, sustained the master in this respect.</p> <p id=\"b287-5\" pgmap=\"287\">There is much conflict in the evidence, but we can not say the conclusion thus reached is erroneous. We are inclined on the contrary to believe it is right. The fact that appellant suffered these items, amounting to some $1,400, to rest without a claim on his part for several years, and until the bill was filed by appellee, and that the corn transaction really occurred before the partnership, should have no little weight in supporting the position of appellee. We deem it not necessary to state the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b287-6\" pgmap=\"287\">Being of opinion that the decree is responsive to the merits of the case it will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
