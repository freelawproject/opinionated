That fact is manifest from the evidence of the three witnesses who testified on that subject for the plaintiff. Although some kind of a <em>force majeure </em>clause appears commonly to have been inserted in contracts for the sale of cocoanut oil, they differed in such important respects in their terms that it cannot be said that parties in the trade contracted with relation to any particular <em>force majeure </em>clause. Under at least one such clause the defendant would not be liable in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Glennon, Untermyer, Dore and Callahan, JJ., concur; Martin, P.
