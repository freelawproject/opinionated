Memorandum: The trial court\u2019s order awarding defendant $750 on her application for counsel fees for enforcement proceedings in a divorce action, as opposed to the $5,553.73 requested, should be affirmed. A large portion of counsel\u2019s services was devoted to support defendant\u2019s dilatory tactics in obstructing the return of personal property required by prior court order. The amount that the trial court did award is reasonable compensation for the additional time expended because of plaintiffs failure to timely procure financing to buy out defendant\u2019s share of the marital residence. Plaintiff previously paid $3,000 for defendant\u2019s counsel fees and funds are readily available for defendant to pay her own fees. Given the financial circumstances of the parties and the particular circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant the full amount of the application was not an abuse of discretion.
