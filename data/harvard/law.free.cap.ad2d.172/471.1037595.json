A landowner has a general duty to those using his or her property to maintain it in reasonably safe condition to prevent the occurrence of foreseeable injuries <em>(see, Basso v Miller, </em>40 NY2d 233; <em>see also, Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432; <em>Diven v Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, </em>156 AD2d 538). We agree with the Court of Claims\u2019 conclusion that the infant claimant\u2019s injuries were foreseeable and that the State of New York failed to maintain its property in a reasonably safe condition. The placement of wooden poles directly adjacent to the sledding area maintained by the State distinguishes this case from <em>Nagawiecki v State of New York </em>(150 AD2d 147), which involved an expert skier who collided with a pole outside the area of normal skiable terrain. Bracken, J. P., Kunzeman, Kooper and Harwood, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
