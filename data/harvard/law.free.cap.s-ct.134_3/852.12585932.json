When Air Wisconsin stopped flying from Hoeper's home base on aircraft that he was certified to fly, he needed to become certified on a different type of aircraft to keep his job. After Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to gain certification, Air Wisconsin agreed to give him a fourth and final chance. But he performed poorly during a required training session in a simulator. Hoeper responded angrily to this failure-raising his voice, tossing his headset, using profanity, and accusing the instructor of \"railroading the situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The instructor called an Air Wisconsin manager, who booked Hoeper on a flight from the test location to Hoeper's home in Denver. Several hours later, the manager discussed Hoeper's behavior with other airline officials. The officials discussed Hoeper's outburst, his impending termination, the history of assaults by disgruntled airline employees, and the chance that-because Hoeper was a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO), permitted \"to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044921\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)-he might be armed. At the end of the meeting, an airline executive made the decision to notify the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the situation. The manager who had received the initial report from Hoeper's instructor made the call to the TSA. During that call, according to the jury, he made two statements: first, that Hoeper \"was an FFDO who may be armed\" and that the airline was \"concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm\"; and second, that an \"[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was terminated today.\" In response, the TSA removed Hoeper from his plane, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his gun. Hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to Denver, and Air Wisconsin fired him the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Hoeper sued for defamation in Colorado state court. Air Wisconsin moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict, relying on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044941\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), except where such disclosure is \"made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading\" or \"made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure,\" \u00a7 44941(b). The trial court denied the motions and submitted the ATSA immunity question to the jury. The jury found for Hoeper on the defamation claim. The State Supreme Court affirmed. It held that the trial court erred in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error was harmless. Laboring under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made recklessly, the court held that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity because its statements to the TSA were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the material falsity requirement was settled when the ATSA was enacted, Congress presumably meant to incorporate it into the ATSA's immunity exception and did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to true statements made recklessly. This presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of statutory meaning. Section 44941(b)(1) requires falsity, and \u00a7 44941(b)(2) simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones. Denying immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth, would defeat the purpose of ATSA immunity: to ensure that air carriers and their employees do not hesitate to provide the TSA with needed information. Pp. 860 - 863.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (b) Hoeper's arguments that the State Supreme Court's judgment should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of ATSA's immunity standard are unpersuasive. Hoeper claims that Air Wisconsin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immunity, but Air Wisconsin contended in the state court that ATSA's immunity exception incorporates the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   actual malice standard, which requires material falsity. And the State Supreme Court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in finding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict. A court's deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record; the jury was instructed only to determine falsity, not materiality; and applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity. Pp. 862 - 863.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Under the correct material falsity analysis, Air Wisconsin is entitled to immunity as a matter of law. Pp. 863 - 867.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (a) In the defamation context, a materially false statement is one that \" 'would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the ... truth would have produced.' \"\n   <em>\n    Masson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S., at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This standard suffices in the ATSA context as well, so long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer. For purposes of ATSA immunity, a falsehood cannot be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat. Pp. 863 - 864.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (b) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hoeper, the Court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in Air Wisconsin's statement to the TSA were not material. First, the Court rejects Hoeper's argument that Air Wisconsin should have qualified its statement that Hoeper \"was an FFDO who may be armed\" by noting that it had no reason to think he actually was armed. To the extent that Air Wisconsin's statement could have been confusing, any such confusion is immaterial, as a reasonable TSA officer-having been told that Hoeper was an FFDO who was upset about losing his job-would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed. To demand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats. Second, Air Wisconsin's statement that Hoeper \"was terminated\n   today\" was not materially false. While Hoeper had not actually been fired at the time of the statement, everyone involved knew that his firing was imminent. No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate. Finally, although the details of Hoeper's behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, it would have been correct even under Hoeper's version of the facts for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper \"blew up\" during the test. From a reasonable security officer's perspective, there is no material difference between a statement that Hoeper had \"blown up\" in a professional setting and a statement that he was unstable. Air Wisconsin's related statement that it was \"concerned about [Hoeper's] mental stability\" is no more troubling. Many of the officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of \"mental stability,\" but it would be inconsistent with the ATSA's text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the TSA could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airline's concern. A statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as \"the gist\" of the statement is accurate,\n   <em>\n    Masson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    501 U.S., at 517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But by late 2004, Air Wisconsin had stopped operating flights from Denver, Hoeper's home base, on any type of aircraft for which he was certified. To continue flying for Air Wisconsin out of Denver, Hoeper needed to gain certification on the British Aerospace 146 (BAe-146), an aircraft he had not flown.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Hoeper failed in his first three attempts to pass a proficiency test. After the third failure, as he later acknowledged at trial, his employment was \"at [Air Wisconsin's] discretion.\" App. 193.

The agreement left little doubt that Hoeper would lose his job if he failed again.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In December 2004, Hoeper flew from Denver to Virginia for simulator training as part of this final test. During the training, Hoeper failed to cope with a challenging scenario created by the instructor, Mark Schuerman, and the simulator showed the engines \"flam[ing] out\" due to a loss of fuel. App. 203. As Schuerman began to tell Hoeper that he \"should know better,\"\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    Hoeper responded angrily. He later described what happened:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \"At this point, that's it. I take my headset off and I toss it up on the glare shield.... [Schuerman] and I exchanged words at the same elevated decibel level. Mine went something like this: This is a bunch of shit. I'm sorry.

Schuerman then reported Hoeper's behavior to Patrick Doyle, the Wisconsin-based manager of the BAe-146 fleet. Doyle booked Hoeper on a United Airlines flight back to Denver.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Several hours after Schuerman's report, Doyle discussed the situation at Air Wisconsin's headquarters with the airline's Vice President of Operations, Kevin LaWare; its Managing Director of Flight Operations, Scott Orozco; and its Assistant Chief Pilot, Robert Frisch. LaWare later explained the accretion of his concerns about what Hoeper might do next. He regarded Hoeper's behavior in the simulator as \"a fairly significant outburst,\" of a sort that he \"hadn't seen ... before.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n     at 276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The FFDO program allows the Government to \"deputize volunteer pilots of air carriers ... to defend\n    the flight decks of aircraft ... against acts of criminal violence or air piracy.\" \u00a7 44921(a). FFDOs are permitted \"to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation.\" \u00a7 44921(f)(1). Hoeper had become an FFDO earlier in 2004 and had been issued a firearm. He was not allowed to carry the firearm during his trip to the training facility, because he was not \"engaged in providing air transportation,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n      ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But according to one official at the meeting, the Denver airport's security procedures made it possible for crew members to bypass screening, so that Hoeper could have carried his gun despite the rule. Indeed, Frisch later testified that he was \"aware of one\" incident in which an Air Wisconsin pilot had come to training with his FFDO weapon. App. 292. On the basis of this information, LaWare concluded, there was \"no way ... to confirm\" whether \"Hoeper had his weapon with him, even though ... by policy, [he was] not supposed to have it with him.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n     at 279\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Finally, LaWare testified, he and the other Air Wisconsin officials discussed two prior episodes in which disgruntled airline employees had lashed out violently.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n     at 280\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The actual malice standard does not cover materially true statements made recklessly, so we presume that Congress did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to such statements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Other indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this presumption, but here, they do not. First, the ATSA's text favors a falsity requirement. The first subsection of \u00a7 44941(b) requires falsity, as a true disclosure cannot have been made \"with actual knowledge\" that it \"was false.\" The only question is whether the second subsection-which denies immunity to \"any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to [its] truth or falsity\"-similarly requires falsity. We conclude that it does. The second subsection simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones, ensuring that an air carrier cannot avoid liability for a baseless report by sticking its head in the sand to avoid \"actual knowledge\" that its statements are false. \"[T]he defense of truth ..., even if not explicitly recognized, ... is implicit in ... a standard of recovery that rests on knowing or reckless disregard of the truth.\"\n    <em>\n     Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.

The ATSA shifted from airlines to the TSA the responsibility \"for assessing and investigating possible threats to airline security.\" --- P.3d, at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     2012 WL 907764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *14 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In directing the TSA to \"receive, assess, and distribute intelligence information related to transportation security,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20114\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f)(1), Congress wanted to ensure that air carriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide the TSA with the information it needed. This is the purpose of the immunity provision, evident both from its context and from the title of the statutory section that contained it: \"encouraging airline employees to report suspicious activities.\" ATSA \u00a7 125,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Stat.%20631\">\n     115 Stat. 631\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (capitalization and boldface type omitted). It would defeat this purpose to deny immunity for substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth. Such a rule would restore the pre-ATSA state of affairs, in which air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate and verify potential threats.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    We therefore hold that ATSA immunity may not be denied under \u00a7 44941(b) to materially true statements. This interpretation of the statute is clear enough that Hoeper effectively concedes it. See Brief for Respondent 30 (acknowledging that if the Colorado Supreme Court actually said \" 'an airline may be denied ATSA immunity ... for reporting true information,' \" then \"the court was likely wrong\"). Hoeper does point out in a footnote that given Congress' desire to deny immunity to \" 'bad actors,' \" and \"given that the vast majority of reckless statements will\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    turn out to be true[,] ... Congress could have quite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of ATSA immunity to all reckless speakers,\" even those whose statements turned out to be true.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 30, n. 12. But although Congress could have made this choice, nothing about the statute's text or purpose suggests that it actually did. Instead, Congress chose to model the exception to ATSA immunity after a standard we have long construed to require material falsity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    We are not persuaded by Hoeper's arguments that we should affirm the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court notwithstanding its misapprehension of the ATSA immunity standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Hoeper first argues that Air Wisconsin forfeited the claim that it is entitled to immunity because its statements were materially true. His premise is that Air Wisconsin argued the truth of its statements only in challenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation verdict, not in asserting immunity. But Air Wisconsin's brief before the Colorado Supreme Court argued that the exception to ATSA immunity \"appears to incorporate the\n    <em>\n     New York Times\n    </em>\n    actual malice standard,\" which-as we have explained-requires material falsity. Petitioner's Opening Brief in No. 09SC1050, p. 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Hoeper next argues that the Colorado Supreme Court performed the requisite analysis of material falsity, albeit in the context of finding the record sufficient to support the jury's defamation verdict. For several reasons, however, this analysis does not suffice for us to affirm the denial of ATSA immunity. First, to the extent that the immunity determination belongs to the court-as the Colorado Supreme Court held-a court's deferential review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of the record. Second, the jury here did not find that any falsity in Air Wisconsin's statements was material, because the trial court instructed it only to determine whether \"[o]ne or more of th[e] statements was false,\" App. 580, without addressing materiality. Third, applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity. In both contexts, a materially false statement is one that \" 'would have a different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that which the ... truth would have produced.' \"\n    <em>\n     Masson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n     501 U.S., at 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n     111 S.Ct. 2419\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    But the identity of the relevant reader or listener varies according to the context. In determining whether a falsehood is material to a defamation claim, we care whether it affects the subject's reputation in the community. In the context of determining ATSA immunity, by contrast, we care whether a falsehood affects the authorities' perception of and response to a given threat.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court's analysis of material falsity was erroneous. We turn next to explaining why, by applying the ATSA immunity standard to the facts of this case.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fr4\" name=\"fr4\">\n      4\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    We begin by addressing how to determine the materiality of a false statement in the ATSA context.

Rather, we conclude that even if a jury were to find the historical facts in the manner most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin is entitled to ATSA immunity as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    We begin with Air Wisconsin's statement that Hoeper \"was an FFDO who may be armed.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Hoeper cannot dispute the literal truth of this statement: He was an FFDO, and because FFDOs possess weapons, any FFDO \"may be armed.\" Hoeper argues only that to avoid any misinterpretation, Air Wisconsin should have qualified the statement by adding that it had no reason to think he was actually carrying his gun during the trip to Virginia, especially because he was not allowed to do so\n    under \u00a7 44921(f)(1).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fr5\" name=\"fr5\">\n      5\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    We agree that Air Wisconsin's statement could have been misinterpreted by some, but we reject Hoeper's argument for two reasons. First, any confusion of the nature that Hoeper suggests would have been immaterial: A reasonable TSA officer, having been told only that Hoeper was an FFDO and that he was upset about losing his job, would have wanted to investigate whether Hoeper was carrying his gun. Second, to accept Hoeper's demand for such precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats. Baggage handlers, flight attendants, gate agents, and other airline employees who report suspicious behavior to the TSA should not face financial ruin if, in the heat of a potential threat, they fail to choose their words with exacting care.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fr6\" name=\"fr6\">\n      6\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    We next consider Air Wisconsin's statement that Hoeper \"was terminated today.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. When Air Wisconsin made that statement, Hoeper had not yet been fired. But everyone knew the firing was almost certainly imminent. Hoeper acknowledged that his employment was \"at [Air Wisconsin's] discretion\" after his third failed test, App. 193, and the agreement between him and Air Wisconsin stated that his \"fourth ... attempt\" to pass the test would be his \"final\" one,\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 426. No reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Finally, we consider Air Wisconsin's statements that Hoeper was \"[u]nstable\" and that it was \"concerned about his mental stability.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Although the details of Hoeper's behavior during the simulator session may be disputed, Hoeper himself testified that he had become visibly angry: He decided \"that's it,\" he removed his headset and \"toss[ed] it,\" and he accused the instructor-at an \"elevated decibel level,\" and with an expletive-of \"railroading the situation.\" App. 203-204. It would surely have been correct, then, for Air Wisconsin to report that Hoeper \" 'blew up' \" during the test. --- P.3d, at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     2012 WL 907764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *8. The question is whether, from the perspective of a reasonable security officer, there is any material difference between a statement that Hoeper had just \"blown up\" in a professional setting and a statement that he was \"[u]nstable.\" We think not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    We are no more troubled by Air Wisconsin's related statement that it was \"concerned about [Hoeper's] mental stability.\" Hoeper is correct that many of the Air Wisconsin officials who attended the meeting\n    at headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of \"mental stability.\" LaWare, for instance, testified that \"[t]hose weren't the words that [he] would have anticipated\" when he directed Doyle to call the TSA. App. 272. But the officials who attended the meeting did harbor concerns about Hoeper's mental state: They knew he had just \"blown up,\" and they worried about what he might do next. It would be inconsistent with the ATSA's text and purpose to expose Air Wisconsin to liability because its employee could have chosen a slightly better phrase than \"mental stability\" to articulate its concern. Just as \"[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity\" in the defamation context, \"so long as 'the substance, the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be justified,' \"\n    <em>\n     Masson,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n     501 U.S., at 517\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p517\">\n     111 S.Ct. 2419\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , a statement that would otherwise qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision, so long as \"the gist\" of the statement is accurate. Doyle's statements to the TSA accurately conveyed \"the gist\" of the situation; it is irrelevant whether trained lawyers or judges might with the luxury of time have chosen more precise words.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Hoeper's overarching factual theory appears to be that members of the BAe-146 team, including Doyle and Schuerman, harbored personal animosity toward him, which caused them to manipulate the proficiency tests in order to fail him. But even if Hoeper were correct about all this (and we express no view on that question), we do not see why it would have made him any less a threat in the eyes of a reasonable security officer. As between two employees-one who thinks he is being fired because of his inadequate skills, another who thinks he is being fired because his employer hates him-the latter is presumably more, not less, likely to lash out in anger.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The partial dissent argues that Doyle's reference to Hoeper's \"mental stability\" was so egregious as to make his report to the TSA the basis of a $1.2 million defamation judgment. We disagree. While lawyers and judges may in some contexts apply the label \"mentally unstable\" to people suffering from serious mental illnesses, see\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 869 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), that is hardly the only manner in which the label is used. A holding that Air Wisconsin lost its ATSA immunity by virtue of Doyle's failure to be aware of every connotation of the phrase \"mental stability\" would eviscerate the immunity provision. All of us from time to time use words that, on reflection, we might modify. If such slips of the tongue could give rise to major financial liability, no airline would contact the TSA (or permit its employees to do so) without running by its lawyers the text of its proposed disclosure-exactly the kind of hesitation that Congress aimed to avoid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The partial dissent further argues that Hoeper's \"display of anger\" made him no more a threat than \"millions of perfectly harmless air travelers.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 869. But Hoeper did not just lose his temper; he lost it in circumstances that he knew would lead to his firing, which he regarded as the culmination of a vendetta against him. And he was not just any passenger; he was an FFDO, which meant that he could plausibly have been carrying a firearm. In short, Hoeper was not some traveling businessman who yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a badly brewed cup of coffee.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Finally, the partial dissent relies on an expert's testimony \"that Hoeper's behavior did not warrant\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    report to the TSA.\"\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 869 (citing App. 356). But the expert appears to have based that statement on an outdated understanding of reporting\n    obligations that is flatly at odds with the ATSA. Prior to the ATSA, \"airlines were responsible for assessing and investigating possible threats to airline security.\" --- P.3d, at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     2012 WL 907764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *14 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). But the ATSA shifted that responsibility to the TSA, creating a policy \"known as 'when in doubt, report.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    ; see\n    <em>\n     supra,\n    </em>\n    at 862. The expert who believed that Hoeper's conduct did not warrant a report to the TSA also believed that airlines have \"an obligation ... to filter out ... the low noise from ... what's significant\" in reporting threats. App. 356. That understanding does not comport with the policy that Congress chose to enact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Colorado Supreme Court recognized that even if the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin \"would likely be immune\" had it \"reported that Hoeper ... knew he would be terminated soon, that he had acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier and 'blew up' at test administrators, and that he was an FFDO pilot.\" --- P.3d, at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     2012 WL 907764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *8. But the court erred in parsing so finely the distinctions between these hypothetical statements and the ones that Air Wisconsin actually made. The minor differences are, for the reasons we have explained, immaterial as a matter of law in determining Air Wisconsin's ATSA immunity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    By incorporating the actual malice standard into \u00a7 44941(b), Congress meant to give air carriers the \" 'breathing space' \" to report potential threats to security officials without fear of civil liability for a few inaptly chosen words.\n    <em>\n     New York Times,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/\">\n     376 U.S., at 272\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/\">\n     84 S.Ct. 710\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

We must of course begin by taking as given the findings that we\n    <em>\n     know\n    </em>\n    the jury already made, including that Air Wisconsin told the TSA that the airline was \"concerned about [Hoeper's] mental stability\" and that he was an \"[u]nstable pilot,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a (special verdict form), and that those statements were false, --- P.3d ----, ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     2012 WL 907764\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *10 (Colo., Mar. 19, 2012). Next, we must ask whether a reasonable jury\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    find the remaining historical facts to be such that those statements were not only false, but\n    <em>\n     materially\n    </em>\n    false from the perspective of a reasonable TSA agent.

It could also believe his \"overarching factual theory\" that his anger was reasonable because the instructor had \"manipulate[d]\" the test to cause him to fail out of \"personal animosity,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 866-a theory that was not without supporting evidence, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    App. 259-260 (pilot testifying as expert witness that Hoeper's testing was \"absolutely unfair\" and \"biased\"). Moreover, there was evidence from which a jury could conclude that no one who interacted with Hoeper during or after the confrontation-including the instructor-viewed him as either unstable or threatening. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at ---- - ---- (instructor acknowledging that\n    he \" 'quickly realized it wasn't a threatening situation' \");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20907764\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at ---- - ---- (instructor testifying he \" 'never felt that [Hoeper] was going to go do something stupid,' \" \" 'didn't believe that Mr. Hoeper posed a threat in any way to anybody else at all,' \" \" 'did not believe that Mr. Hoeper was engaging in irrational behavior,' \" and \" 'deem[ed] him perfectly safe to get on an airplane' \");\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., at 462 (airline representative who gave Hoeper permission to fly home testifying he \"had no concern that [Hoeper] was a physical threat to anybody\" and \"didn't believe he was mentally unstable\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In short, a jury\n    <em>\n     could\n    </em>\n    find that Hoeper did nothing more than engage in a brief, run-of-the-mill, and arguably justified display of anger that included raising his voice and swearing, but that did not cause anyone, including the person on the receiving end of the outburst, to view him as either irrational or a potential source of violence. Viewing the facts in that light, I cannot agree with the Court that a reasonable TSA official would not \"consider ... important,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 864, the difference between an individual who engaged in this sort of heated but commonplace display of anger, on the one hand, and on the other, an individual whose colleagues regard him as \"mentally unstable.\" It is the difference between a category that no doubt includes millions of perfectly harmless air travelers and one that, in ordinary parlance, connotes an alarming degree of unpredictability and aggressiveness. Indeed, we have used that term in connection with individuals so \"dangerously mentally ill\" that they may be subject to civil confinement.\n    <em>\n     Kansas v. Hendricks,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p363\">\n     521 U.S. 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 363,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p363\">\n     117 S.Ct. 2072\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p363\">\n     138 L.Ed.2d 501\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1997). The importance of that difference was highlighted by the expert testimony in this case of a former TSA Federal Security Director, who stated-based on a version of the underlying facts the jury was entitled to accept-that Hoeper's behavior did not warrant\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    report to the TSA. App. 356.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      *\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The association with dangerous mental illness is not, as the Court suggests, merely one \"connotation of the phrase 'mental [in]stability' \" among many,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 866 - 867; it is the everyday understanding of that phrase. The Court says that this is \"hardly the only manner in which the label is used,\"\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    but it does not even attempt to describe another usage, let alone one that would be a materially accurate description of the facts of this case as a jury might find them. The Court also suggests that the circumstances of this case-particularly the fact that Hoeper knew his firing was imminent, had reason to be angry with the airline, and was authorized to carry a firearm-distinguish Hoeper's confrontation with the instructor from an ordinary \"fit of pique.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p363\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But if so, it was\n    <em>\n     all the more important\n    </em>\n    for the airline to make an accurate report to the TSA, so that the agency could assess the possible\n    danger and determine an appropriate response. Falsely reporting to the TSA that a young Irishman is an IRA terrorist is much more likely to produce a prompt and erroneous response than reporting that a 70-year-old English grandmother is. The circumstances the Court identifies enhanced, rather than diminished, the likelihood that the false \"mentally unstable\" designation would have a material effect on the TSA's response.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In sum, it is simply implausible that, taking the facts of this case in the light most favorable to Hoeper, a reasonable jury would\n    <em>\n     have\n    </em>\n    to find that the report of mental instability would have no effect upon the course of action determined by the TSA. The Court's holding to the contrary demonstrates the wisdom of preserving the jury's role in this inquiry, designed to inject a practical sense that judges sometimes lack. I respectfully dissent from that holding.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"*\">\n    <p id=\"p-95\">\n     The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
