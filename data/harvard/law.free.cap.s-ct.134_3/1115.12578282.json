Respondents allege that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds' forfeiture and forwarded it to a United States Attorney's Office in Georgia. In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents' funds were returned. Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise jurisdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with significant Nevada connections.\n </history>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  <em>\n   Held:\n  </em>\n  The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.

No part of petitioner's course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical focus from petitioner's contacts with the forum to his contacts with respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner's challenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself. Respondents emphasize that they suffered the \"injury\" caused by the delayed return of their funds while residing in Nevada, but\n  <em>\n   Calder\n  </em>\n  made clear that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum. The proper question is whether the defendant's conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents' claimed injury does not evince such a connection. The injury occurred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to be when they desired to use the seized funds. Other possible contacts noted by the Ninth Circuit-that respondents' Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, that cash seized in Georgia originated in Nevada, and that funds were returned to respondents in Nevada-are ultimately unavailing.

In August 2006, petitioner was working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as a deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). As part of a task force, petitioner conducted investigative stops and other law enforcement functions in support of the DEA's airport drug interdiction program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Administration agents searched respondents Gina Fiore and Keith Gipson and their carry-on bags at the San Juan airport in Puerto Rico. They found almost $97,000 in cash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she and Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the El San Juan, and that they had residences in both California and Nevada (though they provided only California identification). After respondents were cleared for departure, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport notified petitioner's task force in Atlanta that respondents had boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to catch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and another DEA agent approached them at the departure gate for their flight to Las Vegas. In response to petitioner's questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were professional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the cash they were carrying was their gambling \" 'bank' \" and winnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to perform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Petitioner advised respondents that their funds would be returned if they later proved a legitimate source for the cash. Respondents then boarded their plane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash to a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA headquarters. The next day, petitioner received a phone call from respondents' attorney in Nevada seeking return of the funds. On two occasions over the next month, petitioner also received documentation from the attorney regarding the legitimacy of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped draft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of the funds and forwarded that affidavit to a United States Attorney's Office in Georgia.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   According\n   to respondents, the affidavit was false and misleading because petitioner misrepresented the encounter at the airport and omitted exculpatory information regarding the lack of drug evidence and the legitimate source of the funds. In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned the funds to respondents in March 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking money damages under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

Rather than assessing petitioner's own contacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to petitioner's knowledge of respondents' \"strong forum connections.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498673\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/688/558/\">\n    688 F.3d, at 577-579, 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the court's view, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that respondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satisfied the \"minimum contacts\" inquiry.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n     8\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 582.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This approach to the \"minimum contacts\" analysis impermissibly allows a plaintiff's contacts with the defendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis. Petitioner's actions in Georgia did not create sufficient contacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed his conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plaintiff's forum connections to the defendant and makes those connections \"decisive\" in the jurisdictional analysis. See\n   <em>\n    Rush,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306221\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/320/#p332\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306221\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/320/#p332\">\n    at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306221\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/320/#p332\">\n    100 S.Ct. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also obscures the reality that none of petitioner's challenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Calder,\n   </em>\n   respondents emphasize that they suffered the \"injury\" caused by petitioner's allegedly tortious conduct (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the delayed return of their gambling funds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for Respondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As previously noted,\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   made clear that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum. Regardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is jurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the defendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The proper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a particular injury or effect but whether the defendant's conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Respondents' claimed injury does not evince a connection between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider the continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct injury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada in any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respondents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because anything independently occurred there, but because Nevada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they desired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents would have experienced this same lack of access in California, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have traveled and found themselves wanting more money than they had. Unlike the broad publication of the forum-focused story in\n   <em>\n    Calder,\n   </em>\n   the effects of petitioner's conduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State in a way that makes those effects a proper basis for jurisdiction.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n     9\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts with Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents' Nevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that is precisely the sort of \"unilateral activity\" of a third party that \"cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162253\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/235/#p253\">\n    357 U.S., at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6162253\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/235/#p253\">\n    78 S.Ct. 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondents allege that\n   some of the cash seized in Georgia \"originated\" in Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created by petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada, when petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventually returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had nothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that it was respondents' unilateral decision to have their funds sent to Nevada).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are sufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the \"minimum contacts\" inquiry in intentional-tort cases is \" 'the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Calder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p788\">\n    465 U.S., at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337451\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/783/#p788\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it is the defendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must create contacts with the forum State. In this case, the application of those principles is clear: Petitioner's relevant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere fact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections to the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdiction.
