One of the Act's provisions protects whistleblowers; at the\n  time relevant here, that provision instructed: \"No [public] company ..., or any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activity].\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a).\n </p>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respondents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under \u00a7 1514A, for that provision protects only employees of public companies, and not employees of private companies that contract with public companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court's denial of FMR's motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed, concluding that the term \"an employee\" in \u00a7 1514A(a) refers only to employees of public companies.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712424\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/61/\">\n    670 F.3d 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that \u00a7 1514A's whistleblower protection includes employees of a public company's private contractors and subcontractors. Pp. 1165 - 1176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (a) This reading of \u00a7 1514A is supported by the provision's text. Pp. 1165 - 1169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provision's language. See\n   <em>\n    Moskal v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219942\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/103/#p108\">\n    498 U.S. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219942\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/103/#p108\">\n    111 S.Ct. 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/103/#p108\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As relevant here, \u00a7 1514A(a) provides that \"no ... contractor ... may discharge ... an employee.\" The ordinary meaning of \"an employee\" in this proscription is the contractor's own employee. FMR's \"narrower construction\" requires inserting \"of a public company\" after \"an employee,\" but where Congress meant \"an employee of a public company,\" it said so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in \u00a7 1514A(a)-discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment terms and conditions-are actions an employer takes against its own employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract. FMR's interpretation of \u00a7 1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provision's ban on retaliation by contractors. The protected activity covered by \u00a7 1514A, and the provision's enforcement procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblowing employee. Pp. 1165 - 1168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) FMR's textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that \"an employee\" must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   their housekeepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments opposing FMR's reading of \u00a7 1514A. FMR also urges that its reading is supported by the provision's statutory headings, but those headings are \"not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    331 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    91 L.Ed. 1646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 1168 - 1169.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) Other considerations support the Court's textual analysis. Pp. 1169 - 1175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The Court's reading fits \u00a7 1514A's aim to ward off another Enron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress' understanding that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the employees of Enron's contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numerous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only \u00a7 1514A affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers for complying with the Act's reporting requirements. Pp. 1169 - 1171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) This Court's reading of \u00a7 1514A avoids insulating the entire mutual fund industry from \u00a7 1514A. Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly, the \"narrower construction\" endorsed by FMR would leave \u00a7 1514A with no application to mutual funds. The Court's reading of \u00a7 1514A, in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mutual funds. Pp. 1171 - 1172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) There is scant evidence that today's decision will open any floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside \u00a7 1514A's purposes. The Department of Labor's regulations have interpreted \u00a7 1514A as protecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor has asserted a \u00a7 1514A claim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court need not determine \u00a7 1514A's bounds here, however, because, if plaintiffs' allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the \"firsthand witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud\" Congress anticipated \u00a7 1514A would protect. S.Rep. No. 107-146, p. 10. Pp. 1172 - 1174.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act does not affect this Court's task of determining whether Congress in 2002 afforded protection to whistleblowing contractor employees. Pp. 1173 - 1175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (c) AIR 21's whistleblower protection provision has been read to cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contractors and subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory texts and whistleblower protective aims, the Court reads the words \"an employee\" in AIR 21 and in \u00a7 1514A to have similar import. Pp. 1175 - 1176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Justice SCALIA, joined by Justice THOMAS, relying only on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A's text and broader context, agreed that \u00a7 1514A protects employees of private contractors from retaliation when they report covered forms of fraud.

See S.Rep. No. 107-146, pp. 2-11 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the time here relevant, instructed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"No [public] company ..., or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].\" \u00a7 1514A(a) (2006 ed.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case concerns the definition of the protected class: Does \u00a7 1514A shield only those employed by the public company itself, or does it shield as well employees of privately held contractors and subcontractors-for example, investment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises-who perform work for the public company?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We hold, based on the text of \u00a7 1514A, the mischief to which Congress was responding, and earlier legislation Congress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees of private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shelters employees of the public company served by the contractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our principal reasons, then describe this controversy and explain our decision more comprehensively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of private companies that contract to advise or manage mutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public companies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle is to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund investors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another company's payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual fund's investment adviser or manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both plaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse action by their employers. Plaintiffs read \u00a7 1514A to convey that \"[n]o ... contractor ... may ... discriminate against [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].\" We find that reading consistent with the text of the statute and with common sense. Contractors are in control of their own employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control someone else's workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to Congress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating against whistleblowers employed\n   by the public company the contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to retaliate against its own employees when they reveal corporate fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, contractors and subcontractors, including the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron's fraud and its coverup. When employees of those contractors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encountered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20750\">\n    116 Stat. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -765, 773-774, 784, \u00a7\u00a7 101-107, 203-206, 307. Given Congress' concern about contractor conduct of the kind that contributed to Enron's collapse, we regard with suspicion construction of \u00a7 1514A to protect whistleblowers only when they are employed by a public company, and not when they work for the public company's contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Congress borrowed \u00a7 1514A's prohibition against retaliation from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR 21),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042121\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Act provides: \"No air carrier or contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may discharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\" when the employee provides information regarding violations \"relating to air carrier safety\" to his or her employer or federal authorities. \u00a7 42121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contractors and subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read the words \"an employee\" in AIR 21 and in \u00a7 1514A to have similar import.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act) aims to \"prevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud, protect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of such fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their actions.\" S.Rep.

Zang (plaintiffs) separately initiated proceedings under \u00a7 1514A against their former employers, privately held companies that provide advisory and management services to the Fidelity family of mutual funds. The Fidelity funds are not parties to either case; as is common in the mutual fund industry, the Fidelity funds themselves have no employees. Instead, they contract with investment advisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day operations, which include making investment decisions, preparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawson was employed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidiary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.

For convenience, we refer to respondents collectively as FMR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Lawson worked for FMR for 14 years, eventually serving as a Senior Director of Finance. She alleges that, after she raised concerns about certain cost accounting methodologies, believing that they overstated expenses associated with operating the mutual funds, she suffered a series of adverse actions, ultimately amounting to constructive discharge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years, most recently as a portfolio manager for several of the funds. He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for raising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC registration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.

The ordinary meaning of \"an employee\" in this proscription is the contractor's own employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   FMR's interpretation of the text requires insertion of \"of a public company\" after \"an employee.\" But where Congress meant \"an employee of a public company,\" it said so: With respect to the actors governed by \u00a7 1514A, the provision's interdictions run to the officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and agents \"of such company,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a public company. \u00a7 1514A(a). Another anti-retaliation provision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: \"[A] broker or dealer and persons employed by a broker or dealer who are involved with\n   investment banking activities may not, directly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to retaliate against any securities analyst\n   <em>\n    employed by that broker or dealer or its affiliates\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2078\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   -6(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added). In contrast, nothing in \u00a7 1514A's language confines the class of employees protected to those of a designated employer. Absent any textual qualification, we presume the operative language means what it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate against its own employee for engaging in protected whistleblowing activity.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n     7\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Section 1514A's application to contractor employees is confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term \"an employee\" to the provision as a whole. The prohibited retaliatory measures enumerated in \u00a7 1514A(a)-discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment-are commonly actions an employer takes against its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract. FMR's interpretation of \u00a7 1514A, therefore, would shrink to insignificance the provision's ban on retaliation by contractors. The dissent embraces FMR's \"narrower\" construction. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1178, 1178 - 1179, 1179, 1180 - 1181.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   FMR urges that Congress included contractors in \u00a7 1514A's list of governed actors simply to prevent public companies from avoiding liability by employing contractors to effectuate retaliatory discharges. FMR describes such a contractor as an \"ax-wielding specialist,\" illustrated by George Clooney's character in the movie Up in the Air.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n     8\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Brief for Respondents 24-25 (internal quotation marks omitted). As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding specialist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad news that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in deciding who to terminate. If the company employing the ax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retaliatory reasons, the \u00a7 1514A claim would properly be directed at the company. Hiring the ax-wielder would not insulate the company from liability. Moreover, we see no indication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the real-world problem that prompted Congress to add contractors to \u00a7 1514A.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fr9\" name=\"fr9\">\n     9\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moving further through \u00a7 1514A to the protected activity described in subsection\n   (a)(1), we find further reason to believe that Congress presumed an employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower. Employees gain protection for furnishing information to a federal agency, Congress, or \"a person with supervisory authority over\n   <em>\n    the employee\n   </em>\n   (or such other person working for\n   <em>\n    the employer\n   </em>\n   who has the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate misconduct).\" \u00a7 1514A(a)(1) (emphasis added). And under \u00a7 1514A(a)(2), employees are protected from retaliation for assisting \"in a proceeding filed or about to be filed (\n   <em>\n    with any knowledge of the employer\n   </em>\n   ) relating to an alleged violation\" of any of the enumerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other federal law relating to shareholder fraud. \u00a7 1514A(a)(2) (emphasis added). The reference to employer knowledge is an additional indicator of Congress' expectation that the retaliator typically will be the employee's employer, not another entity less likely to know of whistleblower complaints filed or about to be filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Section 1514A's enforcement procedures and remedies similarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an employee of the retaliator. As earlier noted, see\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1163 - 1164, \u00a7 1514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under \u00a7 1514A \"shall be governed under the rules and procedures set forth in section 42121(b) of title 49,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   AIR 21's anti-retaliation provision. Throughout \u00a7 42121(b), the respondent is referred to as \"the employer.\" See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042121\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(ii) (The Secretary shall not conduct an investigation into a retaliation claim \"if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.\"); \u00a7 42121(b)(2)(B)(iv) (\"Relief may not be ordered ... if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Regarding remedies, \u00a7 1514A(c)(2) states that a successful claimant shall be entitled to \"reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had, but for the discrimination,\" as well as \"the amount of back pay, with interest.\" As the Solicitor General, for the United States as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae,\n   </em>\n   observed, \"It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how a contractor or subcontractor could provide those remedies to an employee of a public company.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   15. The most sensible reading of \u00a7 1514A's numerous references to an employer-employee relationship between the respondent and the claimant is that the provision's protections run between contractors and their own employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a strange design. Under the dissent's \"narrower\" construction,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1178, 1178 - 1179, 1179, 1180 - 1181, a public company's contractor may not retaliate against a public company's employees, academic here because the public company has no employees. According to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to prevent \"a gaping hole\" that would allow public companies to \"evade \u00a7 1514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee could not.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1182. This cannot be right-even if Congress had omitted any reference to contractors, subcontractors, or agents in \u00a7 1514A, the remaining language surely would prohibit a public company from directing someone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the public company's employees; hiring an ax-wielder to announce an employee's demotion does not change the fact that the public company is the entity commanding the demotion. Under the dissent's reading\n   of \u00a7 1514A, the inclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more than make the contractor secondarily liable for complying with such marching orders-hardly a hole at all.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fr10\" name=\"fr10\">\n     10\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the dissent's view of \u00a7 1514A's reach to prevail: Contractors' employees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerable to retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistle on a scheme to defraud the public company's investors, even a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor. Not only would mutual fund advisers and managers escape \u00a7 1514A's control. Legions of accountants and lawyers would be denied \u00a7 1514A's protections. See\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 1170 - 1172. Instead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing babysitters and the like,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1177 - 1178, 1180, 1183 - 1184, 1187 - 1188, the dissent might pause to consider whether a Congress, prompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whistleblower protection countless professionals equipped to bring fraud on investors to a halt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR. First, FMR urges that \"an employee\" must be read to refer exclusively to public company employees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the personal employees of company officers and employees,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   their housekeepers or gardeners. See Brief for Respondents 19-20;\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1177 - 1178, 1180, 1183 - 1184, 1187 - 1188. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General do not defend \u00a7 1514A's application to personal employees. They argue, instead, that the prohibition against an \"officer\" or \"employee\" retaliating against \"an employee\" may be read as imposing personal liability only on officers and employees who retaliate against other public company employees. Brief for Petitioners 12; Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   16.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fr11\" name=\"fr11\">\n     11\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   FMR calls this reading \"bizarre,\" for it would ascribe to the words \"an employee\" in \u00a7 1514A(a) \"one meaning if the respondent is an 'officer' and a different meaning if the respondent is a 'contractor.' \" Brief for Respondents 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor General offer an interpretation at odds with the text Congress enacted. If, as we hold, \"an employee\" includes employees of contractors, then grammatically, the term also includes employees of public company officers and employees. Nothing suggests Congress' attention was drawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue, however, is likely more theoretical than real. Few housekeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon and comprehend evidence of their employer's complicity in fraud. In any event, FMR's point is outweighed by the compelling arguments opposing FMR's contention that \"an employee\" refers simply and only to public company employees. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1165 - 1168. See also\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 1172 - 1174 (limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad applications).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings support the exclusion of contractor employees from \u00a7 1514A's protections. Although \u00a7 1514A's own heading is broad (\"Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases\"), subsection (a) is captioned \"Whistleblower Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.\" Similarly, the relevant public law section, \u00a7 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley, is captioned \"Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20802\">\n    116 Stat. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals described the latter two headings as \"explicit guides\" limiting protection under \u00a7 1514A to employees of public companies.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712424\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/61/\">\n    670 F.3d, at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This Court has placed less weight on captions.

The under-inclusiveness of the two headings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent. The provision indisputably extends protection to employees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant to \u00a7 15(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are not \"publicly traded.\" And the activity protected under \u00a7 1514A is not limited to \"provid[ing] evidence of fraud\"; it also includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regulations. \u00a7 1514A(a)(1). As in\n   <em>\n    Trainmen,\n   </em>\n   the headings here are \"but a short-hand reference to the general subject matter\" of the provision, \"not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    331 U.S., at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .Section 1514A is attended by numerous indicators that the statute's prohibitions govern the relationship between a contractor and its own employees; we do not read the headings to \"undo or limit\" those signals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158216\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/331/519/#p528\">\n    67 S.Ct. 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n     12\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Our textual analysis of \u00a7 1514A fits the provision's purpose. It is common ground that Congress installed whistleblower protection in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as one means to ward off another Enron debacle. S. Rep., at 2-11. And, as the ARB observed in\n   <em>\n    Spinner,\n   </em>\n   \"Congress plainly recognized that outside professionals-accountants, law firms, contractors, agents, and the like-were complicit in, if not integral to, the shareholder fraud and subsequent cover-up [Enron] officers ... perpetrated.\" ALJ No. 2010-SOX-029, pp. 12-13. Indeed, the Senate Report demonstrates that Congress was as focused on the role of Enron's outside contractors in facilitating the fraud as it was on the actions of Enron's own officers.

These requirements, however, indicate why Congress would have wanted to extend \u00a7 1514A's coverage to the many lawyers and accountants who perform outside work for public companies. Although lawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regulations and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provision of the Act other than \u00a7 1514A affords them protection from retaliation by their employers for complying with the Act's reporting requirements.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fr14\" name=\"fr14\">\n     14\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   In short, we cannot countenance the position advanced by FMR and the dissent, see\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1184 - 1186, that Congress intended to leave these professionals vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory action for complying with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Our reading of \u00a7 1514A avoids insulating the entire mutual fund industry from \u00a7 1514A, as FMR's and the dissent's \"narrower construction\" would do. As companies \"required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a), mutual funds unquestionably are governed by \u00a7 1514A.

See S.Rep. No. 91-184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company Act of 1940). The United States investment advising industry manages $14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors.

These investment advisers, under our reading of \u00a7 1514A, are contractors prohibited from retaliating against their own employees for engaging in whistleblowing activity. This construction protects the \"insiders [who] are the only firsthand witnesses to the [shareholder] fraud.\" S. Rep., at 10. Under FMR's and the dissent's reading, in contrast, \u00a7 1514A has no application to mutual funds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed by the privately held investment management\n   companies, not by the mutual funds themselves. See Brief for Respondents 45 (describing this glaring gap as \"merely a consequence of the corporate structure\" of mutual funds).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court of Appeals found exclusion of the mutual fund industry from \u00a7 1514A tenable because mutual funds and their investment advisers are separately regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-1\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   and elsewhere in Sarbanes-Oxley.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712424\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/61/\">\n    670 F.3d, at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 1514A alone shields them from retaliation for bringing fraud to light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Indeed, affording whistleblower protection to mutual fund investment advisers is crucial to Sarbanes-Oxley's endeavor to \"protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20745\">\n    116 Stat. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We agree. Plaintiffs' allegations fall squarely within Congress' aim in enacting \u00a7 1514A. Lawson alleges that she was constructively discharged for reporting accounting practices that overstated expenses associated with managing certain Fidelity mutual funds.

FMR asserts that Congress' decision to add NRSROs to \u00a7 1514A shows that the provision did not previously cover contractor employees: \"If [\u00a7 1514A] already covered every private company contracting with a public company, there would have been no need for Congress to extend [\u00a7 1514A] to certain private companies.\" Brief for Respondents 35-36.

These distinctions, the Court of Appeals reasoned, render \u00a7 1514A less amenable to an inclusive construction of the protected class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712424\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/61/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fr22\" name=\"fr22\">\n     22\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   We do not find these textual differences overwhelming. True, Congress strayed from \u00a7 42121's pattern in failing to define \"contractor\" for purposes of \u00a7 1514A, and in adding \"officers\" and \"employees\" to \u00a7 1514A's list of governed actors. And we agree that \u00a7 1514A covers a far wider range than \u00a7 42121 does. But in our view, neither difference warrants the determination that \u00a7 1514A omits employees of contractors while \u00a7 42121 includes them. The provisions' parallel text and purposes counsel in favor of interpreting the two provisions consistently. And we have already canvassed the many reasons why \u00a7 1514A is most sensibly read to protect employees of contractors. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1165 - 1172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the reasons stated, we hold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A whistleblower protection extends to employees of contractors and subcontractors. The judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, concurring in principal part and concurring in the judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   I agree with the Court's conclusion that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A protects employees of private contractors from retaliation when they report covered forms of fraud. As the Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically flows from \u00a7 1514A's text and broader context. I therefore join the Court's opinion in principal part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   I do not endorse, however, the Court's occasional excursions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and context, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance on legislative history rests upon several frail premises. First, and most important: That the statute means what Congress intended. It does not. Because we are a government of laws, not of men, and are governed by what Congress enacted rather than by what it intended, the\n   sole object of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what a law\n   <em>\n    says\n   </em>\n   . Second: That there\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a congressional \"intent\" apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On most issues of detail that come before this Court, I am confident that the majority of Senators and Representatives had no views whatever on how the issues should be resolved-indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely. Third: That the views expressed in a committee report or a floor statement represent those of all the Members of that House. Many of them almost certainly did not read the report or hear the statement, much less agree with it-not to mention the Members of the other House and the President who signed the bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Since congressional \"intent\" apart from enacted text is fiction to begin with, courts understandably allow themselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today's opinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative record that are consistent with its holding that \u00a7 1514A covers employees of private contractors and subcontractors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in the opposite direction. For example, the following remark by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's lead sponsor in the Senate: \"[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively to public companies-that is, to companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not applicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fr23\" name=\"fr23\">\n     *\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   ] who make up the vast majority of companies across the country.\" 148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Two other minor points in the Court's opinion I do not agree with. First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate anti-retaliation provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042121\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"has been read\" by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor employees.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1176. Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled \"Procedure,\" contains cross-references to the procedural rules set forth in \u00a7 42121(b), but the substantive provisions of \u00a7 1514A(a) are worded quite differently from the substantive prohibition of \u00a7 42121, which is contained in subsection (a)-thus making interpretation of the latter an unreliable guide to \u00a7 1514A's meaning. Second, I do not agree with the Court's acceptance of the possible validity of the Government's suggestion that \"\u00a7 1514A protects contractor employees only to the extent that their whistleblowing relates to 'the contractor ... fulfilling its role as a contractor for the public company.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1173 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19). Although that \"limiting principl[e],\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   may be appealing from a policy standpoint, it has no basis whatsoever in the statute's text. So long as an employee works for one of the actors enumerated in \u00a7 1514A(a) and reports a covered form of fraud in a manner identified in \u00a7 1514(a)(1)-(2), the employee is protected from retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For all the other reasons given by the Court, the statute's text is clear, and I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice SOTOMAYOR, with whom Justice KENNEDY and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20802\">\n    116 Stat. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , forbids any public company,\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fr24\" name=\"fr24\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   or any \"officer, employee, contractor,\n   subcontractor, or agent of such company,\" to retaliate against \"an employee\" who reports a potential fraud. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a). The Court recognizes that the core purpose of the Act is to \"safeguard investors in public companies.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1161. And the Court points out that Congress entitled the whistleblower provision, \"Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\" \u00a7 806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20802\">\n    116 Stat. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite these clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe \u00a7 1514A to apply only to public company employees who blow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company employers. The Court instead holds that the law encompasses any household employee of the millions of people who work for a public company and any employee of the hundreds of thousands of private businesses that contract to perform work for a public company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court's interpretation gives \u00a7 1514A a stunning reach. As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act authorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his employer-a parent who happens to work at the local Walmart (a public company)-if the parent stops employing the babysitter after he expresses concern that the parent's teenage son may have participated in an Internet purchase fraud. And it opens the door to a cause of action against a small business that contracts to clean the local Starbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted after reporting that another nonpublic company client has mailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweeping regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and private businesses to litigation over fraud reports that have no connection to, or impact on, the interests of public company shareholders. But because nothing in the text, context, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests that Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with the statutory text, it fails to recognize that \u00a7 1514A is deeply ambiguous. Three indicators of Congress' intent clearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower interpretation of \u00a7 1514A: the statute's headings, the statutory context, and the absurd results that follow from the majority's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring that the \" 'relevant syntactic elements' \" of \u00a7 1514A are that \" ' \"no ... contractor ... may discharge ... an employee.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1165. After \" 'boiling ... down' \" the text to this formulation, the majority concludes that the \"ordinary meaning of 'an employee' \" is obviously \"the contractor's own employee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20802\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   If that were what the statute said, the majority's decision would undoubtedly be correct. But \u00a7 1514A(a) actually provides that \"[n]o [public] company ... or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company ... may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee.\" The provision thus does not speak only (or even primarily) to \"contractors.\" It speaks to public companies, and then includes a list of five types of representatives that companies hire to carry out their business: \"officer[s], employee[s],\n   contractor[s], subcontractor[s], [and] agent[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The majority is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause of action both for employees of public companies and for employees of the enumerated public company representatives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to prohibit the public company and the listed representatives-all of whom act on the company's behalf-from retaliating against just the public company's employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense when one considers the other terms in the list of company representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a matter of \"gramma[r],\" the scope of protected employees must be consistent with respect to all five types of company representatives listed in \u00a7 1514A(a).\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1168 - 1169. Yet the Government and petitioners readily concede that \u00a7 1514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated representatives-\"officer[s]\" and \"employee[s]\"-from retaliating against other employees of the public company, as opposed to their own babysitters and housekeepers. See Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   16 (\u00a7 1514A \"impose[s] personal liability on corporate officers and employees who are involved in retaliation against other employees of their employer\"); Brief for Petitioners 12 (similar). The Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board (ARB) agrees.\n   <em>\n    Spinner v. David Landau &amp; Assoc., LLC,\n   </em>\n   No. 10-111 etc., ALJ No. 2010-SOX-029, p. 8 (May 31, 2012). And if \u00a7 1514A prohibits an \"officer\" or \"employee\" of a public company from retaliating against only the public company's own employees, then as the majority points out, the same should be true \"grammatically\" of contractors, subcontractors, and agents as well,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1168 - 1169.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fr25\" name=\"fr25\">\n     2\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The majority responds by suggesting that the narrower interpretation could have been clearer if Congress had added the phrase \" 'of a public company' after 'an employee.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1165 - 1166. Fair enough. But Congress could more clearly have dictated the majority's construction of the statute, too: It could have specified that public companies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and agents may not retaliate against \"their own employees.\" In any case, that Congress could have spoken with greater specificity in both directions only underscores that the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous. To resolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a statute's titles can offer \"a useful aid in resolving [the] ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166086\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/385/#p388\">\n    359 U.S. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388-389,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166086\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/385/#p388\">\n    79 S.Ct. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166086\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/385/#p388\">\n    3 L.Ed.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959). Here, two headings strongly suggest that Congress intended \u00a7 1514A to apply only to employees of public companies. First, the title of \u00a7 806-the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted \u00a7 1514A-speaks clearly to the scope of employees protected by the provision: \"Protection for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20802\">\n    116 Stat. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the\n   heading of \u00a7 1514A(a) reinforces that the provision provides \"[w]histleblower protection for employees of publicly traded companies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The majority suggests that in covering \"employees of publicly traded companies,\" the headings may be imprecise.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1169. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to the employees of two types of companies: those \"with a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\" and those that are \"required to file reports under section 15(d) of the\" same Act. Both types of companies are \"public\" in that they are publicly owned. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1164 - 1165. The difference is that shares of the \u00a7 12 companies are listed and traded on a national securities exchange; \u00a7 15(d) companies, by contrast, exchange their securities directly with the public. The headings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase \"publicly traded\" is commonly associated with companies whose securities are traded on national exchanges. Congress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer to \u00a7 15(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are traded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recognizes,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1171, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic example of a \u00a7 15(d) company. And mutual funds, like other \u00a7 15(d) companies, are both publicly owned and widely traded; the trades just take place typically between the fund and its investors directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In any case, even if referring to employees of \u00a7 12 and \u00a7 15(d) companies together as \"employees of publicly traded companies\" may be slightly imprecise, the majority's competing interpretation of \u00a7 1514A would stretch the statute's headings far past the point of recognition. As the majority understands the law, Congress used the term \"employees of publicly traded companies\" as shorthand not just for (1) employees of \u00a7 12 and \u00a7 15(d) companies, but also for (2) household employees of any individual who works for a \u00a7 12 or \u00a7 15(d) company; (3) employees of any private company that contracts with a \u00a7 12 or \u00a7 15(d) company; (4) employees of any private company that, even if it does not contract with a public company, subcontracts with a private company that does; and (5) employees of any agent of a \u00a7 12 or \u00a7 15(d) company. If Congress had wanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would have called it something other than \"[w]histleblower protection for employees of publicly traded companies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are inconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes that the Court has \"placed less weight on captions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1169. But where the captions favor one interpretation so decisively, their significance should not be dismissed so quickly. As we have explained, headings are important \" 'tools available for the resolution of a doubt' about the meaning of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/#p234\">\n    523 U.S. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/#p234\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/#p234\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Statutory context confirms that Congress intended \u00a7 1514A to apply only to employees of public companies. To start, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a whole evinces a clear focus on public companies. Congress stated in the Act's preamble that its objective was to \"protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20745\">\n    116 Stat. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , disclosures that public companies alone must file. The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations for public companies, \u00a7 401; added new conflict of interest rules for their executives,\n   \u00a7 402; increased the responsibilities of their audit committees, \u00a7 301; and created new rules governing insider trading by their executives and directors, \u00a7 306. The common denominator among all of these provisions is their singular focus on the activities of public companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   When Congress wanted to depart from the Act's public company focus to regulate private firms and their employees, it spoke clearly. For example, \u00a7 307 of the Act ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue rules \"setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the [SEC],\" including a rule requiring outside counsel to report violations of the securities laws to public company officers and directors.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207245\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, Title I of the Act created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authority to register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately held outside accounting firms and their employees. \u00a7\u00a7 7211-7215. And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules governing outside securities analysts when they make public recommendations regarding securities. \u00a7 78o-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously cover the employees of private businesses that contract with public companies or the employees of individuals who work for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons noted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act demonstrates, if Congress had really wanted \u00a7 1514A to impose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it would have said so more clearly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Congress' intent to adopt the narrower understanding of \u00a7 1514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the whistleblower provision that served as its model. That provision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042121\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides that \"[n]o air carrier or contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier\" may retaliate against an employee who reports a potential airline safety violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Section 42121 protects employees of contractors. But as the majority acknowledges, \"Congress strayed\" from \u00a7 42121 in significant ways when it wrote \u00a7 1514A.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1176. First, \u00a7 42121 specifically defines the term \"contractor,\" limiting the term to \"a company that performs safety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.\" \u00a7 42121(e). That is in notable distinction to \u00a7 1514A, which does not define the word \"contractor\" as a particular type of company, instead placing the term in a list alongside individual \"officer[s]\" and \"employee[s]\" who act on a company's behalf. Second, unlike \u00a7 42121, \u00a7 1514A sets off the term \"contractor\" in a separate clause that is subsidiary to the primary subject of the provision-the public company itself. Third, the title of \u00a7 42121 is \"[p]rotection of employees providing air safety information,\" a title that comfortably encompasses the employees of contractors. Not so of \u00a7 1514A's headings, as explained above. In short, \u00a7 42121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if it wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet chose to depart from that model in several important ways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental. See\n   <em>\n    Blue Chip Stamps v.

It first argues that the types of conduct prohibited by the statute-\"discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimination in the terms and conditions\n   of employment\"-are \"commonly actions an employer takes against its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1166. The problem is that \u00a7 1514A does not forbid retaliation by an \"employer\"; it forbids retaliation by a \"[public] company ... or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.\" For the reasons already discussed, Congress could have reasonably included the five types of representatives not in their capacity as employers, but rather as representatives of the company who are barred from retaliating against a public company's employees on the company's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely \"positioned to take adverse actions against employees of the public company with whom they contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1166. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces, which increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and persons laboring under more typical employment relationships. For example, public companies often hire \"independent contractors,\" of whom there are more than 10 million,\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fr26\" name=\"fr26\">\n     3\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   and contract workers,\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fr27\" name=\"fr27\">\n     4\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   of whom there are more than 11 million.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fr28\" name=\"fr28\">\n     5\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   And they employ outside lawyers, accountants, and auditors as well. While not every person who works for a public company in these nonemployee capacities may be positioned to threaten or harass employees of the public company, many are. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tides v.

Congress therefore had as much reason to shield a public company's employees from retaliation by the company's contractors as it had to bar retaliation by officers and employees. Otherwise, the statute would have had a gaping hole-a public company could evade \u00a7 1514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee could not.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fr29\" name=\"fr29\">\n     6\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence of \"outplacement\" firms, or consultants that help companies determine whom to fire. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1166 - 1167.

But there is no requirement that a statute must make every type of remedy available against every type of defendant. A contractor can compensate a whistleblower with backpay, costs, and fees, and that is more than enough for the statute's remedial scheme to make sense. The majority's reference to the affirmative defense for public company \"employers\" who lack \"knowledge\" that an employee has participated in a proceeding relating to the fraud report,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1167 (citing \u00a7 1514(A)(a)(2)), fails for a similar reason.

Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    458 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). The majority's interpretation transforms \u00a7 1514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress could not have intended. As construed by the majority, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relationships between individuals and their nannies, housekeepers, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to litigation\n   if their employees claim to have been harassed for providing information regarding any of a host of offenses. If, for example, a nanny is discharged after expressing a concern to his employer that the employer's teenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud, the nanny can bring a \u00a7 1514A suit. The employer may prevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired \"because of\" the fraud report. \u00a7 1514A. But there is little reason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes into federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to impose costly litigation burdens on any private business that happens to have an ongoing contract with a public company. As the majority acknowledges, the purpose of the Act was to protect public company investors and the financial markets. Yet the majority might well embroil federal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane labor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns. For instance, a construction worker could file a \u00a7 1514A suit against her employer (that has a long-term contract with a public company) if the worker is demoted after reporting that another client has mailed the company a false invoice.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fr32\" name=\"fr32\">\n     9\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The majority's interpretation also produces truly odd distinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter can bring a \u00a7 1514A retaliation suit against his employer if his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart (a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the local Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer who works for a construction business can avail himself of \u00a7 1514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the local Dick's Sporting Goods store (a public company), but not if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private company).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In light of the reasonable alternative reading of \u00a7 1514A, there is no reason to accept these absurd results. The majority begs to differ, arguing that \"[t]here is scant evidence\" that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude of newly covered employees \" 'who have no exposure to investor-related activities and thus could not possibly assist in detecting investor fraud.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1172. Until today, however, no court has deemed \u00a7 1514A applicable to household employees of individuals who work for public companies; even the Department of Labor's ARB rejected that view.\n   <em>\n    Spinner,\n   </em>\n   ALJ No. 2010-SOX-029, at 8. And as the District Court noted, prior to the ARB's 2012 decision in\n   <em>\n    Spinner,\n   </em>\n   the ARB \"ha[d] yet to provide ... definitive clarification\" on the question whether \u00a7 1514A extends to the employees of a public company's private contractors.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4108029\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/724/141/\">\n    724 F.Supp.2d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155 (Mass.2010). So the fact that individuals and private businesses have yet to suffer burdensome litigation offers little assurance that the majority's capacious reading of \u00a7 1514A will produce no untoward effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Finally, it must be noted that \u00a7 1514A protects the reporting of a variety of frauds-not only securities fraud, but also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a statute that already protects an expansive class of conduct also to cover a large class of employees, today's opinion\n   threatens to subject private companies to a costly new front of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly did not intend the statute to have that reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The majority argues that the broader reading of \u00a7 1514A is necessary because a small number of the millions of individuals and private companies affected by its ruling have a special role to play in preventing public company fraud. If \u00a7 1514A does not bar retaliation against employees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms and accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their employees when those employees report fraud on the part of their public company clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role that outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron debacle and the importance of encouraging them to play an active part in preventing future scandals. But it hardly follows that Congress must have meant to apply \u00a7 1514A to every employee of every public company contractor, subcontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more likely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and professional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and accountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the hands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Specifically, rather than imposing \u00a7 1514A's generic approach on outside accounting firms, Congress established the PCAOB, which regulates \"every detail\" of an accounting firm's practice, including \"supervision of audit work,\" \"internal inspection procedures,\" \"professional ethics rules,\" and \" 'such other requirements as the Board may prescribe.' \"\n   <em>\n    Free Enterprise Fund v.

Such sanctions could well provide a more powerful incentive to prevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its employees than \u00a7 1514A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory authority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys.

Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the power to censure culpable attorneys and to deny \"permanently\" to any such attorney the \"privilege of appearing of practicing before\" the SEC \"in any way.\" \u00a7 602.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Congress thus evidently made the judgment that decisions concerning how best to punish law firms and accounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department of Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB. Such judgment should not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much less at the cost to congressional intent produced by today's ruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments for why Congress might have been wiser to include certain types of contractors within \u00a7 1514A, noting for example that a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retaliate against its employees for making reports required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1170 - 1171. But as the majority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that precise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower incentive\n   and protection program that unequivocally \"prohibit[s] any employer\"-public or private-\"from retaliating against 'a whistleblower' for providing information to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or making disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-Oxley and certain other securities laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1174 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-6(a)(6), (b)(1), (h)).

According to petitioners, the ARB's rulings are entitled to deference because the \"Secretary is responsible for enforcing Section 1514A both through investigation and through formal adjudication.\" Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far as it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to investigate and adjudicate \u00a7 1514A claims, Congress did not delegate authority to the Secretary to \"make rules carrying the force of law,\"\n   <em>\n    Mead,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p226\">\n    533 U.S., at 226-227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p226\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The SEC, however, has not issued a regulation applying \u00a7 1514A whistleblower protection to employees of public company contractors. And while the majority notes that the SEC may share the (incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has interpretive authority regarding \u00a7 1514A,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1165, n. 6, the majority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may transfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Congress to a different agency simply by signing onto an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to resolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by \u00a7 1514A's mechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely permit courts to review the Secretary's final adjudicatory rulings under the Administrative Procedure Act's deferential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an action in a federal district court, and allows district courts to adjudicate such actions\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   in any case where the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.

As a result, even if Congress had not delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambiguities in \u00a7 1514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review suggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts, and not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power.

By covering employees of every officer, employee, and contractor of every public company, the majority's interpretation extends \u00a7 1514A's protections to the outside lawyers and accountants who could have helped prevent the Enron fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress envisioned a system in which public company employees would be covered by \u00a7 1514A, and in which outside lawyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be regulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not envision a system in which employees of other private businesses-such as cleaning and construction company workers who have little interaction with investor-related activities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting fraud against shareholders-would fall within \u00a7 1514A. Nor, needless to say, did it envision \u00a7 1514A applying to the household employees of millions of individuals who happen to work for public companies-housekeepers, gardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned to prevent fraud against public company investors. And to the extent \u00a7 1514A may have been underinclusive as first drafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any gaps. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7\u00a7 922, 929A,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%201848\">\n    124 Stat. 1848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1852 (extending \u00a7 1514A to credit rating agencies and public company subsidiaries); \u00a7 922,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1841-1848 (codifying additional whistleblower incentive and protection program at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Court's decision upsets the balance struck by Congress.

If \u00a7 1514A creates a cause of action for contractor employees, the majority concludes, so too must it create a cause of action for \"housekeepers\" and \"gardeners\" against their individual employers if they happen to work for a public company.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1168 - 1169. In reaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities produced by its holding.

It surely does, but that is the point-the whole reason \u00a7 1514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly forbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through \"any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.\" The prohibition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain (hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to retaliate through its \"officers and employees.\" Moreover, while the majority concedes that, under the narrower reading of \u00a7 1514A, Congress' inclusion of the term \"contractor\" imposes secondary liability in the event a public company is judgment proof,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1167 - 1168, the majority fails to recognize that Congress' use of the term also imposes primary liability against contractors who threaten public company employees without direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR's interpretation of \u00a7 1514A would prevent an outside accountant from threatening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the accountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the whistle on that fraud.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7.\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010, www. slate. com/ articles/ news_ and_ politics/ explainer/ 2010/ 01/ getting_ the_ ax_ from_ george_ clooney. html.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8.\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    The majority suggests that an outplacement firm would likely be acting as an \"agent\" for the public company, such that Congress' additional inclusion of the word \"contractor\" would be superfluous under the narrower reading of \u00a7 1514A.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1166, n. 9. The two words are not legally synonymous, however. An outplacement firm and public company might, for example, enter into a contract with a provision expressly disclaiming an agency relationship. Moreover, Congress' use of the term \"contractor\" would in all events have an independent and important effect: If Congress had not included the term, no one could be held liable if a contractor were to threaten or harass a public company employee without the company's direction. While the majority may speculate that such occurrences are rare,\n    <em>\n     ibid.,\n    </em>\n    it is hardly unthinkable.

But that argument is misguided for a reason similar to the majority's concern about lawyers and accountants.

The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five years for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to punish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their employees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insufficient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, \u00a7 78u-6's extensive whistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously covers such employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11.\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Although it claims not to reach the issue,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1165, n. 6, the majority implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB's ruling as well, rejecting the ARB's ruling that \u00a7 1514A does not apply to the household employees of public company officers and employees,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 1168 - 1169, and n. 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12.\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Congress could, for example, limit \u00a7 1514A to contractor employees in only those professions that can assist in detecting fraud on public company shareholders, or it could restrict the fraud reports that trigger whistleblower protection to those that implicate the interests of public company investors, see n. 9,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
