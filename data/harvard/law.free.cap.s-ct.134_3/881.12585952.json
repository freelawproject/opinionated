After medical experts testified at trial that Banka might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka's death could only \"result from\" heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Burrage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years.

The episode began on the morning of April 14, when Banka smoked marijuana at a former roommate's home. Banka stole oxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and later crushed, cooked, and injected the oxycodone. Banka and his wife, Tammy Noragon Banka (Noragon), then met with petitioner Marcus Burrage and purchased one gram of heroin from him. Banka immediately cooked and injected some of the heroin and, after returning home, injected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April 15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after witnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When Noragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead in the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple's home and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin, alprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a bottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at issue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of heroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2 alleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on April 14, 2010, and that \"death ... resulted from the use of th[at] substance\"-thus subjecting Burrage to the 20-year mandatory minimum of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the cause of Banka's death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic toxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present in Banka's system at the time of his death, including heroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metabolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a \"product of metabolism,\" Webster's New International Dictionary 1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it, \"what a drug breaks down into in the body,\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862813\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1015/\">\n     687 F.3d 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1018, n. 2 (C.A.8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin metabolite, was the only drug present at a level above the therapeutic range-\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the concentration normally present when a person takes a drug as prescribed-Dr. Schwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless concluded that heroin \"was a contributing factor\" in Banka's death, since it interacted with the other drugs to cause \"respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.\" App. 196. The heroin, in other words, contributed to an overall effect that caused Banka to stop\n    breathing. Dr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner, came to similar conclusions. She described the cause of death as \"mixed drug intoxication\" with heroin, oxycodone, alprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a \"contributing\" role.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether Banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but observed that Banka's death would have been \"[v]ery less likely.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 171.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    The District Court denied Burrage's motion for a judgment of acquittal, which argued that Banka's death did not \"result from\" heroin use because there was no evidence that heroin was a but-for cause of death.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 30. The court also declined to give Burrage's proposed jury instructions regarding causation. One of those instructions would have required the Government to prove that heroin use \"was the proximate cause of [Banka's] death.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 236. Another would have defined proximate cause as \"a cause of death that played a substantial part in bringing about the death,\" meaning that \"[t]he death must have been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable consequence of the cause and except for the cause the death would not have occurred.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 238. The court instead gave an instruction requiring the Government to prove \"that the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a contributing cause of Joshua Banka's death.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 241-242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the court sentenced him to 20 years' imprisonment, consistent with \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)'s prescribed minimum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Burrage's convictions.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862813\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1015/\">\n     687 F.3d 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Consider a baseball game in which the visiting team's leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of the first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a score of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English language and familiar with the American pastime would agree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is so because it is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point that the victory also resulted from a host of\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    necessary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach's decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league's decision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event. If the visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than 1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter's early, non-dispositive home run.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the contrary, courts regularly read phrases like \"results from\" to require but-for causality.

The Government argues, however, that distinctive problems associated with drug overdoses counsel in\n    favor of dispensing with the usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often take drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010 involved more than one drug. See Brief for United States 28-29. This consideration leads the Government to urge an interpretation of \"results from\" under which use of a drug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for cause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause death, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such as mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In support of its argument, the Government can point to the undoubted reality that courts have not\n    <em>\n     always\n    </em>\n    required strict but-for causality, even where criminal liability is at issue. The most common (though still rare) instance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes independently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\n    <em>\n     Nassar,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698471\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/338/#p2525\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at ----, 133 S.Ct., at 2525; see also LaFave 467 (describing these cases as \"unusual\" and \"numerically in the minority\"). To illustrate, if \"A stabs B, inflicting a fatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting independently, shoots B in the head ... also inflicting [a fatal] wound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two wounds,\" A will generally be liable for homicide even though his conduct was not a but-for cause of B's death (since B would have died from X's actions in any event).\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    ., at 468 (italics omitted). We need not accept or reject the special rule developed for these cases, since there was no evidence here that Banka's heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was prepared to say that Banka would have died from the heroin use alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less demanding (but also less well established) line of authority, under which an act or omission is considered a cause-in-fact if it was a \"substantial\" or \"contributing\" factor in producing a given result.

One prominent authority on tort law asserts that \"a broader rule ... has found general acceptance: The defendant's conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about.\" W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7 41, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But the authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the tort context, \"[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated\" (an apparent reference to the situation where each of two causes is independently effective) \"no case has been found where the defendant's act could be called a substantial factor when the event would have occurred without it.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative rule-functionally identical to the one the Government argues here-that \"[w]hen the conduct of two or more actors is so related to an event that their combined conduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event, and application of the but-for rule to them individually would absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.\"\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    Yet, as of 1984, \"no judicial opinion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     Ibid.,\n    </em>\n    n. 40.

The language Congress enacted requires death to \"result from\" use of the unlawfully distributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed. Congress could have written \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the underlying crime \"contributes to\" death or serious bodily injury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to cases involving concurrent causes, as five States have done, see Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-2-5(a) (2005); Ark.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-2-205 (2006); Me.Rev.Stat.

We doubt that the requirement of but-for causation for this incremental punishment will prove a policy disaster. A cursory search of the Federal Reporter reveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuperable barrier the Government makes it out to be.

Taken literally, its \"contributing-cause\" test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or omission that makes a positive incremental contribution, however small, to a particular result. See Brief for State of Alaska et al. as\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    20; see also Black's Law Dictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    (defining \"contributing cause\" as \"[a] factor that-though not the primary cause-plays a part in producing a result\"). But at oral argument the Government insisted that its test excludes causes that are \"not important enough\" or \"too insubstantial.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how important or how substantial a cause must be to qualify. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 41-42. Presumably the lower courts would be left to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since the evidence in \u00a7 841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms of probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in this case, for example, testified that Banka's death would have been \"[v]ery less likely\" had he not used the heroin that Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use of a drug made the victim's death 50 percent more likely? Fifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that kind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the need to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons can comprehend.
