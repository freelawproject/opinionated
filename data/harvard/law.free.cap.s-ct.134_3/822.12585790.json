(\"At the very least, before acting irretrievably, this Court might have invited prompt clarification of the Court of Appeals' [stay] order. Appreciation of our own fallibility, and respect for the judgment of an appellate tribunal closer to the scene than we are, as I see it, demand as much.\").\n </opinion>\n\n</casebody>\n"}}
