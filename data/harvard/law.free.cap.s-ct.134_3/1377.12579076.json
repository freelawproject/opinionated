Lexmark's \"Prebate\" program gives customers a discount on new cartridges if they agree to return empty cartridges to the company. Each Prebate cartridge has a microchip that disables the empty cartridge unless Lexmark replaces the chip. Respondent Static Control, a maker and seller of components for the remanufacture of Lexmark cartridges, developed a microchip that mimicked Lexmark's. Lexmark sued for copyright infringement, but Static Control counterclaimed, alleging that Lexmark engaged in false or misleading advertising in violation of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and that its misrepresentations had caused Static Control lost sales and damage to its business reputation. The District Court held that Static Control lacked \"prudential standing\" to bring the Lanham Act claim, applying a multifactor balancing test the court attributed to\n   <em>\n    Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    459 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    74 L.Ed.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To decide that question, this Court must determine the provision's meaning, using traditional principles of statutory interpretation. It is misleading to label this a \"prudential standing\" question. Lexmark bases its \"prudential\n   standing\" arguments on\n   <em>\n    Associated General Contractors,\n   </em>\n   but that case rested on statutory considerations: The Court sought to \"ascertain,\" as a statutory-interpretation matter, the \"scope of the private remedy created by\" Congress in \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, and the \"class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under\" that legislatively conferred cause of action,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    459 U.S., at 529, 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while this Court may have placed the \"zone of interests\" test that Static Control relies on under the \"prudential\" rubric in the past, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p12\">\n    542 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p12\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2525260\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/1/#p12\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it does not belong there any more than\n   <em>\n    Associated General Contractors\n   </em>\n   does.

Pp. 1388 - 1390.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (2) A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.

In a sense, all commercial injuries from false advertising are derivative of those suffered by consumers deceived by the advertising. But since the Lanham Act authorizes suit only for commercial injuries, the intervening consumer-deception step is not fatal to the proximate-cause showing the statute requires. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Bridge v.

Thus, a plaintiff suing under \u00a7 1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.

Background\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Lexmark manufactures and sells laser printers. It also sells toner cartridges for those printers (toner being the powdery ink that laser printers use to create images on paper). Lexmark designs its printers to work only with its own style of cartridges, and it therefore dominates the market for cartridges compatible with its printers. That market, however, is not devoid of competitors. Other businesses, called \"remanufacturers,\" acquire used Lexmark toner cartridges, refurbish them, and sell them in competition with new and refurbished cartridges sold by Lexmark.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Lexmark would prefer that its customers return their empty cartridges to it for refurbishment and resale, rather than sell those cartridges to a remanufacturer. So Lexmark introduced what it called a \"Prebate\" program, which enabled customers to purchase new toner cartridges at a 20-percent discount if they would agree to return the cartridge to Lexmark once it was empty. Those terms were communicated to consumers through notices printed on the toner-cartridge boxes, which advised the consumer that opening the box would indicate assent to the terms-a practice commonly known as \"shrinkwrap licensing,\" see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452869\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1447/#p1449\">\n     86 F.3d 1447\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1449 (C.A.7 1996). To enforce the Prebate terms, Lexmark included a microchip in each Prebate cartridge that would disable the cartridge after it ran out of toner; for the cartridge to be used again, the microchip would have to be replaced by Lexmark.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Static Control is not itself a manufacturer or remanufacturer of toner cartridges. It is, rather, \"the market leader [in] making and selling the components necessary to remanufacture Lexmark cartridges.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623410\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/387/\">\n     697 F.3d 387\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 396 (C.A.6 2012) (case below). In addition to supplying remanufacturers with toner and various replacement parts, Static Control developed a microchip that could mimic the microchip in Lexmark's Prebate cartridges. By purchasing Static Control's microchips and using them to replace the Lexmark microchip, remanufacturers were able to refurbish and resell used Prebate cartridges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Lexmark did not take kindly to that development. In 2002, it sued Static Control, alleging that Static Control's microchips violated both the Copyright Act of 1976,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.,\n    </em>\n    and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    Static Control counterclaimed, alleging, among other things, violations of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20441\">\n     60 Stat. 441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Static Control alleged only false advertising.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    As relevant to its Lanham Act claim, Static Control alleged two types of false or misleading conduct by Lexmark. First, it alleged that through its Prebate program Lexmark \"purposefully misleads end-users\" to believe that they are legally bound by the Prebate terms and are thus required to return the Prebate-labeled cartridge to Lexmark after a single use. App. 31, \u00b6 39. Second, it alleged that upon introducing the Prebate program, Lexmark \"sent letters to most of the companies in the toner cartridge remanufacturing business\" falsely advising those companies that it was illegal to sell refurbished Prebate cartridges and, in particular, that it was illegal to use Static Control's products to refurbish those cartridges.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 29, \u00b6 35.

It further maintained that Lexmark's misrepresentations had \"proximately caused and [we]re likely to cause injury to [Static Control] by diverting sales from [Static Control] to Lexmark,\" and had \"substantially injured [its] business reputation\" by \"leading consumers and others in the trade to believe that [Static Control] is engaged in illegal conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 44, \u00b6 88.

For example, while a competitor who is forced out of business by a defendant's false advertising generally will be able to sue for its losses, the same is not true of the competitor's landlord, its electric company, and other commercial parties who suffer merely as a result of the competitor's \"inability to meet [its] financial obligations.\"\n    <em>\n     Anza,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     547 U.S., at 458\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1991\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fr6\" name=\"fr6\">\n      6\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     C.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 11-12, 17-18. But it urges us to adopt, as the optimal formulation of those principles, a multifactor balancing test derived from\n    <em>\n     Associated General Contractors\n    </em>\n    . In the alternative, it asks that we adopt a categorical test permitting only direct competitors to sue for false advertising. And although neither party urges adoption of the \"reasonable interest\" test applied below, several\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    do so. While none of those tests is wholly without merit, we decline to adopt any of them. We hold instead that a direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The balancing test Lexmark advocates was first articulated by the Third Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Conte Bros.\n    </em>\n    and later adopted by several other Circuits.\n    <em>\n     Conte Bros.\n    </em>\n    identified five relevant considerations:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \"(1) The nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury: Is the injury of a type that Congress sought to redress in providing a private remedy for violations of the [Lanham Act]?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"(2) The directness or indirectness of the asserted injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \"(3) The proximity or remoteness of the party to the alleged injurious conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    \"(4) The speculativeness of the damages claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \"(5) The risk of duplicative damages or complexity in apportioning damages.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11772344\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/221/#p233\">\n     165 F.3d, at 233\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    This approach reflects a commendable effort to give content to an otherwise nebulous inquiry, but we think it slightly off the mark. The first factor can be read as requiring that the plaintiff's injury be within the relevant zone of interests and the second and third as requiring (somewhat redundantly) proximate causation; but it is not correct to treat those requirements, which must be met in every case, as mere factors to be weighed in a balance. And the fourth and fifth factors are themselves problematic. \"[T]he difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action\" is a \"motivating principle\" behind the proximate-cause requirement,\n    <em>\n     Anza, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 457-458,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1991\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; but potential difficulty in ascertaining and apportioning damages is not, as\n    <em>\n     Conte Bros.\n    </em>\n    might suggest, an\n    <em>\n     independent\n    </em>\n    basis for denying standing where it is adequately alleged that a defendant's conduct has proximately injured an interest of the plaintiff's that the statute protects. Even when a plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled to injunctive relief under \u00a7 1116(a) (assuming it can prove a likelihood of future injury) or disgorgement of the defendant's ill-gotten profits under \u00a7 1117(a).

Finally, experience has shown that the\n    <em>\n     Conte Bros.\n    </em>\n    approach, like other open-ended balancing tests, can yield unpredictable and at times arbitrary results. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Tushnet, Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal Trademark and False Advertising Law,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%201305\">\n     159 U.

To be sure, a plaintiff who does not compete with the defendant will often have a harder time establishing proximate causation. But a rule categorically prohibiting all suits by noncompetitors would read too much into the Act's reference to \"unfair competition\" in \u00a7 1127. By the time the Lanham Act was adopted, the common-law tort of unfair competition was understood not to be limited to actions between competitors. One leading authority in the field wrote that \"there need be no competition in unfair competition,\" just as \"[t]here is no soda in soda water, no grapes in grape fruit, no bread in bread fruit, and a clothes horse is not a horse but is good enough to hang things on.\" Rogers, 39 Yale L. J., at 299; accord,\n    <em>\n     Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641513\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f/300/509/#p512\">\n     300 F. 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 512 (C.A.6 1924); 1 H.

It is thus a mistake to infer that because the Lanham Act treats false advertising as a form of unfair competition, it can protect\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    the false-advertiser's direct competitors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Finally, there is the \"reasonable interest\" test applied by the Sixth Circuit in this case. As typically formulated, it requires a commercial plaintiff to \"demonstrate '(1) a reasonable interest to be protected against the alleged false advertising and (2) a reasonable basis for believing\n    that the interest is likely to be damaged by the alleged false advertising.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623410\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/387/\">\n     697 F.3d, at 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Famous Horse,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3796156\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/106/#p113\">\n     624 F.3d, at 113\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). A purely practical objection to the test is that it lends itself to widely divergent application. Indeed, its vague language can be understood as requiring only the bare minimum of Article III standing. The popularity of the multifactor balancing test reflects its appeal to courts tired of \"grappl[ing] with defining\" the \" 'reasonable interest' \" test \"with greater precision.\"\n    <em>\n     Conte Bros.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11772344\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/165/221/#p233\">\n     165 F.3d, at 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The theoretical difficulties with the test are even more substantial: The relevant question is not whether the plaintiff's interest is \"reasonable,\" but whether it is one the Lanham Act protects; and not whether there is a \"reasonable basis\" for the plaintiff's claim of harm, but whether the harm alleged is proximately tied to the defendant's conduct. In short, we think the principles set forth above will provide clearer and more accurate guidance than the \"reasonable interest\" test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Application\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Applying those principles to Static Control's false-advertising claim, we conclude that Static Control comes within the class of plaintiffs whom Congress authorized to sue under \u00a7 1125(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    To begin, Static Control's alleged injuries-lost sales and damage to its business reputation-are injuries to precisely the sorts of commercial interests the Act protects. Static Control is suing not as a deceived consumer, but as a \"perso[n] engaged in\" \"commerce within the control of Congress\" whose position in the marketplace has been damaged by Lexmark's false advertising. \u00a7 1127. There is no doubt that it is within the zone of interests protected by the statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Static Control also sufficiently alleged that its injuries were proximately caused by Lexmark's misrepresentations. This case, it is true, does not present the \"classic Lanham Act false-advertising claim\" in which \" 'one competito[r] directly injur[es] another by making false statements about his own goods [or the competitor's goods] and thus inducing customers to switch.' \"\n    <em>\n     Harold H. Huggins Realty,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4093472\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/787/#p800\">\n     634 F.3d, at 799, n. 24\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But although diversion of sales to a direct competitor may be the paradigmatic direct injury from false advertising, it is not the only type of injury cognizable under \u00a7 1125(a). For at least two reasons, Static Control's allegations satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    First, Static Control alleged that Lexmark disparaged its business and products by asserting that Static Control's business was illegal. See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623410\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/387/\">\n     697 F.3d, at 411, n. 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting allegation that Lexmark \"directly target[ed] Static Control\" when it \"falsely advertised that Static Control infringed Lexmark's patents\"). When a defendant harms a plaintiff's reputation by casting aspersions on its business, the plaintiff's injury flows directly from the audience's belief in the disparaging statements. Courts have therefore afforded relief under \u00a7 1125(a) not only where a defendant denigrates a plaintiff's product by name, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McNeilab, Inc. v. American Home Prods. Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783451\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/34/#p38\">\n     848 F.2d 34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 38 (C.A.2 1988), but also where the defendant damages the product's reputation by, for example, equating it with an inferior product, see,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Camel Hair and Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605808\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/799/6/#p7\">\n     799 F.2d 6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 7-8, 11-12 (C.A.1 1986);\n    <em>\n     PPX Enterprises, Inc. v.

Traditional proximate-causation principles support those results: As we have observed, a defendant who \" 'seeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to\n    <em>\n     or about\n    </em>\n    the plaintiff or his\n    product' \" may be said to have proximately caused the plaintiff's harm.\n    <em>\n     Bridge,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p656\">\n     553 U.S., at 657\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p656\">\n     128 S.Ct. 2131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 870, Comment\n    <em>\n     h\n    </em>\n    (1977); emphasis added in\n    <em>\n     Bridge\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static Control are not direct competitors. But when a party claims reputational injury from disparagement, competition is not required for proximate cause; and that is true even if the defendant's aim was to harm its immediate competitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral damage. Consider two rival carmakers who purchase airbags for their cars from different third-party manufacturers. If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from the second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the second carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker and its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and their sales may decline as a result. In those circumstances, there is no reason to regard either party's injury as derivative of the other's; each is directly and independently harmed by the attack on its merchandise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In addition, Static Control adequately alleged proximate causation by alleging that it designed, manufactured, and sold microchips that both (1) were necessary for, and (2) had no other use than, refurbishing Lexmark toner cartridges. See App. 13, \u00b6 31;\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 37, \u00b6 54.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    It follows from that allegation that any false advertising that reduced the remanufacturers' business necessarily injured Static Control as well. Taking Static Control's assertions at face value, there is likely to be something very close to a 1:1 relationship between the number of refurbished Prebate cartridges sold (or not sold) by the remanufacturers and the number of Prebate microchips sold (or not sold) by Static Control. \"Where the injury alleged is so integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, there can be no question\" that proximate cause is satisfied.\n    <em>\n     Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/#p479\">\n     457 U.S. 465\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 479,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/#p479\">\n     102 S.Ct. 2540\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/#p479\">\n     73 L.Ed.2d 149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1982).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    To be sure, on this view, the causal chain linking Static Control's injuries to consumer confusion is not direct, but includes the intervening link of injury to the remanufacturers. Static Control's allegations therefore might not support standing under a strict application of the \" ' \"general tendency\" ' \" not to stretch proximate causation \" ' \"beyond the first step.\" ' \"\n    <em>\n     Holmes,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226783\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/258/#p268\">\n     503 U.S., at 271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6226783\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/258/#p268\">\n     112 S.Ct. 1311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But the reason for that general tendency is that there ordinarily is a \"discontinuity\" between the injury to the direct victim and the injury to the indirect victim, so that the latter is not surely attributable to the former (and thus also to the defendant's conduct), but might instead have resulted from \"any number of [other] reasons.\"\n    <em>\n     Anza,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     547 U.S., at 458-459\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1991\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is not the case here. Static Control's allegations suggest that if the remanufacturers sold 10,000 fewer refurbished cartridges because of Lexmark's false advertising, then it would follow more or less automatically that Static Control sold 10,000 fewer microchips for the same reason, without the need for any \"speculative ... proceedings\" or \"intricate, uncertain inquiries.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     at 459-460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p456\">\n     126 S.Ct. 1991\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
