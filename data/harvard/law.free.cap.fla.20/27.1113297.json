Where a party sells and delivers to another party at a port of entry in this State a quantity of timber on board a ship, and guarantees the same to be of \u201cthe season\u2019s manufacture, and of fair average quality, the measurement to overrun the specifications,\u2019' the measure of damages to be recovered in an action for a broach of the contract is controlled by the difference in the value of the timber in the market where the contract was made, and the timber delivered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-9\">2. The refusal of the court to receive evidence in such a case of the difference in such value in the market of Liverpool, where the contract does not provide for such an assessment of damage, and where there is no allegation in the declaration that the damage was there to lie assessed, is not error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-11\">0. The contract or agreement of parties in Liverpool lor the purchase and sale of such timber, to receive from their consignor, in Pensacola, a certain sum in full for damages on a breach of such contract to be completed in Liverpool, is not evidence of the value of the timber as guaranteed in Pensacola, and its market value in Pensacola.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-12\">4. The general rule is, \u201cThat damages recoverable will bo calculated at the market value of the goods at the time and place when and where they ought to have been delivered.\u201d \u201cAnd evidence of the value of such goods in a foreign market cannot be received upon a question of damages, unless it is averred in the declaration that the goods were bought for that market.\u201d</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b23-13\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Escambia county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-14\">The facts of the case are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>John G. Avery </em>and <em>J. JE. Yonge </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-4\">The first error assigned is that the court below rejected so much of Thomas Harrison\u2019s deposition as went to show the guaranty of the contract between Gilbert, Harrison &amp; Co. and Carter, Tyner &amp; Parker. The rejection of this testimoiry was clearly erroneous, because, when connected with testimony previously given, it made out a material breach of the contract sued on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">The guaranty of the contract sued on was that the timber was \u201c of fair average quality.\u201d The guaranty of the contract between G., H. &amp; Co. and C., T. &amp; P. was that \u201c the timber should be of the fair average quality of the season\u2019s shipments of pitch pine from Pensacola to Liverpool.\u201d These two guarantees are substantially identical, plaintiffs having shown by other witnesses that the fair average quality of timber from Pensacola to Liverpool was not different from the lair a verage quality of timber at Pensacola, and, if identical, then the testimony rejected was material and pertinent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-6\">Plaintiff's did not derive any benefit from the admission of the statement that \u201c on the arrival of the ship the wit\u25a0ness himself examined the cargo as it was discharged, and at once decided that it was not of fair average quality of the season\u2019s shipments, but on the contrary was inferior.\u201d So far as the jury -was advised, the \u201c fair average quality \u201d here mentioned might have had reference to shipments from Canada, or any other timber section, remote from Pensacola. They required the information, which would have been afforded by the excluded testimony, to enable them to properly understand and apply to the case before them the testimony that was admitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-7\">The second error assigned is the injection of the interrogatory addressed to, and the answer thereto, by\u201eWilfofd Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ter. Tt may be that it was immaterial in itself whether reclamation was or was not made by Carter. Tyner &amp; Parker; and if the witness had been asked only whether such reclamation was made and allowed, then, possibly, the objection would have been plausible. But the interrogatory requires the witness to state further whether the amount of the reclamation was more or less than the true difference between the value of the timber delivered and the value of average shipments from Pensacola. Thus, in connection with the other testimony in the case, the whole interrogatory, and the -answer to it, became relevant and proper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">But the evidence of amount of reclamation paid is itself admissible for the purpose of determining value. Such evidence shows that the price for which the timber sold was so much less than it would have been but for defect warranted against; and evidence of the price obtained on re-sale has been held admissible to prove value.

The court below erred in sustaining the objection to the interrogatory adressed to Wilford Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Second. The court below erred in sustaining the objection to answer to interrogatory addressed to Thomas Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The record shows that the plaintiffs introduced witnesses who \u201c testified, that the fair average quality of pitch \u201c pine timber ar Pensacola was not different from the fair \u201c average quality of such timber at Pensacola in other sea- \u201c sons, and that the fair average quality of pitch pine \u201c shipments from Pensacola to Liverpool, in L879, was not \u201cdifferent from the fair average quality of shipments in \u201c other seasons, or to other ports, and that, the fair average \u201c quality of such shipments from Pensacola to Liverpool \u201cwas'not different from the fair average quality of such \u201c timber at Pensacola, and that the timber in question was \u201c not of fair average quality of the season\u2019s shipment of \u201c pitch pine timber from Pensacola to Liverpool \u201d ; and then and there by their attorneys, offered the deposition of Thos. Harrison, taken at Liverpool under a commission, and upon written interrogatories, in the course of which said deposition and in answer to the following interrogatory:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u201c State whether in the year 1879 you became the purchaser of a cargo, or part of a cargo of pitch pine timber shipped from Pensacola, Flprida, United States of America, to Liverpool, on the British bark FT. Mosher, by L. iVL Merritt &amp; Son., and if so, state what was the description and quality of said, cargo. Was it, or was it not merchantable Y Was it, or was it not of fair average quality of pitch pine shipments from Pensacola to Liverpool, in previous years Y Please'state whether the average quality of pitch pine shipments to Pensacola previous to H79 were better or worse than the shipments of 1879 ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The said witness answered and said : \u201c In the year 1879 his firm of Gilbert, Harrison Brothers purchased from Messrs. Carter, Tyner &amp; Parker portions of the cargo of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>]\\r. Mosher ; such purchases were made before the ship arrived, and upon a guarantee in the contract that the timber should be o\u00ed the fair average quality of the season\u2019s shipments of pitch pine from Pensacola to Liverpool ; on the arrival of the ship the witness, himself, examined the cargo as it was discharged, and at once decided that it was not of fair average quality of the season\u2019s shipments, but on the contrary was inferior. The inferiority was so groat that the witness rejected the timber as'a fulfillment of his contract, and refused to accept it, and the rejection was allowed by Messrs. Carter, Tyner &amp; Paiker. It could not be resisted.\u201d \u201c But to the- admission of said answer to said interrogatory the attorney for the said defendant did then and there object, because the guarantee of the contract, in said answer mentioned was different from the guarantee of the contract mentioned in the declaration ; and the said Judge did then and there deliver his opinion and decide that the said objection ought to be allowed, and said answer ought not to be admitted in testimony,\u201d except the following: \u201cIn the year 1879, his firm o.f Gilbert, Harrison <em>&amp; </em>\u201cBros, purchased from Messrs. Carter, Tyner &amp; Parker, \u201cportions of the cargo of the 1ST. Mosher; such purchases \u201c were made before the ship arrived.\u201d And except the following: \u201cOn the arrival of the ship the witness, himself, \u201c examined the cargo as it was discharged, and at once de\u201coided that it was not of lair average quality of the season\u2019s shipments, but on the contrary was interior.\u201d To \u2022which opinion and decision of said Judge said plaintiffs, by their attorneys, did then and there except.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">It also appears by the record that the plaintiffs produced and offered the deposition of Wilford Carter, of Liverpool, taken under a commission upon written interrogatories; that he was one of the firm of \u201cTyner, Carter &amp; Pai\u2019ker,\u201d who were the purchasers of the cargo of timber on the U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Mosher; that witness ivas required by the plaintiffs to answer the following interrogatory : \u201c State whether any reclamation was made from L. M. Merritt &amp; Son, in behalf of Messrs. Vaughn &amp; Co., on account of said cargo not being of fair average quality of shipments of pitch pine timber from Pensacola, Florida, to Liverpool, and if so, state iti what amount, and was the said reclamation paid ? And was the amount of the said reclamation moreor less than the true difference between the value of said timber and the value of average shipments from Pensacola, estimating also the deficiency in the measurement- ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The witness answered as follows: \u201c Witness saith his firm claimed -an allowance under the circumstances as stated in his answer to the last interrogatory. Negotiations in regard to the claim were conducted between his firm and Messrs. Merritt, by Mr. Smith, of the firm of James Smith &amp;. Co. In result, witness agreed to accept-an allowance of \u00a347 and \u00a363, making together \u00a3110 from the contract price, and such amount was duly paid to the witness\u2019s firm. The witness has no hesitation in saying that the amount of the allowance was not more than the true difference between the value of the timber, and value of the average shipments from Pensacola, estimating also, the deficiency in measurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">To \"this \u00edhteh\u2019bgat\u00f3iy and-answer the defendantVeouhsel duly objected, because the same was irrelevant and impertinent. The court sustained the objection,- and decided that the answer should not be read to the jury. The plaintiffs duly excepted to the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The contract in this ease was made in Pensacola, and in' it there is no reference as to the place of delivery of the timber by the ship.\" Witticli sells and Merritt &amp; Son buy at Pensacola. The title there passes and the delivery is made. The declaration charges the same fact, to wit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201c That on the 17th day of May, A. I). 1879, in the county aforesaid (Escambia county) the said defendant sold to L. M. Merritt &amp; Son, the plaintiffs, a cargo of pitch pine loaded on board the British ship U. Mosher,\u201d &amp;c. There is no allegation that defendant knew that said timber ivas to be transported t\u00a9 Liverpool, or that it was to be there inspected. The defendant did not guarantee that the timber should be of the \u201c fair average quality of pitch pine \u201c shipments from Pensacola to Liverpool in previous years.\u201d The language of his contract is: \u201c Timber guaranteed of \u201c the seasons manufacture, of fair average quality.\u201d He did not guarantee. \u201c that the timber should, be of the fair aver\u201c\u2022age.quality of the season\u2019s shipments of pitch pine from \u201c Pepsaeola to Liverpool,\u201d as.embodied in the answer to th\u00a7. interrogatory .propounded \u25a0 to the witness Harrison. The quality was to be determined in the Pensacola.market, an,A not Liverpool... The Liverpool market might have, demanded a. higher ..quality of., timber than did the Pensacola market. . It appears that .the consignors at. Liverpool, Caiv ter, Tyner.&amp; Parker, had sold, by contract, to Gilbert,. Haiv rjson.Bros...a..povtipn of the .cargo , of the U. Mosher, to agr i\\i,ve, and- hacl guaranteed in that contract \u201c that the timber-\u201c\u25a0should be of \u2022the..-fair..av,ej:age quality .of the season\u2019s, shi.p- \u201c ment of pitch pine <em>from Pensacola to ..Liverpool.\u201d </em>.TfieevL deqce of this witness, Harrison.,, was in reference to the contract so made with his firm,and .not with reference to the, contract here declared on, which is essentially different from the one .between Carter, Tyner &amp; Parker and Gilbert,Harrison Bros. The evidence as to .the quality of the timber in question should have been directed in reference to the Pensacola market, and. not to that, of some foreign port. It is true that the witness, E. B. Merritt, one of, the plaintiffs, testifies in his own behalf \u201c that the said timber in the said \u201c declaration mentioned was purchased by the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201c from the defendant for re-sale at Liverpool, England, of \u201c which the defendant at the time of said -purchase had no- \u201c tice, and that tlie said ship N. Mosher, on board of which \u201c the said defendant contracted to and did deliver said timu ber, was under charter to the said Wittich at the time of \u201c said sale for some safe port in the United Kingdom, and <em>il </em>about.the time of the said sale of timber in the declara- \u201c tion mentioned, the defendant assigned said charter party to the plaintiffs.\u201d None of these facts so sworn to appear in the contract, nor are they alleged in- the declaration. This evidence does not, therefore, permit'the testimony of Harrison to be introduced to show the quality of the timber in Liverpool under the sub-contraet with Carter,.Tyner <em>&amp; </em>Parker. It is evident the sale and delivery was fully consummated at Pensacola, and the breach of the coutract, if there was one, was at sapie place. Tt'mnst.have been easy to ascertain the quality of the timber at Pensacola by the examination of witnesses who handled \u00a1and 'Shipped it-at that port. No notice seems to have-been: given.:.to- the 'defendant on the arrival of the timber in :Liverpool \u25a0 of .the alleged failure, of his guarantee, or of the sale.at a-reduced price of the same, until, the-commencement .of this action: If the contract or the conduct of the parties fixed a place \u201c by the market rates -of which the -value is to be ascer- \u201c tained, the .eyidenco should be confined to the market \u201c value at that place, and not extend to the value in other \u201c markets.\u201d Abbott\u2019s Trial Evidence, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The case of Cahen vs. Platt, 69 N. Y., 348, was an action brought to recover damages for the alleged breach of a contract of purchase and sale. In the city of Now York plaintiff sold to defendants certain boxes-of glass, to be paid for in New York upon, bills of lading, by bills of exchange on Antwerp. It was to be delivered on board of vessels at Antwerp, and to be thereafter at the risk of the defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>In pursuance of the contract the plaintiff delivered a portion of the- glass, tor which -they were paid. The defendants refused to receive any more, and the action was brought to recover damages consequent on such refusal. The court in their opinion say : \u201c The contract was made in New York, \u201c and it was doubtless contemplated by the parties that the \u201c glass would be carried to New York. But the plaintiff' \u201c was not bound to deliver it there. His delivery was upon. \u201c ship board at Antwerp, and after the glass was shipped \u201c the defendants could transport it to any port of the world. \u201c It was then at their risk, :md they were- liable to pay for \u201c it, although it should be lost.\u201d \u201c The general measure \u2018\u2018 of damage in such a case is the difference between the con- \u201c tract price and the market price at the time and plaee of \u201c delivery.\u201d Bickett vs. Colton, 41 Miss., 368; Boier vs. Vincent, 4 Iowa, 387; Sleuter vs. Wallbaum, 45 Ill., 43; Gregory vs. McDowell, 8 Wend., 435; Clark vs. Pinney, 7 Cowen, 681; Shaw vs. Nudd, 8 Pick., 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u201c Upon a contract to deliver goods, the general rale of \u201c damages for non-delivery is the market value ot the goods. \u201c at the time and plaee ot the promised delivery, if no-' \u201c money has yet been paid by the vendee;. but. if the ven- \u201c dee has already paid the price in advance he may recover \u201c the highest price of such goods in the same place, at any \u201ctime between the stipulated day and the time of trial\u201d 2 Greenleaf on Ev., 13 Ed., p. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">-In Wait\u2019s Actions and Defences, Vol. 3, page 521, it is Said: \u201c The damages recoverable will be calculated as the \u201c market value of the goods at -the time and plaee when and \u201c where they ought to have been delivered, and cites Lawrence vs. Knowles, 5 Bing., N. C., 399; s. c., 7 Scott, 181; York vs. VerPlanck, 65 Barb., 316. \u201c And evidence of \u201c the value of such goods in a foreign market cannot be \u201c received upon the question of damages, unless it is averred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201c in- the declaration that the goods were bought for that market,\u201d and cites Cofield vs. Clark, 2 Col. T., 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Again, he says in Vol. 2, page 460 : \u201c Where the vendor <em>\u201c </em>incurs liability to the vendee for the detective quality of \u201cgoods sold, whether his liability arises through fraud or \u201c a breach of contract, the measure of damages is the differ- \u201c ence'in value at the time between' goods corresponding \u201c with the representations made, and those actually deliv- \u201c ered.\u201d Likes vs. Baer, 8 Iowa, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In the ease of Converse vs. Barrows, 2 Minn., 229, cited by counsel for appellants, the declaration alleged that the pork was to he furnished to the plaintiff for supplies at Eort Eidgley in the Territory of Minnesota, which plaintiff had contracted to supply, which fact was well known to the defendant. In the case under consideration, neither the contract nor the declaration in any way indicate the intention of plaintiffs to export the timber, or the defendant to become liable for a breach of the guarantee at any place except Pensacola, where the sale and delivery took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">If the court was correct in sustaining the objection to the answer to the interrogatory addressed to Harrison, it was also right in sustaining the objection to the answer of Carter. The amount of allowance of ,\u00a3110 from the contract price in Liv\u00e9rpool, was iu no sense evidence of the differ-, enee in value of the timber as guaranteed in Pensacola, and its market value at Pensacola.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">There was no error upon the part of the court and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
