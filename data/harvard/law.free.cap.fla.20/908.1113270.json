Cockrell </em>for -Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-6\">The equity of the bill was assailed by the demurrer, and the action of the court overruling the demurrer is here the basis of the petition of appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-7\">Brief. The court should have sustained the demurrer :</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-8\">1. It is the settled rule in equity, if a person wants relief, touching the personal assets of his debtor, he must show he has taken out <em>execution at laxo. </em>Brenkerhoff vs. Brown, 4 Johns. Chy., 676.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-9\">2. Persons intermeddling with a decedent\u2019s estate are liable to the executor or administrator, only. Scriven vs. Bostwick, 2 McCord\u2019s Chy., 410; s. c., 16 Amer. Decis., 664.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-10\">3. As all the creditors of TI. B.

Chy., 639; Scott vs. Wolf, 64 Ala., 182.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-11\">4. If the estate is to be administered, the executor <em>de son tort </em>being before the court will not dispense with the presence of the regular representative ; the executor <em>de son tort </em>is only treated as executor for the purpose of being charged, not for any other purpose. Williams on Executors, pages 1727, 2016, 2128, and the cases therein cited; Garner <em>et al. </em>vs. Gant, 19 Ala., 668.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-12\">The conclusive answer to the bill is, that the title to the assets sought to be appropriated to the payment of the note, not being before the court in the person of the rightful representive, he could not be bound by the decree which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>court might make touching the assets of the decedent. Upon his appointment, lie is clothed, by the action of the only court constitutionally competent to grant letters, with the title to all the assets which were of the decedent <em>at the time of his </em>death, and hence he could recover the assets notwithstanding the disposition sought to be made of them by the Chancery Court pi\u00faor to his appointment. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b909-5\">There is no such thing as an executor <em>ude son </em>tort\u201d under our system. <em>17 </em>Arkansas, 122, 129; 11 Kansas, 214; 50 Cal., 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b909-6\">As to whether an executor <em>de son tort </em>may be sued at law, and not in equity, see Campbell vs. Shelton, 13 Pick., 8, 22, 24.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b909-7\"><em>Ii.

Walker, George U. Walker and Elizabeth H. McCallum, the widow of the deceased, the allegation against Mrs. McCallum being that she is improperly in possession of or controlling an asset of the estate, a debt to the estate by Charles H. Jones, and a creditor of the deceased alleged to have received payment of his claim when not entitled to any priority as against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Ho relief is prayed against this satisfied creditor, and we do not see how there could be as the payment of his debt was precisely'the thing which plaintiff himself seeks here, he being no more than a simple creditbr.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">There are sufficient assets remaining to pay the sureties\u2019 debt \u201cif a proper and judicious management or administration of the assets of said estate be had and immediate steps are taken for the benefit thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Giving the surety here the standing of a creditor of the deceased intestate, principal, and we think he certainly has a provable claim against the estate, the debt of the principal being due and unpaid ; what are the equities attached to that relation as applicable to the subject matter of this suit ? Where is the equity of the creditor here to have a receiver appointed to administer this estate ? Whatever may be the liability of a person, who, without lawful authority, either as executor or administrator, converts or collects assets of the estate to the legal administrator or personal representative, or to a creditor, this wrongful executor has no authority to collect the ,debts. He is not enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>tied to an action, has no right to reduce assets and his own liability is substantially founded upon tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Again, the creditor of an intestate estate has no direct action against its debtors to appropriate the debt to the satisfaction of his claim. If he attempts this he becomes himself <em>pro tanto </em>an executor <em>de son </em>tort, if there be such a thing as au executor <em>de son tort </em>in Florida. Besides he can be entitled to no particular priority against any debt under our statute. He has no lien if he gets a judgment, not being one of. the claims to which the statute gives priority. It follows, therefore, that neither an executor <em>de son </em>tort, if there be such ,a relation in Florida, nor a creditor, nor each combined have an equity to sue for and recover the debts due an intestate estate or to control the debts of such estate. If this be so, and that it is so we have no doubt, where is their equity to have a receiver to do these acts ? \u00a5e are entirely satisfied that a creditor cannot maintain such a bill as this. \"What kind of a bill he can maintain, and what are his rights against an intermeddler for assets in his hands or illegal administration or appropriation of those collected by him, is a question which does not arise here.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The order overruling the demurrer is reversed and the case will be remanded with directions to allow the demurrer and dismiss the bill without prejudice to any other proceeding in equity or at law which plaintiffs may institute, or for any relief different from that sought to be had in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
