The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>will in question was executed in New York, in compliance with the laws of the State of New York, by a citizen of New York who died in New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b849-5\">Did it not pass the real estate of the testator which was situated in Florida ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b849-6\">2d. ,As to the proper construction of the act of February 27, 1872, chapter 1878 : The first- section, it seems to us, clearly limits its application to cases where a man dies in this State. To deny this is to force into the minds of the legislators something not by them expressed, and only by us guessed at or, perhaps, thought by us to he more reasonable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b849-7\">The second section either limits its operation to cases where the death occurs in this State, as does the first section, and is intended to apply to eases where no election is made by the wife, as is now provided for. in the first section ; or, (second,) applying to all cases no matter where the death occurs makes the rule different where the death occurs in this State from that where death occurs abroad; or else, (third,) applying in all cases takes from the wife the right of election granted by the first section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b849-8\">We think that the first suggestion, to wit: that the second section limits its operation to cases where the death occurs in this State, as does the first section, and is intended to apply to cases where no election is made by the wife, as provided for in the first section, is the only one which will permit the two sections to harmonize, and is the most reasonable construction to be given it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b849-9\">Does not the first section control and limifrthe. operation of the second and confine the benefits conferred to the wife of a man dying intestate in the State of Florida as does the first section ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b849-10\"><em>Fleming DanieHor </em>Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>The questions involved in this ease come up on the demurrer to the bill filed for specific performance in the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-5\">The points to be decided are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-6\">1st. Whether a will executed in the State of New York in the presence of two witnesses, which in that State is good and valid to pass real estate, is effectual as a devise of lands -in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-7\">2d. Whether the widow of a man who dies intestate out of the State of Florida and without children is the sole heir at law of her deceased husband, or whether the provision in section two of the law of February 27th, 1872, chapter 1878, enures only to the benefit of widows whose husbands died in the State of Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-8\">As to the first point, the statement of the law of the subject establishes it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-9\">The statute now of force on the subject of last wills and testaments was enacted by the Legislature on the 20th day of November, A. D. 1828.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-10\">The 1st section of that act provides among other things that every person of the age of twenty-one years being of sound mind shall have power by last will and testament in writing to devise and dispose of his or her lands, provided that such will be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said testator or testatrix by three or more witnesses, or else it shall be utterly void and of none effect. McClellan\u2019s Dig., sec. 1, p. 985.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-11\">There has been no statute passed since this law was enacted doing away with the imperative requirement of at least \u201cthree witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b850-12\">The law of the place where the land is situate governs in the matter of the forms and solemnities requisite ,to give effect to a will designed to operate upon the same. 3d Washburn on Real Property, 3d Edition, p. 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>We have no law giving effect to a devise of lands if made according to the law of the place where the will is made, as is the case in Massachusetts and some other States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b851-5\">The statute of February 24th, 1873, chapter 1939, entitled \u201cAn act providing for the acknowledgment of deeds and other conveyances of lands,\u201d providing that deeds to lands in this State executed in another State may be executed according to the laws of such other States, applies only to deeds; and it is presumed that that provision of section 1 of said law would be pronounced unconstitutional for the same reason that section 5 of the same law has been so pronounced by this court in Carr vs. Thomas, 18 Fla., 736.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b851-6\">The second point, as we have above intimated, involves the construction of section 2 of the act of February 27th, 1872, chapter 1878 of the Laws of Florida, found in McClellan\u2019s Digest, p. 476, where both sections of the act are put together in what is marked as section 5, on p. 476. We contend that the second section of the act should be so construed as' to embrace all cases, whether the man die in this State or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b851-7\">The title of the act is general, being \u201c An act defining the interest the wife shall take in the husband\u2019s property.\u201d The Constitution of Florida provides that the subject of each act shall be briefly expressed in the title. There being no limitation in the title the presumptions are that the Legislature did not intend to limit the law as enacted to the property of a man dying in this State intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b851-8\">The first section of the act, it is true, reads : \u201c If a man' die in this State intestate, &amp;c.,\u201d the wife shall take the whole estate or dower at her election, and if the Legislature had stopped here the courts would in all probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>confine the operation of the law to cases where the intestate died in this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-5\">The second section, however, has no such limitation but provides in general terms that where the husband dies intestate without children the wife shall be sole heir at law. It will be noted that there are larger privileges granted to the wife under the first section than under the second. By the first section the wife at her election may either take the whole estate (subject, of course, to the debts of her intestate husband) or dower (discharged, as is the law in our State, from her husband\u2019s debts).</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-6\">The second section makes the wife the sole heir at law without any election of dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-7\">If it were intended by the Legislature to restrict the operation of the second section to estates where the intestate dies in this State without children, &amp;e., it would be a mere repetition if not a contradiction of the first which makes the wife the sole heir at law\" of her intestate husband but gives her the election of dower. The second section makes the wife no more the sole heir at law than does the first, while the first section gives her the right to elect dower, which, if the second section is intended to be applied to the same class of cases, is not given to her by the last section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-8\">The courts will so construe the two sections as to make them both operative and give meaning and effect to both, if such a construction can be put upon the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-9\">How assuming that the first section is limited to cases where a man dies in this State, &amp;c., the wife has the privilege of taking the whole estate or dower at her election, while the second section being without limitation as to whether the man die in this State or not makes the wife a sole heir at law without the privilege of electing her dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b852-10\">This construction of the second section is fully within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the subject of the act as expressed in the title and we think harmonizes the two sections of the act and gives meaning and purpose to both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b853-5\">An established rule of interpretation in considering a statute is, \u201cthat one part of a statute must be so construed by another that the whole, if possible, may stand.\u201d Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, p. 189.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The Chief-Justice delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Two questions are presented by the appeal in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">I. Whether a last will and testament executed out of this State, to wit: in the State of Rew York, only two witnesses attesting the execution thereof, is valid with respect to real estate in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">II. What is the effect of the act of the Legislature approved February 27, 1872, ch. 1878, in respect to the rights of the widow in the estate of her husband, he.having died in another State, leaving no children, and, under the law of this State, intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">1. By the law of this State every 1 ast will and testament disposing of lands shall be signed by the testator or by some person under his express direction, and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the testator \u201c by three or more witnesses, or else it shall be utterly void and of none effect.\u201d Act Rovember 20, 1828, \u00a751; McC. Big., $86 ; Th. Big., 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Probate of wills granted in other States are admitted to record in this State with the same effect as to the disposition of property as wills executed in this State; Provided, The said wills made out of the.State of Florida shall have conformed to the laws thereof in the form and manner of their execution. Act Rovember 20, 1828, sec. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">These are the only acts of legislation bearing on the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>tion. A will to affect real property in this State, made out of the State, must conform to the laws of this State as to form and manner of its execution. It must be witnessed by three or more witnesses, subscribing their names thereto as attesting its execution, or it is \u201c utterly void and of none effect.\u201d A will, therefore, executed in presence of only two attesting witnesses is of no effect in this State, and a person dying without having executed a will in the manner required by our law is, as to property in this State, <em>intestate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">2. The act of 1872 is \u201c An act defining the interest the wife shall take in her husband\u2019s property.\u201d The whole body of the act is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201c Section 1. If a man dies in this State intestate, without children, who shall at the time of his death be possessed of real and personal property, or either, the wife shall take the whole estate, or dower, at her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201c Sec. 2. Where the husband dies intestate without children'the wife shall be sole heir at law.\u201d \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The first section, in terms, refers to a husband\u2019s dying in this State; the second refers to a husband\u2019s dying in or out of this State. The sections are complete, each in itself, as though they were contained in separate acts. The object of the act is expressed in its title, to define \u201c the interest, the wife shall take in her husband\u2019s property,\u201d not only where he dies in this State, but in case of his death- anywhere intestate and childless.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Whether the second section making the wife the sole heir at law affects her right of dower as previously s'ecured to her by the statute, iu case she should prefer dower only, it is not necessary' here to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">With regard to the facts stated in the bill, the result is that as to the real estate of*Mr. Alsop, it is an intestate estate under the laws of this State. He having died in Hew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>York leaving real property in Florida, and without children, his widow is his sole heir at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The decree overruling the demurrer to the bill , is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
