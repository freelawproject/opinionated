Daman and Valerie A. Daman (Taxpayers) petition\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   for review of an order of the Board of Finance and Revenue (Board) granting in part and denying in part their appeal from a determination of the Department of Revenue (Department) Board of Appeals (BOA), and disallowing the majority of their claimed $38,150.00 in unreimbursed employee business expenses\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for tax year 2010, and determining that a tax of $1,089.00 plus penalties and interest was due. For the reasons that follow, we quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 15, 2011, Taxpayers filed a timely joint 2010 personal income tax return reporting the following:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-11\">Gross Compensation $ 85,333 Unreimbursed Employee Expenses $ 38,150 Net Compensation $ 47,183 Interest $ 41 ___________________________________________ Taxable Income $ 47,224 Tax Liability $ 1,449</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon reviewing Taxpayers' joint return, the Department issued an assessment disallowing\n   $36,249.00 of Taxpayers' claimed unreimbursed employee business expenses. This modification resulted in adjusted taxable income in the amount of $83,473.00 and a corresponding tax liability of $2,563.00 plus penalties and interest. Taxpayers appealed and the BOA sustained the assessment in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Taxpayers then appealed to the Board, asserting that in 2010, Mrs. Daman was employed as a per diem/standby nurse at two separate hospitals in Maryland and Delaware. Mrs. Daman traveled from her Pennsylvania home to her temporary residence in Maryland where she would stay for three to four days at a time until her scheduled shifts ended for the week, at which point she would return home to Pennsylvania. Taxpayers submitted documentary evidence in support of Mrs. Daman's claimed unreimbursed employee business expenses which, according to the Board, included mileage logs, home office expense receipts, registered nurse license and education receipts, receipts for tolls and rental costs in Maryland, cell phone bills and miscellaneous expenses. Taxpayers claimed all of these expenses were incurred as necessary and reasonable costs of Mrs. Daman's employment in Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers also submitted letters from both of Mrs. Daman's out-of-state employers indicating she was employed as a temporary or standby nurse and was not reimbursed for any expenses incurred in the course of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By decision dated October 30, 2013, the Board granted in part and denied in part Taxpayers' requested relief. Specifically, the Board found that Taxpayers submitted sufficient evidence to support an additional $832.00 in allowable unreimbursed employee business expenses related to Mrs. Daman's uniform and nursing education costs because these expenses were supported by specific payment verification and receipts. The Board denied other claimed expenses relating to Mrs. Daman's education and licensing for failure to provide receipts and verification of those costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board also denied the vast majority of the claimed unreimbursed business expenses-which it summarized as travel costs from Pennsylvania to Maryland, temporary housing in Maryland, cell phone costs, cable and television costs and meal expenses-because they were personal in nature and Taxpayers failed to prove they were required as a condition of Mrs. Daman's employment. Therefore, the Board adjusted Taxpayers' account as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\">Gross Compensation $ 85,333 Unreimbursed Employee Expenses $ 2,733 Net Compensation $ 82,600 Interest $ 41 ___________________________________________ Taxable Income $ 82,641 Tax Liability $ 2,537</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After adjusting for tax withheld, resident credit and payment made, the Board ordered that Taxpayers' account be reassessed at a tax due of $1,089.00 plus penalties and interest. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Taxpayers argue that they are entitled to deduct from their taxable income all claimed unreimbursed employee business expenses because those expenses were necessary, reasonable and incurred in the actual performance of Mrs. Daman's work as a standby nurse in Maryland and Delaware. However, even after requesting and receiving numerous extensions of time, Taxpayers' brief is severely deficient as it fails to contain an argument section or a conclusion stating the precise relief sought as required by Rule 2111 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and several other required sections of their brief are insufficient.

The job, not the taxpayer's pattern of living, is the crucial matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Ellwein v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526718\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/778/506/#p509\">\n     778 F.2d 506\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 509-10 (8th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted). Expenses incurred by the taxpayer at the new employment location are not deductible under section 162(a)(2), because the expenses did not arise when the taxpayer was \"away from home.\" Under these provisions, Mrs. Daman's tax home would be Maryland and she would not be entitled to deduct the expenses from her federal taxes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
