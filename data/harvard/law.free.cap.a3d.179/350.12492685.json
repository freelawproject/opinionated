He was charged with violating probation because new criminal charges were filed against him; however, the new criminal charges had not yet been\n   adjudicated when the State requested that the court proceed and sentence defendant on the VOP. At the VOP hearing, the State advanced hearsay evidence to substantiate the new criminal charges. The State did not produce the officer who had witnessed the alleged new criminal acts for which defendant was later identified and charged as the perpetrator. Nor did the State provide justification for that failure, relying on the proposition that hearsay is admissible in probation violation hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although we have yet to address the use of hearsay evidence in VOP hearings, several decades ago the Appellate Division determined it \"fair and practical\" for a court to admit \"reliable hearsay evidence\" in such hearings.\n   <em>\n    State v. Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"381766\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/207/126/#p139\">\n    207 N.J.

First, while there is no bar to the admission and use \"of demonstrably reliable hearsay evidence ... [a] violation may not be bottomed on unreliable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    504 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the nature of VOP hearings calls for flexibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    504 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In respect of the latter, the\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   panel emphasized that when a defendant is charged with \"inexcusably fail[ing] to comply\n   with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of\" probation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:45-3(a)(4), the State usually does not know whether, or what, factual aspect of a probation violation charge a defendant will contest at a VOP hearing,\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"381766\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/207/126/#p139\">\n    207 N.J.

The decision in\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   elaborates on ways in which the State may initially produce evidence of a violation and then meet its ultimate burden of proving the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    at 137, 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20A.2d%2043\">\n    504 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   's approach to the use of hearsay in probation violation hearings is both practical and protective of the due process rights of a probationer charged with a violation of probation. Building on the sound legal foundation of\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   , we hold that hearsay is generally admissible in a VOP hearing. When assessing the State's\n   ability to rely on hearsay to satisfy its proof obligation without contravening a defendant's due process rights, a court fundamentally should consider the State's reasons for relying on hearsay forms of evidence and the reliability of the evidence for its proposed purpose. We identify factors for a court to consider when called on to balance the respective interests of the parties concerning the State's use of hearsay in a VOP hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this matter, the State failed to provide any justification for relying on hearsay, and the hearsay evidence was not sufficiently reliable for its asserted purpose of substantiating the new criminal charges against defendant. In fact, the hearsay was pivotal to defendant's ability to confront and test the adequacy of the evidence to support a conclusion that he committed a VOP by engaging in new criminal conduct. The sole witness at the VOP hearing was an officer who became involved in the investigation of the alleged criminal incident after it had occurred, and that witness could not attest to personal knowledge of the events that provided the basis for defendant's new criminal charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the unusual circumstances of this case, the hearsay presented through his testimony was insufficient to prove the new underlying substantive offense that was the premise for defendant's probation violation and sentence. We are constrained to reverse the Appellate Division judgment that upheld defendant's probation violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was serving a five-year term of probation when he was arrested in September 2014. Based on the circumstances underlying that arrest, the State charged him with a VOP and several new criminal offenses. The new criminal charges included third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10(a)(1), third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute,\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5(b)(3), third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute near a school zone, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7, second-degree distribution of a controlled dangerous substance within 500 feet of public housing, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7.1, and second-degree eluding a police officer, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 23, 2014, before any proceedings on the new criminal charges had taken place, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on defendant's VOP. Defendant had admitted that he had been arrested on the new criminal charges and he was being held in custody for that arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:45-3(a)(3). However,\n   the State wanted the court to sentence defendant on the VOP charge. Accordingly, to move forward on the State's request, the court required an evidentiary hearing on the State's proofs to substantiate the unadjudicated new criminal charges that were the premise for the VOP charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Michael Carullo of the Edison Police Department was the only witness to testify at the VOP hearing. Although he was not present during the events that provide the basis for defendant's charges, Detective Carullo assisted with the investigation after the events had occurred. Detective Carullo testified based on information that the on-scene officer, Officer Zundel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relayed in police reports about the incident. In addition to relying on Zundel's reports, Carullo relied on a police report that he had prepared concerning the investigation and conversations he stated that he had with other officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Detective Carullo's testimony, at about noon on September 7, 2014, Officer Zundel of the Edison Police Department parked his unmarked police car in a local store's parking lot. Sometime later, a blue Mercedes parked about two spaces away from his car. The windows of the Mercedes were rolled halfway down, and Zundel observed in the vehicle a black male driver and\n   a white male passenger. Shortly thereafter, a minivan entered the lot and parked next to the Mercedes. The minivan's driver, a white male, got out of the minivan and entered the rear passenger side of the Mercedes. Zundel then observed what he believed to be a hand-to-hand exchange of narcotics between the minivan driver and the Mercedes driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When the minivan driver exited the Mercedes and returned to the minivan, Zundel maneuvered his unmarked police vehicle to block in the Mercedes and the minivan to prevent both from leaving. When each vehicle nevertheless attempted to leave the parking lot, Zundel ordered them to stop. The minivan driver complied, but the Mercedes driver did not. Zundel drew his weapon and grabbed the Mercedes's side door handle, but he was unable to stop the Mercedes from speeding out of the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After securing the scene, Zundel talked with the minivan's driver, Anthony Thornton. A consent search of the minivan yielded approximately twenty bags of heroin. Thornton later gave a statement to police revealing that the person whom he met in the parking lot was known as \"Black\" and that Thornton had been purchasing heroin from him for over a year. Thornton also provided a physical description of the person who sold him the drugs that day.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The record does not disclose Officer Zundel's first name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The police also obtained a statement from a bystander to the episode in the parking lot. Jimmy An provided an account of what he saw, along with a description of the Mercedes driver.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Carullo testified that he joined Zundel in working on the case and eventually uncovered evidence that pointed to defendant as the driver of the Mercedes when Zundel encountered it in the parking lot. Zundel was asked to view a photograph of defendant, and based on the photo, Zundel identified defendant as the Mercedes driver that he observed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    During the VOP hearing, Detective Carullo was unable to provide details of the encounter between Zundel and defendant\n    that led to defendant's arrest. Carullo was unable to answer questions designed\n    to test Zundel's ability to observe what his report stated he had witnessed. Carullo admitted that he was \"going by [Zundel's] version of events.\" Several times during his testimony, Carullo's recollection had to be refreshed. He read from Zundel's report. He also refreshed his recollection by reviewing his own report containing information secured from other third parties. Specifically, Carullo could not remember the name of the minivan driver; used Zundel's police report to refresh his recollection concerning the description Thornton had provided of his drug seller; used his own report to refresh his recollection as to the name of witness Jimmy An; could not remember whether the Mercedes windows were tinted; and could not remember what Zundel observed before the minivan arrived.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    At the close of the evidence, defense counsel objected to the State's use of hearsay, maintaining that the only witness to testify-Carullo-had not been present during the alleged drug transaction and ensuing events in question. Counsel stated that he was denied the opportunity to confront and question \"the person who was actually trying to effect the arrest\" about the events that led to defendant's new criminal charges. He argued that the State had not produced sufficient evidence to carry its burden of proof on the substantive aspects of defendant's probation violation charge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Following an adjournment, the State declined to produce more evidence, arguing that hearsay is admissible in VOP hearings and that the standard of proof is lower in such hearings than in a typical criminal trial. The court agreed. Although noting that it \"appreciate[d] the desire defense might have to have the actual witness present,\" the court stated that it was not required to follow the rules of evidence in a VOP hearing. The court determined that the record contained sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant violated probation. For that violation of probation, the court sentenced defendant to five years in prison with a two-and-a-half-year parole disqualifier.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Defendant appealed, arguing in relevant part that he was denied due process by the admission and use of hearsay in the VOP hearing. The Appellate Division rejected the argument and affirmed in an unpublished opinion. Stating that a defendant's right to confrontation is not absolute, the panel reasoned that a VOP hearing is not a criminal prosecution and that a trial court may rely on hearsay evidence so long as it is \"demonstrably reliable.\" The panel determined that Carullo's testimony met that standard because he had \"actively investigated defendant's actions\" and had extensive experience \"interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence against those being investigated.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    We granted defendant's petition for certification, \"limited to the issue of the trial court's acceptance of hearsay testimony as proof that defendant committed a new offense in violation of probation.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306076,12306086\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/433/\">\n     228 N.J. 433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12306099,12306076,12306086\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/849/\">\n     157 A.3d 849\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016). We also granted the motions of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) and the Attorney General to appear as amicus curiae.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    II.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Defendant argues that his state and federal due process rights were violated by the State's use of hearsay evidence at his VOP hearing. While acknowledging that such hearings are technically not criminal in nature and do not require the same procedural demands as a criminal trial, defendant contends that such hearings still place probationers at risk of incarceration\n    and thus require careful procedural protections. Defendant contends that those procedural protections have not been adequately elucidated. Defendant maintains that\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    's\"demonstrably reliable\" standard for the use of hearsay evidence in VOP hearings is vague, unclear, and subject to inconsistent application. Defendant asks that we adopt a new test, incorporating a variety of factors for determining the admissibility of hearsay evidence in VOP hearings. In defendant's view, any such test should assess the reliability of the hearsay evidence and, where necessary, critically analyze\n    the State's reasons for calling a witness without personal knowledge of the events in question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Further, defendant contends that the hearsay adduced here is inadmissible under any standard. Defendant notes that the prosecutor provided no reason for failing to call Zundel as a witness. Defendant asserts that Carullo's testimony was unreliable because his recollection had to be refreshed numerous times and because his testimony was based, in part, on police reports that he did not prepare. Defendant thus maintains that the hearsay relied upon at his VOP hearing was not reliable and should not have been admitted to substantiate that he committed the new criminal offenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The State contends that the trial court followed \"longstanding principles of due process\" in allowing Carullo's hearsay testimony. The State claims widespread support for the proposition that hearsay evidence is permissible in VOP hearings and that such hearings do not afford defendants the same procedural safeguards as a criminal trial. Moreover, the State argues that the evidence adduced here was \"sufficiently reliable,\" as required by\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    , and that the demands of due process were satisfied. The State maintains that to hold otherwise would be inconsistent with both state and federal case law and would place a heavy and unwarranted burden on the State to either produce witnesses at VOP hearings or at the very least explain their absence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Amicus ACLU-NJ argues that defendants subject to VOP hearings should receive the protections of the confrontation clause because such hearings are criminal in nature and thus entitle defendants to certain procedural safeguards. ACLU-NJ emphasizes the grave importance of ensuring that probationers are not imprisoned erroneously and posits that any burden imposed upon the State by such additional safeguards is warranted by the fact that those safeguards will aid in the truth-seeking process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Alternatively, ACLU-NJ maintains that even under the law as it currently stands the prosecution must show good cause for failing to allow a defendant to confront witnesses. In so arguing, ACLU-NJ states that we should not allow\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    's vague standard to \"eviscerate\" a probationer's right to witness confrontation. Turning to the facts at issue here, ACLU-NJ argues that the State could not provide a sufficient reason to explain Officer Zundel's absence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    D.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Attorney General, appearing as amicus, argues that VOP hearings are intended to be flexible and informal proceedings that provide trial courts with sufficient discretion to determine the reliability of hearsay evidence. Like the State, the Attorney General argues that VOP hearings are not a stage of criminal prosecution and thus do not provide the same protections as a criminal trial. Therefore, the Attorney General maintains, the current reliability standard does not violate defendant's due process rights and there is no reason to abandon the current rule in favor of a new standard that would turn VOP proceedings into \"mini-trials\" and imbue the process with unnecessary complications and uncertainty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We start with some basic concepts governing probation, which is an authorized sentence under the New Jersey Criminal Code.

In the years that have ensued since\n    <em>\n     Reyes\n    </em>\n    issued, appellate courts in numerous other jurisdictions have addressed the use of hearsay in VOP hearings. In their own ways, those courts have sought to offer guidance to trial courts on when hearsay may be relied upon to support a VOP charge while balancing the rights of the defendant in such a proceeding. The starting premise, however, is that hearsay generally\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    admissible in VOP hearings.

However, there are several factors which should be evaluated in examining the basis cited by the government for dispensing with confrontation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    First, the court should assess the explanation the government offers of why confrontation is undesirable or impractical. For example, the government might contend that live testimony would pose a danger of physical harm to a government informant,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Birzon v.

Thus, where the government demonstrates that the burden of producing live testimony would be inordinate and offers in its place hearsay evidence that is demonstrably reliable, it has made a strong showing of good cause. Where, on the other hand, the government neither shows that presenting live testimony would be unreasonably burdensome nor offers hearsay evidence that bears indicia of reliability, the probationer is entitled to confrontation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    [\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"557493\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/677/1024/#p1026\">\n      Ibid.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (footnote omitted).]\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Following\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    's lead, other federal courts began adopting a balancing-test approach.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

I also concur in its analysis that defendant was denied the opportunity to confront the critical witness in this case. The State essentially tried defendant on a newly charged criminal offense as a violation of probation-without the burden of satisfying a higher standard of proof or complying with the Rules of Evidence. Defendant had a substantial liberty interest in a fair probation revocation hearing. Here, the trial court, which found a probation violation, sentenced defendant to a five-year prison term with a two-and-a-half year parole disqualifier on the underlying offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Unlike the majority, I believe that the Rules of Evidence should apply in probation revocation hearings in the absence of a good-cause showing for the relaxation of those rules. The Rules of Evidence are an instructional guide-developed over generations-for the admission of reliable and trustworthy evidence. We apply those rules in garden-variety, slip-and-fall personal injury cases in the Civil Part and in minor contractual dispute cases tried in the Special Civil Part because the reliability of the outcome\n    matters to the parties. A defendant facing a long prison term has as great an interest in the reliability of the fact-findings in a probation revocation hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Procedural protections that protect the substantial liberty interests of the accused should prevail over claims of efficiency. When the stakes are at their highest, our tolerance for fact-finding errors should be at its lowest. In those circumstances, procedural safeguards, such as those embodied in the Rules of Evidence, are of the utmost importance. This Court has not hesitated to impose additional procedural safeguards-above the minimal requirements imposed by due process-when a person's freedom hangs in the balance.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.

In\n    <em>\n     Gagnon v. Scarpelli\n    </em>\n    , the United States Supreme Court set forth the minimal due process requirements for conducting a probation revocation hearing.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     411 U.S. 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 781-82,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     93 S.Ct. 1756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     36 L.Ed.2d 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1973). The majority understandably turns to\n    <em>\n     Gagnon\n    </em>\n    for guidance. The Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Gagnon\n    </em>\n    , however, presumed that probation officers, not prosecutors, would present the case against a defendant on a probation violation charge,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     at 783-85, 789\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     93 S.Ct. 1756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and did not find that the defendant had an absolute right to counsel at such hearings,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     at 790\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p781\">\n     93 S.Ct. 1756\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Probation violation hearings are much different today from when\n    <em>\n     Gagnon\n    </em>\n    was decided more than four decades ago.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    I do not believe that we need a different set of evidence rules for probation violation hearings. Our judges need no instruction on the application of our Rules of Evidence. The rules adopted by the majority, although an improvement, I fear will lead to inconsistent\n    results because those rules are more pliable and unfamiliar to our judges.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pasqua\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951524\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/186/127/#p146\">\n     186 N.J. at 139-40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2951524\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/186/127/#p146\">\n     892 A.2d 663\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    I would apply our evidence rules to probation violation hearings, but I would make some common-sense accommodations given the nature of those proceedings. One approach is a notice and demand procedure. For example, if a non-critical witness is unavailable, the prosecutor could give notice of its intent to call a substitute witness and demand to know if the defendant intends to challenge the substitute's testimony. If there is no challenge, the issue is resolved.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
