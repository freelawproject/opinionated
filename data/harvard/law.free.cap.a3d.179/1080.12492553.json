Code of Judicial Conduct Rule 2.11(A) (hereinafter the Pa.C.J.C. or the \"Code\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As Applicants note, the Code, Rule 2.11(A), provides that I must disqualify myself \"in any proceeding in which [my] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" I may decide that this is the case when, while a candidate for judicial office, I \"made a public statement... that commit[ted me] to reach a particular result or rule in a particular way in the proceeding or controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2.11(A)(5).

Countervailing, \"[u]nwarranted disqualification or recusal may bring public disfavor to the court and to the judge personally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2.7, cmt. 1 (\"Responsibility to Decide).\" Furthermore, the Preamble to the Code notes that it is not \"intended to be the basis for litigants to seek collateral remedies against each other or to gain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Preamble \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Applicants have excerpted several statements from hundreds of appearances that I made across Pennsylvania while campaigning for a seat on this Court in 2015. While a judicial candidate, I responded to many questions regarding my positions on subjects of interest to the voters of this Commonwealth, and I accordingly expressed my views on a broad range of legal issues. These issues included the lawfulness of partisan gerrymandering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, Applicants submit that my \"position regarding the 2011 Plan, and, more generally, partisan map[-]drawing were clearly defined and cemented long before this case was initiated.\" Application at 6. They then excerpt a handful of comments made during my campaign for this office, including that \"gerrymandering is an absolute abomination,\" \"a travesty,\" \"insane,\" and \"deeply wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. I mentioned the thirteen-to-five split in favor of Republican representatives in Pennsylvania's House delegation against the background of a Democratic advantage in voter representation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. I further opined that \"[e]xtreme gerrymandering is ... antithetical to the concept of one person, one vote.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. These comments expressed my thoughts on the topic, something manifestly distinct from a clear commitment to rule in a certain way if presented with a specific challenge based upon a well-developed factual record and the benefit of full and fair advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Applicants' own chosen quotations also reveal a degree of equivocation and reserve on my part that defies their strongly-worded characterization of my putative prejudice on the particular questions that this case presents, which then were neither before the Court nor, to my knowledge, publicly anticipated. For example, in one instance in which I referred to the thirteen-to-five split, I elaborated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I'm not trying to be partisan, but I have to answer your question, frankly-. We have more than a million more Democrats in Pennsylvania, we have a state senate and state house that are overwhelmingly Republican. You cannot explain this without partisan gerrymandering. So I don't have a philosophy other than fidelity to our Constitution, and fidelity to our Constitution does not include drawing lines down the middle of streets or separating neighbors from one another. It doesn't include carving up municipalities. Our Constitution and its jurisprudence say that we ... are not supposed to divide up municipalities except where absolutely necessary. We are supposed to have ... compact and contiguous districts. And I challenge anybody to look at the map of our districts and deem them to be compact and contiguous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. On another occasion, I made clear that my thoughts on the matter were distinct from how I might rule on a hypothetical challenge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Right nearby here, by way of just one example, Montgomery County, a county or two over here, is represented in pieces by I think 5 different members of Congress. That's unbelievable. So I don't know and I can't tell you what the map would be, and it's not for me to say, and I don't know how I would rule on any given map. But I can tell you the Constitution says \"one person, one vote,\" and it does not allow for unconstitutional gerrymandering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. While Applicants find that these comments in 2015 reinforce their claim that I committed myself to a specific position in this specific case being litigated now in 2018, I find in them the circumspection warranted of a candidate for judicial office endeavoring to inform voters of my views without committing to a particular result in any given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Opponents to the Application have filed three separate Answers. The Answers focus in large part upon the untimeliness of Applicants' challenge, Applicants' allegedly misleading quotations of the statements at issue, and the propriety of those statements when viewed in context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Petitioners argue that Applicants knew or should have known of the statements underlying their challenge long before\n   Applicants sought my disqualification, and, thus, have waived the issue by failing to seek my disqualification at the earliest opportunity.

They also argue that Applicants should have known the facts upon which they rely, at a minimum, months before they filed the instant application. Independent of the untimeliness of the application, Petitioners maintain that my campaign statements were entirely appropriate, in that judicial candidates are authorized and encouraged to comment upon legal issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610173\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/330/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 10 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   Pa.C.J.C. 4.1, cmt. 9 (stating that judicial candidates' \"announcements of personal views on legal, political, or other issues ... are not prohibited\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Governor Wolf similarly argues that the statements at issue comported with Pennsylvania's Code of Judicial Conduct, amounted to nothing more than responses to general questions from the public, and did not constitute any pledge to rule in a particular way in any case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Governor's Answer at 13. The Governor notes that the Pennsylvania Constitution requires partisan elections of Supreme Court Justices, which necessarily means that judicial candidates are expected to provide public statements regarding issues of concern to voters. The Code recognizes this, and allows for judicial candidates to \"respond to media and other inquiries,\" subject to the guidance that candidates should \"give assurances that they will keep an open mind\" and must refrain from making any \"pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of judicial duties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (quoting Pa.C.J.C. 4.1(A)(12), cmt. 11). Governor Wolf notes that, at the time that I made the statements at issue in 2015, there was no pending case involving Pennsylvania's congressional districting plan, and I offered no opinion as to the validity of that plan, the existence of a judicially manageable standard for assessing that plan, nor the quality or quantity of evidence that would be necessary to adjudicate any such future question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lieutenant Governor Stack stresses the untimeliness of the Application, arguing that Applicants are sophisticated parties who should have been aware of publicly available information about my campaign and that, in any event, the Application reveals that Applicants discovered the statements at issue from publicly available sources over the course of three days, but declined to act until after receiving an adverse judgment. Lieutenant Governor's Brief at 11-12. He also argues in detail that my statements did not violate the Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Importantly, all three Answers stress that Applicants have omitted portions of my statements, removing critical context and creating an intentionally misleading impression as to their content and meaning.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Petitioners' Answer at 11-14; Governor's Answer at 4-12; Lieutenant Governor's Answer at 5-7, 18. As Governor Wolf explains, Applicants repeatedly \"cut out those portions of [my] quotations that made clear [that I] was in fact discussing\n   <em>\n    state legislative\n   </em>\n   redistricting and the Supreme Court's non-judicial role in it.\" Governor's Answer at 4 (emphasis in original). \"Perhaps more egregiously,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   Governor Wolf notes, the Application redacts numerous portions of the quotations in which I stated that I remain open-minded on the issues, offered no opinion on the lawfulness\n   of any particular districting plan or map-drawing process, and clarified that I will decide each case based upon the law and the facts. All Answers suggest that Applicants have redacted my statements deliberately to create a false impression of their contents and to cast unjustified doubt upon my integrity and impartiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Throughout these proceedings, time has been of the essence. This is reflected in the alacrity with which, upon order of this Court, the Commonwealth Court and the parties prepared and conducted a robust, tremendously complex trial mere weeks after our order directing same; the Commonwealth Court issued painstaking, detailed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law approximately two weeks after its completion; and, on a challenging schedule, the parties prepared excellent, informative briefs on appeal to this Court, and prepared and delivered exemplary arguments on the issues presented-all of this to enable a timely decision that preserves the 2018 primary and general election as scheduled, while ensuring that Pennsylvanians go to the polls confident that their respective districts fairly reflect their and their community's interests and that their votes will not be marginalized by partisan maneuverings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The lone exception to this breakneck pace is the timing of this Application, and that fact alone compels my decision to deny Applicants' request. This Court very recently has articulated and reaffirmed the well-settled standard governing the timeliness of such applications. \"The case law in this Commonwealth is clear and of long standing; it requires a party seeking recusal or disqualification to raise the objection at the earliest possible moment, or that party will suffer the consequence of being time barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Lomas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324242,12324228\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/380/\">\n    170 A.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Goodheart v.

The timeliness of such an application is particularly troubling where a party seeks disqualification only after receiving an adverse judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792334\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/204/\">\n    489 A.2d at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Once the trial is completed with the entry of a verdict, a party is deemed to have waived his right to have a judge disqualified, and if he has waived that issue, he cannot be heard to complain following an unfavorable result.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Litigants cannot be permitted to hedge against the possibility of losing a case on the merits by delaying the production of arguable grounds for disqualification, or, worse, by digging up such grounds only after learning of an adverse order. To hold otherwise would encourage judge-shopping, would undermine the interests in the finality of judicial decisions, and would countenance extensive and unnecessary expenditures of judicial resources, which are avoidable by mere timely advancement of the challenge. The courts of this Commonwealth cannot and do not approve of such gamesmanship. Indeed, the Preamble to the Code expressly cautions that it is not \"intended to be the basis for litigants ... to obtain tactical advantages in proceedings before a court.\" Pa.C.J.C. Preamble \u00b6 7. To foreclose this improper tactical maneuvering as it relates to applications for disqualification, \"the law is clear\" that \"a party must seek recusal of a jurist at the earliest possible moment,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   when the party knows of the facts that form the basis for a motion to recuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Lomas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12324242,12324228\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/380/\">\n    170 A.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, this Court has held that, in addition to actual knowledge of the facts underlying the application, facts that \"should have been known\" are to be considered in determining timeliness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodheart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820318\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/523/188/\">\n    565 A.2d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, where an application for disqualification is based upon facts purportedly discovered after judgment has been rendered, this Court has held that, \"as in other cases involving after discovered evidence, there must be a showing that... the evidence could not have been brought to the attention of the ... court in the exercise of due diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Reilly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792334\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/204/\">\n    489 A.2d at 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Herein, Applicants have based their challenge to the propriety of my participation in the instant case upon campaign rhetoric that has been in the public domain for well over two years. Their evidence consists of media reports and YouTube videos that have been freely accessible to any user of the Internet since 2015. Applicants do not suggest that they were unable to discover the statements at issue, or otherwise were precluded from bringing them to the Court's attention, at some point before this Court assumed extraordinary jurisdiction on November 9, 2017, before the commencement of trial on December 11, 2017, before the submission of their brief on January 10, 2018, before the presentation of oral argument on January 17, 2018, before this Court issued its dispositive order on January 22, 2018, or before the Court issued its most recent order on January 26, 2018. Instead, Applicants aver that they learned the facts that form the basis of their application only after oral argument on January 17, 2018. The impetus for their late investigation, Applicants aver, was what they now characterize as my \"adversarial tone\" at the oral argument session. Application at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Applicants' argument is belied by their application. In support of their contention that the application is timely, Applicants have appended an affidavit from counsel's \"Senior Litigation Support Coordinator,\" who attests to the dates and manner by which he discovered the statements at issue herein. According to the affidavit, he discovered each statement through Internet searches conducted on January 31, 2018 and February 2, 2018. February 2, 2018, is also the date upon which the instant application was filed. Not only does this affidavit demonstrate that Applicants were able to discover the statements and to draft the application in three days, but it also establishes, on its face, that Applicants did not even commence their investigation into the matter until two weeks after the date upon which, they aver, they developed cause to do so. In those intervening two weeks, this Court issued its order ruling against Applicants on January 22, 2018, and issued a corresponding order on January 26, 2018. Applicants fail to explain why, after being so troubled by my questions at oral argument, they declined to conduct their investigation immediately, rather than waiting until after this Court had rendered its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Applicants may not rely upon disqualification to obtain a retroactive victory in this litigation. Because Applicants have brought this matter to my attention only after receiving an adverse order, because the facts that form the basis of their challenge were known or should have been known to them at an earlier date, and because Applicants have not advanced their claim at the earliest possible opportunity, their application is untimely as a matter of Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Applicants also seek to excuse their delay by transferring to me exclusive responsibility for their own purported ignorance of the contents of my campaign rhetoric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application at 16 (\"Justice[ ] Wecht... failed to disclose [his] prior statements and beliefs in violation of their affirmative duty to do so established by [Pa.C.J.C. 2.11(A) ].\"). Applicants' argument is unpersuasive. First, and as discussed below, my statements taken in their proper context, while vigorously worded, were not improper and would not warrant my recusal regardless of the Application's untimeliness. Second, I reject Applicants' suggestion that I can recall with perfect detail the substance and tenor of comments that I made on the statewide campaign trail well over two years ago, comments cherry-picked and curated from among thousands of statements that I made over the course of that dizzying and unprecedented campaign. While I appreciate Applicants' generous assumption regarding my mental acuity, I must admit that the details of every such statement do not remain at the forefront of my memory, my focus, and my attention day-to-day. Third, this Court's case law does not support the notion that, simply because,\n   <em>\n    arguendo,\n   </em>\n   I should have disclosed these statements to Applicants (had I remembered them), Applicants may seek my disqualification\n   <em>\n    now,\n   </em>\n   only after they have received an adverse judgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792334\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/507/204/\">\n    489 A.2d at 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]imply because a judge does not raise\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the issue of his impartiality, however, does not entitle a party to question a judge's partiality after the case has ended without substantiation in the record that the complaining party did not receive a full, fair, and impartial trial\"). Accordingly, Applicants' alternative suggestion regarding the timeliness of the Application is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Setting aside waiver, it is worth acknowledging the tension that the Supreme Court of the United States has highlighted between the First Amendment rights of judicial candidates to speak freely and the need to maintain the fact and appearance of their impartiality once in office.

The Court found this sense of the word had no bearing on the rule, which pertained by its terms to legal and political\n   <em>\n    issues.\n   </em>\n   The second sense of the word was \"lack of preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Proof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court was a complete\n   <em>\n    tabula rasa\n   </em>\n   in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias....

Although this might be desirable, the High Court did not believe that it was the intended purpose of the announce rule. The Court noted that campaign trail statements are \"an infinitesimal\" portion of most judges' public commitments to legal positions. The Court cited as examples Justice Black's participation in decisions considering the constitutionality of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which he helped author as a Senator, and Chief Justice Hughes' authorship of a Court opinion overruling a case he had criticized in a book he wrote before his appointment. Setting aside these and the expression of opinions on the bench-and I have expressed a great many, like most of my peers at all levels of the judiciary-the Court cited classes conducted and books and speeches as more pedestrian outlets for such opinions. Minnesota's own Code of Judicial Conduct specifically acknowledged that \"[a] judge may write, lecture, teach, speak and participate in other extra-judicial activities concerning the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be a tall order indeed for the average judge to do any or all of these things, and to hold an audience's attention in the process, while refraining from at least suggesting views and beliefs regarding any number of issues likely to come before a court of general jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Supreme Court then addressed the incongruity between the announce clause and a realistic account of the long, winding road most jurists travel to the bench. Under the clause, a\n   <em>\n    candidate\n   </em>\n   could not declare that he thought it unconstitutional to prohibit same-sex marriages, but he could have done so in a public forum mere moments before declaring his candidacy without bearing upon his impending candidacy. Thus, the open-mindedness account of the word \"impartial\" rendered the clause unconstitutionally vague-\"so woefully underinclusive as to render belief in that purpose a challenge to the credulous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court then turned to consider the concern that lay at the heart of Minnesota's prohibition of robust commentary on legal issues on the campaign trail-that a judge who articulated a strong opinion on a legal topic during a campaign would feel duty-bound to rule consistently with that position in future cases. The Court did not dispute that a judge might perceive some pressure to do so, but emphasized that an elected judge\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   faces the prospect that a given ruling will move the electorate\n   to vote against him in a future election, regardless of whether he spoke on the subject during his campaign. By way of example, the Court colorfully observed that \"[s]urely the judge who frees Timothy McVeigh places his job much more at risk than the judge who (horror of horrors!) reconsiders his previously announced view on a disputed legal issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254601\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/765/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Among the challenged canons was Wisconsin Supreme Court Rule 60.04(4)(f), which, much like\n   <em>\n    White's\n   </em>\n   announce clause, would require a judge to recuse in a case presenting a legal issue when, as a candidate, the judge \"made a public statement that commits, or appears to commit\" the judge with respect to \"an issue in the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Duwe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4121888\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/490/968/\">\n    490 F.Supp.2d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Our Code did not directly limit my First Amendment right to speak during the campaign; rather, it assigned certain consequences to my exercise of that freedom. Furthermore, as I was a sitting Superior Court judge during that campaign, I could be expected to recognize the risk that the more strongly I articulated my informed thoughts on the state of the law with respect to certain issues, the more likely I was to have my own comments stated back to me as evidence of bias and a basis for disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   My campaign rhetoric concerning redistricting indisputably was sometimes ardent. Furthermore, I did not always qualify my statements to clarify that I would view each case on its individual merits, subject to the particular laws implicated, the particular arguments presented, and the particular factual record the parties developed-in this case at tremendous expense in time and treasure-although I did so more frequently than Applicants allow. However, my comments must be taken in context and in sum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applicants' own collection of my comments deploring gerrymandering as violative of the principle of \"one person, one vote\" include two instances in which I aptly and sincerely qualified my opinion on the subject by noting that there was no impending case on the matter, and that I would be bound to judge any such case on its merits should occasion arise. Application at 4-5. Like most judges, I have spent the better part of my professional life advocating, interpreting, and applying Pennsylvania law. I have held forth at length on more topics than I can remember, and in all instances have done so out of love and respect for our Constitution.

That being said, given the publicity surrounding this case and its consequence, it is as or more likely that the reversal of such a prominent case after a flurry of state and national media coverage will call into question this Court's orderly administration of justice, as will be my decision not to recuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After a great deal of reflection, I have decided to deny the Application. The reasons are several: Applicants' delay in seeking my recusal, and particularly the fact that, by their own account, they did not even begin to mine the public record in search of a basis to do so until two weeks after they claim they were moved to do so and nine days after they received an adverse ruling; the contemporaneous qualifications I offered in connection with my 2015 comments on gerrymandering; the principles articulated in the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ; and my own certainty that I have evaluated this case strictly on the facts and the law without regard to a handful of statements I made among thousands expressed on the 2015 campaign trail, which were offered only to present voters with a sincere, transparent account of the thoughts that had informed my work as an appellate jurist. For all of these reasons, and confident in my determination to judge each case on its individual merits, I decline to disqualify myself from these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <em>\n    5\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of February, 2018, the February 2, 2018 Application of Respondents for Disqualification of Justice David Wecht and for Full Disclosure by Justice Christine Donohue is denied, to the extent it seeks the undersigned Justice's disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    While Governor Wolf and Lieutenant Governor Stack are named respondents in this matter, they have adopted and defended Petitioners' position that Pennsylvania's congressional districts are unconstitutionally gerrymandered throughout this litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goodheart,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820318\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/523/188/\">\n     565 A.2d at 763\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting a litigant's argument that the moving party \"chose to remain silent, resorting to the unconscionable and reprehensible tactic of I[y]ing in the grass, waiting until the decision and then raising the disqualification issue only if they lost,\" and noting, \"[w]e cannot say that this characterization, although somewhat florid, is either inaccurate or unfair\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Ellis,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8207901\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/275/109/#p116\">\n     275 S.W.3d 109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 116 (Tex.
