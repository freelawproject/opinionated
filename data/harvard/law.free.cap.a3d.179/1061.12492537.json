We affirm because plaintiff's complaint was not filed within the two-year statute of limitations under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We discern the following facts and procedural history from the record. On November 17, 1988, plaintiff was arrested in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after delivering cocaine to an undercover police officer. Six days later, on November 23, 1988, the New Jersey State Police (State Police) arrested plaintiff on the New Jersey Turnpike (Turnpike) for possession of cocaine and weapons. Plaintiff was tried on these charges before a jury and found guilty of possession of controlled dangerous substances and weapons. We affirmed this conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

According to plaintiff, his New Jersey conviction was not vacated at that time because it \"fell through the cracks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2011, plaintiff was convicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for another narcotics offense. Plaintiff was sentenced to thirty years, with five years of supervised release. Notably, the court found plaintiff's 1988 convictions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania enhanced his federal sentence because he qualified as a three-strike \"career offender\" under federal sentencing guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 2, 2014, the New Jersey court entered a consent order vacating defendant's 1988 New Jersey conviction because it was subject to inclusion in the aforementioned State Police racial profiling consent order. In light of the vacated conviction, on August 13, 2015, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania resentenced plaintiff to sixty-three to seventy-eight months as he no longer qualified as a \"career offender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a violation of the Act in the Superior Court on April 27, 2016. The complaint was signed by counsel but not verified by plaintiff. Plaintiff sought damages for time spent incarcerated on the vacated 1988 New Jersey conviction as well as the enhanced time he served in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Treasury moved to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim,\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:6-2(e), and plaintiff opposed the Treasury's motion and cross-moved to amend the complaint to include his verification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial judge granted the Treasury's motion for three reasons: (1) the Act barred plaintiff's claim because he did not institute the action within two years of being released from imprisonment on his 1988 New Jersey conviction; (2) plaintiff's complaint was not timely submitted as a verified complaint; and (3) plaintiff could not recover for the enhanced time served in Pennsylvania because the Act does not allow for such a cause of action. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues, among other things, the trial judge erred in finding his complaint was time-barred because the two-\n   year limitation period should begin to run when his 1988 New Jersey conviction was vacated.

The statute identifies two triggering events from which to calculate the two-year statute of limitations: release from imprisonment or a pardon. What is apparent is that the Legislature considered pardon to be a separate and independent triggering event.

The legal consequences of each are not always equivalent. In New Jersey, a pardon is a constitutional power bestowed solely upon the Governor.\n   <em>\n    N.J. Const.\n   </em>\n   art. V, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 1 states: \"The Governor may grant pardons and reprieves in all cases other than impeachment and treason[.]\" Vacatur or reversal of a conviction is a judicial power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   According to plaintiff, he was released from prison in or around March 1996 for his 1988 New Jersey conviction, which was subsequently vacated, on May 2, 2014, upon the State's concession that it may have been tainted by racial profiling. Plaintiff filed this instant complaint on April 27, 2016. Since plaintiff was not pardoned and did not file this action within two years of release from imprisonment, the trial court applied the Act as written and did not err in granting the Treasury's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As we are satisfied with the trial judge's legal conclusion regarding the untimeliness of plaintiff's complaint, we need not reach plaintiff's additional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    During the pendency of this appeal, the Treasury moved to supplement the record to include relevant portions of plaintiff's criminal trial record, which the panel granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
