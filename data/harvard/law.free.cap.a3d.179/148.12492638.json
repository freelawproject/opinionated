This case was referred to the full Court sitting in conference for possible disposition without further briefing or argument, in accordance with Article I, Rule 12A(7)(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the defendant's appeal is fatally defective in that it was not filed in a timely manner. The order the defendant appealed from was entered on April 6, 2017. The defendant's notice of appeal was filed on May 2, 2017, beyond the twenty-day time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, requires that, in a civil case, the notice of appeal shall be filed within twenty days of the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from. This Court has ruled that \"the time specified in Rule 4(a) is mandatory, and that once the prescribed time has passed there can be no review by way of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank v.
