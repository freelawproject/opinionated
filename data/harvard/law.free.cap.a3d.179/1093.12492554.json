We previously held predecessor counsel-Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck (Meyer Darragh)-was not entitled to breach of contract damages against successor counsel-the Law Firm of Malone Middleman, P.C. (Malone Middleman), where a contract regarding counsel fees did not exist between the two firms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958,12280948,6805965,6806054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/1247/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958,12280948,6805965,6806054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/1247/\">\n    at 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsequently, we granted discretionary review\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to determine whether Meyer Darragh is entitled to damages in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against Malone Middleman, where the trial court initially held such damages are recoverable, but the Superior Court reversed. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Superior Court and remand to the trial court for reinstatement of its award of damages in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   to Meyer Darragh against Malone Middleman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter arose from a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Estate of Richard A. Eazor (the Eazor Estate) deriving from a motor vehicle accident (the Eazor Litigation). The Eazor Estate was represented by Attorney William Weiler, Jr., who entered his appearance in the matter on March 24, 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 6. On December 1, 2005, Attorney Weiler became associated with Meyer Darragh. Attorney Weiler brought the Eazor Litigation with him and Meyer Darragh attorneys worked on the Eazor Litigation for a total of 71.25 hours over a nineteen-month period.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 39, 40 &amp; Exhibit D to Proposed Stipulated Facts. In May 2007, Attorney Weiler resigned from Meyer Darragh. At the time of Attorney Weiler's resignation, Meyer Darragh understood it would continue as lead counsel in the Eazor Litigation along with Attorney Weiler at his new firm. Written correspondence at the time of Attorney Weiler's separation from Meyer Darragh indicated that Meyer Darragh would receive two-thirds of the attorneys' fees arising out of the Eazor Litigation, and Attorney Weiler would retain one-third of the fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 18 and Exhibit 7 to Proposed Stipulated Facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon departing from Meyer Darragh, Attorney Weiler became affiliated with Malone Middleman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 22. In correspondence dated June 18, 2007, the Eazor Estate informed Meyer Darragh that it was moving its file to Malone Middleman and discharging Meyer Darragh as counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 14 to Proposed Stipulated Facts. Upon being retained by the Eazor Estate, Malone Middleman entered into a contingency fee agreement with the Estate, noting representation\n   would be provided in exchange for 33.3% of the net proceeds of settlement if the matter settled before suit was filed, and 40% of the net proceeds of settlement recovered if settlement occurred after the filing of suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit C to the Proposed Stipulated Facts. Thereafter, Meyer Darragh notified Malone Middleman that pursuant to its agreement with Attorney Weiler, it was entitled to two-thirds of the contingent fee earned from the Eazor Litigation. In response, Malone Middleman denied Meyer Darragh was entitled to two-thirds of any contingent fee, and \"at best, ha[d] a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim for actual time expended.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 18 to Proposed Stipulated Facts. Malone Middleman eventually settled the Eazor Litigation for $235,000, and received $67,000 in attorneys' fees, which it apparently accepted as payment in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meyer Darragh demanded from Malone Middleman two-thirds of the counsel fees generated by the settlement of the Eazor Litigation pursuant to its agreement with Attorney Weiler or, in the alternative, payment based on\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   in the amount of $17,673.93 for the work it performed and costs it incurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6 51. Malone Middleman did not pay any portion of the fees it collected to Meyer Darragh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2010, Meyer Darragh filed suit for breach of contract against Malone Middleman and for damages in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against Malone Middleman and the Eazor Estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint. After a bench trial on stipulated facts, the trial court entered a verdict in the amount of $14,721.39 in favor of Meyer Darragh on its\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim. The court denied relief on the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both Meyer Darragh and Malone Middleman filed post-trial motions, which were denied, and both parties appealed to the Superior Court. In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court first addressed Meyer Darragh's\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim, noting Pennsylvania's jurisprudence regarding predecessor counsel's entitlement to a portion of a recovered contingent fee under a theory of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against successor counsel, while inconsistent, does not prohibit such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ct. slip. op. at 5. The court opined Meyer Darragh's work in the Eazor Litigation conferred benefits to Malone Middleman, and those benefits materialized into a settlement and receipt of a contingent fee of $67,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The court further noted cases where\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   damages were denied involved contracts regarding the payment of fees to all counsel, and the terms of those contracts controlled in those disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruby v.

The court reasoned Meyer Darragh could succeed under a claim of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   only if the employment agreement between Attorney Weiler and Meyer Darragh was unenforceable against Malone Middleman. The court concluded Malone Middleman was not bound by the Weiler/Meyer Darragh agreement, and held Meyer Darragh was entitled to its share of fees on a theory of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The court rejected Meyer Darragh's claim the amount of damages should be increased to $17,673.93, holding its $14,721.39 verdict was the correct reflection of the itemized bill submitted by Meyer Darragh excluding charges related to the fee dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Superior Court first addressed Malone Middleman's challenge to the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award, reversed the trial court's ruling on the issue, and held a predecessor law firm or attorney who is dismissed as counsel cannot maintain a claim in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against a successor law firm who ultimately settles the case.\n   <em>\n    Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek &amp; Eck, P.L.L.C. v.

Malone Middleman submits any benefit conferred by Meyer Darragh's work on the Eazor Litigation was realized, not by Malone Middleman, but by the Eazor Estate, and any\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim therefore lies only against the Eazor Estate. We are not persuaded by this argument. It is axiomatic that without predecessor counsel's effective litigation of a civil action, successor counsel will not have the opportunity to reach a favorable verdict or settlement. In that sense, predecessor counsel who is fired by the client before collecting a fee for work on litigation, has obviously conferred a benefit upon both the client and successor counsel who concludes the matter and receives a percentage of the proceeds as a fee. In such a case, someone must make initiating counsel whole.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shafer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254290,6928100,6928126,4253191\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/96/989/\">\n    96 A.3d at 993-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim is a claim for unjust enrichment which \"implies a contract [and] requires the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the value of the benefit conferred\");\n   <em>\n    American and Foreign Ins.

We hold recovery from successor counsel is proper on the facts presented, and we reject the Superior Court's contrary decision based on distinguishable precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, there is no question that Meyer Darragh's work on the Eazor Litigation contributed to the settlement ultimately negotiated by Malone Middleman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Stipulated Facts at \u00b6\u00b6 12-17 and Exhibits 4, 5 and 25 to the Proposed Stipulated Facts (describing the work completed by Meyer Darragh on behalf of the Eazor Estate, including securing settlement of $15,000 from one insurer defendant to the Eazor Litigation). Accordingly, both Malone Middleman and the Eazor Estate received a benefit from Meyer Darragh's work on the Eazor Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20A.%2092\">\n    186 A. at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (it would be \"unjust to permit the mortgagee [bank] to reap all the benefits of the attorney's endeavors\" without sharing the fund created by those efforts). Further, Meyer Darragh was not paid for its work that contributed to this benefit, while the client completely discharged its payment obligation to Malone Middleman. In such a situation, where both the client and successor counsel retain\n   a benefit achieved in part by predecessor counsel's work, where predecessor counsel has not been remunerated for that work, and no contract governs the situation, we hold predecessor counsel may recover damages in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   . The inquiry now becomes against whom that claim can be brought-the client or successor counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Until today, our courts have not provided a clear roadmap on this question, but existing case law has allowed the possibility that the proper defendant in some\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   situations might be successor counsel. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the court stated a predecessor law firm might have sued its clients directly to recover fees it lost when the clients moved their case to successor counsel, who obtained a settlement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"96881\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/254/41/\">\n    385 A.2d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, where the clients \"ha[d] paid their counsel fee\" to successor counsel, and therefore could not be held liable for any further payment of fees, the court acknowledged predecessor counsel could bring a \"quasi-contract\" action against successor counsel to recover fees if successor counsel was unjustly enriched through predecessor counsel's work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 516-517. We agree with this reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, we emphasize the cases relied upon by the Superior Court and Malone Middleman for the proposition that a predecessor law firm can proceed under a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   theory only against its former client, and not successor counsel, are factually distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    Styer v. Hugo\n   </em>\n   , for example, the client hired and fired two lawyers before hiring a third, and the third lawyer (Attorney Hugo) had no knowledge of a fee sharing agreement between the first two lawyers before achieving a settlement. The Superior Court determined under these circumstances any benefit that may have been transferred to Attorney Hugo as successor counsel was not unjust, and therefore he was not liable for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   damages. We note predecessor counsel's claim did not fail under these circumstances because there is a rule prohibiting all\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claims against successor counsel, but because predecessor counsel failed to demonstrate he conferred a benefit upon predecessor counsel which was unjust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Styer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"923455\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/422/262/\">\n    619 A.2d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nor did\n   <em>\n    Mager\n   </em>\n   create a rule that a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim by predecessor counsel lies only against the former client and never against successor counsel. Instead, predecessor counsel could not recover in that case because it could not establish the necessary elements of a breach of contract or\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim against successor counsel. The\n   <em>\n    Mager\n   </em>\n   court's decision denying relief was grounded on the following: (1) the client agreed to indemnify successor counsel against any claim for fees by predecessor counsel and (2) predecessor counsel performed exceptionally minor work after agreeing to a contingent fee arrangement, and thus, there was no contingent fee earned upon which predecessor counsel could base a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435445\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/797/948/\">\n    797 A.2d at 955, 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the basis for the holding that any claim for counsel fees lay only against the client was not because such a claim is prohibited against successor counsel, but because the client had agreed to indemnify successor counsel against such a claim. Moreover, predecessor counsel was fully compensated for its work through the payment of regular invoices prior to the transfer of the\n   compensation agreement to a contingent fee basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435445\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/797/948/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435445\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/797/948/\">\n    at 951-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Malone Middleman nevertheless claims it cannot be liable to Meyer Darragh because it did not receive the full 40% contingent fee identified in its fee agreement. The argument fails. For whatever reason, Malone Middleman accepted less than 40% as full payment of its fee by the Eazor Estate. Its decision to do so does not inoculate it against a meritorious\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim by Meyer Darragh, where the record shows unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer Darragh II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280958,12280948,6805965,6806054\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/137/1247/\">\n    137 A.3d at 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Saylor, C.J., concurring) (allowing\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   recovery from a client \"puts the client in an untenable position where, as here, the client has already paid the attorney fee in full to the successor law firm\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Fowkes\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.

Significantly, however, successor counsel specifically agreed to accept a lesser percentage contingent fee for the purpose of allowing the client to pay any fees they owed to predecessor counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"721972,7876765\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/877/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"721972,7876765\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/661/877/\">\n    at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is clear the clients in\n   <em>\n    Fowkes\n   </em>\n   were not unfairly placed in the position of paying\n   <strong>\n    excess\n   </strong>\n   fees to predecessor counsel; the discount received in their subsequent fee agreement was expressly intended to remunerate predecessor counsel. Here, however, there is no evidence of record-or even an allegation by Malone Middleman-that the discount Malone Middleman provided to the Eazor Estate was for the purpose of allowing the estate to pay fees to Meyer Darragh. In the absence of such an explicit agreement, we decline to hold predecessor counsel's\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim for fees lies against the client rather than successor counsel; otherwise, successor counsel could evade liability to predecessor counsel once a dispute arose by accepting a lower fee and claiming it was never fully compensated by the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, we hold, under circumstances like those presented here, predecessor counsel may recover damages in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against successor counsel in a contingent fee dispute. Such a claim is viable only where the facts demonstrate unjust enrichment, that is, successor counsel has received and retained a benefit from predecessor counsel, which would be unjust to retain without some payment to predecessor counsel. Our decision today does not preclude a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim by predecessor counsel against a former client, where the benefit is similarly conferred upon and unjustly retained by the client without payment to predecessor counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court's decision, and remand to the trial court for reinstatement of its award of $14,721.39 in favor of Meyer Darragh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Jurisdiction relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Chief Justice Saylor, Justices Baer, Todd, Donohue, Wecht and Mundy join the opinion\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    As the Eazor Litigation was settled after suit was filed, Malone Middleman was slated to receive 40% of the net proceeds of settlement pursuant to its contingency fee agreement with the Eazor Estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Exhibit C to the Proposed Stipulated Facts.
