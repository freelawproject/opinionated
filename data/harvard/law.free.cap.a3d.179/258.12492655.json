Tirado, appeals from the judgment of dismissal rendered by the trial court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the court improperly\n   dismissed the plaintiff's action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to her failure to (1) file her complaint within one year of the tax assessment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119, and (2) exhaust available administrative remedies prior to filing an action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies prior to filing suit pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On March 22, 2010, the city of Waterbury issued a certificate of change for the 2004 grand list, removing the plaintiff's motor vehicle therefrom, after receiving information from the plaintiff that she resided in Torrington on October 1, 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city of\n   Waterbury forwarded its certificate of change to the defendant, the city of Torrington. On March 24, 2010, after receiving\n   the Waterbury certificate of change, the defendant's tax assessor issued a certificate of change and added the plaintiff's motor vehicle to its 2004 grand list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 10, 2014, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the judicial district of Waterbury, claiming that the defendant issued a certificate of change after the three year statutory limit set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 12-57.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 3, 2014, the defendant filed an answer, denying that the expiration of any limitations period required the defendant's tax assessor's office to remove the plaintiff's name from the list of individuals owing taxes to the defendant. On October 20, 2015, the plaintiff filed a certificate of closed pleadings and a claim for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 8, 2016, the court,\n   <em>\n    Shapiro, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the defendant's motion to transfer the matter to the\n   judicial district of Litchfield because an aggrieved taxpayer must bring an application for relief in the judicial district where the town or city is located. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-117a and 12-119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 26, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum in support thereof, claiming that the defendant acted without authority when it added the plaintiff's motor vehicle to its 2004 grand list on March 24, 2010, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-60. On April 27, 2016, the defendant objected to the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, arguing that the certificate of change was issued pursuant to \u00a7 12-57 (b), not \u00a7 12-60. On April 28, 2016, the plaintiff filed a reply brief in further support of her motion for summary judgment, but she withdrew her summary judgment motion on May 4, 2016. Thereafter, on May 12, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the defendant's answer, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Shah, J.\n   </em>\n   , denied on May 17, 2016, on the grounds that the motion was untimely filed more than two years after the filing of the defendant's answer and did not contain an accompanying memorandum that was required pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A one day bench trial took place on May 17, 2016. Following trial, the court rendered a judgment of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because \"[t]he plaintiff failed to exhaust available administrative remedies before she filed the present action pursuant to ... \u00a7 12-117a.... She also failed to file her complaint within one year of the assessment if she had proceeded under ... \u00a7 12-119.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted.)

The first category in the statute embraces situations where a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the municipality where it is situated ....

Though she did not frame it as an issue on appeal, the plaintiff also states in her principal brief that she had not \"received the tax bill nor the certificate of change [because] it was sent to an address in Torrington that the plaintiff hadn't lived at in over five years by the Torrington tax assessor.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    At trial, in contradiction to her statements on appeal, the plaintiff testified: \"In ... 2010 I received a letter from Torrington stating that ...
