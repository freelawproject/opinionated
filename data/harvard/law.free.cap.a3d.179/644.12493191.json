C.S. \u00a7 1547.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 12, 2014, Licensee was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) pursuant to Section 3802(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3802(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 28, 2014, the Department notified Licensee that his operating privilege would be suspended for a period of one year, effective January 2, 2015. The notice explained that the suspension resulted from his refusal to submit to chemical testing following the arrest, in violation of the Implied Consent Law. 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1547(b). Licensee appealed, contending that \"[he] did not refuse to submit to chemical testing.\" Certified Record (C.R.), Petition for Appeal (12/23/2014), \u00b6 5. The trial court held a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing on August 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department presented the testimony of Pennsylvania State Trooper Derrick Cargill. He testified that on November 12, 2014, while on patrol, he observed a black Nissan Maxima fail to stop at a red light. Notes of Testimony, 8/1/2016, at 6 (N.T. __). Cargill followed the vehicle as it travelled at a high rate of speed and crossed over the yellow dividing lines. After stopping the vehicle, Cargill confronted Licensee, whose breath was marked by \"the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage.\" N.T. 8. Licensee stated that he had one drink. Cargill conducted three field sobriety tests, all of which Licensee failed. Cargill also administered a portable breath test, which \"showed a high presence of alcohol.\" N.T. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cargill arrested Licensee for DUI and transported him to Einstein Hospital for a blood test. Once there, Cargill read the Department's DL-26 form to Licensee, which contained the following warnings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If you refuse to submit to the chemical test, your operating privilege will be suspended for at least 12 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If you previously refused a chemical test or were previously convicted of driving under the influence, you will be suspended for up to 18 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, if you refuse to submit to the chemical test and you are convicted of violating Section 3802(a) relating to impaired driving of the Vehicle Code, then because of your refusal, you will be subject to more severe penalties set\n   forth in Section 3804(c) relating to penalties of the Vehicle Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   These are the same penalties that will be imposed if you are convicted of driving with the highest rate of alcohol, which include a minimum of 72 consecutive hours in jail and a minimum fine of $1,000 or up to a maximum five years in jail and a maximum fine of $10,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   N.T. 15-18. Licensee confirmed that he understood the consequences and signed the DL-26 form. Cargill testified that Licensee refused to take the blood test without giving a reason. Cargill further testified that Licensee did not inform him that he has a medical condition that prevents him from taking the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Licensee testified that after being read the DL-26 form, he told Cargill that he could not take a blood test because he \"[had] a phobia for needles.\" N.T. 35. He offered to \"take a urinalysis\" or a breathalyzer test, but Cargill insisted upon a blood test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The only test to which Licensee submitted was the portable breath test at the initial traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Licensee presented the testimony of his physician, Dr. Wayne Gibbons, who has treated Licensee on several occasions. Dr. Gibbons testified that Licensee often had a \"vasovagal reaction\" to having blood drawn, meaning that he felt faint or broke out in a sweat. N.T. 28-29. On one occasion, Licensee fainted. As a result, Dr. Gibbons uses alternative methods for laboratory testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Licensee argued that the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v. North Dakota\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), which was rendered during the pendency of his license suspension appeal, governs the instant matter. Under\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , Licensee argued, his refusal to take the blood test \"[was] not improper\" because a motorist cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test \"on pain of committing a criminal offense.\" N.T. 41. Here, Licensee was warned that he could be subject to both civil and criminal penalties if he refused to take the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Crediting Cargill's version of the event, the trial court denied Licensee's appeal. In its opinion filed pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a), the trial court explained that the Department satisfied its burden under Section 1547 of the Vehicle Code in proving that Licensee (1) was arrested for DUI by a police officer who had reasonable grounds to believe he was under the influence of alcohol; (2) was asked to submit to a chemical test; (3) refused to do so; and (4) was warned that the refusal would result in a license suspension. Once the Department satisfied its burden, Licensee had to prove that his refusal was not knowing or conscious or that he was physically unable to take the test. Trial Court op. at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sitoski v. Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bureau of Driver Licensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7282703\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/11/12/#p18\">\n    11 A.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) ). Based on Cargill's credited testimony, the trial court found that Licensee refused to take the blood test and did not explain the reason for his refusal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court rejected Licensee's argument that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   required his license suspension to be set aside. The trial court explained that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   does not govern civil license suspensions, noting that the Supreme Court referred approvingly to state implied consent laws that \"impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply [with chemical testing].\" Trial Court op. at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , ---U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2185 ). Licensee appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Licensee presents two issues for our consideration. First, he argues that the trial court erred in holding that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   does not govern the instant matter. He contends that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   should be extended to civil license suspensions because a licensee cannot be punished, either civilly or criminally, for refusing to submit to a blood test. Second, Licensee argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding Cargill's testimony more credible than that of Licensee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin with a review of the Implied Consent Law.

There, petitioners challenged North Dakota and Minnesota laws that imposed a criminal penalty on motorists suspected of DUI who refused to submit to a breath or blood test required under the states' implied consent laws. The motorists argued that a search warrant is needed before police can conduct either a breath test or a blood test. The Supreme Court held that a warrant is not required for a breath test because the need for testing a motorist's level of intoxication outweighs the comparatively slight impact on the motorist's privacy interest in providing a breath sample.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    at 2184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court observed, nevertheless, that its \"prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    at 2185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that case, the arresting officer warned the driver that he would be subject to enhanced criminal penalties if he refused to consent to a blood test, and the driver consented. At his subsequent criminal trial on DUI charges, the driver moved to suppress the results of the blood test. The trial court denied the motion to suppress. The driver appealed, arguing that his consent to the warrantless request for a blood test was involuntary. The Superior Court vacated the trial court's order. It held that the warning contained in the former version of Section 1547(b)(2)(ii) of the Vehicle Code (Act of November 29, 2004, P.L. 1369) was \"partially inaccurate\" and, consequently, the results of the blood test had to be suppressed and the enhanced sentence for refusing the blood test vacated.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315606\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/323/\">\n    153 A.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

He contends that because the warnings he was given contained language about enhanced criminal penalties, which was declared unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   , he cannot be punished for refusing to take the blood test, either civilly or criminally. Licensee argues that \"it is impossible [that] one must consent for civil purposes but cannot for criminal purposes.\" Licensee Brief at 13. Licensee describes the problem as a \"Hobson's choice,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , yield to a directive \"that is so coercive as to be constitutionally infirm\" or lose his license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. By failing to consider such an \"inherent dilemma,\" Licensee argues, the trial court erred by holding that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   does not apply to civil license suspension cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Preliminarily, we observe that the basis for Licensee's license suspension appeal to the trial court was that \"[he] did not refuse to submit to chemical testing.\" C.R., Petition for Appeal (12/23/2014), \u00b6 5. Licensee testified that he could not take the blood test because he had a \"phobia for needles.\" N.T. 35-36. In support, he presented the testimony of his physician, who confirmed that Licensee often felt faint or broke out in a sweat when he had blood drawn. N.T. 28-29. The factual record does not indicate that Licensee was forced to choose between asserting his Fourth Amendment right and maintaining his operating privilege. Nevertheless, because Licensee raised\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   at his hearing before the trial court, we consider it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Licensee contends that\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   must be extended to civil license suspension cases. We disagree. The\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   court explicitly limited its holding to implied consent laws imposing criminal penalties. In so doing, the Supreme Court observed that the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   did not question the constitutionality of implied consent laws that impose only civil penalties, and stated that nothing in its opinion \"should be read to cast doubt on them.\"\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that it is one thing to approve implied consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to comply, but quite another for a state to insist upon an intrusive blood test and then impose criminal penalties on motorists who refuse to submit. Therefore, \"\n   <em>\n    [t]here must be a limit on the consequences\n   </em>\n   to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Subsequently, in\n   <em>\n    Boseman v.

Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Boseman\n   </em>\n   is grounded upon the settled distinction between a civil license suspension proceeding and a criminal DUI proceeding arising out of the same incident. Further, it is not a crime to refuse to submit to chemical testing under the Implied Consent Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Licensee argues that the trial court erred by relying on the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   approving of the general concept of implied consent laws that impose civil penalties and evidentiary consequences on motorists who refuse to submit to a blood test. Licensee asserts that this language was\n   <em>\n    obiter dicta\n   </em>\n   . We rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Marchese\n   </em>\n   , explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   By its own language, the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   Court unequivocally stated that \"nothing we say here should be read to cast\n   doubt\" on the constitutionality of state implied consent laws imposing civil penalties and evidentiary consequences for refusing a blood test. Contrary to Licensee's characterization of this language as\n   <em>\n    obiter dicta\n   </em>\n   , we believe the U.S. Supreme Court clearly indicated nothing in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   questions the constitutionality of state implied consent laws imposing only civil sanctions. To that end, the Court stated: \"It is another matter, however, for a State to not only insist upon an intrusive blood test, but also to impose criminal penalties on the refusal to submit to such a test.\" Therefore, the Court concluded \"that motorists cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to a blood test on pain of committing a criminal offense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Given the\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   Court's explicit limitation on its holding to implied consent laws imposing criminal penalties, we reject Licensee's contention that it must logically be extended to render unconstitutional implied consent laws which provide for only civil penalties for refusal of a blood test. Such an interpretation would be contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court's limiting language in\n   <em>\n    Birchfield\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Marchese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327611\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/733/#p740\">\n    169 A.3d at 739-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis and internal quotations omitted).
