We held in\n   <em>\n    Chmiel\n   </em>\n   that an April 2015 FBI press release, stating that certain hair microscopy expert testimony from the FBI's own experts was flawed, qualified as a newly-discovered fact for the purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n    173 A.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Opinion of Wecht, J.). This was the case even though the expert who testified at trial was employed by the Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI had no direct involvement in the case, and the defendant produced no evidence that the FBI had trained the state expert who testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For all the reasons set forth in my dissent in\n   <em>\n    Chmiel\n   </em>\n   , I continue to believe this Court's rationale was flawed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n    173 A.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mundy, J., dissenting). Specifically, I remain skeptical that \"the FBI's agreement with [a defendant] as to [erroneous scientific testimony] is an essential factual predicate to a legal claim for relief in a case where the FBI was not involved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/#p620\">\n    173 A.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mundy, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) (stating that a PCRA petition is deemed timely if \"the facts\n   <em>\n    upon which the claim is predicated\n   </em>\n   were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence\") (emphasis added). Nevertheless, as\n   <em>\n    Chmiel\n   </em>\n   is now the law of this Commonwealth, I recognize that its rationale applies equally to Appellant in this case. I therefore join the Court's order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
