We held in the affirmative-that \"a condominium association is permitted to foreclose on [its] six-month [super-priority] lien and [to] distribute the proceeds from the foreclosure sale first to satisfy [its super-priority] lien and then to satisfy any\n   remaining liens in order of lien priority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6920505\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/166/#p172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We clarified that in such circumstances \"[a]ny liens [including a first mortgage or first deed of trust] that are unsatisfied by the foreclosure-sale proceeds are extinguished, and the foreclosure-sale purchaser acquires free and clear title.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6920505\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/166/#p172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The present case requires this court to determine a similar issue.

Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order granting summary judgment to U.S. Bank, which concluded that a condominium could foreclose on its super-priority lien while leaving the underlying mortgage lien intact, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 9, 2007, Jon Michael Lucas obtained a mortgage loan in the amount of $589,750 to finance his purchase of condominium unit 1003, located at 301 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., in the Sonata Condominium complex. Mr. Lucas also executed a deed of trust and promissory note, which secured the loan on the condominium. Mr. Lucas's mortgage loan was originally from Vanguard Mortgage and Title, Inc. (\"VMT\") and the deed of trust and note were executed in VMT's favor. The deed of trust was recorded in the land records of the District of Columbia. Mr. Lucas's mortgage loan was later assigned to U.S. Bank (\"Bank\"), which also took possession of the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Mr. Lucas stopped paying both his monthly mortgage payments and his condominium assessments, the latter of which prompted the Sonata Condominium Unit Owners Association (\"Sonata\") to seek foreclosure on the condominium, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 42-1903.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), which entitles condominium associations to a super-priority lien for the most recent six months of unpaid condominium assessments. Between 2011 and 2014, Sonata scheduled several foreclosure sales for the condominium, but the sales were all cancelled after the Bank paid Mr. Lucas's unpaid assessments. The Bank paid the assessments on Mr. Lucas's behalf in order to preserve its lien on the condominium. These payments were secured under Mr. Lucas's loan by the deed of trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 1, 2014, Mr. Lucas was in default for unpaid condominium assessments, prompting Sonata to file a \"Notice of Foreclosure Sale of the Condominium Unit for Assessments Due\" with the District's Recorder of Deeds. The notice stated that\n   Mr. Lucas was in arrears to Sonata for $11,503.67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sonata sent the notice of the foreclosure sale to Mr. Lucas and all other interested parties, including the Bank; the notice stated that the foreclosure sale would not be held until thirty-one days past the date on which the notice was mailed, and that if the past due amounts were not paid in full by that time, the condominium would be sold at a public auction on June 4, 2014. On May 23, Sonata also sent the Bank a letter stating the amount that needed to be paid in order to stop the scheduled foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sonata publicly advertised the sale of the condominium in the Washington Post on May 23, May 28, and June 3, 2014. The advertisement stated that the condominium would be sold pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 42-1903.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that it would be \"[s]old subject to a deed of trust for approximately $589,750.00 (as of 03/09/2007)[,]\" referencing the Bank's deed of trust for Mr. Lucas's mortgage loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 4, Sonata held a public auction for the foreclosure sale and the condominium was sold to appellant Liu, the highest bidder at the auction, for $17,000. An accounting of the foreclosure sale, included in the record, demonstrates that, of the $17,000 purchase price for the condominium, Sonata deducted almost six months of unpaid condominium assessments, totaling $5,195.28, as well as interest on the assessments, attorney's fees, and other expenses from the foreclosure sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Bank attempted to pay the assessments owed to Sonata in order to stop the foreclosure sale. Sonata, however, did not receive the check from the Bank until June 5, 2014, the day after the foreclosure sale. Accordingly, the Bank's check was returned with a letter indicating that the condominium had already been sold to a third-party purchaser. Ms. Liu recorded the deed of trust, dated July 1, 2014, which included a provision inserted by Sonata, stating: \"The hereinafter described property is sold subject to a deed of trust recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds at Instrument Number 2007035647.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 16, 2014, the Bank filed a claim for judicial foreclosure against Mr. Lucas, as the mortgagor in default under the note, and later joined Ms. Liu, the new record owner of the condominium, as a defendant in the action. In its claim, the Bank asserted its rights as the beneficiary of the deed of trust, and also notified the court that Mr. Lucas's loan had been accelerated, and that he owed $799,034.23 under the note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her defense, Ms. Liu maintained that she purchased the condominium at the foreclosure sale, free and\n   clear of the Bank's mortgage lien, pursuant to both\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C.

The trial court acknowledged that, at the time of Sonata's foreclosure sale, the law was unclear regarding the effect of a condominium association's foreclosure sale, pursuant to its super-priority lien, on a bank's first-priority mortgage lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite this lack of clarity in the law at the time of Ms. Liu's purchase, the trial court emphasized that the advertisements, the memorandum of sale to Ms. Liu, and the deed of trust all specified that the property was sold to Ms. Liu subject to the Bank's mortgage lien. Thus, it was \"abundantly clear\" that Ms. Liu was purchasing the property subject to the Bank's lien. Furthermore, the court noted that Ms. Liu had testified at a deposition that the property was worth between $700,000 and $750,000, and that the District of Columbia Office of Tax and Revenue assessed the condominium at a value of $719,930. The court stated that the $17,000 purchase price \"obviously reflected the understanding that the Property was subject to [the Bank's] lien.\" Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \"[i]t would be an inequitable windfall and contrary to the parties' expectations to permit Ms. Liu to disavow [the Bank's] mortgage ... and would impose an enormous foreclosure deficiency on [ ] [Mr.] Lucas if Ms. Liu's purchase is not subject to [the Bank's] lien, as was contemplated at the foreclosure sale.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Code \u00a7 42-1901.07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   states \"[e]xcept as expressly provided by this chapter, a provision of this chapter\n   <em>\n    may not be varied by agreement\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    any right conferred by this chapter may not be waived\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Chase Plaza\n   </em>\n   , none of the provisions of the chapter expressly indicate that a super-priority lien may be contracted away by the parties or waived by the condominium association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, permitting a condominium association to exercise its super-priority lien while also preserving the full amount of the Bank's unpaid lien, defeats the Council's purpose in enacting the super-priority lien. The super-priority lien provision effectively shields condominium associations from pressure by lenders to require foreclosure-sale purchasers to agree that the property is subject to the first mortgage, a term that could reduce the number of interested bidders and impair\n   the condominium association's ability to recover unpaid assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the record demonstrates that Sonata enforced its lien for Mr. Lucas's most recent six months of unpaid assessments, when it sold the condominium to Ms. Liu at the foreclosure sale. The foreclosure notice to Mr. Lucas and Sonata's letter to the Bank indicated that Sonata was seeking to collect $11,503.67 in unpaid assessments and related costs, and that if the amount was not paid, Sonata would institute foreclosure proceedings on the unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Bank argues, however, that because the terms of the sale indicated that the unit would be sold subject to its first deed of trust, Sonata did not actually enforce its super-priority lien. The Bank also maintains that a condominium association may agree to subordinate its super-priority lien to a first deed of trust during a foreclosure sale. We disagree. Such a reordering of lien priorities would effectively constitute a waiver by the condominium association of its super-priority lien, which is not permitted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1901.07\">\n    D.C.

Equitable Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Bank contends that the trial court properly concluded that Ms. Liu was\n   equitably estopped from claiming that its mortgage interest was extinguished at the sale. We have recognized that \"[a] party raising equitable estoppel must show that he changed his position prejudicially in reasonable reliance on a false representation or concealment of material fact which the party to be estopped made with knowledge of the true facts and intent to induce the other to act.\"\n   <em>\n    Nolan v.

In response, Ms. Liu asserts that the provisions in the advertisement, on her memorandum of sale, and in the deed of trust, which indicated that the property was sold subject to the deed of trust, were only included because of the trial court's erroneous ruling in\n   <em>\n    Chase Plaza\n   </em>\n   , which was later reversed by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, the record does not support the trial court's application of the equitable estoppel doctrine to preclude Ms. Liu from maintaining that her purchase of the condominium was not subject to the Bank's deed of trust. To begin, the Bank has not demonstrated that it reasonably relied on the advertised terms of sale to protect its mortgage interest. To the contrary, the Bank attempted to pay the six months of condominium assessments in order to stop the foreclosure sale, but failed to make the payment on time. Moreover, although the Bank contends that it \"reasonably relied upon Ms. Liu's actions in accepting the terms of the sale by not moving to vacate the sale after it occurred[,]\" this argument lacks merit-the Bank was aware through its loan servicer that the state of the law on super-priority liens was in flux at the time, and that the Bank's interest could be subordinate to Sonata's interest in the event of a foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Furthermore, the legislative history of the super-priority lien provisions and public policy concerns related to ensuring a condominium association's collection of unpaid assessments, also support a conclusion that equitable estoppel is not appropriate in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears v. Sears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208179\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/293/884/#p887\">\n    293 F.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (D.C.

For example, in 2013, the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Real Property Acts (\"JEB\")-a board established by the Uniform Law Commission (\"ULC\")-created a report, to in part, address the appropriate interpretation of the six-month limited priority lien provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JEB Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 11, at 6. In its report, the JEB discussed how the depressed real estate market has led to incentives for banks to intentionally delay foreclosure proceedings, at the expense of condominium associations, which are forced to forgo timely payments of assessments, and at the expense of condominium association residents who \"bear the consequences of default by a [condominium unit owner] [on] assessment obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In this\n   case, Mr. Lucas was in default on both his mortgage payments and his condominium assessments for a lengthy period, from 2009 to 2014, yet the Bank waited five years to institute foreclosure proceedings on the unit. In addition, the condominium association had to file several notices of foreclosure in an effort to obtain payments to cover Mr. Lucas's defaults on the assessments. It is this prejudice to condominium associations from extended delays by a bank to institute foreclosure on a condominium unit, which the super-priority lien was intended to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, we note that equitable relief is not available when granting such relief would contravene the express provision of a statute. The judicial system is charged with enforcing public policy as embodied by legislative statute. \"It is a basic maxim that equity is ancillary, not antagonistic, to the law. Equitable relief is not available when the grant thereof would violate the express provision of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v. Am. Ins.

Although it may seem like Ms. Liu was able to procure the property for a relatively low amount of money through the foreclosure process, any concerns about this process are properly addressed through the legislative process. Moreover, the Bank still retains a claim against Mr. Lucas, the borrower under the Bank's mortgage loan, from whom the Bank can seek to recover the remaining balance owed on Mr. Lucas's mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Bank's Additional Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Bank makes a few additional challenges to Sonata's foreclosure sale, which warrant brief discussion. First, the Bank argues that Sonata was permitted to conduct the foreclosure sale subject to the Bank's first deed of trust, because a secured party bank and a condominium association may agree to subordinate a condominium association's super-priority lien to a bank's mortgage lien under the JEB Report. However, this is a mischaracterization of the JEB Report. Example One of the JEB Report addresses an instance in which a unit owner is in default on both its mortgage with the bank and its common expense assessments, and the bank institutes foreclosure proceedings on the unit. JEB Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 11, at 7-8. Example One clarifies that a bank's foreclosure on the unit will not extinguish the association's super-priority lien because that lien is senior to the bank's lien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Instead, the association's super-priority lien will transfer to the proceeds of the sale, and the buyer at the foreclosure sale will take title to the unit, subject to the association's six-month super-priority lien.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. In this example, the JEB Report mentions that as an alternative, the bank and the association may agree that the foreclosure sale will deliver clear title to the buyer, with the proceeds of the sale being distributed first to the association to cover its six months' worth of unpaid assessments prior to being applied to the bank's unpaid mortgage balance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. This alternative, however, does not suggest that the association may subordinate its senior lien status; to the contrary, it reinforces the principle that an association's six-month priority lien has \"true priority\" over the bank's subordinate lien.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, the Bank argues that Sonata could only impose its six-month super-\n   priority lien through a judicial foreclosure, and maintains that because the association conducted a non-judicial foreclosure in this case, the sale could not operate to extinguish the Bank's mortgage lien. We disagree. The Bank cites to the version of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C.

Here, the condominium by-laws explicitly authorize a non-judicial foreclosure, stating that \"[t]he lien for assessments may be foreclosed in the manner provided by the laws of the District of Columbia either, at the option of the Board of Directors, by a sale in a non-judicial proceeding or by suit brought in the name of the Board of Directors, acting on behalf of the Association.\" Moreover, effective June 21, 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C.

In this jurisdiction, a mortgage lender may foreclose on a unit through judicial foreclosure or non-judicial foreclosure, and accordingly, Sonata had the option of pursuing either type of foreclosure in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2042-815\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 42-815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , - 816 (2012 Repl.). Thus, Sonata was not precluded from pursuing non-judicial enforcement of its super-priority lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lastly, the Bank argues that Sonata's foreclosure sale could not have been conducted pursuant to its super-priority lien because Sonata had already previously attempted to foreclose on the unit. The Bank, relying on Example Three in the JEB Report, is correct that the super-priority lien provision \"does not ... authorize an association to file successive lien enforcement actions every six months as a means to extend the association's limited lien priority.\" JEB Report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 11, at 12. Example Three in the JEB Report, however, is based on a case in which a foreclosure action is already pending at the time the association attempts to file an\n   additional foreclosure action; as a foreclosure action had already been initiated, the additional action was not necessary to enforce the association's lien and represented an attempt to extend the association's lien priority beyond the six months entitled to super-priority status. Although this precludes an association from obtaining super-priority status on an amount in excess of six months while a foreclosure action is pending, it does not preclude an association from enforcing another super-priority lien if there is no action pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the District of Nevada stated that it could not find \"any authority stating that an [association] is precluded from bringing multiple enforcement actions to enforce entirely separate liens (with super[-]priority portions) for unpaid assessments against the same parcel of property.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139262\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/200/1141/#p1167\">\n    200 F.Supp.3d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167 (D. Nev. 2016). The court recognized that the JEB Report barred multiple attempts to \"enforce the super[-]priority portion of its lien multiple times during the pendency of the same bank foreclosure action\" but that no such bar existed for a subsequent enforcement action to enforce a separate lien when no other foreclosure action was pending.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139262\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/200/1141/#p1167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139262\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/200/1141/#p1167\">\n    at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in this case, although Sonata had previously collected on a separate super-priority lien, they were not barred from filing a successive foreclosure action when no such action was pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, we conclude that a condominium association, acting on its six-month super-priority lien for unpaid condominium assessments, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 42-1903.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), may not conduct its foreclosure sale subject to the first deed of trust. Although Sonata's foreclosure sale in this case was purportedly subject to the Bank's deed of trust, the anti-waiver provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1901.07\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 42-1901.07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , precludes a condominium association from waiving the priority of its super-priority lien or exercising its super-priority lien while also preserving the full amount of the Bank's unpaid lien. Thus, when Sonata enforced its super-priority lien to collect six months of unpaid assessments at the foreclosure sale, the Bank's first deed of trust for the condominium was effectively extinguished and Ms. Liu purchased the condominium free and clear of the Bank's deed of trust. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the Bank and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n     D.C.

Notably, Ms. Liu mentions the attorney who conducted the foreclosure sale of the property at issue in this case was the same attorney who conducted the foreclosure sale in\n    <em>\n     Chase Plaza\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    We do not address the question of whether a lien covering a period in excess of six months prior to the 2017 amendment to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2042-1903.13\">\n     D.C.

In this case, Ms. Menist testified that her intention was for Sonata to foreclose on a lien for January through December, 2014. However, given that the sale occurred on June 4, 2014, Sonata foreclosed on a lien covering slightly less than the six months entitled to super-priority status.
