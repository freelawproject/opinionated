Essentially, the District presents two issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the Award satisfies the essence test; and (2) whether the Award contravenes public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District and the Association are parties to a CBA which became effective July 1, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Article III, Paragraph H of the CBA contains language regarding subcontracting and specifically states: \"No work of the bargaining unit shall be sub[ ]contracted for the life of the [CBA].\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 63a. During labor negotiations in July 2016, the District notified the Association that a Request for Proposals (RFP)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for custodial\n   services had been issued on March 29, 2016. The District provided the Association with the information it received from the successful bidder. However, the District did not enter into a contract with the successful bidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Association filed a grievance on April 7, 2016, claiming that the District violated the CBA\n   <em>\n    by accepting bids for custodial labor services\n   </em>\n   . The grievance was submitted to arbitration and a hearing was held before an Arbitrator on August 16, 2016. On November 7, 2016, the Arbitrator granted the Association's grievance, holding that the District had violated the CBA's \"no outside subcontracting provision\" and \"the RFPs cannot be used in bargaining with the Association to secure [an] advantage.\" R.R. at 15a. The Arbitrator further held that \"[o]utside contracts which eliminate the Bargaining Unit cannot be used unless or until the parties are at legal impasse\" and \"[a]ny formal selection of prior RFPs are therefore considered to be null and void.\" R.R. at 15a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award (Petition) on December 6, 2016. The Association filed a Motion to Strike Portions of Petition (Motion to Strike) on December 28, 2016. The trial court held a hearing on the Motion to Strike on January 23, 2017. By January 23, 2017 order, the trial court granted the Motion and struck Exhibits B, C, D and E from the Petition, leaving only Exhibits A (the CBA) and F (the Award) for consideration. On January 30, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the Petition, and affirmed the Award and denied the Petition. The District appealed to this Court. The trial court issued an order directing the District to file a Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure (Rule) 1925(b) Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( Rule 1925(b) Statement). The District filed its Rule 1925(b) Statement on March 14, 2017. On April 13, 2017, the trial court filed its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District first argues that the Award fails to draw its essence from the CBA.

In the instant case, the relevant CBA provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No Sub\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    [ ]\n    <strong>\n     Contracting\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    No work of the bargaining unit shall be sub\n   </strong>\n   [ ]\n   <strong>\n    contracted for the life of the Agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2.

The District maintains that the RFP was issued for negotiation purposes only, the CBA makes no mention of RFPs and that the CBA was not implicated because no contract was executed. The Association rejoins that the CBA's subcontracting provisions were triggered once the RFP was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The issue\n   <strong>\n    before\n   </strong>\n   the Arbitrator was whether \"the District violate[d] the CBA by issuing [an RFP] for custodial services in the District[.] If so, what is the remedy?\" R.R. at 8a. The issue the Arbitrator\n   <strong>\n    addressed\n   </strong>\n   was \"whether the District ha[d] subcontracted out work ....\" R.R. at 10a. Clearly, the issue the Arbitrator\n   <strong>\n    addressed\n   </strong>\n   falls within the CBA's terms prohibiting subcontracting. However, since it is undisputed that no contract for custodial services had been signed, that issue was not before the Arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In determining that the issue was before him, the Arbitrator explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   '[O]utside contracting,' or 'contracting out' is a process.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   It does not start when the contractor signs the formal contract or begins actual work. It begins when the District decides to pursue that outside contracting avenue and then advises the Association and advertises through the use of RFPs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   That process, therefore, started when the current CBA was in effect and, in my opinion, is in violation of the 'no subcontracting' language. The process then continues then [sic] through the 'walk through' and culminates with the public opening of the bids and the selection of a successful bidder. The formal contract would then follow and the work would then commence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In summary, the outside contracting language becomes operative not when the outside contracting work actually begins, but at least back to when the RFPs are announced. Arguably, it could flow even back to when the District [m]anagement in their [sic] internal discussions decided to initiate the outside contracting process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R.R. at 13a. At the time the District issued the RFP, the parties were negotiating a new contract, and the District proposed eliminating the no subcontracting provision in the next CBA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notes of Testimony August 16, 2016, Ex. E at 4), and issued the RFP to determine whether removing that provision was in the District's best interest. The Arbitrator stated that the District's action in issuing the RFP \"had a 'chilling effect' on the negotiations[,]\" and thus \"was a bargaining tactic to secure\n   advantage for the District.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 12a-13a. The Arbitrator concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   There is no question that the District, while the CBA was in effect, decided to subcontracted [sic] out and to pursue that alternative.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   They [sic] could have broached the subject in negotiations and pursued it without going through the RFP process. I do not believe that [it] went through that entire process only to obtain information but to use it as a tactic in negotiations to secure advantage or to bargain to impasse. Then potentially [it] could unilaterally initiate custodial subcontracting, thereby, eliminating the Bargaining Unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Therefore, in my opinion, the provisions of the CBA have been violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   R.R. at 14a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, the law is well-established as pronounced by the United States Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    An arbitrator\n   </strong>\n   is confined to interpretation and application of the [CBA]; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may, of course, look for guidance from many sources, yet his\n   <strong>\n    award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    United Steelworkers v.

Therefore, this Court is constrained to hold that the issue before the Arbitrator does not fall within the CBA's terms.

The import of this mandate is revealed through its similar imposition on unions as Section 1201(b)(5) of PERA equally prohibits unions from, and makes it an unfair labor practice for, \"[r]efusing to\n   <strong>\n    bargain\n   </strong>\n   collectively\n   <strong>\n    in good faith\n   </strong>\n   ....\" 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1201(b)(5) (emphasis added).

In fulfilling its good faith bargaining duty, the District issued an RFP to determine whether it was financially feasible and thus in the District's best interest to do so. The District presented the information it received from the successful bidder in order to provide the Association with an opportunity to match or counter the proposal. The Arbitrator concluded \"that the request [sic] for RFPs announced in the newspaper and in negotiations, had a 'chilling effect' on the negotiations.\" R.R. at 12a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, the PLRB, the administrative agency the General Assembly expressly created and empowered to enforce and uphold its legislative mandates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section 501 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.501, has long since specifically rejected the Arbitrator's statement and reasoning upon which the Arbitrator based his conclusion that the District violated the CBA. In doing so, the PLRB opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We recognize that in\n   <em>\n    Township of Little Egg Harbor\n   </em>\n   , PERC No. 76-15 2 NJPER 5 (1976), the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) found that an employer had committed unfair practices in violation of Sections 5.4(a)(1) and (5) of the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   under circumstances similar to those of the present case. During the course of negotiations, the employer in\n   <em>\n    Little Egg Harbor\n   </em>\n   advertised for bids to subcontract garbage collections. The employer rejected all the bids received. Nevertheless, the PERC's hearing examiner found that the employer had engaged in unfair practices by failing to negotiate in good faith about the issues of subcontracting. The hearing examiner said:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A decision to advertise for bids to provide the services currently performed by the employees of the Sanitation Department during the middle of negotiations for a first contract could only have had a 'chilling effect' on the entire negotiations process. This unilateral action certainly affected changes in the 'status quo' with reference to the terms and conditions of employment of a Sanitation Department employee, specifically with regard to an individual's job security and expectation of continuing employment. The record established that a municipal sanitary collection service has been maintained for approximately the past nine years. The very act of setting in motion the process of subcontracting the unit work, in a drastic departure from the existing and past practices, is tantamount to the sending of termination notices to employees\n   negotiating a first contract with only the precise date of termination left blank.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The New Jersey PERC adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law but not necessarily the dicta of the hearing examiner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Little Egg Harbor\n    </em>\n    is in conflict with our own decisions which focus on whether the public employer has approached the bargaining table with an open mind and a sincere desire to reach an agreement and on whether the employe organization has been afforded the opportunity to formulate its own proposal in response to subcontracting proposals received by the employer\n   </strong>\n   . We have not in the past viewed the mere solicitation of bids as an inherently coercive act on the part of a public employer which would have a 'chilling effect' on negotiations.\n   <strong>\n    We have, rather, regarded such solicitations as prerequisites for intelligent bargaining\n   </strong>\n   .
