Specifically, the question this case presents is whether the revised and consolidated assault statute, contained in Section 3-201(b) of the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), contemplates different crimes, or whether the acts constitute second degree assault. Petitioner Barrington Dean Watts was convicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of two counts of first degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Over Petitioner's objection, the jury heard instructions on two different variations of second degree assault, battery and intent to frighten, but was not instructed to reach a unanimous decision about which iteration occurred here. Petitioner appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in an unreported opinion. First, we determine that the objection made by Petitioner preserved the issue of whether the jury should hear a unanimity instruction after hearing instructions for both forms of assault. We next determine that the assault statute contemplates different modalities of committing the singular crime of second degree assault as opposed to different crimes. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have found that on November 9, 2014, Petitioner, Barrington Dean Watts, entered the apartment of Lavasha Harding, pointed a gun at one of the occupants of the apartment, Andre French, and demanded money. An altercation transpired, during which Petitioner fired three shots. One bullet struck a different occupant, Antonio Woods. After a brief struggle, one of the men involved gained possession of the gun and then detained Petitioner until the police arrived shortly thereafter. Petitioner was charged with seven crimes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   including two counts of first degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the trial judge instructed the jury, the prosecutor and Petitioner's counsel reviewed the jury instructions with the judge. During those discussions, Petitioner's counsel objected to the State's request for instructions on accomplice liability, conspiracy, and a special instruction related to the castle doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the trial judge instructed the jury on the law, particularly as it pertained to second degree assault:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Second degree assault. There are two ways that you can commit a second degree assault. One is, intent to frighten. Assault is intentionally frightening another person with the threat of immediate offensive physical contact or physical harm. In order to convict the defendant of assault, the State must prove, number one, that the defendant committed an act with the intent to place Andre French and/or Antonio\n   Woods in fear of immediate offensive physical contact or physical harm. That the defendant had the apparent ability at that time to bring about the offensive physical contact or physical harm. And three, that Andre French and/or Antonio Woods reasonably feared immediate offensive physical contact or physical harm and that the defendant's actions were not legally justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Battery. Assault is also causing offensive physical contact to another person. In order to convict the defendant of assault under [a] battery theory, the State must prove that the defendant caused offensive physical contact or physical harm to Andre French and/or Antonio Woods. That the contact [was] the result of an\n   intentional or reckless act of the defendant and was not accidental. And three, that the contact was not consented to by Andre French and/or Antonio Woods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the reading of the jury instructions, the judge called the attorneys to the bench and asked if they took \"any exception to the court.\" The prosecutor took no exceptions. Petitioner's attorney renewed the previous objections as well as noted a new exception to the assault instruction, and the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The defense would now like to reiterate our previous objections and object to the alternative instruction on assault and that it's possible that six jurors could go with one theory, six could go with another, and there would not be a unanimous verdict for him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Six could go with one and six could go with the other?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Or some other division of jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Exceptions noted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After deliberations, the jury found Petitioner guilty of two counts of first degree assault as well as the remaining counts against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   on the following question, slightly rephrased from the question submitted to this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Are intent to frighten and battery separate assault crimes, thus requiring individualized jury unanimity?\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Watts v.

After the trial judge had instructed the jury, Petitioner's counsel explained at a bench conference that the jury could possibly split its decision with regard to the assault\n   crime, with half of the jury believing that Petitioner had committed a battery and the other half believing Petitioner had intentionally frightened the occupants.\n   Thus, there would be a lack of jury unanimity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Maryland Rule 4-325(e) governs the preservation of error in jury instructions and states, in pertinent part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We have explained that the purpose of Rule 4-325(e) is \"to give the trial court an opportunity to correct its charge if it deems correction necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Gore v.

During the bench conference after the delivery of jury instructions, Petitioner's counsel engaged in a brief back-and-forth with the trial judge at which time Petitioner's counsel renewed an earlier objection and noted a new objection, stating as the basis that the jury might not have a unanimous verdict for assault because \"six jurors could go with one theory, six could\n   go with another.\" If the trial judge lacked clarity about counsel's objection, the record does not reflect it.

Petitioner contends that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree to the means of committing second degree assault. Petitioner urges this Court to conclude that assault and battery are distinct and separate crimes, and therefore the jury instruction should have required a unanimous consensus as to whether the defendant committed assault by battery or intent to frighten.

The inclusion of the Committee Note as part of the final House Bill that was enacted as Chapter 632 reflects the General Assembly's intention to draw a parallel between the assault statute and the burglary statute as well as its intention to rely on case law to clarify the meaning of second degree assault. Based upon our interpretation of the legislative material supporting the enactment of the assault statute in Chapter 632, this Court is persuaded that the General Assembly intended to codify a singular crime, second degree assault, which may be committed through different modalities. The current language of Crim.

As we previously noted, the General Assembly intended for the changes to the assault statute to be in lock-step with the changes to the theft statute. Like the theft statute, nothing in the plain language of Crim. Law Art., \u00a7 3-201(b) describes battery, attempted battery, or intent to frighten as separate\n   crimes. Similar to the revisions made to the theft statute, and its common law burglary counterpart, the General Assembly sought to simplify and consolidate the law of assault. Consistent with our interpretation of the theft statute in\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   , here the assault statute refers to a single crime, second degree assault, derived from what had previously been defined as \"battery,\" \"assault,\" and \"assault and battery\" in the common law. In 1996, the General Assembly simply codified what the Court of Special Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   had already recognized-that second degree assault is a single crime that could be committed via different modalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamb v.
