Severability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the conclusion that Section 9718(a)(3), in and of itself, does not implicate\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the issue of whether the statute is invalid under that decision is more complex, since other provisions of Section 9718 do offend the relevant constitutional norm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , 636 Pa. at 51-56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 660-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing Section 9718(a)(1) and concluding that the statute violates\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, to the degree that the unconstitutional provisions would be deemed non-severable, Section 9718 as a whole would be void as a consequence of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Significantly, the remaining question is not whether Section 9718(c) should be severed, as has been the issue in other cases. In those cases, Section 9718(c) operated as an unconstitutional requirement for sentencing judges to determine the aggravating facts delineated in subsection (a)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as discussed above, subsection (c) does not function in this fashion in relation to Section 9718(a)(3), given that subsection (a)(3) does not require any aggravating facts to be found. Thus, the relevant concern here is whether the unconstitutional provisions of Section 9718 -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those that do specify aggravating facts relative to other mandatory minimum sentences-may be severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this regard, these provisions, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), are presumptively severable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925 (prescribing, subject to enumerated exceptions, that \"[t]he provisions of every statute shall be severable\"). Severance should be withheld only if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected with the void provisions that it cannot be presumed that the legislature would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the voided ones; or (2) the remaining valid provisions standing alone are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accord with the intent of the General Assembly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172604\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/632/36/#p61\">\n    632 Pa. at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863226,12172604\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/117/247/\">\n    117 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   257 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the presumption of severability remains intact.

This Court's Decision in\n    <em>\n     Wolfe\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the above reasoning disposes of the issue presented on appeal, the Commonwealth also addresses language from this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , which this author wrote, disapproving of Section 9718 in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , 636 Pa. at 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e ... find that Section 9718 is irremediably unconstitutional on its face, non-severable, and void.\").

Accordingly, although\n    <em>\n     Wolfe's\n    </em>\n    substantive analysis applies to subsection (a)(1) as much today as at the time the decision was rendered, the reasoning does not extend to subsection (a)(3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-41\">\n   JUSTICE TODD, Concurring\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This is the third in a series of recent decisions by our Court interpreting the contours of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to have a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that increases his or her mandatory minimum sentence. Here, the fact of a conviction, which triggered the mandatory minimum sentence under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(3), was found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That being the case, Appellee's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. Therefore, I join the ultimate conclusion of the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (\"OAJC\") that Appellee is not entitled to relief. However, like Justice Dougherty, whose concurrence I join in full, I cannot accept the OAJC's attempt to distinguish our Court's prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in my view, the OAJC's flawed premise, that there is no \"aggravating fact\" in this case, OAJC at 20-21, creates a false distinction with\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . The \"fact\" of the underlying conviction\n   is the trigger for the mandatory minimum sentence, no different than the \"fact\" of the element of the underlying conviction in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   was the trigger for the mandatory minimum sentence in that case. In essence, to reach its result, the OAJC advances my dissenting approach in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , which was joined by Justice Dougherty, an analysis a majority of this Court therein rejected. As a result, in my view, like that of Justice Dougherty, the OAJC should not give continued life to our erroneous decision in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , but should overrule it. Thus, for the reasons set forth below, I respectfully concur only in the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   By way of background, in its 2013 decision in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of whether, under the Sixth Amendment, a conviction for using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, which carried a mandatory minimum five-year sentence, and which was increased to a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence if a firearm was \"brandished\" when committing the crime, required a jury, rather than a judge, to find the fact of brandishing.

Moreover, as an element of the offense, the factual predicate must be specifically alleged in the charging document, and the defendant has the right to have that fact determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Alleyne,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 2160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our Court first grappled with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   two years ago in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172604\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/632/36/#p61\">\n    632 Pa. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6863226,12172604\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/117/247/\">\n    117 A.3d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   , we considered the constitutionality of a sentence imposed upon a defendant for a conviction of delivery or possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, with a mandatory minimum to be applied when that offense was committed by a defendant who was over 18 years of age, and within 1,000 feet of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a school. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant\n   Kyle Hopkins urged that his mandatory minimum sentence under Section 6317 violated\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   as it was based upon facts-that the offender was over 18 years of age, and the proximity of the drug transaction to a school-that were not found by a jury, but rather by a judge pursuant to the \"proof-at-sentencing\" provisions in Section 6317(b). The Commonwealth, for its part, while conceding some sections of the sentencing statute were unconstitutional in light of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , nevertheless argued that those provisions were severable, and, thus, that the sentencing statute could still be enforced without them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Our Court reviewed Section 6317 and considered various provisions which, we found, were indeed unconstitutional after\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . We detailed that, in particular, the proof-at-sentencing provisions in Section 6317(b) were in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , highlighting (1) that it was the sentencing court, rather than a jury, that rendered a factual determination regarding the age of the offender and the proximity of the drug transaction to the school; (2) that the legislature intended that mandatory minimum provisions were not to constitute an element of the crime; (3) that notice of the application of the mandatory minimum sentence was not required prior to conviction; (4) that the relevant fact finding required only a preponderance of the evidence; and (5) that the Commonwealth's right to appeal the fact finding determination raised double jeopardy concerns. Thus, we concluded that the sentencing provisions were unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We then continued to the more difficult question of whether the statute could survive without these offensive provisions. We explained that, in determining the severability of a statute, the primary focus was on the legislative intent, and whether the statute, without the infirm provisions, could still function consistent with that intent. Further, we determined that the non-infirm provisions, standing alone, were incomplete and incapable of being carried out consistent with the intent of the General Assembly, especially the legislature's expression that the mandatory minimum sentencing triggers were not to be considered elements of a crime and that it did not intend Section 6317 to constitute a new\n   aggravated offense. As our Court concluded that the statute could not survive without the invalid portions, we struck Section 6317 as violative of the Sixth Amendment and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   One year after our decision in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   , our Court again explored the contours of a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , the Court was faced with another mandatory minimum sentence, containing the same proof-at-sentencing provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , the sentence was not based upon a fact divorced from the underlying conviction; instead, the triggering fact was an element of the underlying crime. Specifically, Matthew Wolfe was convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (\"IDSI\") where the victim was less than 16 years of age. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123(a)(7). Section 9718(a)(1) of the Sentencing Code, similar to Section 6317(a) at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   , requires imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence for a variety of crimes where the victims are less than 16 years of age, including IDSI crimes. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(1). Therefore, given this overlap in the age requirement in the offense as well as the mandatory sentencing trigger, the fact that triggered the mandatory minimum sentence was also the fact that served as the basis of the underlying conviction. Thus, this fact was (1) stated in the information; (2) an element of the offense; (3) found by a jury; and (4) found beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Wolfe enjoyed his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of this fact which served as the trigger for the mandatory minimum sentence, and all of the other requirements of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   were satisfied. Nevertheless, in a 4-2 decision, the\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   majority found the entirety of Section 9718 to be unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   majority, instead of focusing on whether there was a constitutional violation, began with an examination of the sentencing statute and its similarities to the sentencing statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   . It initially set forth its premise that Section 9718\"plainly and explicitly require[s] judicial fact-finding in its subsection (c).\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   660-61 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(c) (\"The applicability of this section shall be determined at sentencing ... by a preponderance of the evidence.\") ). The majority continued that \"subsection (c) is integral to the statute,\" rejecting the Commonwealth's assertion that subsection 9718(c) can be deemed to be \"moot, dormant, or irrelevant-or can be otherwise disregarded or overlooked.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, the majority explained that the remainder of the sentencing statute could not be severed from its infirm proof-at-sentencing provisions. Thus, the core of the majority's analysis was that a mandatory minimum sentence implemented by proof-at-sentencing provisions, such as those found in Section 9718(c), was unconstitutional in its entirety because it was incapable of severance. While acknowledging the anomaly that the age of the victim was, in fact, an element of the underlying crime, and thus found by the jury, the majority nevertheless offered that the mandatory minimum statute must be regarded as creating a \"distinct and aggravated crime,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2163 ), such that judicial fact finding is nonetheless required: \"although the jury at Appellee's trial plainly decided that the victim was under sixteen years of age, the sentencing court was bound to make its own determination at sentencing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(c), but it could not do so in a manner consistent with the Sixth Amendment to the United States\n   Constitution, on account of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Therefore, in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , although a jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was under the age of 16, the majority explained that, because the sentencing court was also required to make that redundant determination at sentencing, imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. Indeed, the majority emphasized its broad holding stating that, \"[b]ecause\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   invalidates material requirements of this statute, and because those provisions are non-severable per\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    the statute simply cannot be enforced by the judiciary in any respect\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 662 n.6 (emphasis added), and ultimately concluding that \" Section 9718 is irremediably unconstitutional on its face, non-severable, and void,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In my dissent, joined by Justice Dougherty, I pursued a distinct analytical tack.\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Todd, J., dissenting). Rather than starting with the sentencing statute, the dissenters first asked whether Wolfe's constitutional rights had been violated. In that regard, the dissenters observed that the fact which triggered the mandatory minimum sentence was not an extra or independent fact, as in\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   , but, rather, was already an element of the underlying criminal offense, listed in the information, and found by a jury. For this foundational reason, it was self-evident, in our view, that\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   was not implicated, and that Wolfe's constitutional rights were not violated. Furthermore, the dissenters disputed the\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   majority's assertion that, even though a jury found \"in the abstract\" the charged element beyond a reasonable doubt,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nevertheless, a sentencing judge was also required to find the same fact by a lesser burden of proof, thus, violating Wolfe's Sixth Amendment rights. The dissenters observed that there was no support in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   for the majority's ill-founded theory that the Sixth Amendment could be violated simply because a sentencing judge\n   <em>\n    redundantly\n   </em>\n   found a fact already found by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the dissenters offered that, even if Section 9718 were infirm, the harmless error doctrine should apply, as embraced by numerous state and federal courts. This, according to the dissenters, was especially appropriate, as the jury actually found beyond a reasonable doubt the fact triggering the mandatory minimum sentence. The majority, however, rejected the dissenters' proffer, admonishing that \"a finding of harmless error would sanction a residual longevity in small segments of an unseverable statute requiring unconstitutional actions on the part of judicial officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 662 n.6. In short, in the view of the dissenters, the majority erred by finding the mandatory minimum statute to be infirm without first identifying the foundational constitutional violation to which Appellee was subjected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the final installment of this trilogy, the mandatory minimum sentence at issue-imposed pursuant to the very same statute that was the focus in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   -was triggered by a fact already found by the jury, the\n   <em>\n    underlying conviction itself\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(3). Moreover, the same proof-at-sentencing provisions that served as the foundation for the majority's rejection of relief in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , Section 9718(c), are again at issue here. Yet, despite these seemingly dispositive similarities, the OAJC-rather than acting consistent with\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   and finding that, because the proof-at-sentencing provisions are void as found in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , and, thus, that Appellee is entitled to relief-curiously attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, the OAJC,\n   <em>\n    sub silento\n   </em>\n   , adopts the dissenters' approach in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, it is noteworthy that the OAJC does not begin its analysis with an assessment of the viability of the proof-at-sentencing provisions, as the majority did in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . Rather, like the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , the OAJC first, and appropriately, considers whether Appellee's Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Next, the foundation to the OAJC's analysis is essentially that the underlying conviction that triggers the mandatory minimum is not an\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   \"fact,\" whereas, by contrast, the age-of-victim element at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   was an\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OAJC at 20 (finding \"subsection (a)(3) requires no proof of any predicate or aggravating facts.\"). This foundation is faulty. There is no apparent difference between an underlying conviction serving as a trigger for a mandatory minimum sentence, and the subset thereof of an element of the underlying crime serving as a trigger. While the Supreme Court has not provided a definition of what constitutes an\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   fact, the clear import of its decisions in this area is that any trigger for a mandatory minimum sentence must be found by a jury. Indisputably, both the underlying conviction here, and the underlying element in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the age of the victim), triggering Section 9718's mandatory minimum sentences, were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, thereby satisfying\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the OAJC's assertion that the underlying conviction at issue in this matter \"is itself a contemporaneous jury determination, and the concern of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   is with sentencing enhancements tied to facts to be determined by a judge at sentencing,\" OAJC at 21, is equally applicable to the age-of-victim element which the jury found in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . Yet, somehow, a constitutional violation was found in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , but, no violation is found in the OAJC. It is in my view, entirely illogical for the OAJC to come to the result it reaches today, but keep\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Further, the OAJC jettisons the primary rationale used in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   -that Section 9718(c) requires judicial fact finding in violation of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   -by now asserting that Section 9718(c)'s proof-at-sentencing provisions are mere redundancies, again adopting the logic of the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   majority explicitly recognized the anomaly that the age-of-victim determination was an element of the underlying offense; yet, it found that that fact did not alter its \"core assessment\" that Section 9718 created a \"distinct and aggravated crime\" and that the \"statute's directive for judicial fact-finding attaches to that aggravated crime notwithstanding a jury verdict; and that sentencing judges are not free to disregard such explicit legislative mandates by substituting their own procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   dissenters explicitly challenged this concern regarding redundant fact finding, noting that \"the [\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ] majority cites nothing to suggest the\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   Court was concerned about a judge making factual findings redundant to those of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Todd, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the majority's conclusion that Wolfe's \"Sixth Amendment jury trial rights were nonetheless impaired because a sentencing judge redundantly found this same fact by a lesser burden of proof\").

Yet, herein, the OAJC dismisses the same proof-at-sentencing provisions as merely \"awkward\" or \"superfluous,\" and contends that \"no proof of any facts is required at sentencing.\" OAJC at 21. The OAJC thus transforms the \"core\" defects in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   into mere gratuities today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, the OAJC's severance analysis is irreconcilable with that employed in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . The OAJC individually dissects the various subsections of Section 9718-(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) -to see if they are inseparably connected, and ultimately able to survive constitutional infirmity. This approach, however, is in direct conflict with\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , which, as noted above, looked at the entire statute and struck it in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794555,12279979\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/651/\">\n    140 A.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \" Section 9718 is irremediably unconstitutional on its face, non-severable, and void\"). Indeed, the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   offered the very same individualized approach taken by the OAJC today, distinguishing the other criminal offenses referred to in Section 9718, and calling out the very subsection we address today:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   While the triggering fact for the mandatory minimum sentence under Section 9718 is, in this case, the same fact that is an element of the underlying criminal offense at Section 3123(a)(7), the vast majority of other criminal offenses referred to in Section 9718 follow the factual situation which gave rise to\n   <em>\n    Alleyne,\n   </em>\n   in that the fact that triggers the mandatory minimum sentence is independent of the facts constituting the elements of the underlying criminal offense. Indeed, of the 21 criminal offenses referenced in Section 9718(a)(1) and (2), only three, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123(a)(7), (b) and (c), subsume the same factual predicate as that required for imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence. Additionally, I note that the convictions themselves of four offenses, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 121(c) and (d), 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125(a)(7), and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125(b), serve as the necessary trigger for the mandatory minimum sentences provided in Section 9718(a)(3). Respecting this last situation, the issue of the validity under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   of a mandatory minimum sentence imposed simply on the basis of the conviction of an underlying crime is raised in a petition for allowance of appeal that is currently before our Court in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

On the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Wolfe's\n   </em>\n   all-encompassing approach was unmistakable. Perhaps acknowledging the same, the OAJC continues that, \"even if the relevant references to Section 9718 as a whole were not\n   <em>\n    dictum\n   </em>\n   , the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   does not apply to pronouncements that are not adequately supported in reason.\" OAJC at 22. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, but the OAJC's concession is too narrow. Its\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rewrite of\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   is unsupportable-we should either continue to follow\n   <em>\n    Wolfe's\n   </em>\n   misguided construct and grant relief, or overrule that decision\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   . Given that there is no constitutional violation to correct here (nor was there in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   ), the law commands the latter. Indeed, it is seldom that we are so rapidly confronted with the error of a decision.

Today we correctly hold appellee's right to a jury trial was satisfied because judicial fact-finding was unnecessary, but the same was true in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   . Wolfe was convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123(a)(7), an element of which is that the complainant is under sixteen years of age. Wolfe was then sentenced under Section 9718(a)(1) which provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than ten years for those convicted under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123 when the victim is under sixteen years of age. This \"additional fact\" of the age of the victim was found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury in Wolfe's case and thus judicial fact-finding was unnecessary regardless of the \"proof at sentencing\" provision found at Section 9718(c).

Section 9718(c) of the sentencing statute provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Proof at sentencing.-\n   </strong>\n   the provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime and notice of the provisions of this section to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction, but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth's intention to proceed under this section shall be provided after conviction and before sentencing.

This or similar language has been the subject of scrutiny in this Commonwealth since the decision in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne v.

I have maintained my personal view that statutes with the above language may be applied in certain situations, notwithstanding the language that deems sentencing enhancing facts as non-elements and directs the sentencing courts to find these non-elemental facts by a preponderance of the evidence, without running afoul of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . However, as a matter of adhering to this Court's precedent regarding mandatory minimum sentencing schemes in Pennsylvania, I would conclude Resto's judgment of sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing. Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court held that pursuant to the rights afforded under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, any fact which by law increases the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is an element of the offense and therefore must be, inter alia, submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Simply put, sentencing statutes may no longer tie the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence to a fact found by a sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence. Following the\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   decision, the courts of this Commonwealth were tasked with how to reconcile the new rule with a number of similarly-patterned Pennsylvania sentencing statutes that direct the sentencing court to impose a mandatory minimum sentence if it finds an operative fact by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9713.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Matteson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928431\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/96/1064/\">\n    96 A.3d 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2014), the Superior Court considered the post-\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   constitutional viability of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9718(a)(3), the sentencing statute at issue in this case. The court concluded the mandatory minimum sentence could withstand an\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   challenge because \"the jury specifically found the element required to impose the mandatory minimum sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Matteson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928431\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/96/1064/\">\n    96 A.3d at 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Implicit in the panel's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Matteson\n   </em>\n   is the notion that the statute could be applied without regard to the procedure the Legislature crafted that required the essential fact be found at sentencing, by a preponderance of the evidence, and defining the fact as a sentencing factor rather than as an element of the underlying offense.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Seemingly, then, the relevant inquiry appeared to center on whether there was a violation of the\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   rule as applied to each defendant, i.e., whether it was necessary for the sentencing court to find the operative fact or whether it had been conceded by the defendant or otherwise found by the jury and not specifically on the statutorily proscribed procedure at sentencing.

Our analysis led us to decidedly endorse the severance rationale employed in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   . Hopkins was convicted of possession with intent to deliver and sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of two years' imprisonment pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a), based on a judicial finding that the drug offense occurred within 1,000 feet of a school. As with other sentencing statutes rendered void under\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , Section 6317 provided \"[t]he provisions of this section shall not be an element of the crime....

This Court held that the provisions specifying the proximity of the drug transaction to the school and the age of the defendant did not offend\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ; however, the remainder of the statute, given the Legislature's clear intent that it was a sentencing statute, was invalid and could not be severed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, as detailed above, we find that numerous provisions of Section 6317 are unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . After\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   , these aspects of the statute-that the provisions are declared not to be elements of the offense, that notice is not required prior to conviction, that factfinding is conducted at sentencing, that the sentencing court performs factfinding, that the applicable standard is preponderance of the evidence, and that the Commonwealth has the right to appeal where the imposed sentence was found to be in violation of the statute-are now infirm. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [T]he General Assembly has unambiguously expressed its intent regarding the nature of this mandatory minimum sentencing statute: it is a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     sentencing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   statute.... Yet, virtually every provision of Section 6317 enacted by the legislature to effectuate this intent runs afoul of the notice, jury trial, burden of proof, and post-trial rights of the accused after\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   . These provisions are elaborate, express, and detailed, and are no mere add ons, but, rather, are prominent and central features of the statute. In contemplating the significant rights that come with the United States Supreme Court's marked transformation of sentencing factors into elements of a new aggravated offense, and the resulting evisceration of essential aspects of Section 6317, we find that the unoffending provisions of this statute-the proximity and age requirements-standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth posited, broadly, that there was no violation of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   in the first instance because Section 9718(a) standing alone, could operate to impose the sentence without consideration of the other violative provisions based on the triggering fact being an element of the offense.
