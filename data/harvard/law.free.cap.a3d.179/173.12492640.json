At issue in this appeal is whether a family court may, after concluding that a custodial parent's relocation constitutes an unanticipated change in circumstances, maintain physical rights and responsibilities with that parent but then decline to modify parent-child contact, effectively barring the custodial parent from moving because it determined that the move is not in the child's best interests. Custodial mother appeals the family court's denial of her motion to modify parent-child contact to facilitate her relocation with the child. We conclude that the family court applied the wrong framework in evaluating mother's motion, and reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The family court found the following facts. Mother and father have one child together, born in January 2007, but were never married. When the parties separated in 2007, they entered into a stipulation and final order regarding parental rights and responsibilities. The order provided that the parties would share legal rights and responsibilities and mother would have sole physical rights and responsibilities. It also provided that father would have \"daily contact by agreement\" with their child, and that vacations and holidays would be determined by agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Following the parents' separation, they continued living together until 2011. After the parents started living separately, the child spent most nights with mother but continued to have almost daily contact with father. For example, father would often pick the child up in the mornings to go to school. Father also had the child overnight on Fridays and Sundays; the child stayed with the maternal grandmother on Saturday nights and with mother the rest of the week. The child has a close relationship with both parents, and mother and father each testified that the other was a good parent. In addition, the court found that the child had many relatives in Vermont, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, with whom the child has close relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In January 2015, mother married her partner whom she met in Vermont in 2010 and who now lives in Staten Island, New York. Soon thereafter, mother lost her job; she has been unemployed ever since. The parties testified that father began spending less time with the child after mother got married and lost her job, but\n   father continued having the child overnights on Fridays and Sundays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In April 2016, mother filed a motion to modify parent-child contact and legal rights and responsibilities, announcing her intent to move to Staten Island to live with her spouse. Mother asked the court to issue an order that would permit her to relocate to New York with the child and to establish a new parent-child contact order. She also requested that the court grant her sole legal rights and responsibilities, citing a breakdown in communication between the parents since her marriage, father's refusal to attend mediation, and the impracticality of sharing legal rights if she moved to New York. Mother proposed an alternate parent-child contact schedule that would allow father to have the child every other weekend and two weeks in the summer, plus half of the child's school vacations. Father opposed mother's motions, and requested that the court modify physical rights and responsibilities and award them to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The family court held a hearing in August 2016. In its findings and order, the family court first found that mother's marriage to someone who lived in New York City constituted a change in circumstances. Considering the best-interest factors, the court determined that the majority of them did not favor granting either parent sole rights and responsibilities. It determined that the fourth and seventh factors favored father. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b)(4), (7). The fourth statutory factor considers \"the quality of the child's adjustment to the child's present housing, school, and community and the potential effect of any change.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 665(b)(4). The court determined that all of the child's relatives lived in Vermont and thus the child's ability to spend time with them would be greatly reduced, that a move from Vermont to an apartment in Staten Island would be a \"dramatic change,\" and that the reduction in time with father would affect the child's relationship with him. The seventh factor considers \"the relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 665(b)(7). The court concluded that if the child moved with mother, the child's contact with father as well as other family members and friends would be greatly reduced, which would not be in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. However, the court determined that the sixth statutory factor favored mother. That factor considers \"the quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider, if appropriate given the child's age and development.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 665(b)(6). The court noted that father was engaged in the child's life and that the child was close to both parents. However, it concluded that, \"[b]ased solely on the amount of time [the child] spends with each parent,\" mother was the child's primary caregiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. The court then opined that mother's proposal to move the child to New York would reduce parent-child contact with father by over fifty percent, would require the child to spend twelve to fourteen hours in the car visiting father every other weekend, and would take the child away from family and friends in Vermont. Accordingly, the court concluded that the move was \"clearly not in [the child's] best interest.\" Furthermore, the court concluded that it was in the child's best interest that the parents \"continue to share legal parental rights and responsibilities, and that [mother] retain physical rights and responsibilities subject to [father's] rights to parent child contact as previously ordered.\" The court therefore denied mother's motion to modify father's parent-child contact, stating that the original final order would remain in place and that \"substantial\n   changes to [the child's] residence must be by mutual agreement of the parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. On appeal, mother raises three primary arguments. First, she argues that the family court was required to modify legal rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact once it concluded that there was a substantial change in circumstances. Second, she argues that the court failed to give sufficient weight to her role as the primary caregiver with sole physical rights and responsibilities. Third, she argues that some of the court's factual findings were not supported by the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the court failed to apply the proper analysis when it awarded mother physical rights and responsibilities but then essentially ordered her to remain in Vermont with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. The family court \"has broad discretion both in assessing whether there has been a change in circumstances and in evaluating what parenting arrangement is in a child's best interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Wener v. Wener\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454571\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/203/582/\">\n    2016 VT 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454571\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/203/582/\">\n    203 Vt. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454571\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/203/582/\">\n    157 A.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Skoglund, J., concurring and dissenting). The court's factual findings must stand unless, \"viewing the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and excluding the effect of modifying evidence, there is no credible evidence to support the findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Sochin v. Sochin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    2005 VT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    178 Vt. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    872 A.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.)

We uphold the court's legal conclusions if \"they are supported by its findings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. When considering a motion to modify legal or physical rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact, the family court must follow a two-step analysis. First, the moving party must show that there is a \"real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances.\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 668(a) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Sochin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    2005 VT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    178 Vt. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    872 A.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the party meets that burden, the court may modify legal and/or physical rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact \"if it is in the best interests of the child.\" 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 668(a). In determining the best interests of a child, the court considers the nine factors listed in 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 665(b).\n   <em>\n    Sochin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    2005 VT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    178 Vt. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3363077\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/178/535/\">\n    872 A.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Although the family court has great discretion in this area, its authority is not boundless.

Our caselaw establishes that, in the face of a relocation that amounts to a change in circumstances, and when there are competing requests for physical rights and responsibilities,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the family court must\n   determine, in light of the proposed move, which custodian and parent-child contact schedule will serve the child's best interests, not whether the move itself is in the child's best interests. The court may not determine that it is in the child's best interests to remain with the custodial parent but restrict the custodial parent's ability to relocate with the child. We rely on two main cases to support these propositions:\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    158 Vt. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    614 A.2d 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    McCart v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , we confronted the issue presented in this case. The mother was originally awarded sole physical and legal rights and responsibilities and later announced her intention to move out of state with the children for the purpose of attending law school.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    158 Vt. at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    614 A.2d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The father then moved to modify, asking the court to award him custody. The family court concluded that the mother should remain the custodian, but that the move was not in the children's best interests, and ordered that the mother must live within a four-hour drive of the father.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    . at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    614 A.2d at 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We explained, \"[b]ecause of the impracticality of substituting the judgment of a court for that of the custodial parent, a court must employ some level of deference when evaluating lifestyle decisions affecting childrearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    . at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    614 A.2d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We acknowledged that a custodial parent's relocation might adversely impact a noncustodial parent's contact with the child, but concluded that the general policy favoring the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact between the child and both parents \"does not supersede the custodial parent's reasonable decision to relocate\" or \"overshadow\n   the proper role of the custodial parent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    . at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840351\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/489/#p495\">\n    614 A.2d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18.

In that case, the mother was initially awarded sole physical and legal rights and responsibilities. Two years after the final divorce, she informed the father that she planned to move with the children to New Mexico, where her fianc\u00e9 was employed. The father sought to modify the final divorce judgment to obtain sole legal and physical rights and responsibilities. After a hearing, the court concluded that the mother's move represented a substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances. The court found that the best-interest factors were closely balanced, but on the whole favored maintaining custody with the mother. However, the court concluded that the mother's reasons for moving to New Mexico were trivial compared to the substantial loss the children would suffer as a result of their separation from the father, and entered an order preventing the mother from moving to New Mexico with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , this Court explained that the trial court should have determined the appropriate custodial parent in light of the move. We stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If the court concludes that the best interests of the children would be better served by continuing to live with the custodial parent in the new location rather than with the noncustodial parent in Vermont, the motion to modify must be denied.

However much one may sympathize with the court's desire to maintain the family unit, it could not substitute its judgment for that of the custodial parent. Having found, on balance, that the children's best interests lay with maintaining custody in mother, the court abused its discretion in prohibiting the move rather than denying the motion. Of course, the court remains free on remand to modify the visitation or child support schedules to accommodate any additional costs or burdens occasioned by [the] mother's relocation to New Mexico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548936\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/166/629/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20. In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McCart\n   </em>\n   , the family court erred by focusing on whether the move was in the child's best interests, and effectively prohibiting mother from moving with the child when it concluded that it was not. The court's framework and process for considering this case, although largely consistent with the way the parties framed it, was not consistent with the applicable statutes and our caselaw which call for a determination of whether the movant has shown a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances, an assignment of physical rights and responsibilities in the event of changed circumstances, and the development of a parent-child contact schedule that serves the child's best interests in light of the custodial assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21.

Next, the court should have determined whether the child's best interests would be optimally served by transferring physical rights and responsibilities to father. In making this assessment, the court should be mindful of our admonition that \"when a\n   <em>\n    noncustodial\n   </em>\n   parent seeks a change in custody based solely on the\n   <em>\n    custodial\n   </em>\n   parent's decision to relocate, the moving party faces a high hurdle in justifying the 'violent dislocation' of a change in custody from one parent to the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Hoover v.

However, the proposed move may be highly relevant to the best-interests analysis, and its negative impact on the child's best interests could outweigh the benefits of continuity with his primary caregiver. But the determination of which parent should be awarded physical rights and responsibilities in light of the relocation, rather than whether the relocation itself is in the child's bests interests, should drive the court's analysis. In addition to considering the child's relationship with the primary caregiver, the court may also consider the relative stability, relationships, and opportunities available to the child in each of the alternative living situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23.

Finally, the court should have fashioned a parent-child contact order that would serve the child's best interests, in light of its determination that physical rights and responsibilities should remain with mother. See 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 664(2) (\" 'Parent child contact' means the right of a parent who does not have physical responsibility to have visitation with the child.\"). If the court assigned physical rights and responsibilities to father, it would be charged with ordering a parent-child contact schedule that would ensure continued contact between mother and the child. If the court denied father's motion to transfer physical rights and responsibilities to him, it could not, under the rubric of a parent-child contact order, prevent mother from exercising the authority-including deciding where she and the child reside together-associated with physical rights and responsibilities. Although the noncustodial parent is entitled to substantial parent-child contact in the child's best interests, 15 V.S.A. \u00a7 650, the court could not maintain the existing parent-child contact order if doing so would prevent mother from relocating with the child even though it had ordered that she retain physical rights and responsibilities.

I agree with the majority that the family court should have modified the parties' current parental rights and responsibilities in response to mother's intended relocation rather than maintain those rights and responsibilities based on its conclusion that the relocation is not in their child's best interests. Accordingly, I concur with the majority's legal analysis and mandate.

The way the family court resolved the parties' motions is understandable, given the circumstances of this case and how the parties' framed their dispute. The evidence presented at the motion hearing focused on whether mother's intended move was in the best interests of the parties' son, and mother was noncommittal when father's attorney, and then the court, questioned her as to whether she would move if the court were inclined to determine that the move was not in the boy's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 28. Father presented the testimony of relatives to establish that the parties' son had close relationships with members of father's extended family living close by in Vermont, where the boy had spent his entire life. The court found that the child \"has a very close relationship with his aunts, uncles, and cousins who all live in the area,\" and concluded that moving the boy \"from a loving, stable environment where he has lived for his entire life surrounded by a close knit group of family and friends to a large city where he only knows [mother] and her husband is not in [his] best interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 29. In contrast, with respect to mother and her husband, the court found that, except for the husband's month-long business trip to Las Vegas in January 2015 when he and mother got married, the two had \"not resided together for more than a few days at a time.\" The court also found that plaintiff and her husband \"had some rocky patches\" before being married and \"took a break\" from their relationship for several months; that mother's husband had been living in New York since 2013; that the parties' son had been to New York with mother to visit her husband on only two occasions since the two were married; that the child had had \"face to face contact\" with the husband only \"a few times\"; and that mother \"would need to\n   rely completely on [her husband] to do her share of any transportation required to facilitate parent-child contact\" because she did not drive due to anxiety. These were some of the facts that, in concert with how the parties framed the issue, led the court to focus on whether mother's intended relocation was in the best interests of the parties' child rather than on whether, given the intended relocation, the best interests of the child warranted transferring physical parental rights and responsibilities to father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 30. As the majority correctly concludes, notwithstanding how the parties framed their dispute at the motion hearing, the family court should have determined how to modify parental rights and responsibilities in light of mother's intended relocation-whether to transfer physical responsibility to father or whether to maintain that responsibility with mother.

In contrast, in this case, the parties share legal rights and responsibilities, and neither the family court nor the majority has modified that aspect of the parentage order. That is noteworthy because in past cases we have upheld the family court's transfer of physical rights and responsibilities to the parent remaining in Vermont, based on a consideration of the child's best interests, in situations where that parent shared legal rights and responsibilities with the parent seeking to relocate.

Moreover, although mother was awarded sole physical parental rights and responsibilities, her attorney, in explaining to the court mother's interest in fostering an ongoing relationship between father and the parties' son, stated that mother \"has honored a shared parenting paradigm.\" Cf.\n   <em>\n    Sochin v.

That the parties have shared legal responsibility and possibly a de facto shared custodial arrangement should be key factors in the family court's assessment of the motions to modify stemming from mother's intended relocation. Thus, on remand, the family court should take into account the parties' current parental rights and responsibilities when considering the effect any modification would have on the child's stability, family relationships,\n   and opportunities in the alternative living arrangements.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
