Code (Repl. Vol. 2012) \u00a7 22-119 of the Land Use Article (\"Land Use\"). The parties to this appeal are Precision Small Engines (\"PSE\"), a tenant to the\n   property at 9651 Baltimore Avenue, College Park, and the owners of the property, Gregory Hnarakis and Thomas Stokes (collectively \"Petitioners\"), and the County and the City (collectively \"Respondents\"). The parties contest the County's zoning authority, outlined in Prince George's County Code \u00a7\u00a7 27-253, 4-352(a), and the City's authority under Maryland Code (Repl. Vol. 2013) 5-211 of the Local Government Article (\"Local Gov't\"). We must determine whether the Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") between the County and the City altered the City's authority to enforce zoning violations within the limits of its municipality. For reasons to be explained, we hold that the MOU does not alter the City's authority, and that the MOU permitted the City to require additional permits under the City Building Code. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioners initially challenged citations issued by the City in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Prince George's County. PSE and other occupants of shared property received citations after failing to obtain required City permits. PSE challenged its fines, arguing that portions of the MOU prohibited the City from issuing any occupancy and building permits, including permits authorized under the City Code. On this basis, some, but not all, of the fines were dismissed. Hnarakis employed the same argument, but it was not successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 1, 2014, while the disputes were still pending before the District Court for Prince George's County, Petitioners filed an action for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. Petitioners sought a declaration that the terms of the MOU restricted the City from requiring City non-residential occupancy or building permits where occupants previously obtained use and occupancy, or building permits, from the County. Respondents filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on December 4, 2015. On February 18, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a Memorandum Opinion and Order, issued May 24, 2016, the circuit court decided that the MOU restricted the City from requiring owners or occupants of non-residential properties within the municipal corporate limits to obtain non-residential occupancy permits issued by the City, where such persons have obtained County use and occupancy permits. The court also determined that the MOU restricted the City from requiring owners or occupants of non-residential property within the municipal corporate limits to obtain building, grading, or other construction permits from the City, where persons have obtained permits from the Department of Permits, Inspection, and Enforcement. The circuit court opined that the City's and County's permits virtually serve the same purpose, and the only difference between the permits is that the City permit must be renewed annually after re-inspection, whereas the County permit is issued upon changes in property use or occupancy. However, the circuit court held that the City could\n   exercise its police powers for the purpose of health, safety, and welfare, including annual inspections, and any other purpose not specifically addressed in the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Respondents noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals issued a reported opinion on June 6, 2017, reversing the circuit court's decision. The court reasoned that the plain language of the MOU clearly dictated that the City did not give up any of its power to adopt and enforce its own building code, or its own health, safety,\n   and welfare regulations.\n   <em>\n    City of Coll.

The City is granted enactment power pursuant to several statutes, including Local Gov't \u00a7 5-211. Under these statutes, the City may enact regulations that control the issuance of permits. The MOU only controls power that the County delegated to the City, not power that originates from other sources of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sources of Zoning Authority\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Land Use \u00a7 22-104, the County Council for Prince George's County, sitting as the District Council, may\n   adopt and amend the County's zoning laws. A zoning law under Land Use \u00a7 14-101(q)(1)(2) is defined as, \"the legislative implementation of regulations for zoning by a local jurisdiction [and] includes a zoning ordinance, zoning regulation, zoning code, and any similar legislative action to implement zoning controls in a local jurisdiction.\" Pursuant to that power, the County adopted Subtitle 27 of the Prince George's County Code, which regulates all zoning matters, including use and occupancy permits.

Beyond the authority granted by Land Use \u00a7 22-104, Land Use \u00a7 22-119(b) describes the requirements needed before a municipality may exercise its jurisdiction. Under \u00a7 22-119(b), a municipality must enter into an agreement with the County, which must outline the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) the method by which the county will be advised of citations issued by a municipal inspector;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) the responsibility of the municipal corporation or the county to prosecute violations cited by the municipal corporation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (3) the disposition of fines imposed for violations cited by the municipal corporation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (4) the resolution of disagreements between the municipal corporation and the county about the interpretation of zoning laws; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (5) any other matter that the district council considers necessary for the proper exercise of the authority granted by this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Land Use \u00a7 22-119. The agreement between the County and the City is typically in the form of a MOU, and must sufficiently describe the powers granted to, and the limitations imposed upon the City in enforcing County zoning laws. Once entered, the MOU grants a municipality the power to exercise enforcement authority equal to that of the County. In this case, the County and the City entered into a valid MOU, discussed in detail\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City also derives its powers to enact local regulations from Local Gov't \u00a7\u00a7 5-211, 5-202 and 5-209. Pursuant to Local Gov't \u00a7 5-211, a municipality may enact regulations relating to the erection of buildings and signage, and may enact a building code and regulations which relate to occupancy and use permits. Additionally, the City can require inspections of property under this Article. Local Gov't \u00a7 5-202 empowers a municipality to adopt ordinances designed to protect \"personal property from damage and destruction\" as well as for the protection of \"the health, comfort, and convenience of the residents of the municipality.\" Local Gov't \u00a7 5-202. Finally, Local Gov't \u00a7 5-209 permits a municipality to regulate certain health hazards or other nuisances that may cause unsanitary conditions or conditions detrimental to health. Local Gov't \u00a7 5-209. Pursuant to the authority derived therefrom, the City adopted an ordinance regulating use and occupancy permits. Under the City ordinance, any rented residential property or any non-residential property that is required to get a County Use permit must also obtain a City use and occupancy permit. Coll. Park, Md., City Code \u00a7 144 (1966).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Parameters of the MOU\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Pursuant to Local Gov't \u00a7 22-119, the County Council unanimously approved the MOU on October 22, 2002. On November 19, 2002, the City Council unanimously ratified the MOU, which remains in effect. The MOU provides that the agreement is to run from year to year extending automatically at the conclusion of each term. Either party can void the MOU at the conclusion of a given term. The following provisions of the MOU are relevant to the instant dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Paragraph 1(a) requires the City to enforce the zoning laws effective as of December 1, 2002.

Successive paragraphs require the City to file copies of violations with the County, enforce zoning laws consistent with the plain language of the Code, and consult with the County Attorney to ensure consistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City's authority to regulate zoning matters is reserved by various sources of City and State law. Petitioners rely on isolated portions of the MOU, and assert that the MOU, along with the statutory requirements under \u00a7 22-119 of the Land Use Article, does not empower the City to adopt its own zoning regulations. Petitioners ask us to reverse the Court of Special Appeals, and follow the analysis outlined by the circuit court, which highlights that there are few differences between the County use and occupancy permit and the City occupancy permit. As such, they each serve the same purpose in violation of the MOU, and the City can only enforce County laws. In turn, Respondents argue that the plain language of the MOU did not require the City to relinquish its authority to require occupancy and building permits under City law. Respondents posit that the Court of Special Appeals' holding was correct. Although the MOU at issue here empowers the City to enforce the County's zoning laws, the City additionally reserves the authority to enforce its own zoning laws. The MOU's plain language elucidates that the parties never intended that the City cede its authority and power to create its own city zoning laws. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The plain language of the MOU does not relegate the City's preexisting powers to require building and use permits issued by the City. This Court follows an \"objective theory of contract interpretation, giving effect to the clear terms of agreements, regardless of the intent of the parties at the time of contract formation.\"\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

Thus, we must first ascertain the reasonable interpretation of the parties' intent from the MOU's language. If the language is unambiguous, we only need apply the terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Following this approach, Petitioners assert that the plain language of the MOU limits the City's enforcement authority. As before the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioners highlight paragraphs 2(c) and 3(b) as clear demarcations that the County\n   intended to restrict the City from imposing requirements that are different or more restrictive than those imposed under County zoning laws. Paragraph 2(c) states, in part, that \"the City is not authorized to issue building, grading, use and occupancy, or other permits now issued by the County...\" Paragraph 3(b), partially explains, \"[n]othing in the Memorandum authorized the City to impose standards or requirements which the Zoning Ordinance does not establish....\" Petitioners read these two provisions together to restrict the City from imposing additional requirements than those imposed under County zoning laws. Mainly, the City process requires additional inspections, fees, and compliance with other zoning laws before a permit is issued. These sections do not contain any relinquishment of power by the City in order to gain concurrent enforcement power. Rather, the plain language of the contract demonstrates that the County imposed limitations of the City's enforcement in an effort to maintain its own power with regard to zoning. In doing so, the County ensured that the City could enforce the law, while requiring it to submit to the County's authority. Respondents contend that reading these two paragraphs in isolation, renders a result that the parties did not intend. We agree. Petitioners' reading of the MOU omits key paragraphs that illustrate the parties' intention for the City to retain permit issuing power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A reading of the MOU in its entirety, demonstrates that the parties intended\n   that the City maintain its authority to enforce its own building and use permit laws, specifically in light of paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b). We have explained that \"[e]ffect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\"\n   <em>\n    Clancy v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739873\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/541/#p557\">\n    405 Md. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739873\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/541/#p557\">\n    954 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1101 (2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sagner v. Glenangus Farms\n   </em>\n   , Inc.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2299745\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/234/156/#p167\">\n    234 Md. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20277\">\n    198 A.2d 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (1964) ). At the outset, in paragraph 1(a) of the MOU, the agreement states that the City gained \"all enforcement powers then possessed by County government [.]\" Paragraph 1(b) states that \"[t]he City's assumption of these zoning enforcement\n   powers and duties shall not be deemed to diminish any City power or authority under \u00a7\u00a7 8-112.1 or 8-112.3 of the Regional District Act, or any other law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plain language of paragraph 1(a) dictates that the City may undertake the same powers to enforce permitting that the County possessed. Paragraph 1(b) expressly reserves that the City has authority enumerated by any other laws. These paragraphs, considered with paragraphs 2(c) and 3(b), plainly demonstrates that both parties were cognizant of other sources of municipal power and intended for the City to retain that power, while gaining additional power from the County. Thus, the plain language of the MOU dictates that the parties reasonably intended for the City to retain the right to create and enforce its own zoning laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Due to the express language of the MOU and the City's statutorily granted power, the circuit court went beyond the expressed intent of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomran, Inc. v. Passano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2830421\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/391/1/#p14\">\n    391 Md. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"976416,2830421\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/891/336/\">\n    891 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344 (2006) (holding that the cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties' intentions). The circuit court failed to apply the objective theory of contract interpretation, and in doing so applied a meaning inconsistent with the plain language of the agreement. Additionally, during the hearing, the circuit court did not examine the nature of the relationship between the City and the County. Specifically, the court did not consider the over 4,000 inspections conducted by the City annually and the extent to which the County may have either expressly permitted the City to act, or otherwise ratified the City's actions. Given this volume, it appears that the City was well within the authority granted to it by the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The circuit court also overlooked the MOU's express provision that reflected its intended beneficiaries. Generally, only parties to a contract or third-party intended beneficiaries\n   have standing to challenge the validity or application of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor of Baltimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708311\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/14/#p36\">\n    426 Md. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708311\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/426/14/#p36\">\n    43 A.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (2012). Paragraph 10 specifically states that the City and the County are the only beneficiaries of the contract and no other persons have rights that are applicable under the MOU. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that an enforcement issue exists, the City and the County, as parties to the agreement, would be in the best position to dictate how to construe the terms of agreement and the appropriate parties to challenge the agreement, not Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, the circuit court disregarded the express authority of the City granted under Local Gov't \u00a7\u00a7 5-202, 5-209, and 5-211. Per these sections, the power of the City to enact regulations is separate and distinct from power granted by the County\n   in the MOU. We quote again from the Court of Special Appeals opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [T]he MOU is consistent with the statutory grant of authority for municipal corporations to exercise concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the County Zoning Ordinance. [Land Use] section 22-119 does not mandate that a municipal corporation surrender its powers under the [Local Gov't] Article to regulate health, safety, and welfare in order to accept a delegation of authority to enforce the County Zoning Ordinance. Rather, it requires the County and the municipal corporation to reach an agreement respecting the division of authority between the entities to prevent inconsistent enforcement. [Land Use] \u00a7 22-119(b). If the legislature had intended for the assumption of zoning enforcement powers by a municipal corporation to be conditioned upon its forfeiting other statutory grants of authority, it would have said so.
