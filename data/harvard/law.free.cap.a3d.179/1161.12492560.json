Essentially, there are two issues before this Court: (1) whether the trial court properly dismissed Brown's Section 1983 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( Section 1983 ), Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim because he did not suffer an injury; and, (2) whether the trial court properly dismissed Brown's negligence and fraud claims based on sovereign\n   immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Brown is currently incarcerated at SCI-Rockview. On March 16, 2016, Inmates filed the Complaint alleging that, as a result of DOC's administration failing to act on the knowledge of the existence of asbestos within the facility, one or more Inmates were exposed to asbestos at some point between October 2014 and March 2016 while being confined at SCI-Rockview. Inmates demanded compensatory damages in the amount of $500,000.00 for each Inmate and other individuals to whom the allegations of the Complaint pertained, as well as punitive damages in an amount to be determined for each Inmate and other similarly-situated SCI-Rockview inmates. On April 12, 2016, Wetzel filed Preliminary Objections to Inmates' Eighth Amendment constitutional claim, negligence claim and fraud claim. The trial court held a hearing on August 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 4, 2016, the trial court sustained the Preliminary Objections to the Complaint and dismissed all claims pertaining to Brown. Brown filed a Notice of Appeal (Appeal) with the trial court on November 2, 2017. The Appeal was received in the Pennsylvania Superior Court on November 23, 2016 and, by January 31, 2017 order, was transferred to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Inmates filed their \"civil rights action ... under [ Section 1983 ] for [ ] deliberate indifference to the continued exposure of asbestos [.]\" Complaint at 1.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In determining whether a plaintiff has stated a cognizable cause of action under [S]ection 1983, the inquiry must focus on whether two essential elements are met: (1) whether the complained of conduct was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether the conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Flagg v.

In\n   <em>\n    Herman,\n   </em>\n   the United States (U.S.) Fifth Circuit Appeals Court held: \"The prohibitive feature of [ Section] 1997e(e) [of the PLRA], requiring physical injury before recovery,\n   <strong>\n    does not apply\n   </strong>\n   in the context of requests\n   <strong>\n    for declaratory or injunctive relief sought to end an allegedly unconstitutional condition\n   </strong>\n   of confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    Herman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11143161\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/660/\">\n    238 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
