Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's appeal. On April 28, 2008, the defendant was convicted of the underlying offense of the sale of hallucinogens/narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277(a). On June 17, 2008, he was sentenced to ten years incarceration, execution suspended after two years, and three years of probation. The defendant was released from incarceration on September 10, 2010, and his probationary period began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 21, 2012, the defendant was convicted of violating his probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32. He was sentenced to eight years incarceration, execution suspended after two years, and three years of probation. The terms of his probation, in addition to the standard conditions, required as special conditions, that the defendant (1) obey all federal and state laws, (2) not possess weapons, (3) submit to psychological evaluation and treatment, (4) take medications as prescribed, (5) submit to substance abuse evaluation and treatment, (6) not use or possess drugs and alcohol, (7) submit to random urine and alcohol sensor testing, (8) not associate with drug dealers, users, and gang members, (9) secure full time employment, and (10) pass a general education development course. On August 5, 2013, the defendant, after he reviewed the conditions of probation, acknowledged that he understood the conditions and would follow them. On August 27, 2013, the defendant again was released from incarceration and his probationary period commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 29, 2014, an arrest warrant for the defendant was issued charging him with a violation of probation on the grounds that the defendant violated the following standard conditions of his probation: (1) \"[d]o\n   not violate any criminal law of the United States, this state or any other state or territory\" and (2) \"[s]ubmit to any medical and/or psychological examination, urinalysis, alcohol and/or drug testing, and/or counseling sessions required by the [c]ourt or the [p]robation [o]fficer.\" The defendant also was charged with failing to comply with the following special conditions of his probation: (1) submit to substance abuse evaluation and treatment, (2) do not use or possess drugs or alcohol, (3) submit to random urine and alcohol sensor testing, (4) do not associate with drug dealers, users, or gang members, and (5) obey all federal and state laws. The defendant denied that he committed any violations and a probation revocation hearing was held on April 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After hearing evidence and argument, the court found that the state had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated his probation. The court found,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in relevant part: \"[Probation] Officer [Robert] Amanti\n   of the Office of Adult Probation spoke with [the defendant] about the conditions of his probation, including his requirement that he successfully complete treatment and remain free of any illicit substance.... [The defendant] acknowledged those conditions.... [O]n August 15, 2013, the [defendant] was\n   confronted about his substance abuse.... [The defendant] indicated he was proud of getting high\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was referred for treatment at [the Southeastern Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (rehabilitation facility) ].... [The defendant], while on probation with the previously noted conditions, rendered several dirty urines on at least seven occasions while on probation. One of the urines dated [August 27, 2013,] was positive for [tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) ] with a level of 757. The [defendant] did not successfully complete treatment at [the rehabilitation facility] and was unsuccessfully discharged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court finds that he was then rereferred to [the rehabilitation facility] by probation, and again was unsuccessfully discharged....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[P]robation elected to continue working with [the defendant] toward its intended goal of rehabilitation and did not submit a warrant for violation of probation, which would be a second violation of probation ... [probation] continued to work with the [defendant] even after seven positive urines; and that the [defendant] eventually was arrested on [January 20, 2014].... [The defendant's] conduct included grabbing the hair of a pregnant victim, pulling out at least one of her braids.... The [defendant] struck this pregnant female in the face with an open hand, causing pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [The defendant] attempted to run away from the police and struggled with those police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [The defendant committed\n   the] crimes of breach of peace, assault in the third degree on a pregnant victim, [and] interfering with an officer ... [and demonstrated an] inability to successfully complete treatment or to remain sober .... [Therefore] ... the state ... met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, and [proved that the defendant] violated conditions of his probation for the aforementioned conduct.\" (Footnotes added.) After the conclusion of the dispositional phase, the court revoked the defendant's probation and sentenced him to four years of incarceration. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant's sole claim is that the court deprived him of his right to due process by admitting into evidence the reports of the results of drug tests performed on his urine samples without requiring the state to introduce such results through the testimony of the analysts who performed the actual testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. At the defendant's probation revocation hearing, the state sought to present testimony from Amanti about the results of the drug tests\n   performed on the defendant's urine and to introduce the reports of such results into evidence as an exhibit. The drug tests were performed on samples of the defendant's urine collected by both probation and the rehabilitation facility between August, 2013, and December, 2013. These samples were sent to out-of-state laboratories to be analyzed and the laboratories would fax reports of the results to the Office of Probation. The analysts who performed the drug tests and authored the reports of the drug tests were not present to testify at the defendant's probation revocation hearing. The identity of these analysts is not explicitly contained in the record, nor is there any indication that the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine these analysts prior to his probation revocation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the state's direct examination of Amanti, the prosecutor asked him about the results of a drug test on one of the defendant's urine samples, collected on August 27, 2013. Before Amanti could answer, defense counsel objected on the basis that the report of the results of that drug test was not in evidence. Defense counsel argued that Amanti testifying about the drug test results was inadmissible because it was an unreliable form of double hearsay and a violation of the defendant's right to confrontation. With respect to the right to confrontation, defense counsel argued that admitting Amanti's testimony concerning the results of the drug test violated the defendant's right to confrontation as explicated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    564 U.S. 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor\n   responded that\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its progeny do not apply to probation revocation hearings. In response, defense counsel specified that, on the basis of the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming\n   </em>\n   , the results of the drug test were unreliable hearsay without testimony from the person who performed the actual testing and were, thus, inadmissible. Defense counsel never explicitly argued that the admission of the test results violated the defendant's right to due process, which is his sole claim on appeal. The court overruled defense counsel's objection, finding \"that the testimony being elicited now and the use of the document is not just a testimonial variety of hearsay that's unsupported. This is a document that the state wishes to reference through the testimony of [Amanti] along the lines of what is clearly admissible under Connecticut law .... So the court's going to at this point overrule the objection by the defense ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the court ruled that Amanti could testify about the results of the drug test, the state opted to \"skip a little ahead and do something a little different\" by introducing the reports of the results of the drug tests as an exhibit at the hearing. Defense counsel objected to the admission of the reports as an exhibit, again arguing that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming\n   </em>\n   , the reports of the results of the drug test were inadmissible hearsay because Amanti did not conduct the actual testing. The court, overruling the defendant's objections, admitted the reports into evidence. All but one of the reports in the state's exhibit indicated that marijuana was detected in the defendant's urine samples collected\n   while he was on probation. The prosecutor then asked Amanti whether the defendant's urine samples tested positive for THC, which is an indication of the use of marijuana, and Amanti answered that they did several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The state argues that the defendant's due process claim was not preserved because, at the probation revocation hearing, the defendant did not object to the admission of the reports of the results of the drug tests as a violation of his right to due process. As a result, the state argues that the record is inadequate to review the defendant's claim that the admission of the results denied him of his right to due process. In response, the defendant argues that the claim was preserved or, if the claim is unpreserved, it is nonetheless reviewable pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first turn to a brief review of the principles relating to probation and the defendant's rights at a probation revocation hearing. \"[P]robation is, first and foremost, a penal alternative to incarceration .... [Its] purpose ... is to provide a period of grace in order to aid the rehabilitation of a penitent offender; to take advantage of an opportunity for reformation which actual service of the suspended sentence might make less probable.... [P]robationers ... do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions.... These restrictions are meant to assure that the probation\n   serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer's being at large....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The success of probation as a correctional tool is in large part tied to the flexibility within which it is permitted to operate.... In this regard, modifications\n   of probation routinely are left to the office of adult probation. When the court imposes probation, a defendant thereby accepts the possibility that the terms of probation may be modified or enlarged in the future pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-30.... To this end, probation officers shall use all suitable methods to aid and encourage [a probationer] and to bring about improvement in his [or her] conduct and condition....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that certain minimum procedural safeguards be observed in the process of revoking the conditional liberty created by probation.... Among other things, due process entitles a probationer to a final revocation hearing .... A revocation proceeding is held to determine whether the goals of rehabilitation thought to be served by probation have faltered, requiring an end to the conditional freedom obtained by a defendant at a sentencing that allowed him or her to serve less than a full sentence.... [T]he ultimate question [in the probation process is] whether the probationer is still a good risk .... This determination involves the consideration of the goals of probation, including whether the probationer's behavior is inimical to his own rehabilitation, as well as to the safety of the public....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"On the other hand ... a [probation] revocation proceeding ... is not a criminal proceeding.... It therefore does not require all of the procedural components associated with an adversary criminal proceeding.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Faraday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457025\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/174/#p180\">\n    268 Conn. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=842%20A.2d%20567\">\n    842 A.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

Although it is not necessary to address this issue in order to resolve this appeal, we observe that, since\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    , an overwhelming majority of federal circuit and state appellate courts that have addressed this issue have concluded that\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    does not apply to a revocation of probation hearing.

The defendant asserts that the determination of whether the admission of the reports of the drug test results, without allowing the defendant to confront the analysts who analyzed the defendant's urine, amounted to a violation of the defendant's due process rights only requires this court to make a legal conclusion. Yet, the defendant's argument is not persuasive because the legal conclusion the defendant requests requires the factual underpinnings as to why the analysts who performed the drug tests were not called to testify.

A footnote in that case states: \"When the trial court ruled on the objection [to out-of-court statements], it addressed the defendant's objection as to the credibility of the witness and the reliability of the hearsay statements. Thus, the defendant's claim on appeal that the admission of [the out-of-court declarant's] testimony denied him the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses was not presented to the trial court. We further note that, under\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , the defendant's claim cannot be reviewed because it fails to satisfy the first prong, which requires that the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , [supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n     213 Conn. at 239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n     567 A.2d 823\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ].

Moreover, defense counsel's incorrect interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Giovanni P.\n    </em>\n    neither alerted the court that it needed to balance the defendant's due process right to confrontation against the state's interest in not presenting the witness, nor developed an adequate record for appellate review of the defendant's claim pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
