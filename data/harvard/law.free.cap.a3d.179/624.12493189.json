(UGI) commenced this action in the Court's original\n   jurisdiction on October 13, 2015, seeking a declaratory judgment that certain ordinances of Respondent City of Reading (City) are invalid and a permanent injunction barring the City from enforcing those ordinances. Count I of UGI's three-count amended petition for review asserts that City Ordinance No. 45-2015, which imposes restrictions on the location of gas meters in historic districts, is preempted by the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101 - 3316, and a regulation promulgated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) pursuant to its authority under the Public Utility Code. The matter before the Court is UGI's application for partial summary relief seeking a judgment in its favor on Count I of its amended petition for review declaring that Ordinance No. 45-2015 is invalid and permanently enjoining the City from enforcing Ordinance No. 45-2015. For the reasons set forth below, we grant UGI's application for partial summary relief and enjoin the City from enforcing Ordinance No. 45-2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 1532(b) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that \"[a]t any time after the filing of a petition for review in an appellate or original jurisdiction matter the court may on application enter judgment if the right of the applicant thereto is clear.\" Pa. R.A.P. 1532(b). Summary relief may be granted if there are no genuine disputes of material fact and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the movant's right to judgment in its favor is clear as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Hospital &amp; Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania v.

Ordinance No. 45-2015 provides,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   F. Placement of gas meters in historic districts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) Installation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    No gas meters shall be installed or placed in front yards, front of buildings or along their facades that can be seen from a public right-of-way within any historic district designated by City ordinance or listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Such gas meters shall be located inside the building, at an exterior location that is not visible from a public right-of-way, or shall be installed within an exterior, below-grade vault\n   </em>\n   that is covered by a flush, corrosion-resistant access hatch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) Exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Gas meters, as defined herein, may be installed in front yards, front of buildings, or along their facades that can be seen from a public right-of-way within historic districts only if no other means of gas service can be provided\n   </em>\n   . In such cases where the proposed location of a gas meter is visible from a public right-of-way, the public utility shall seek the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness as required in \u00a7 295-107 of this chapter. Such gas meters shall be unobtrusive and shall be screened from view through the use of landscaping, fencing and/or architectural building features. The Building Inspector and Historic Preservation Specialist shall approve the installation to ensure there is no disruption to the historic nature and aesthetic value of the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) Removal. Any existing gas meter assembly installed in front yards, front of buildings or along their facades that can be seen from a public right-of-way within historic districts before the enactment of this Section must be reviewed by the Historical Architectural Review Board to obtain a certificate of appropriateness as required per \u00a7 295-106 of this chapter within one year of the effective date of this chapter.\n   <em>\n    The Historical Architectural Review Board may require removal and/or alterations to existing gas meter assemblies\n   </em>\n   and adjacent construction to meet the requirements of this Section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) Violations and penalty.\n   <em>\n    Placement of any gas meter that does not conform to the guidelines of this section will constitute a violation and may be subject to penalty and enforcement\n   </em>\n   per \u00a7 295-122 and 295-123.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Ordinance No. 45-2015) (emphasis added). In February 2016, after UGI commenced this action, the City filed a Complaint with the PUC contending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that UGI is installing meters on the front exterior of buildings in its historic districts without consideration of indoor placement in violation of PUC Regulation 59.18 and seeking an order from the PUC setting standards for meter location in historic districts. That Complaint, PUC Docket No. C-2016-2530475, and a related Complaint filed by Centre Park Historic District, Inc., PUC Docket No. C-2015-2516051, with which it has been consolidated (collectively, the PUC Proceedings), are pending before a PUC administrative law judge (ALJ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 19, 2017, UGI filed the instant\n   application for partial summary relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this application, UGI asserts that Ordinance No. 45-2015 is preempted both because it conflicts with PUC Regulation 59.18 and because it is barred by the PUC's exclusive authority over the location of public utility facilities. The City, in response, argues that Ordinance No. 45-2015 is consistent with and permitted by PUC Regulation 59.18. The City also contends that the question of whether UGI must comply with Ordinance No. 45-2015 is before the PUC in the PUC Proceedings and has requested that the Court defer ruling on UGI's application until the PUC rules in those proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   UGI asserts that there is no basis to stay this matter because the PUC Proceedings involve only issues of whether UGI's meter relocations violate PUC Regulation 59.18 and will not address the question of whether Ordinance No. 45-2015 is preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We reject the City's request to delay ruling on the application for partial summary relief. The record in the PUC Proceedings demonstrates that those proceedings will not address whether Ordinance No. 45-2015 is preempted or can be enforced by the City against UGI. On August 28, 2017, the ALJ issued an Initial Decision on a motion for summary judgment filed by UGI in which she addressed the scope of the PUC Proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that Initial Decision, the ALJ specifically ruled that the validity of the City's ordinances was not before the PUC. (PUC Proceedings 8/28/17 Initial Decision at 20, 22 n.38.) While the ALJ concluded that the existence of the local ordinance could be relevant to whether the utility's consideration of indoor gas meter placement was sufficient to satisfy its obligations under PUC Regulation 59.18, the ALJ specifically rejected the City's contentions that PUC Regulation 59.18 incorporated local ordinances requiring indoor placement of meters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22.) The issue of whether UGI's meter placements in the City's historic districts violated PUC Regulation 59.18 is still pending in the PUC Proceedings and those proceedings may clarify the obligations that a utility has under PUC Regulation 59.18 in historic districts. Neither of those matters, however, need be resolved for this Court to address whether Ordinance No. 45-2015 conflicts with PUC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Regulation 59.18 and the Public Utility Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Turning to the merits, we conclude that Ordinance No. 45-2015 is preempted by PUC Regulation 59.18 and the Public Utility Code. \"Municipalities are creatures of the state and have no inherent powers of their own.

PUC Regulation 59.18 does not require or direct that gas meters in historic districts must be installed indoors, but provides only that \"[i]nside meter locations shall be\n   <em>\n    considered\n   </em>\n   \" by the utility in such districts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2059.18\">\n    52 Pa. Code \u00a7 59.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(ii) (emphasis added). Indeed, the PUC in promulgating this regulation made clear that utilities are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to install gas meters indoors in historic districts and that the decision whether to install a meter indoors involves an exercise of discretion by the utility, noting that \"it is necessary that, due to its public safety obligations, the utility be allowed to make the final decision.\" Final Rulemaking Order, 44 Pa. B. at 5848. Ordinance No. 45-2015, in contrast, imposes an absolute prohibition on outdoor, aboveground installation of gas meters where the only available outdoor location is in a front yard or fa\u00e7ade visible from the street unless \"no other means of gas service can be provided.\" (Ordinance No. 45-2015 \u00a7 F(1)(a), (2) ). Such a restriction is directly contrary to the discretion that the PUC conferred on utilities to determine whether safety permits an indoor location. Therefore, Ordinance No. 45-2015 stands as an obstacle to the execution of the full purposes of PUC Regulation 59.18 and is preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holt's Cigar Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199377,4199946,7289852,7289799\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/10/902/\">\n    10 A.3d at 913-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ordinance preempted where it prohibited sales of certain items regardless of sellers' knowledge where state required proof of seller\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   because ordinance conflicted with state purpose to protect innocent sellers);\n   <em>\n    Cellucci v.

The PUC, in PUC Regulation 59.18, regulates the locations at which utilities may install gas meters. Ordinance No. 45-2015 does not merely impose historic district requirements of general applicability on utilities. It specifically regulates the very same subject regulated by the PUC, the location of gas meters, and provides for local enforcement of its restrictions by orders that gas meters be removed or altered and by imposition of penalties. Such regulation of the location of utility facilities is preempted by the PUC's exclusive authority regardless of whether it conflicts with any specific PUC regulations or orders.\n   <em>\n    County of Chester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20331\">\n    218 A.2d at 332-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (invalidating ordinance requiring utilities constructing pipelines in county to submit plans and specifications to the county planning commission before construction);\n   <em>\n    UGI Utilities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 125 A.3d at 864-65 (ordinance sections that required utility to submit maps and engineering specifications to city were preempted because they \"allow the City to become a regulator itself\" in contravention of the PUC's exclusive jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    PPL Electric Utilities Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 125 A.3d at 849-53 (ordinance sections that provided for city\n   inspection of utility facilities, for city orders to relocate utility facilities and for city enforcement of PUC regulations were preempted because each of those provisions \"makes the City a regulator itself\" in contravention of the PUC's exclusive jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    Township of Pine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8377152\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/926/1241/#p1249\">\n    926 A.2d at 1249-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (township was preempted from enforcing PUC regulation concerning underground location of electric transmission lines).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The City argues that preemption does not apply because PUC Regulation 59.18 recognized the existence of local historic district ordinances. This argument is without merit. Nothing in the PUC's rulemaking authorized or validated the type of regulation of gas meter location that Ordinance No. 45-2015 imposes. The local regulation of historic districts acknowledged and discussed by the PUC in promulgating PUC Regulation 59.18 consists of ordinances of general application regulating construction in historic districts, not ordinances directed specifically at regulating utilities or imposing specific restrictions on the location of gas meters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Rulemaking Order, 44 Pa. B. at 5837-38, 5842-43, 5847. Moreover, the PUC did not make any determination that historic district ordinances are necessarily valid and enforceable against utilities. To the contrary, the PUC specifically noted that \"[s]uch municipal laws may not be enforceable against public utilities due to the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction of utilities under the Public Utility Code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8377152\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/926/1241/#p1249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 5837 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The City also argues that preemption does not apply because the location of meters in historic districts implicates its protection of historic resources under Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This argument likewise fails. Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania's public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pa. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 27. The issue here, however, is not the importance or legitimacy of the City's purpose, but whether it has been preempted by the state. Article 1, Section 27 does not immunize local regulation from preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Range Resources-Appalachia, LLC v.

The reason that preemption fails in such a case is that the preempting state law itself is unconstitutional. That situation is not present here. The City does not claim that PUC Regulation 59.18 violates Article 1, Section 27 or is unconstitutional in any respect. Nor is there are any basis on which a court could conclude that the\n   PUC's safety regulation of gas meters violates Article 1, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, as it in fact takes into account the interest in protection of historic resources by providing for consideration of indoor meter placement in historic districts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2059.18\">\n    52 Pa.
