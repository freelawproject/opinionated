Upon careful review, we vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We summarize the procedural history of this case as follows. On September 21, 2012, Appellant was a student at the University of Pittsburgh when he attended a\n   fraternity party and became intoxicated. At the time, Appellant was taking prescribed medications for depression and anxiety. On that date, Appellant was apprehended by University of Pittsburgh Police when it was reported that he was attempting to harm himself. The police took Appellant to Western Psychiatric Hospital, where he was involuntarily committed under section 302 of the Mental Health Procedures Act (\"MHPA\") 50 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7101 - 7503. Subsequently, Appellant was discharged on September 25, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant continued his course of studies in law enforcement at the University of Pittsburgh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 24, 2014, Appellant filed a petition to vacate and expunge his involuntary commitment pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6105(f)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(g)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing was held on January 8, 2015, and on March 10, 2015, the trial court signed an order denying Appellant's petition for expungement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant filed exceptions that were denied by operation of law, resulting in this timely appeal on August 27, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court did not order Appellant to file a concise statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). On October 7, 2015, the trial court issued an opinion in support of its March 10, 2015 order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Previously, a divided three-judge panel of this Court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Appellant then filed an application for reargument en banc, which was granted on January 26, 2017, and the former memorandum decision of the three-judge panel was withdrawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant presents the following issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I. Did the trial court err and/or abuse its discretion by finding that there was a valid commitment of the Appellant under Section 303 of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303 (hereafter the [\"MHPA\"] ) and by denying the Appellant's petition to vacate and expunge involuntary civil commitment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Did the trial court err and/or abuse its discretion by finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the Appellant's commitment under Section 302 of the Act and by denying the Appellant's petition to vacate and expunge involuntary civil commitment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 4. \"Our well-settled standard of review in cases involving a motion for expunction is whether the trial court abused its discretion.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Keyes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7264491\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/83/1016/#p1022\">\n    83 A.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (Pa. Super. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant first argues that the trial court erred in concluding that there was a valid commitment under section 303 of the MHPA. Appellant's Brief at 12-19. Essentially, Appellant contends that his due process rights were violated, thereby invalidating the section 303 commitment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 18-19. Appellant claims there was no valid section 303 commitment at all. He states, \"the 303 certification was merely a device for accomplishing the immediate release of [Appellant] from the 302 commitment while assuaging the liability concerns of UPMC and WPIC.\" Appellant's Brief at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are constrained to agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Initially, we observe that prevailing case law has interpreted 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111.1(g) as providing no opportunity to obtain expungement of a mental health record pursuant to a commitment under section 303 and only allows for a trial court to review commitments under section 302.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Jacobs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7338616\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/509/#p511\">\n    15 A.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511 (Pa. Super. 2011). In addition, an appellant seeking expungement and restoration of firearms rights cannot \"bootstrap\" review of a section 303 commitment to a petition seeking review of a section 302 commitment under section 6111.1(g), because the section 303 commitment is \"an entirely separate judicial proceeding, complete with its own avenue of appeal.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7338616\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/509/#p511\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The law in Pennsylvania is \"well-settled that involuntary civil commitment of mentally ill persons constitutes deprivation of liberty and may be accomplished only in accordance with due process protections.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Hutchinson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1781048\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/500/152/\">\n    500 Pa. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1781048\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/500/152/\">\n    454 A.2d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010 (1982) ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Chiumento\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"947346\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/455/376/\">\n    455 Pa.Super. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7347585,947346\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/688/217/\">\n    688 A.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 220 (1997). \"The very nature of civil commitment ... entails an extraordinary deprivation of liberty....

As we ultimately held in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Ryan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , when an appellant's due process rights under the MHPA are violated, \"we may vacate the certification for involuntary treatment pursuant to section [ ]303, and direct that all records pertaining to this matter be expunged.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Ryan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9464856\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/784/803/#p807\">\n    784 A.2d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re A.J.N.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775458,12486363\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/130/\">\n    144 A.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (Pa.

Section 302 of the MHPA provides for the involuntary emergency examination and treatment of a person not to exceed 120 hours if, upon certification of a physician for examination, or upon a warrant issued by a county administrator authorizing an examination, an examination conducted by a physician within two hours of arrival shows that the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of emergency treatment. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7302(a), (b). Section 303 of the MHPA provides for extended involuntary emergency treatment of any person who is being treated pursuant to section 302 for a period not to exceed twenty days if, after an informal conference where the patient is represented by counsel, a judge or mental health review officer finds that the patient is severely mentally disabled and in need of continued involuntary treatment, and so certifies. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(a) - (c). Indeed, the person is entitled to the appointment of counsel. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(b). In addition, section 303(c) requires the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) At the commencement of the informal conference, the judge or the mental health review officer\n   <strong>\n    shall inform the person of the nature of the proceedings.\n   </strong>\n   Information relevant to whether the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment shall be reviewed, including the reasons that continued involuntary treatment is considered necessary. Such explanation shall be made by a physician who examined\n   the person and shall be in terms understandable to a layman. The judge or mental health review officer may review any relevant information even if it would be normally excluded under rules of evidence if he believes that such information is reliable. The person or his representative shall have the right to ask questions of the physician and of any other witnesses and to present any relevant information. At the conclusion of the review, if the judge or the review officer finds that the person is severely mentally disabled and in need of continued involuntary treatment, he shall so certify. Otherwise, he shall direct that the facility director or his designee discharge the person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Also of importance are the following provisions of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) CONTENTS OF CERTIFICATION.-A certification for extended involuntary treatment\n   </strong>\n   shall be made in writing upon a form adopted by the department and\n   <strong>\n    shall include:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) findings by the judge or mental health review officer as to the reasons that extended involuntary emergency treatment is necessary;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) a description of the treatment to be provided together with an explanation of the adequacy and appropriateness of such treatment, based upon the information received at the hearing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) any documents required by the provisions of section 302;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (4) the application as filed pursuant to section 303(a);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (5) a statement that the person is represented by counsel; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (6)\n   <strong>\n    an explanation of the effect of the certification, the person's right to petition the court for release under subsection (g), and the continuing right to be represented by counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) FILING AND SERVICE.-The certification shall be filed with the director of the facility and a copy served on the person\n   </strong>\n   , such other parties as the person requested to be notified pursuant to section 302(c), and on counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    (f) EFFECT OF CERTIFICATION.-Upon the\n   </strong>\n   filing and\n   <strong>\n    service of a certification for extended involuntary emergency treatment\n   </strong>\n   , the person may be given treatment\n   <strong>\n    in\n   </strong>\n   an approved facility for a period not to exceed 20 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    (g) PETITION TO COMMON PLEAS COURT.\n   </strong>\n   -In all cases in which the hearing was conducted by a mental health review officer,\n   <strong>\n    a person made subject to treatment pursuant to this section shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas for review of the certification.\n   </strong>\n   A hearing shall be held within 72 hours after the petition is filed unless a continuance is requested by the person's counsel.

At the expungement hearing, Appellant testified that, although he spoke with a public defender prior to his release from the hospital, he was unaware of any 303 commitment hearing held on September 25, 2012. N.T.,\n   1/8/15, at 32-33. Appellant testified that he merely \"was told that there\n   <strong>\n    could\n   </strong>\n   be a hearing.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 33 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition, our review of the certified record reflects that, by happenstance, the public defender who signed Appellant's section 303 certification was present at the courthouse at the time of Appellant's expungement hearing and was asked to testify. N.T., 1/8/15, at 15-20. When called into the courtroom, the public defender stated that he did not \"specifically recall [Appellant].\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 16. However, upon reviewing the section 303 commitment form at the time he provided his testimony, the public defender acknowledged that\n   <strong>\n    Appellant did not attend the 303 hearing.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Also, Sergeant Andrew Redman of the University of Pittsburgh Police Department testified at Appellant's expungement hearing. Sergeant Redman explained that university police officers who file section 302 petitions typically receive notices of section 303 commitment hearings. N.T., 1/8/15, at 54. However, Sergeant Redman stated that he did not appear at a section 303 commitment hearing for Appellant on September 25, 2012, and could not recall whether he was ever informed that such a hearing for Appellant was to be held. N.T., 1/8/15, at 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition, the certified record reflects that the section 303 commitment certification document specifies that Appellant did not attend the hearing. The section 303 commitment certification provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   AND NOW, this 25TH day of September, 2012, a hearing having been held on a Petition of Extended involuntary Treatment of [Appellant], Respondent, under Section 303 of the Mental Health Procedures Act of 1976, as amended by Act 324 of 1978, the Respondent having been present and represented by the Office of Public Defender, upon consideration of the testimony of F. DePietro, MD., a physician on the staff of WPIC, your Mental Health Review Officer finds that the Respondent is severely mentally disabled and presents a clear and present danger to himself/herself or others; and certifies that he/she shall receive:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   PLEASE CHECK ONE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [] In Patient Treatment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [] Partial Hospitalization\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [] Out-Patient Treatment [this box checked]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [] Combination of such treatment as the director of the facility shall from time to time determine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   which is the least restrictive appropriate treatment for the Respondent at WPIC/Blair Co. MH Hospital, pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health Procedures Act, for a period not to exceed Twenty (20) days from the date of this Certification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-50\"><em><em>Robert Zunich</em></em> MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW OFFICER <strong>Patient Attended YES ___ NO</strong> <strong><em>X</em></strong> Contested _____ Uncontested: Voluntary _____ Stipulation <em>X</em> <em><em>E.S.</em></em> Patient's Counsel's signature required [Patient is A Resident of BLAIR County]</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Docket Entry 1, Exhibit 7 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appellant did not sign the section 303 commitment certification. Moreover, the section 303 commitment certification does not meet all of the requirements of section 303(d). Of particular importance is the fact that there is no evidence Appellant was ever notified of his right to appeal to the court of common pleas under section 303(g) as required under section 303(d)(6). Likewise, there is no evidence that Appellant was provided an explanation of his continuing right to be represented by counsel as required under section 303(d)(6). In addition, there is no evidence that Appellant was served a copy of the section 303 commitment certification as mandated under section 303(e). These failures amount to a deprivation of Appellant's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, a study of Appellant's discharge summary from Western Psychiatric Hospital is problematic. Precisely, the following language from the hospital's discharge document results in the conclusion that Appellant was not properly committed under section 303:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   HOSPITAL COURSE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ... He\n   <strong>\n    won his 303 hearing\n   </strong>\n   on 9/25/12 after police who petitioned his 302 did not show up to hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   DISCHARGE PLANNING\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Appellant] discharged to home with his parents\n   <strong>\n    after winning his 303 hearing\n   </strong>\n   on 9/25/12 after police did not show up for his 303 hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Docket Entry 1, Exhibit 8 (emphases added). Therefore, it is our determination that the trial court erred in finding that the section 303 certification was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in determining that there was sufficient evidence to support his initial commitment under section 302 of the MHPA. Appellant's Brief at 20-22. Appellant contends that there was no evidence he suffered from mental illness or that he was severely mentally disabled as a result of mental illness. However, at the conclusion of his argument on this issue, Appellant states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   it is noteworthy that the trial court never addressed the sufficiency of the evidence to support the [s]ection 302 commitment. Rather, the lower court expressly stated that it was limiting its inquiry to the sufficiency of the evidence for the [s]ection 303 commitment, but then proceeded to address only the [s]ection 303 procedural requirements. Thus, the [trial] court failed to make any findings whatsoever as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support either the [s]ection 302 or [s]ection 303 commitments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Appellant's Brief at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Our review of the record reflects that, in his Petition to Vacate and Expunge Involuntary Civil Commitment filed on November 24, 2014, Appellant specifically challenged his section 302 commitment that occurred on September 21, 2012. In so doing, Appellant concluded his petition with the following request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Appellant] respectfully requests [the trial court] to Enter an Order vacating his mental health commitment of September 21, 2012, directing Allegheny County Mental Health/Mental Retardation, WPIC, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Forbes Regional Campus, Pennsylvania State Police, as well as all other appropriate law enforcement agencies to expunge all references in their records, files and databanks to said commitment and restoring all of the civil rights and privileges lost by [Appellant] as a result of his commitment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Petition to Vacate and Expunge Involuntary Civil Commitment, 11/24/14, at 9 (unnumbered).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   However, as indicated by Appellant in his appellate brief, our review of the certified record reflects that the trial court failed to address whether there was sufficient evidence to support Appellant's section 302 commitment. Rather than address the underlying section 302 commitment, the trial court made a determination regarding the validity of Appellant's section 303 commitment. Trial Court Opinion, 10/7/15, at 3.

Further, since the courts cannot expunge the record of Appellant's Section 303 commitment, Appellant's claim of error with respect to his commitment under 50 P.S. \u00a7 7302 (hereinafter \"Section 302\") is moot.

The learned majority is apparently aware of this fact, as the majority never explicitly declares that Section 6111.1(g)(2) allows it to review Appellant's Section 303 commitment or to direct that Appellant's Section 303 records be expunged.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Majority Opinion at 1143-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With Section 6111.1(g)(2) providing no avenue of jurisdiction in this case, how does the majority conclude that it (or any court) has jurisdiction to review the sufficiency of a Section 303 commitment that was finalized over two years before Appellant filed his current petition? The majority certainly cannot ground its assertion of jurisdiction in any statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Initially, 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(g) sets the statutory procedure for appealing a Section 303 certification, where the certification was made by a mental health review officer. 50 P.S. \u00a7 7303(g) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    (g) Petition to Common Pleas Court\n   </strong>\n   .-In all cases in which the hearing was conducted by a mental health review officer, a person made subject to treatment pursuant to this section shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas for review of the certification.

Therefore, the mental health review officer's Section 303 certification constitutes a \"final adjudication or determination\" and, under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5571(b), the time for appealing such determination to the court of common pleas is statutorily fixed at 30 days. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5571(b) (\"[e]xcept as otherwise provided ..., an appeal from a tribunal or other government unit to a court ... must be commenced within 30 days after the entry of the order from which the appeal is taken, in the case of an interlocutory or final order\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appeal of Chartiers Valley Sch.
