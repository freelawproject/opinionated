However, Pascual was physically and emotionally abusive to Ana, and when J.S.E. was still a baby, Pascual threw Ana and J.S.E out of the\n   house. J.S.E. did not see his father again until years later, when they met once. At that point, the father was mentally ill and confined to a room in his parents' house. The father died in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the father ejected them from their home, Ana and the baby moved in with her Aunt Catarina. However, Ana struggled to make ends meet, and moved to the United States when J.S.E. was about five years old. Ana left the child in the care of her friend Anacleta. For years, she sent Anacleta money for the child's support. However, when J.S.E. was nine years old, Ana received an anonymous letter warning her that J.S.E. was walking around alone, hungry, and in dirty clothes. Ana learned that Anacleta was physically abusing the child, depriving him of food, and spending the support money on herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ana then arranged for J.S.E. to live with her aunt. However, when J.S.E. was about seventeen years old, the aunt made it clear that she could no longer care for him and believed he should move to the United States to live with his mother. Because there was no one to provide for J.S.E. in Guatemala, he fled to the United States. At the time of the SIJ application, J.S.E. was attending a special school and going to counseling for his emotional trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In September 2016, Ana filed a verified complaint in the Family Part, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), seeking the findings required for SIJ status. She also specifically sought sole legal and physical custody of her son, who was \"a full time student still dependent on his mother for his emotional, financial, educational, and safety needs.\" The complaint asserted that there was no one else \"willing and able\" to care for him. Ana further sought a ruling that the Family Part had jurisdiction over J.S.E. and that he was \"not emancipated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After hearing testimony from J.S.E. and his mother, the Family Part judge found that, due to \"the abuse he suffered at a\n   young age, [J.S.E.] did not acquire the skills necessary to provide for himself. [Ana] is the only suitable caregiver who can help him transition to adulthood.... It is clearly in the best interest of [J.S.E.] to remain in the custody of his mother.\" However, the\n   judge declined to grant custody, reasoning that the Family Part did not have jurisdiction to enter an order placing J.S.E. in his mother's custody, because he was over the age of eighteen. The judge also did not specifically issue a declaration that J.S.E. was not emancipated, although the judge's factual findings made clear that was the case. Based on his view that the court lacked jurisdiction due to J.S.E.'s age, he determined that J.S.E. was neither dependent on the court nor under the custody of an agency or individual appointed by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On this appeal, we review the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.\n   <em>\n    H.S.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363644\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/223/196/#p209\">\n    223 N.J. at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363644\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/223/196/#p209\">\n    121 A.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Neither party apparently relied on N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3, and the Court did not refer to that statute.

Indeed, the idea that child custody necessarily ends, or is barred, when a child turns eighteen, is belied by the case law concerning emancipation.

In the circumstances of this case, J.S.E., who has not even completed high school and is financially dependent on his mother, fits the definition of an unemancipated child. Declaring J.S.E. unemancipated, to protect his continued right to support, and granting Ana custody of him would further the benevolent purpose of N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3 to protect young adults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We therefore hold that N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3 confers jurisdiction on the Family Part, in an appropriate case, to place a non-emancipated child between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one in a parent's custody, and to declare the child unemancipated, where that disposition is in the child's best interest and both the child and the parent consent. We also hold that it was error for the Family Part to deny that relief here, where J.S.E. is clearly not emancipated, still attends a special \"last-chance\" high school, cannot provide for himself economically, has no one else on whom he can depend for financial support, and would face dire circumstances if he were separated from his mother or if she did not financially support him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lastly, to address the related SIJ issue, we conclude that either a declaration of unemancipation or a custody order would justify the court in noting, for purposes of an SIJ finding, that the child is \"dependent\" on the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). A finding of dependency dovetails with the underlying purpose of the pertinent language in N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3, which recognizes that in appropriate situations, young adults still depend on the protection of the Family Part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Recinos v.

After hearing Ana's and J.S.E.'s credible testimony, the Family Part judge made specific factual findings concerning J.S.E.'s best interests, and the evidentiary record strongly supports his findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cesare v.

Based on those findings, which include the judge's conclusion that \"[i]t is clearly in the best interest of [J.S.E.] to remain in the custody of his mother,\" the correct outcome is not in doubt. In view of the time sensitive nature of this case, we exercise our original jurisdiction to determine that J.S.E. shall be declared unemancipated and shall be placed in his mother's custody pursuant to N.J.S.A. 9:17B-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We remand this case to the Family Part, for the limited purpose of\n   issuing an amended order so providing, and finding that J.S.E. is dependent on the court for SIJ purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We also note the need for an additional correction to the order, perhaps caused by an inadvertent error.
