Urrutia was paid total incapacity workers' compensation benefits by his employer, Interstate Brands International. For more than three years, he received the full amount of those benefits while also collecting Social Security retirement benefits. When Interstate learned that Urrutia was receiving Social Security benefits, it sought a credit, by way of a payment holiday, against ongoing incapacity payments pursuant to a statutory provision that reduces the amount of incapacity benefit payments by half of the amount of retirement benefits the employee is also receiving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 2] A hearing officer (\n   <em>\n    Stovall, HO\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ordered that Interstate was entitled to a credit of $24,131.38, but the Workers' Compensation Appellate Division decided the issue differently, determining that section 221 does not allow a reduction based on incapacity overpayments made in the past. On this appeal by Interstate and ACE American Insurance Company (collectively, Interstate), we conclude that section 221 entitles an employer to a credit for workers' compensation benefits previously paid for the same liability period when the employee also was receiving Social Security retirement benefits. We therefore vacate the decision of the Appellate Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The following facts are undisputed by the parties and established by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In 2001, Victor Urrutia began working for Interstate as a production mechanic. In July 2009, when he was 62 years old, Urrutia slipped on a catwalk in the workplace and grabbed a railing to catch himself, resulting in injuries to his spine and extremities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Interstate began paying Urrutia total incapacity workers' compensation benefits in December 2010. Unbeknownst to Interstate, however, Urrutia had started receiving Social Security retirement benefits in August 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2013, Interstate sent Urrutia a Certificate Authorizing Release of Benefit Information for him to sign so that Interstate could obtain his Social Security records. In August 2013, Interstate was informed by Urrutia that he had been and was currently receiving Social Security retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In a petition filed with the Workers' Compensation Board, Interstate sought a determination that pursuant to section 221 it was entitled to reduce Urrutia's ongoing workers' compensation benefits by half of the amount of his Social Security retirement benefits-a reduction that Urrutia ultimately did not contest. Interstate also sought a credit pursuant to section 221, by way of a payment holiday, for amounts it had overpaid Urrutia before learning that he had been receiving retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 7] After a contested hearing held on the latter issue in April 2014, a hearing officer granted Interstate's petition, concluding that section 221 entitled Interstate to \"a credit for all periods for which the employee received old-age [S]ocial [S]ecurity benefits and workers' compensation benefits.\" For that reason, the hearing officer ordered that Interstate \"may cease lost wage benefits payment until such time as it exhausts its credit of $24,141.38\" that accrued between December 2010 and November 2013-the period when Urrutia was receiving both Social Security retirement benefits and the full amount of incapacity benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Urrutia appealed the hearing officer's decree to the Appellate Division,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 321-B (2017), which vacated the decree, concluding that the plain language of section 221 does not permit a credit for incapacity overpayments already made to the employee when the employee was also receiving Social Security benefits, and that the section 221 credit may be applied only against ongoing incapacity benefits that are being paid for the \"same time period\" as the Social Security retirement benefits. The Appellate Division concluded that Interstate therefore was not entitled to a credit based on Urrutia's past receipt of retirement benefits. Interstate filed a timely petition for appellate review, which we granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 322 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 23 (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 9] This case calls for us to address an issue we have not previously had occasion to consider: whether the \"coordination of benefits\" statute in the Workers' Compensation Act, 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221(1), entitles\n   an employer to a credit against ongoing incapacity benefit payments for overpayments made in the past while the employee was also receiving \"old-age\" Social Security benefit payments (i.e., retirement benefit payments).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Section 221(1) provides for an adjustment of the amount of workers' compensation benefits when\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 212 or 213\n   <em>\n    with respect to the same time period\n   </em>\n   for which the employee is also receiving or has received payments for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Old-age insurance benefit payments under the United States Social Security Act, 42 United States Code, Sections 301 to 1397f.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The amount of the adjustment is determined pursuant to section 221(3), which provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Benefit payments subject to this section\n   <em>\n    must be reduced\n   </em>\n   in accordance with the following provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. The employer's obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly [incapacity] benefits ... is reduced by the following amounts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) Fifty percent of the amount of the old-age insurance benefits\n   <em>\n    received or being received\n   </em>\n   under the United States Social Security Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The question presented here is whether the \"same time period\" identified in section 221(1) means the period when the employee is actually\n   <em>\n    receiving\n   </em>\n   both the retirement benefit and the incapacity benefit that is subject to the adjustment, or the period when the employer is-or was-\n   <em>\n    liable\n   </em>\n   for incapacity benefits and the employee is-or was-receiving retirement benefits. If the phrase in section 221(1), \"the same time period,\" modifies \"payments\"-the construction urged by Urrutia-then an employer would be entitled to a reduction only of those payments made during the same period when the employee contemporaneously received old-age retirement benefits, and Interstate would not be entitled to a retroactive credit on account of Urrutia's receipt of retirement benefits from December 2010 through November 2013. If, however-as Interstate asserts-\"the same time period\" modifies \"liability,\" then an employer would be entitled to a credit for the same period when the employer was liable for incapacity benefits and for which the employee received retirement benefits, regardless of when the incapacity payments were actually made, thereby entitling the employer to a retroactive credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The resolution of this dispute is entirely a matter of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beaulieu v.

We make this determination based on several aspects of the language of section 221, as well as a consideration of the underlying purpose of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 14] We first note the grammatical structure of the pertinent part of section 221(1), which lacks a comma or other punctuation to separate the references to \"liability\" and \"the same time period.\" This indicates that the phrase \"with respect to the same time period\" modifies the immediately preceding word-\"liability\"-rather than \"payments,\" which appears earlier in that sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labbe v.

The reference to past receipt of retirement benefits demonstrates that the Legislature intended that the amount of incapacity payments is to be coordinated with other qualifying benefits-including Social Security retirement benefits-even when the benefits were received in the past, before the adjustment is implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Another provision contained in section 221 specifically refers to a \"\n   <em>\n    credit\n   </em>\n   or reduction\" of incapacity benefits based on an employee's receipt of Social Security benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221(3)(B) (emphasis added). The words \"credit\" and \"reduction\" must be seen to signify distinct recovery mechanisms in order to avoid either word becoming surplusage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hickson v.

This demonstrates that while section 221 allows for a \"reduction\" of ongoing incapacity payments arising from the employee's receipt of Social Security retirement benefits, the statute also provides for something different, namely, a \"credit,\" which-in light of the statutory reference to a \"reduction\"-can only be based on past overpayments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 17] The availability of a \"credit or reduction\" also corresponds to the statutory reference in section 221(1) to Social\n   Security benefits \"received or being received\" by the employee: past overpayment of incapacity benefits when the employee also \"received\" retirement benefits entitles the employer to a \"credit,\" whereas the employer is entitled to a \"reduction\" of incapacity benefits being presently paid based on retirement benefits \"being received\" by the employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221(3)(B), (C), (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b6 18] Further, we construe the language of the statute in light of its purpose. As we have previously held, the adjustment created by the predecessor to the portion of section 221 applicable here is designed to \"ensure a minimum income during the period of an employee's incapacity and to prevent a double recovery of both retirement and compensation benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n    651 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   361 ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foley v.

Permitting Interstate to presently receive a credit based on incapacity benefit overpayments made during the past period when Urrutia also received old-age Social Security benefits comports with both of those objectives. Without the credit, Urrutia would retain the double recovery of benefits that section 221 is intended to prevent, while application of the credit formula prescribed in that statute results in Urrutia's receipt of the combined level of benefits intended by the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Supporting this purpose, section 221(3) states explicitly that \"[b]enefit payments subject to this section\n   <em>\n    must be reduced\n   </em>\n   in accordance with the following provisions.\" (Emphasis added.) The statute thus not only creates an employer's entitlement to the credit but makes that credit mandatory.

Consequently, Interstate is entitled to a credit for incapacity benefit overpayments made to Urrutia during the same period when he received Social Security retirement benefits, from December 2010 through November 2013, totaling $24,141.38.

The Plain Language\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b6 25] The Appellate Division unanimously concluded that \"[t]he plain language of section 221(1) requires that the offset or credit be taken '\n   <em>\n    with respect to the same time period\n   </em>\n   ' for which the employee is also receiving or has received payments.\"\n   <em>\n    Urrutia v.

The Appellate Division reasoned that to \"permit an offset when weekly incapacity benefits are being made for a different period than that in which the employee received Social Security retirement benefits ... is in contravention of the plain meaning of the language in section 221(1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [\u00b6 26] The Appellate Division was correct. Workers' compensation benefits for total incapacity ( 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 212 (2017) ) or partial incapacity ( 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 213 (2017) ) are paid on a weekly basis. Following an injury, an employer has 14 days to dispute the employee's claim of incapacity. Me. W.C.B. Rule, ch. 1, \u00a7 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 304(3) (2017). An employee will then receive workers' compensation benefits under two scenarios.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 205(2), 305 (2017). First, in the event that the employer does not dispute the claim, the employer must begin paying the employee benefits on a weekly basis, plus any accrued compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 205(2). Under this scenario, even where the employer agrees to pay the employee, there may be an accrued amount due for the time period between the employee's notice of claim and the employer's decision to accept the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b6 27] The second scenario in which an employee receives compensation is when the employer disputes the claim. 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 305. Under this scenario, in order to receive benefits, the employee must file a petition for an award with the Workers' Compensation Board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This leads to hearings before an administrative law judge (ALJ) and, unless the employer accepts responsibility during the course of the proceedings, the ALJ renders a decision either denying the claim or granting the claim and awarding the employee benefits for his incapacity. 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 318 (2017). If the employee is still incapacitated, the award will indicate that the employer has a continuing obligation to make ongoing payments and, depending on the decision, the employer may be held responsible for payments retroactive to when the employee's period of incapacity began. The employee's compensation for that past period of time will then be paid in a lump sum by the employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b6 28] Section 221 provides for adjustments to an employee's workers' compensation benefits covering these two scenarios. If the employee is to begin receiving weekly workers' compensation benefits and the employee is also receiving Social Security benefits, then the employer is entitled to an adjustment against the ongoing workers' compensation benefits that it is required to pay. 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221(1). On the other hand, if the employee is set to receive a lump sum workers' compensation payment-retroactive to the employee's period of incapacity-then the employer is entitled to an adjustment against that lump sum payment reflecting a credit for the amount of Social Security benefits the employee received during the \"same time period\" that he or she was entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 29] Accordingly, the plain language of section 221 cannot be interpreted to allow a lump sum credit in the form of a payment \"holiday\"-covering a\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   period of time-to be applied to\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   weekly benefits. Rather, the coordination set out in section 221 must be applied to the same time period for which the employee\n   <em>\n    is receiving\n   </em>\n   Social Security benefits, or to the same time period for which the employee\n   <em>\n    has received\n   </em>\n   Social Security benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 30] Here, the Court does not recognize the distinction between present and past payments in section 221. The Court concluded that the phrase \"credit or reduction\" in 39-A M.R.S. \u00a7 221(3)(B) (2017) signifies a recovery mechanism because a credit \"can only be based on past overpayments.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 16. However, in so reasoning, the Court failed to consider that a \"credit\" is applied when an employee is entitled to-but has not yet received-a lump sum payment for workers' compensation benefits retroactive to the employee's period of incapacity. Similarly, the Court wrongfully concluded that \"credit\" as used in section 221 can only be given meaning by applying it to a future payment \"holiday,\" even though the credit applies to a lump sum payment covering a past period of time. According to the Court, \"[t]he reference to past receipt of retirement benefits demonstrates that the Legislature intended that the amount of incapacity benefits is to be coordinated with other qualifying benefits-including Social Security retirement benefits-even when the benefits were received in the past, before the adjustment is implemented.\" Court's Opinion \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 31] We do not agree, as this analysis fails to take into consideration the lump sum provision in section 221. The language \"credit or reduction\" in section 221(3)(B) is in the disjunctive, and therefore the adjustments to an employee's workers' compensation benefits are intended to address the two methods by which an employee will receive those benefits. It is when the employee receives workers' compensation benefits in a lump sum for a past period of time-as is usual in contested cases-that the adjustment because of Social Security payments received during that period is coordinated with the workers' compensation liability for that same period of time. Stated simply, the statute does not permit an employer to receive a credit for a past period of time, that was never applied, to then be applied to offset ongoing weekly benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B. Policy Consideration\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 32] In addition to correctly concluding that the plain language of the statute denies Interstate the remedy of collecting an overpayment by crediting ongoing weekly benefits, the Appellate Division also properly identified the policy considerations underlying section 221.\n   <em>\n    Urrutia v. Interstate Brands\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    International\n   </em>\n   , Me. W.C.B. No. 16-35, \u00b68 (App. Div. 2016). It acknowledged\n   that the dual purpose of the statute is to (1) \"ensure a minimum income during the period of incapacity,\" and (2) \"prevent a double recovery of both retirement and compensation benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n    651 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   361 ). The Appellate Division reasoned that \"[a]llowing an offset that is concurrent with receipt of more than one type of benefit effectuates both of the articulated purposes, whereas allowing an employer to take a payment holiday from paying benefits to compensate for an offset not taken previously does not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256246\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/651/358/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Court discusses section 221's policy against double recovery. Court's Opinion \u00b6 18.

As such, the Court's remand to the ALJ to consider the issue of a \"hardship analysis\" demonstrates the problem with providing a remedy under section 221 that does not exist.

The Court characterizes this remedy as an \"entitlement\" for the employer. Court's Opinion \u00b6 19.

The Legislature did not provide any remedy in the Act to an employer who overpays as a result of failing to coordinate benefits under section 221, and the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   mechanism that grants an employer any such remedy is limited to the specific scenario contained in section 324(1).
