Andrews and his co-defendant, Randall Mack, of the first-degree premeditated murder while armed of Deyon Rivers, and of additional firearms related offenses arising out of the shooting. Appellant filed both direct and collateral appeals, which were affirmed and denied respectively. In this appeal, his second collateral appeal, appellant raises two new constitutional claims: a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim for the government's suppression of statements by a critical witness, and ineffective assistance of counsel claims for his trial attorney's conflicts of interest with two possible third party perpetrators. The trial court granted an evidentiary hearing on these issues but ultimately denied appellant's \u00a7 23-110 motion. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    The Murder of Deyon Rivers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant and Mack were convicted of the July 7, 2000, first-degree premeditated murder of Deyon Rivers, while Rivers sat in his car near the corner of 18th and C Streets, N.E. We affirmed appellant's conviction on direct appeal, and denied his subsequent request for relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

June 3, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The shooting of Rivers occurred in the wake of an altercation the previous day between Rivers and David Braddy, who was a friend of both appellant and Mack. Braddy had complained to appellant and Mack that Rivers, who did not live in the neighborhood, had shot \"bottle rockets,\" one of which had almost hit Braddy's girlfriend. Braddy was angry about the incident, but the altercation ended without violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the confrontation between Rivers and Braddy, the latter was purportedly in the company of Morris Jones, then fifteen years old. Jones, who suffered from a learning disability as well as low intellectual functioning and substance abuse, was a principal prosecution witness at the trial. According to Jones, he and Braddy spoke with appellant and Mack shortly after Braddy's encounter with Rivers, where\n   Braddy told them what had occurred. Later in the evening, well after midnight, Jones and Braddy were sitting on the porch of Braddy's home, drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. According to Jones, Braddy received a telephone call and went into the house, leaving Jones alone on the porch. After Braddy's departure, Jones saw a car pull up to the corner of 18th and C Streets. He recognized the driver as the individual who had fired the \"bottle rocket\" near Braddy's girlfriend. At this point, appellant and Mack came out of an alley and fired handguns into the vehicle. Jones further testified that he and Braddy encountered appellant on the following day and inquired about the events of the previous night. Appellant told them that he had seen \"a suspicious car coming down the street,\" that he had become \"paranoid or something like that,\" and that he had shot at the car. Jones is the sole witness to place appellant at the crime scene; there was no forensic evidence linking appellant to the murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 21, 2000, approximately two weeks after the shooting, an officer observed an unoccupied burgundy-colored Cadillac in the 300 block of 17th Place, N.E., with an expired rear paper license tag. The officer opened the door of the Cadillac, (which, remarkably, was unlocked) for the purpose,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , of checking the tag against the VIN number. Inside the vehicle, he observed a black ammunition magazine protruding beneath the driver's seat in plain view. The officer called for Crime Scene Search Officers, and they subsequently recovered a Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol loaded with a single round of ammunition, as well as a clip containing 26 rounds. This weapon was ultimately identified as having fired fourteen of the sixteen spent cartridges recovered near Rivers' body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Inside the car, officers found a number of items linking it to appellant. These items included: (1) a vial of prescription medicine in appellant's name; (2) an envelope addressed to appellant; (3) several traffic citations for moving violations, all issued to appellant; and (4) an empty bottle of Vodka with appellant's right palm print on it. The registration was in the name of Deon Long, who was the girlfriend of a friend of appellant. She testified appellant had asked her to \"sign for\" a loan for a car that appellant wanted to buy. Ms. Long signed the paperwork, and appellant took possession of the vehicle. Evidence was also recovered that suggested individuals other than appellant used the vehicle: (1) a hotel receipt with Octavian Brown's name on it, (2) a probation report and referral for drug and alcohol testing for Douglas Quander, and (3) an empty bottle of Vodka found in the Cadillac with twelve usable prints, two of which matched appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While Jones did not report the shooting to police, investigating officers apparently learned that he may have been a witness. On August 22, 2000, the police brought him to the United States Attorney's Office for questioning. By this time, appellant and Mack were the primary suspects because police had recovered the two pistols with which the decedent had been shot to death and each weapon had been in the possession of one of the two defendants. Jones initially told the police that he knew nothing about the shooting, but after being questioned for approximately three hours, Jones identified appellant and Mack as the\n   shooters. He was immediately taken before the grand jury, where he repeated his identification of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, Mack presented the testimony of James Braddy, David Braddy's father. According to James Braddy, he, his wife, and his son were inside the house watching television for a \"couple of hours\" prior to the shooting. When he heard shots, James Braddy went to the porch to investigate, and Jones was not there. Indeed, James Braddy testified that he had not seen Jones anywhere, either that night or on the previous day. He, however, admitted that he had retired upstairs for bed thirty minutes prior to the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    David Braddy's Statements and Grand Jury Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government did not call David Braddy to testify at trial, instead relying on Jones's testimony. Appellant and his codefendant also did not call Braddy to testify in part due to his refusal to speak with defense counsel and their investigators prior to the trial. However, the government had both Braddy's videotaped statements to police and his grand jury testimony in its possession. The government only disclosed limited statements as part of its\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligation, noting a single contradiction between David Braddy and Jones's accounts; specifically, Braddy was home alone on the night of the shooting. Braddy's grand jury testimony, however, differed markedly from Jones's trial testimony. Appellant notes six major contradictions, where either Braddy excludes Jones's presence from key events or Braddy's account markedly differs from Jones's. In addition, Braddy's videotaped interview with police contradicted his grand jury testimony in several respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Co-defendant Randall Mack's Retrial\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the government failed to disclose Braddy's statements for appellant and co-defendant Mack's original trial, the government disclosed the testimony in Mack's retrial. Mack's defense opted this time to call Braddy to testify. Braddy testified that Jones was not present the night of the shooting. Mack's defense argued Jones was not to be believed and that Jones and Braddy intentionally lied to blame appellant and Mack for the murder. The jury was unable to return a verdict, and the court ordered a mistrial. After the mistrial, Mack pled guilty to second-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See United States v. Mack\n   </em>\n   , 2000-FEL-5243 (D.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 8, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellant's Second \u00a7 23-110 Evidentiary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 21, 2014, appellant filed a second \u00a7 23-110 motion presenting two new ineffective assistance of counsel (\"IAC\") claims, a claim of actual innocence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. Judge Ronna L. Beck held four evidentiary hearings from December 2014 through February 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the hearing, Jenifer Wicks, appellant's trial counsel, testified that she worked to develop Braddy as an alternate perpetrator but decided against calling him as a witness because he refused to speak with the defense and she did not possess his grand jury testimony. She testified that statements about Rivers tracking Braddy down and threatening him made Braddy a more credible alternate perpetrator. Had the government disclosed\n   his statements, she would have called Braddy as a defense witness. Wicks further testified that appellant admitted to her that he was one of the two people who shot Rivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 20, 2015, the trial court denied all of appellant's claims in a comprehensive order issued from the bench. In regards to appellant's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, the trial court found Braddy's grand jury testimony and video statements both favorable to the defense and suppressed, satisfying the first two prongs of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the trial court found the statements immaterial. In doing so, the trial court expressed significant skepticism that Wicks would have called Braddy to testify at appellant's trial. The trial court found that Wicks already knew that Braddy contradicted Jones's presence at his house the night of the shooting, although it was only later that she learned that Braddy had very serious harmful testimony to add to the government's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Wicks was still able to elicit contradictions in Jones's testimony through the testimony of James Braddy without David Braddy. The trial court The trial court then noted \"[w]hether Wicks would have called Braddy or not the burden is on the defense to establish that if the Brady information had been disclosed it is reasonably probable that the trial would have had a different result. No such conclusion can be reached in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court also rejected any implication from Mack's mistrial, where Braddy testified for the defense, because Braddy did not have comparably incriminating testimony regarding Mack as he did of appellant. The trial court held that \"under the circumstances, no one can honestly say that it is reasonably probable that the trial would have had a different result given the double-edge sword represented by Braddy's testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellant alleges two constitutional violations on appeal: (1) a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation associated with the government's suppression of David Braddy's statements, which the trial court found immaterial, and (2) a Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel resulting from appellant's conflict of interest with two potential alternate perpetrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government's obligation to disclose material evidence favorable to the accused arises from the Due Process Clause's purpose of preventing miscarriages of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , 373 U.S. at 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This review, however, is improper as step four is inconsistent with the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   materiality analysis.

With respect to the first, the record reveals that it was largely cumulative of other impeachment evidence appellant possessed and had used at trial. \"Although impeaching information does not have a lesser standing in the context of the government's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   disclosure obligations than affirmatively exculpatory information, it can be immaterial ... if it is cumulative and the witness has already been impeached by the same kind of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 922 (footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted).

However, Jones's testimony had already been significantly impeached and his flaws as a witness exposed, so the question is one of degree. Here, had Braddy testified, appellant could have used Braddy's account of the fireworks incident and alleged confession to impeach Jones regarding what amounted to discrepancies in the details. However, his testimony also would have corroborated Jones's testimony that many of those incidents actually occurred. Most notably, Braddy's testimony would have corroborated Jones's testimony that appellant confessed to being involved in the shooting, that Rivers had been killed in his car, and that appellant was present when Braddy described the fireworks incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Considering this evidence in the context of the entire record, we are convinced that there is no reasonable probability that disclosing such information would have produced a different outcome at trial. The jury was well aware of the flaws in Jones's testimony and his overall credibility as a witness.\n   <em>\n    Andrews I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n    922 A.2d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we have difficulty giving significant weight to any further undermining of Jones's credibility especially in light of the other evidence presented at trial including the fact that two weeks after the shooting, MPD officers \"recovered a Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol loaded with a single round of ammunition, as well as a clip containing 26 rounds\" from a burgundy-colored Cadillac,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 454 ; that a disinterested witness testified that she had signed a loan for the car on behalf of appellant; that MPD officers discovered a number of items linking appellant to the car; and an MPD firearms examiner testified that after testing, it was determined that fourteen of the sixteen cartridges recovered near River's body were fired from the Glock that was found in appellant's Cadillac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605024\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1885/#p1893\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We are even less persuaded that Braddy's grand jury testimony was material when we review it without separating the five favorable facts from the six the trial court deemed harmful to appellant's case. For example, Braddy's testimony would have provided further corroboration that appellant regularly drove the Cadillac where one of the murder weapons was recovered, that appellant frequently had that weapon in his possession, that appellant had confessed his role in the shooting to friends, and that he and Mack regularly spent time together. Moreover, Braddy's testimony would have included the fact that his father told him he had looked out of his second-story bedroom window and saw someone running from the scene of the shooting that resembled appellant. While Braddy's father subsequently provided a defense investigator with a statement contradicting his earlier identification of appellant as the person he saw running, had Braddy testified about his conversation with his father, there would have been evidence that a second, and arguably more credible, eyewitness inculpated appellant in the murder. In light of the \"double-edged\" nature of the evidence, when compared to the strong case against appellant, we are unpersuaded that had this evidence not been suppressed there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of appellant's trial would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nor is our materiality assessment swayed by the jury's inability to reach a verdict in Mack's retrial. While Braddy testified in Mack's second trial, appellant fails to account for the fact that Braddy did not have remotely comparable incriminating testimony regarding Mack that he did of appellant. Braddy's grand jury testimony regarding Mack related to two areas: (1) appellant's alleged confession and, (2) Mack's possession of one of the murder weapons. As to the first, in the grand jury Braddy testified that after appellant confessed to the shooting, he had a conversation with Mack. Braddy explained he advised Mack of appellant's confession and Mack responded that appellant \"told me the same thing.\" Braddy further attested that Mack never told him that he was present at the time of the shooting or in a position to observe the shooting. Braddy also testified to his observations of Mack's possession of the murder weapons. He explained that he saw Mack \"with the larger gun\" once before the shooting but that he held the other handgun \"most of the time.\" This testimony had far less an incriminating impact on Mack than Braddy's testimony regarding appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Most notable, however, is the absence of Courtney Burley's testimony in Mack's retrial. At the original trial in 2002, Burley was one of the primary government witnesses implicating Mack, not appellant, in the shooting. Burley, a juvenile with an extensive delinquency record, testified that on the night of the shooting he encountered Mack in an alley near 23rd and C Streets, N.E.\n   <em>\n    Andrews I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n    922 A.2d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As he approached Mack, who was in a concealed position, Mack told him \"that it was about to get hot out there because of some gangster shit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Burley called his brother to pick him up, who arrived approximately fifteen minutes later.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the two drove away, Burley testified he heard the sound of gunshots.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the day following the shooting, Burley again ran into Mack.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"In response to Burley's inquiry regarding what had occurred the previous night, Mack allegedly stated that\n   he had been 'shooting.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308352\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/449/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At Mack's retrial, Burley completely recanted his original trial testimony. The absence of this highly inculpatory testimony as well as the presence of Braddy's testimony, which did not have a remotely comparable incriminating effect on Mack as it did on appellant, leads us to conclude that Mack's retrial has no bearing on our materiality determination in appellant's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we agree with the trial court that there is not a reasonable probability that the withheld evidence would have changed the outcome of appellant's trial. While we find the trial court's error was harmless after a proper\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   analysis, we remind the trial court that a proper materiality evaluation precludes it from considering the actual use of the suppressed evidence and substituting its judgment for that of defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellant also raises two new IAC claims in his second \u00a7 23-110 motion that center on his trial counsel's alleged conflicts of interest from her simultaneous representation of Kevin Bellinger and acceptance of compensation from Octavian Brown, two possible alternative perpetrators. We find appellant's arguments unpersuasive and affirm the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the \u00a7 23-110 evidentiary hearing, Jenifer Wicks was questioned regarding her alleged conflicts with Kevin Bellinger and Octavian Brown. At one of their first meetings, appellant informed Wicks that one of the handguns used in the Rivers murder was the same gun used by Bellinger in an earlier non-fatal shooting that occurred on May 26, 2000. Bellinger was eventually convicted in connection with that earlier shooting on April 5, 2002, and, within a few days, contacted Wicks requesting her representation during his sentencing and post-trial proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wicks visited Bellinger in jail a few days later and they discussed possible representation and fee arrangements, but it wasn't until after appellant's trial had concluded in May of 2002 that Wicks formally agreed to represent Bellinger during his sentencing and post-conviction proceedings and entered her appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appellant alleges that when Wicks met with Bellinger an actual conflict of interest was created. He argues that Wicks used confidential information regarding the weapon, which she learned from appellant, \"to file a motion on behalf of Bellinger seeking access to ballistics evidence from the Rivers murder\" with the goal of presenting Mack as a third party perpetrator in Bellinger's case, but never sought the same ballistics evidence to present Bellinger as a third party perpetrator in his case as a possible defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to the conflict with Bellinger, appellant alleges that Wicks possessed a second conflict with Octavian Brown because (1) Brown had agreed to pay Wicks an initial $5,000 retainer fee to represent appellant but still owed $1,500 by the time of trial and (2) Wicks was also representing Brown in two unrelated traffic cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant argues that the representation created a conflict because some of the evidence in his case alluded to a connection\n   between Brown and the Rivers murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Wicks testified that her contacts with Brown did not negatively affect her representation of appellant. She further testified that she made it clear to appellant that her duty was to him and not to those paying her fee but also acknowledged that she never discussed the possibility that appellant and Brown could have had adverse interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial court rejected both IAC claims. It found that Wicks and Bellinger lacked an attorney-client relationship until after appellant's trial and credited Wicks's testimony that she held nothing back out of loyalty to Bellinger. The trial court further determined that Bellinger was not a sustainable third party perpetrator because there was no evidence discovered that, despite what the trial court considered best efforts by Wicks and her investigator, put Bellinger near the scene of the murder during the relevant times. Similarly, the trial court rejected appellant's claim of a conflict due to the fiduciary relationship between Wicks and Brown because appellant's retainer agreement with Wicks clearly set forth her duty of loyalty to appellant, notwithstanding any fee payments by Brown. Again crediting Wicks's testimony, the trial court found that the payment arrangement had no impact on her trial strategy because, like Bellinger, there was no evidence that Brown was present during the day and night in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Our review of the trial court's determination of whether a conflict of interest exists is a deferential one, presenting a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Alston v.

Appellant's entire argument can be summarized as \"guilt by association.\" It relies exclusively on evidence that Bellinger had access to the murder weapon linked to Mack and to the Cadillac-as did many others in the neighborhood-in order to assert a \"plausible defense strategy,\" while wholly ignoring the dearth of evidence placing Bellinger at the scene during the fireworks incident or in the neighborhood near the time of the shooting. Further, the record clearly indicates the scope of Wicks's investigative efforts and the information she obtained. Wicks testified that she and her investigator looked for any evidence linking Bellinger to the scene of the murder. They interviewed Bellinger himself, who provided an alibi that he was in Maryland during the relevant time period. They interviewed mutual friends of Bellinger and appellant to either confirm or deny Bellinger's absence. Wicks was unable to uncover any evidence that Bellinger was in the neighborhood the evening of the shooting or during the early morning hours. When asked why she did not present Bellinger as an alternative perpetrator, Wicks testified that she was unable to establish that Bellinger had the means, motive, or opportunity to murder Rivers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, even though\n   there was evidence that linked Bellinger to one of the murder weapons six weeks earlier, there was no evidence that connected him to the weapon on the day of the murder, no evidence that connected him to the Cadillac other than the fact that it was shared by a number of people in the neighborhood, and no evidence that indicated he had any motive to kill Rivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   There is simply no reasonable possibility that Bellinger was involved in the River's murder or that he had a practical opportunity to be involved. Certainly, he previously possessed one of the murder weapons used in this heinous crime, but that fact alone is insufficient under\n   <em>\n    Winfield\n   </em>\n   and its progeny to offer Bellinger as a viable third party perpetrator. For these reasons, appellant has failed to sustain his IAC claim of a possible conflict from Wicks's connection to Bellinger, and we affirm the trial court's ruling in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Appellant makes a similar IAC claim with regard to Octavian Brown, a third party who paid for appellant's legal services. In this instance, appellant contends that Wicks also failed to present Brown as a third party perpetrator because he paid appellant's legal fees and still owed Wicks $1,500 when appellant's case went to trial. Again however, the only evidence linking Brown to the Rivers murder was his shared access to the Cadillac and the murder weapon contained therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The trial court once again rejected appellant's argument, finding that Wicks \"did not have an actual conflict of interest, and her trial strategy was in no way impacted by any conflict of interest.\" In coming to that determination, the trial court credited Wicks's testimony that the retainer agreement signed by both Brown and appellant clearly indicated that Wicks's loyalty was to appellant, notwithstanding Brown's payments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Brown's payments had no impact on her trial strategy because of the insufficient evidence linking Brown to the Rivers murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a four-day evidentiary hearing, the trial court recognized that Wicks's most sound trial strategy was to have the jury believe Mack and Braddy murdered Rivers, but also to establish that the police did an inadequate investigation and that other people in the neighborhood had access to the murder weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We agree with the trial court that there was no conflict of interest due to Brown's payment of appellant's legal fees or due to Wicks's representation of Brown in two unrelated traffic offenses. Simultaneous representation and third party fee agreements do not automatically equate a conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malede\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11123449\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/767/267/#p272\">\n    767 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   272 ;\n   <em>\n    Veney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11573033\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/738/1185/#p1192\">\n    738 A.2d at 1192-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor are we persuaded by appellant's contention that a small outstanding debt would cause a professional attorney to outright forgo a plausible defense strategy for his or her client, whom was facing considerable incarceration for first-degree murder. Finally, for the same reasons discussed above, we are unconvinced that Wicks would have been able to present Brown as a viable third party perpetrator because, on these\n   facts, there was even less evidence linking Brown to the murder weapons and the scene of the shooting than there was for Bellinger. As such, Wicks's performance was not adversely affected nor was appellant deprived of a plausible defense strategy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Derrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7866143\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/1125/#p1133\">\n    681 A.2d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because appellant has failed to meet his burden in demonstrating an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his counsel's performance, we affirm the trial court's ruling that he was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     Brady v.
