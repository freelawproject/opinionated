In making this argument, the defendant acknowledges that Supreme Court precedent must be overturned for him to be able to prevail on this claim. The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly failed to caution the jury regarding the dangers of uncorroborated accomplice testimony and improperly admitted a witness' prior inconsistent statement. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On May 29, 2013, the defendant and Sedwick Daniels robbed a CVS store in Glastonbury. The store manager, Thang Trang, was in his office counting cash and monitoring the store's surveillance cameras, while another CVS employee, Roberto Orellana, was at the cash register. No other employees were working. The defendant and Daniels arrived between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. When Trang saw the two men enter the store on the surveillance footage, he left his office to offer them assistance. When the defendant and Daniels declined, Trang returned to his office and continued to count the store's cash and to monitor the cameras. The defendant and Daniels began placing merchandise in laundry bags that they had brought with them. Daniels went behind the counter and began to place cartons of cigarettes into his bag. Meanwhile, the defendant approached Orellana\n   and demanded that he open the register. Trang ran from his office to intervene. The defendant put his hand in his pocket as if he had a gun and threatened Trang. After taking money from the register, the defendant and Daniels left the store. As they drove away, Trang went outside and wrote down the car's license plate number. Orellana called 911, and Glastonbury police arrived to take Trang and Orellana's verbal and written statements, and the license plate number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The responding officer \"radioed [the license plate number] into dispatch who put it out over the hotline.\" The car was traced\n   to an incident from earlier that same day. The car had run out of gas on the highway, and State Trooper Erin Lowney responded. Glastonbury police later showed CVS' surveillance footage of the robbery to Lowney. Lowney could not make a positive identification, but told the Glastonbury police that although \"one of the body types didn't look similar to anyone in the car ... one of the body types\" looked similar to Daniels. Daniels and his cousin, Kenneth Millege, were the occupants of the car Lowney had encountered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 30, 2013, the day following the CVS robbery, Farmington police stopped the same car in response to a shoplifting incident at Westfarms Mall. Glastonbury police arrived at the scene and interviewed two of the car's occupants, Millege and Kirk McDowell. McDowell told the police that the previous day he had seen Millege give the car to Daniels, the defendant, and a third individual. Subsequently, Glastonbury police arrested Daniels. Upon arrest, Daniels told the police that the defendant had been the other participant in the CVS robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The police subsequently arrested the defendant and charged him for his involvement in the CVS robbery. At trial, Daniels, who had already pleaded guilty to\n   charges stemming from this incident, testified about the robbery, again identifying the defendant as the other participant. The jury found the defendant guilty. On February 13, 2015, the defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of eight years of incarceration followed by two years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant first claims that he was convicted on the basis of uncorroborated accomplice testimony which, as a matter of law, is insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argues that this court is bound by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stebbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"530614\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/29/463/\">\n    29 Conn. 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1861), and its progeny, which do not require corroboration for accomplice testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our Supreme Court has long held that accomplice testimony does not require corroboration to sustain a conviction.

The parties agree that this claim of instructional error is unpreserved and may be subject to the implied waiver announced in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The defendant nevertheless seeks to prevail on this claim pursuant to the plain error doctrine, as set forth by Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/#p808\">\n    324 Conn. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver does not preclude appellate relief under the plain error doctrine\"). The state argues that the court did not commit plain error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When a party does not preserve a claim, the rules of practice allow this court to review the trial court's decision for plain error. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily [discernible] on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable.... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record. Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application.... [T]he plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate.... [Our Supreme Court] described the two-pronged nature of the plain error doctrine: [An appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   so clear\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/#p808\">\n    324 Conn. at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At trial, Daniels testified that he and the defendant had participated in the May 29, 2013 robbery together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Daniels\n   explained that he had returned to Hartford from shoplifting in New London and was approached by the defendant about robbing a CVS store that night. Daniels described how he and the defendant stole merchandise from the store, and he identified himself and the defendant in a series of CVS' surveillance photographs. On both direct examination and cross-examination, Daniels answered questions about his prior convictions and about the agreement he had made with the state to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony. During closing arguments, however, only the state drew attention to the issue of whether Daniels' testimony was corroborated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court instructed the jury that it should \"decide which testimony to believe and which testimony not to believe\" and that it could \"believe all, none or any part of any witness' testimony.\" The court listed a number of factors for the jury to consider, including whether \"the witness [had] an interest in the outcome of this case or any bias or prejudice concerning any party or any matter involved in this case,\" \"how reasonable was the witness' testimony when considered in light of all the evidence in the case,\" and whether \"the witness'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   testimony [was] contradicted by what that witness has said or done at another time, or by the testimony of other witnesses or by other evidence.\" The court then provided the jury with a specific accomplice testimony instruction, highlighting that \"[i]n weighing the testimony of an accomplice who is a self-confessed criminal, you should consider that fact. It may be that you would not believe a person who has committed a crime as readily as you would believe a person of good character. In weighing the testimony of an accomplice who has not yet been sentenced, you should keep in mind that he may in his own mind be looking for some favorable treatment in the sentence of his own case. Therefore, he may have such an interest in the outcome of this case that his testimony may have been colored by that fact. Therefore, you must look with particular [care] at the testimony of an accomplice and scrutinize it very carefully before you accept it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court's instructions continued as follows: \"There are many offenses that are of such a character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those who are themselves implicated in the crime. It is for you to decide what credibility you will give to a witness who has admitted his involvement and criminal wrongdoing, whether you will believe or disbelieve the testimony of a person who by his own admission has committed or contributed to the crime charged by the state here. Like all other questions of credibility, this is a question you must\n   decide based on all the evidence presented to you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant argues that the accomplice instruction the court provided to the jury did not adequately warn the jury of the dangers of relying on uncorroborated accomplice testimony. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The law does not require \"the judge, whenever an accomplice testifies, to instruct the jury that it is not\n   safe to convict on his testimony alone.... It is the character and interest of the witness, as shown upon the trial, and not the mere fact of his being an accomplice, that must determine the discretion of the judge in commenting on his credibility. The conditions of character and interest most inconsistent with a credible witness, very frequently, but not always, attend an accomplice when he testifies.

The instruction noted that \"[t]here are many offenses that are of such a character that the only persons capable\n   of giving useful testimony are those who are themselves implicated in the crime\" and that the jury should consider this testimony in light of all other evidence. The court also provided the jury with a general witness instruction, which similarly instructed the jury to weigh a witness' testimony in light of his interest in the case and all the other evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the court did not use the word \"corroboration,\" the court instructed the jury to consider other evidence when weighing all witnesses', as well as an accomplice's, testimony. Because the law does not require that an accomplice's testimony be corroborated\n   for the jury to accept it and because the law does not require the court to instruct the jury that it is unsafe to rely on uncorroborated accomplice testimony, there is no patent and obvious error that requires reversal under the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted McDowell's statement to the police as a prior inconsistent statement. On appeal, the defendant argues that McDowell's statement to the police did not satisfy the personal knowledge requirement of\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6502713,6503432,6503325,6503216,6503540,6502614,6502425,6502525,6503134\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) ; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-5(1). The state argues that, at trial, the defendant did not object to the statement's admission on this ground and, in the alternative,\n   that McDowell possessed the requisite personal knowledge. Assuming that the defendant preserved this claim, we agree with the state that the statement itself demonstrates that McDowell had personal knowledge of the facts in the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. On May 30, 2013, the police questioned McDowell about the previous day's CVS robbery. He provided a signed written statement to the police whereby he indicated the following: \"Yesterday when I was at my house, I saw Kenny [Millege] give [Daniels], [the defendant], and [a third individual] the car I was stopped in today by the police at West Farms Mall.

When McDowell insisted that he had not seen Millege give them the car but, rather, that Millege had told him who he gave the car to, and that he did not remember everything he had said to the police, the assistant state's attorney sought to offer McDowell's May 30 statement as a prior inconsistent statement under\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   . Defense counsel objected to the admission of the statement because it \"totally lack[ed] the indicia of reliability needed to come in under [\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ]\" because McDowell had been falling asleep and \"high on heroin when [he] gave the statement.\" The court initially sustained the objection because of the statement's inherent unreliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the next trial day, the state asked the court to reconsider its ruling, arguing that under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2494886\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/141/#p151\">\n    78 Conn.
