Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of numerous charges stemming from his participation in two burglaries and a sexual assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was DNA evidence, as well as testimonial, fingerprint, and documentary evidence, linking appellant to these crimes. The District of Columbia Department of Forensic Sciences (\"DFS\") conducted DNA testing and analysis, and one of its forensic scientists testified to DFS's findings at appellant's trial. However, another DNA expert, Dr. Bruce Budowle, disagreed with some, but not all, of DFS's statistical interpretations of the DNA evidence found in appellant's case, and Dr. Budowle testified as to his own findings. Nevertheless, both DFS and Dr. Budowle came to the expert conclusion that appellant or his partner in crime, DeAundre Williams, were possible contributors to at least some of the DNA samples collected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Post-trial but pre-sentencing, the government disclosed to appellant that a panel of experts, which included Dr. Budowle, convened by the United States Attorney's Office (\"USAO\"), had identified certain, systematic issues with DFS's interpretations of DNA evidence, based on Dr. Budowle's work in appellant's case. Based on this disclosure, appellant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial court denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Super. Ct. Crim. R. 33 (\" Rule 33\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, appellant challenges the trial court's decision to deny his motion for a new trial. He claims that DFS's systemic problems undermined the reliability of the DNA evidence presented at his trial and, thus, confidence in the verdict. Appellant also argues merger; he claims that his three third-degree sexual abuse convictions for acts committed against one victim merge into one count, and that his eight possession of a firearm during a crime of violence (\"PFCV\") convictions also merge into just one count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for a new trial. We conclude that the government's post-trial disclosure regarding systematic concerns with DFS's interpretations of DNA evidence would not have changed the outcome of appellant's case. The jury heard from Dr. Budowle as to his concerns with DFS's\n   DNA analysis, as well as his own calculations and interpretations of the DNA evidence. Further, the DNA evidence constituted a relatively minor portion of the government's evidence in the totality. We also affirm on the issue of merger. Appellant's three third-degree sexual abuse convictions and his eight PFCV convictions do not merge because each count is predicated on a distinct act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The government's evidence at trial proved to the jury that appellant, with the help of another individual, DeAundre \"Dre\" Williams,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   committed two home invasion burglaries in Northeast Washington, D.C. between June 4 and June 5, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government also proved that, during the course of the second home invasion, appellant sexually assaulted the female occupant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. 1105 Sixth Street, Northeast\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first incident occurred at a townhouse located at 1105 Sixth Street, Northeast. At around 11:00 a.m. on June 4, one of its residents, Ameya Bhende,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   discovered that his laptop and book bag, along with his roommate's laptop, were missing. Mr. Bhende also noticed that the keys to his vehicle, a gray Mitsubishi Galant, were missing, and that the vehicle itself, which Mr. Bhende had parked \"just around the corner,\" was gone. Inspecting the house, Mr. Bhende detected that one of the kitchen windows, along with the window screen, was open, and that the front door was already unlocked, which Mr. Bhende thought was \"a little unusual.\" The Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") subsequently recovered Mr. Bhende's vehicle around the 2500 block of Second Street, Northeast, near the site of the second burglary, and towed the vehicle to a consolidated forensics laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police recovered appellant's fingerprint from the interior bottom frame of the open kitchen window.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   From Mr. Bhende's vehicle, the police recovered appellant's fingerprint from the exterior front passenger door window frame and Mr. Williams's fingerprint from the exterior front passenger door window. The police also recovered DNA samples from inside Mr. Bhende's vehicle that were consistent with appellant's and Mr. Williams's DNA profiles. Specifically, expert witnesses DFS DNA Analyst Krystyna Hopkinson\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Dr. Budowle\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   agreed\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that neither appellant\n   nor Mr. Williams could be excluded as possible contributors to DNA found on a cigarette butt recovered from the vehicle and from DNA recovered from the steering wheel. Additionally, they agreed that Mr. Williams's known DNA profile matched the major male contributor samples recovered from the interior driver's door handle and from the interior passenger door handle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. 2432 Second Street, Northeast\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second incident occurred at a house located at 2432 Second Street, Northeast. The upstairs bedroom was shared by husband, J.B., and wife, E.H.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   while the basement bedroom was occupied by their friend, Allison Schneider. During the early-morning hours on June 5, 2013, Mr. B. and Ms. H. were sleeping in their bedroom when they were suddenly woken up by two masked men, one pointing a handgun directly at them and one holding a knife. The government's theory at trial was that the gunman was appellant, while the man with the knife was Mr. Williams. Mr. B. described the gunman as being roughly six foot, \"slender build,\" and \"medium to dark complexion,\" which approximated appellant's physique. Mr. B. also noted in court that appellant looked \"[v]ery, very similar\" to the gunman based on his height, \"the long arms, his torso, just the structure of his body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon waking up Mr. B. and Ms. H., the gunman repeatedly yelled, \"[W]here's the money at, where's the money at\" and \"[S]hut the f**k up,\" and ordered them to \"[p]ut [their] head[s] underneath [their] pillow[s].\" Both Mr. B. and Ms. H. complied by rolling onto their stomachs and putting their faces on their pillows. Mr. B. also informed the men that his wallet was in the adjacent office. The gunman thereafter directed the man with the knife to, \"Get it all, let's get it all,\" and, in response, the man with the knife exited the bedroom, went into the office, and then moved downstairs, ostensibly to find other things of value to steal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, the gunman, now alone with Mr. B. and Ms. H., approached Ms. H.'s side of the bed and lifted off the duvet covers, thereby exposing Ms. H.'s nightgown and bare bottom. Appellant then \"slapped [Ms. H.'s] a**,\" while repeatedly saying that, \"He really liked this. This is what he wanted.\" When Mr. B. became unnerved by the gunman's comments and turned to look at him, the gunman pistol whipped Mr. B. in the head. Turning his sights back on Ms. H., the gunman threatened that he was \"going to be, you know, all up in this.\" He forced Ms. H. to roll onto her back and stroked the front of her body, including her breasts, stomach, and upper thigh. Ms. H. instinctively flipped back onto her stomach and recalled that the gunman then \"took the barrel of the gun and sort of moved it in between [her] legs and in between [her] buttocks.\" The gun was so high up Ms. H.'s thighs that it was \"very, very close\" to the outside of her vulva. The gunman next grabbed Ms. H.'s \"hips and threw her on to her knees,\" and pulled her towards his pelvic region. He also pistol whipped Mr. B. again. Having positioned Ms. H., the gunman attempted to unzip his pants. To prevent his wife from being raped and seeing an opening, Mr. B. lunged at the gunman and made an effort to grab the handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A struggle between the gunman and Mr. B. ensued. As the two men fought, Ms. H. \"raced out of the room\" and \"ran down the steps,\" while yelling for Ms. Schneider to call 911. Meanwhile, during the ensuing struggle, the gunman started yelling for his cohort to come help him. Mr. B. heard\n   the gunman say \"Jay, Jay,\" which sounds like Mr. Williams's nickname, \"Dre.\" Both intruders then started to beat Mr. B., and as they attempted to escape the residence, the gunman fired one round at Mr. B., but missed. The intruders stole Mr. B.'s wallet, containing fifty dollars and his debit and credit cards, a MacBook Pro computer, a Dell computer, two iPhones, and a backpack. The police subsequently recovered a clear imprint of appellant's left palm on the hand railing inside the residence. Dr. Budowle further testified that neither Mr. B. nor Mr. Williams could be excluded from a knife recovered from the scene, and that Mr. Williams also could not be excluded from a shirt recovered from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Appellant's Confession\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government's evidence also included key testimony from Jamir Graham, a friend of appellant and Mr. Williams. Mr. Graham testified that in the early-morning hours of June 5, he was sleeping at home when he was woken up by Mr. Williams standing near him while holding two iPhones and an unfamiliar wallet. Appellant arrived shortly after and appeared \"[w]orried\" and \"eager to leave.\" Then, a few days later, Mr. Graham ran into appellant again, whereupon appellant confessed to his involvement in the burglary and sexual assault at 2432 Second Street, Northeast. Appellant told Mr. Graham specific details of the crime. He told Mr. Graham that he and Mr. Williams went up the steps of the house, and that he yelled at the couple, \"[W]here's the money at?\" Appellant also admitted to \"pull[ing] the covers off the lady,\" \"[s]mack[ing] the lady on her a**,\" and putting the gun to her \"p**sy.\" He said that the \"husband charged at him,\" and that he \"f**ked up\" by yelling \"Dre['s] name\" for help. Lastly, he admitted to firing the gun at the husband and thought that he had hit him before fleeing the scene. Based on the above evidence, in addition to other evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the jury convicted appellant for crimes related to his involvement in the 1105 Sixth Street and 2432 Second Street home invasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion for a New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to trial, the government disclosed to appellant that it had asked Dr. Budowle to review DFS's DNA test results in this case, and \"to recalculate all of the statistics related to DNA testing done on items collected from 2432 [Second] Street, Northeast, and the car stolen from 1105 [Sixth] Street, Northeast.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of Dr. Budowle's findings was that, while he agreed\n   with DFS's allele decisions, and generally the \"inclusions and exclusions\" made by DFS, he disagreed with a few of the statistical calculations performed by DFS under the combined probability of inclusion (\"CPI\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the random match probability (\"RMP\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   methods. An \"allele\" is a \"genetic variation\" that is inherited from a person's mother and father. Alleles produce distinct traits that are passed from parent to offspring. An \"inclusion\" means the sample matches the reference sample \"taken directly from an individual in which the identity of that person is known.\" Conversely, an \"exclusion\" means the sample does not match.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Subsequently at trial, DFS DNA Analyst Hopkinson first explained to the jury how DNA testing is conducted and the specific DNA testing that she performed in this case. Ms. Hopkinson then testified to her conclusions for each piece of DNA evidence recovered by the police. She testified to the number of possible contributors for each DNA sample recovered, and whether the alleles of appellant, Mr. Williams, and/or the victims could be included or excluded, or whether no conclusions could be drawn, for each sample. Notably, Ms. Hopkinson did not reveal the statistical calculations underlying her inclusion and exclusion decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Budowle testified to his review of Ms. Hopkinson's DNA testing in this case; he agreed with Ms. Hopkinson's determinations of whether the alleles match or did not match the suspects or victims, and generally agreed with her inclusions and exclusions as well. However, in a few instances, Dr. Budowle \"felt that [DFS] over extended themselves and used some markers for statistics that [he] thought they shouldn't if they were following the protocol.\" Dr. Budowle then testified to his own statistical calculations for each DNA sample recovered in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following appellant's trial, but prior to sentencing, the government informed appellant by letter dated March 10, 2015, that subsequent to Dr. Budowle's work in this case, DFS initiated an internal investigation regarding its protocols for calculating DNA mixtures and issued two reports on November 19, 2014. When the USAO learned of the issue, it convened a panel of three experts, which included Dr. Budowle, to review DFS's DNA analysis in other cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel's Final Report\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   dated\n   April 22, 2015, identified five primary systematic concerns with DFS's interpretations of forensic DNA mixtures,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and made recommendations on how to remedy those concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the government's disclosure of its investigation and the Final Report, on September 1, 2015, appellant filed a Rule 33 motion for a new trial. Appellant argued in the motion that the government \"relied heavily on DNA evidence in convicting\" him, but that his case was the \"first of over thirty (30) cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   that [brought] to light serious problems with [DFS's] handling of DNA sample[s] submitted for analysis.\" Appellant further asserted that the panel's recommendations \"unequivocally demonstrate the unreliability of DFS testing and invalidates\n   <em>\n    the entire testing process\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that he was entitled to a new trial. (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government opposed the motion and countered that the DNA testing conducted in this case was reliable and accurate, and that the only point of concern was with regard to DFS's \"computation of statistics that resulted in DFS overstating the rarity of certain mixture profiles.\" The government attached Dr. Budowle's affidavit to the opposition, in which Dr. Budowle affirmed that, while he had concerns with the statistical analysis performed by DFS, the actual \"DNA typing\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   [i.e., DFS's handling of the DNA samples, and the chemistry and bench work] were reliable, based on all the control samples that were run,\" and that \"[i]f the results were not reliable, [he] would not have provided any statistical calculations.\" The government also asserted that evidence pertaining to DFS's systematic issues would not have led to an acquittal because the evidence against appellant was overwhelming, and that if appellant had \"cross-examined Ms. Hopkinson and Dr. Budowle on the systematic issues at DFS, the jury would have learned from Dr. Budowle-the most knowledgeable, experienced and published DNA scientist in the world ...-that these issues did not impact the DNA evidence presented to the jury in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court denied appellant's motion for a new trial after hearing arguments on the motion. The court noted that there were no concerns with the actual DNA testing in this case, and that the systematic concerns that were later identified with DFS, had they been raised at appellant's trial, would have gone to the \"impeachment of Ms. Hopkinson regarding [her]\n   <em>\n    interpretation\n   </em>\n   of [the] mixture evidence.\" (emphasis added). The court further observed that the DNA evidence in this case, although \"not unimportant,\" was not the \"key evidence.\" The trial court concluded that key evidence in this case were the fingerprints found at both burglary scenes\n   and also appellant's confession to Mr. Graham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to grant his motion for a new trial. He again asserts that the DNA evidence was \"critical to the government's case,\" and that disclosure of DFS's systematic concerns would have led to his acquittal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the trial court's decision to deny appellant's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 33, the trial court may grant a motion for a new trial \"if required in the 'interests of justice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ingram v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314786\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/887/#p901\">\n    40 A.3d 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 901 (D.C. 2012) (quoting Super. Ct. Crim. R. 33 ). A Rule 33 motion based upon a claim of newly discovered evidence requires appellant to show that: \"(1) the evidence is newly discovered; (2) the moving party was diligent in seeking to obtain the evidence; (3) the evidence is material to the issues involved and not merely cumulative or impeaching; and (4) it is of a nature that it would probably produce an acquittal.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

The \"trial court does not need to hold a hearing before ruling on a motion for a new trial,\" and our review on appeal is \"confined to determining whether there has been an abuse of [ ] discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ingram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314786\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/887/#p901\">\n    40 A.3d at 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, there is no dispute that the systematic concerns with DFS's interpretations of DNA evidence constitute newly discovered evidence, and that appellant would not have discovered this information regardless of diligence. Instead, the parties argue over whether (a) this new evidence can be considered material and \"not merely cumulative or impeaching\" and (b) whether the evidence, had it been discovered, would \"probably produce an acquittal.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110411\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/826/398/#p414\">\n    826 A.2d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, we conclude that the concerns with DFS were not material to appellant's case. The information that the government disclosed following trial regarding the systematic concerns with DFS's DNA statistical calculations were similar to concerns that were present during appellant's trial, and which were known to appellant prior to trial. Concerns with DFS's statistical analyses of DNA evidence discovered in other cases do not bring up any new concerns with its analysis of the DNA conducted in appellant's case because the government had called Dr. Budowle to expressly recalculate the statistics for all of the DNA samples recovered in this case prior to trial. At trial, he testified to his concerns with DFS's calculations, and provided the jury with his own findings and the correct calculations, which appellant does not dispute. In fact, Ms. Hopkinson of DFS never revealed her statistical calculations at trial, so the jury did not hear about any calculations that Dr. Budowle would have concerns about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, none of the evidence at trial, nor the post-trial disclosures by the government, cast doubt on DFS's actual\n   <em>\n    testing\n   </em>\n   of the DNA samples in this case or any other case sampled. Dr. Budowle's affidavit explained that, if he had concerns with the reliability of the DNA testing performed by DFS, he would not have even \"provided any statistical calculations.\" Accordingly, the fact that there were problems with DFS's statistical calculations for DNA found in other cases, if revealed at trial, would, at best, go toward further impeachment of Ms. Hopkinson's testimony. But our case law is clear that new \"[e]vidence which is merely impeaching or cumulative ... cannot be the basis of a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Huggins v.

The evidence of appellant's involvement in the second home invasion on Second Street was overwhelming. DNA evidence played little role in proving this part of the government's case, as it consisted solely of Dr. Budowle testifying that Mr. Williams could not be excluded as a contributor to the knife and shirt recovered from the scene. Mr. B. testified that appellant looked \"very, very similar\" to the masked gunman who attacked him at close range and sexually assaulted his wife. He also recalled appellant yell \"Jay,\" which sounds like Mr. Williams's nickname, \"Dre.\" A very clear handprint belonging to appellant was found on the hand railing inside of the home. Further, Mr. Graham testified in great detail to appellant's confession that he had committed the home invasion and sexual assault at 2432 Second Street, Northeast. There were also business records indicating that first, Mr. Williams, and later, Mr. Graham, were in possession of Mr. B.'s debit and credit cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Other forensic evidence demonstrating appellant's involvement in the first home invasion on Sixth Street was also significant. Specifically, his and Mr. Williams's fingerprints were recovered from both inside the residence and on Mr. Bhende's vehicle. Moreover, even excluding Ms. Hopkinson's testimony in its totality, Dr. Budowle's DNA analysis, alone, placed both appellant and Mr. Williams inside of Mr. Bhende's stolen vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

On the other hand, in\n   <em>\n    Cullen v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   , we noted that merger was appropriate in\n   <em>\n    Cullen\n   </em>\n   in part because the defendant did not order the victim to \"change her physical position.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327128\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/612/#p614\">\n    919 A.2d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The situation here, however, demonstrates that appellant forced Ms. H. to switch positions in order to touch the front\n   of her body. Importantly, there was also an interruption between the two assaultive acts: appellant turned to Mr. B. and struck him in the face with his gun before turning back to Ms. H. and touching her breast. When appellant turned back to Ms. H. after striking Mr. B., he was satisfying a \"fresh impulse\" to sexually assault her in a different way. We conclude that, on these facts, appellant's actions demonstrate an intention on his part to satisfy a different sexual impulse and is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Cullen\n   </em>\n   where the defendant, in rapid succession, made contact with two points on the victim's front side of her body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We further conclude that appellant's subsequent use of a handgun in touching Ms. H.'s thighs and buttocks constitutes a fresh impulse that makes merger inappropriate. Use of a handgun to threaten another's private area contemplates a termination of appellant's original intent to engage in mere physical contact with Ms. H.'s body with his hand, and the creation of a fresh impulse to threaten Ms. H. with a dangerous weapon in order to satisfy a different kind of sexual gratification. It \"surely\" was a \"conscious and deliberate\" decision on the part of appellant to stop using his hand and to instead use the handgun to touch Ms. H.'s bottom and inner thigh.\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327128\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/612/#p614\">\n    919 A.2d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the third-degree sexual abuse statute criminalizes both the use of \"force\" against another and through \"threatening or placing that other person in reasonable fear that any person will be subject to death, bodily injury, or kidnapping.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-3004\">\n    D.C.

Appellant's use of his hand to touch Ms. H., and then a handgun to threaten Ms. H., arguably denotes the legislature's attempt to distinguish different counts of third-degree sexual abuse based on differences in the nature and character of the acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Rengifo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9329755\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/815/351/#p354\">\n    815 A.2d at 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We quickly dispose of appellant's merger claim as to his eight counts of PFCV.

Setting aside the three counts of third-degree sexual abuse, we conclude the other five counts of PFCV are all predicated on distinct acts. Each time, appellant was at a \"fork in the road\" and had an opportunity to reconsider his actions from the moment when he entered into the house with a gun, to pointing the handgun at Mr. B. and Ms. H., to attempting to rape Ms. H.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   to pistol whipping Mr. B., and lastly to shooting at Mr. B. as he attempted to escape the residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spain v.
