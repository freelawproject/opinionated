These complexities are compounded when we consider a statute's relationship with equitable\n   doctrines. The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive scheme to identify and protect the rights of individuals in nursing facilities in Maryland called the Patient's Bill of Rights. Md. Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-343\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . of the Health-General (\"HG\") Article. In this case, we are asked to decide whether the Attorney General has authority to request injunctive relief against a nursing facility pursuant to two different provisions of the Patient's Bill of Rights.\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Neiswanger Management Services, LLC (\"Neiswanger\") operates four Maryland nursing facilities\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   located in Anne Arundel County (\"New Annapolis\"), Montgomery County (\"NMS Silver Spring\" and \"NMS Springbrook\"), and Prince George's County (\"NMS Hyattsville\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 21, 2016, the State of Maryland, through the Attorney General, filed a two-count Complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Neiswanger and other related corporate and individual defendants. The Complaint alleged violations of the Patient's Bill of Rights, and the Maryland False Health Claims Act, HG \u00a7\u00a7 2-601\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Count One, the subject of this appeal, related to allegedly unlawful resident discharges from Neiswanger facilities in violation of HG \u00a7\u00a7 19-345, 19-345.1, and 19-345.2, as well as multiple provisions of COMAR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State alleged that Neiswanger engages in a widespread pattern of unlawful involuntary discharges of residents from their nursing facilities. These practices include involuntary discharges to homeless shelters or \"sham assisted living facilities\" with operators who unlawfully exploit residents' public benefits. Neiswanger discharged residents to shelters or facilities far from residents' hometowns and families. Many evicted residents are ultimately hospitalized, at the State's expense, with serious or life-threatening medical complications caused by the evictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To support its claims about the breadth of Neiswanger's alleged misconduct, the State asserted that during a 17-month period, from January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016, Neiswanger issued involuntary discharge notices to at least 1,061 residents. In 1,038 of these discharge notices, Neiswanger stated that the resident was discharged for failure to pay, or for failure to arrange for payment from Medicare,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Medicaid,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or another third-party payor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By contrast, the State observed that during the same 17-month period, all of Maryland's other 225 licensed nursing facilities issued approximately 510 involuntary discharge notices. It claimed that \"more than 700 people\" who \"reside in the five NMS facilities,\" could be affected by Neiswanger's unlawful discharge practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State provided detailed factual narratives of eight Neiswanger residents' discharges between October 2015 and August 2016. These residents were improperly discharged to family members' homes, homeless shelters, or predatory unlicensed assisted living facilities in violation of the Patient's Bill of Rights. One resident was left outside a family member's home on a hot day. Residents were sent to unfamiliar locations. In many cases, Neiswanger failed to communicate with residents and their family members regarding discharge plans. Three of the named residents had been evicted from Neiswanger facilities on multiple occasions over a period of several years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State asserted that Neiswanger unlawfully discharges residents to benefit from the public-insurance payment system for residents of nursing facilities in Maryland. Medicare recipients\n   are entitled to up to 100 days' coverage in a nursing facility after a qualifying hospital stay. For the first 20 days of a resident's stay, Medicare pays the full reimbursement rate, and an 80% reimbursement rate for days 21 to 100. Some residents may be \"dual eligibles,\" who participate in both Medicare and Medicaid. When a resident has exhausted their Medicare coverage, and is eligible for Medicaid, then the reimbursement rate shifts to the Medicaid rate. Medicaid provides coverage for long-term care in nursing facilities for eligible Maryland residents, and has significantly lower reimbursement rates than Medicare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Complaint charged that Neiswanger \"strives to discharge each resident of its nursing homes at the precise point in time when the resident can be replaced by someone else with a more favorable public health insurance profile.\" It does this by maximizing the number of Medicare recipient residents and minimizing the number of Medicaid recipient residents. The State alleged that Neiswanger monitors residents' public health insurance statuses to identify candidates for eviction, and times that eviction to coincide with the end of the resident's Medicare coverage. It also claimed that Neiswanger unlawfully discharges Medicaid recipients to make room for more lucrative Medicare recipients in violation of HG \u00a7 19-345(b)(1)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State alleged that in executing these practices, Neiswanger committed multiple violations of the Patient's Bill of Rights and COMAR, including failure to give required notices, in violation of HG \u00a7 19-345.1(c)(2)(i) and COMAR 10.07.09.10(D)(8). The timing of Neiswanger's discharge notices is also allegedly improper. The State claims that Neiswanger issued discharge notices before providing residents with notice of nonpayment, in violation of HG \u00a7 19-345(a)(4). Family members often learned of discharges shortly before they occurred, the day of the discharge, or not at all, in violation of COMAR 10.07.09.09(F)(4). Neiswanger allegedly fails to properly document discharges or provide residents and families with a written statement containing statutorily-required information about discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State also asserted that Neiswanger violates HG \u00a7 19-345.2 by failing to engage in discharge planning, develop appropriate post-discharge plans of care, or comply with other statutory procedures required before an involuntary discharge or transfer. Neiswanger allegedly does not\n   arrange for post-discharge medical care for discharged residents, or provide a 3-day supply of current medications upon discharge. Neiswanger also violates its statutory obligation to place involuntarily discharged residents in safe and secure environments, in violation of HG \u00a7 19-345.2(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State also alleged that Neiswanger violates HG \u00a7 19-344(c)(5)(ii) (\"C &amp; A Clause\") by failing to \"cooperate with and assist\" residents and their agents in applying for long-term care coverage from the medical assistance program. Specifically, Neiswanger \"ignor[es] resident requests for assistance,\" \"delay[s] the submission of required paperwork to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or \"impedes the submission of the long-term care applications of Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relying on HG \u00a7\u00a7 19-344(c)(6)(iii) (\"Enforcement Clause\") and 19-345.3(c) (\"Injunction Clause\"), Count One\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the State's Complaint sought an injunction to prohibit Neiswanger from: (1) further violations of HG \u00a7\u00a7 19-344 - 19-345.2 and COMAR 10.07.09; (2) issuing notices of involuntary discharge for failure to pay except under specifically delineated circumstances; (3) discharging a resident who is a Medicaid participant or is Medicaid-eligible, without documenting the resident's\n   or legal representative's failure to cooperate in applying for benefits or arranging for reimbursement; (4) discharging, for non-payment, any resident who has a pending application for Medicaid benefits, unless Neiswanger had a good faith basis for believing that the resident is ineligible for benefits; (5) discharging any resident to an unlicensed assisted living facility or incorporating such a facility into a post-discharge plan of care; and (6) discharging any resident to a homeless shelter, or incorporating such a discharge into a post-discharge plan of care, or discharging a resident without an identified discharge destination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the State filed its Complaint, but before Neiswanger had responded, the Department issued a Notice of Restrictions on Admissions to Neiswanger facilities, prohibiting the facilities from admitting or re-admitting residents. After a hearing, an administrative law judge recommended that the Secretary rescind the ban. On January 26, 2017, Neiswanger entered into a Consent Agreement with the Department, requiring Neiswanger to implement changes to its involuntary discharge practices, comply with the Patient's Bill of Rights, and install an independent monitor to supervise and ensure its compliance with the Consent Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neiswanger, the Department, and the independent monitor, Dr. Daniel Haimowiz, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 8, 2017, which expired after three months, to implement the terms of the Consent Agreement. The MOU set out specific compliance procedures\n   for Neiswanger and outlined numerous conditions for the independent monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Neiswanger and the other defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. After a hearing, the Circuit Court dismissed Count One of the State's Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial court agreed that the allegations in the State's Complaint, if true, \"would certainly\n   be in violation of the Patient's Bill of Rights ....\" But the Circuit Court concluded that the Injunction Clause does not authorize \"a broad sweeping injunction against these Defendants' company practices.\" It determined, based on the plain language of the statute, that the Injunction Clause authorizes injunctive relief only for an individual resident. The Circuit Court also found that the State lacked authority to sue for an injunction under the Enforcement Clause, because the statute does not specify injunctive relief as a means of enforcement for violations of \u00a7 19-344.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State filed a timely appeal pursuant to Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-303(3)(iii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which authorizes an interlocutory appeal from a court's refusal to grant an injunction. Before the Court of Special Appeals issued a scheduling order, the State petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to answer the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that, although Health-General \u00a7 19-345.3 authorizes a court to grant \"injunctive relief\" to remedy violations of the discharge-related provisions of the Patient's Bill of Rights, the statute excludes injunctive relief barring \"company practices\" that violate those provisions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that the statutory responsibility conferred on the Attorney General by Health-General \u00a7 19-344 for the \"enforcement\" of certain of its provisions related to the Medicaid application process does not authorize the Attorney General to seek, or a court to grant, a judicial injunction enforcing those provisions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   We answer both questions affirmatively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State appeals from the grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A court considering a motion to dismiss must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    RRC Ne., LLC v.

The Circuit Court ruled that the Injunction Clause did not authorize the kind of broad injunctive relief the State sought, and that the Enforcement Clause did not authorize injunctive relief at all.

First, NMS Hagerstown has closed, and Neiswanger\n   no longer operates the other facilities. Neiswanger asserted that \"the owners of NMS are out of the picture,\" but admitted that its \"management services company\" and \"personnel\" were involved in the transition. Second, Neiswanger maintains that the Consent Agreement and MOU contain the relief the State initially sought in its Complaint. The State disagrees. The State also contends that the best place to resolve the mootness inquiry regarding the transition in management is before the Circuit Court on remand. Further, the State argues that even if the case is moot, this Court can, and should apply either of two exceptions to mootness: (1) voluntary cessation, and (2) important issues of public interest, to decide the questions presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A party's voluntary cessation of conduct, or a change in the factual circumstances that formed the basis for seeking judicial relief does not require \"dismissal of the judicial proceedings on the grounds of mootness where the matter is a continuing controversy or the circumstances are likely to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Chase v.

Neiswanger points to the Secretary's authority to restrict new admissions to a facility for a 30-day period if \"the Secretary determines that a life-threatening, health or fire safety deficiency exists in a related institution ....\" HG \u00a7 19-328(a)(1). We are not persuaded-because a restriction on new admissions does not prohibit a facility from illegally\n   <strong>\n    discharging\n   </strong>\n   residents. Thus, there is no conflict between the Attorney General's authority to act on behalf of residents, and the Secretary's authority to restrict admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In addition to authorizing the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief, the General Assembly also authorized the Secretary to impose civil penalties on facilities for violations of HG \u00a7\u00a7 19-345 - 19-345.2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HG \u00a7 19-345.3(a). There is no apparent discord between these provisions. A civil penalty against a facility affords little, if any, relief for residents who have been subjected to, or are awaiting an unlawful involuntary discharge. The General Assembly clearly intended for these provisions to operate in tandem. We are unconvinced that the Attorney General's authority to seek injunctive relief to require a facility to comply with its statutory obligations usurps the Secretary's authority under state\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   or federal regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Neiswanger suggests that the nature of the injunction sought by the Attorney General is \"simply unworkable\" in light of the possibility that the Secretary might amend regulations affecting nursing facilities. We are not persuaded. By that logic, courts should\n   <strong>\n    never\n   </strong>\n   issue injunctive relief to enforce provisions of laws because legislatures\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   change those laws, or administrative agencies\n   <strong>\n    might\n   </strong>\n   issue new regulations.

Further, a court may issue complete injunctive relief for violations of HG \u00a7\u00a7 19-345, 19-345.1, and 19-345.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We turn to the second question presented: whether the Attorney General's authority to prosecute violations of HG \u00a7 19-344(c)(4)-(5) permits injunctive relief to enforce the requirement in the C &amp; A Clause, that a facility \"cooperate with and assist\" a resident or applicant's agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    Enforcement Of The C &amp; A Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In its ruling on the State's request for injunctive relief for alleged violations of the C &amp; A Clause, the Circuit Court\n   explained that although the Enforcement Clause grants the Attorney General the responsibility to enforce and prosecute violations of HG \u00a7 19-344(c)(4)-(5), \"the use of the word enforcement does not include injunctive relief.\" The Circuit Court reasoned that the General Assembly never intended to permit injunctive relief because it did not specifically authorize injunctive relief either in the original 1995 enactment, or in subsequent amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Neiswanger encourages us to adopt the Circuit Court's reasoning that the failure to explicitly identify injunctive relief renders it unavailable. It argues that because the General Assembly specifically authorized injunctive relief in the Injunction Clause, and did not include the C &amp; A Clause in the statutory violations triggering an injunction, \"the General Assembly's intent is clear that injunctive relief is not authorized for violations of [ HG \u00a7] 19-344.\" Neiswanger also contends that the Attorney General's authority under the Enforcement Clause is restricted to seeking civil financial penalties against a resident's agent, and the C &amp; A Clause is enforceable through other provisions of the Patient's Bill of Rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The State responds that an express grant of injunctive relief in one statute does not preempt injunctive relief to enforce other statutory provisions. Rather, injunctive relief is impliedly authorized by the term \"enforcement,\" and the Attorney General's authority. The State reasons that because there is no other provision to ensure a facility's compliance with the C &amp; A\n   Clause, the Circuit Court's ruling has rendered the statute unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Enforcement Clause states that \"[t]he Attorney General is responsible for the enforcement and prosecution of violations of the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection.\" HG \u00a7 19-344(c)(6)(iii). The C &amp; A Clause states that \"[t]he facility shall cooperate with and assist the agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance program on behalf of the applicant or resident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336727\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/515/#p552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (c)(5)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Neiswanger is correct that paragraphs (4) and (5) are primarily devoted to the responsibilities of agents in applying for the medical assistance program.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336727\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/515/#p552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (c)(4)-(5).

The State reasons that this Court should not address standing because the Circuit Court did not rule on the issue.
