In this certified appeal, the plaintiff, Gail Reinke, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court's decision to modify the property distribution orders in a prior judgment dissolving her marriage to the defendant, Walter Sing. The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that, under \u00a7 46b-86 (a), in the absence of a finding of fraud, the\n   trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify the prior judgment. We agree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the following relevant facts and procedural history. \"The parties were married in 1989 and had two children. The plaintiff [holds] a bachelor's degree and previously had been employed in a number of well paying jobs. During the marriage, she became a homemaker; she also worked part-time 'from time to time.' The defendant [holds] a degree in mathematics, and he worked throughout the marriage, most recently as a self-employed consultant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The marriage was dissolved by the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Dennis F. Harrigan\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, on October 2, 2007. The parties entered into a 'Stipulation for Judgment,' which was incorporated into the judgment of dissolution. On May 3, 2010, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment of dissolution on the basis of fraud, claiming that the defendant failed to disclose some of his assets on the financial affidavit relied [on] at the time of the dissolution. On September 28, 2010, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Shay, J.\n   </em>\n   , opened the judgment 'by oral agreement of both parties, without a finding of fraud,' in order to reassess the financial orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Following a trial, the court issued its decision on August 23, 2013. The court found that the defendant's income actually had been twice the amount that the defendant disclosed at the time of the original dissolution, and the lesser amount had been relied on in formulating the terms of the initial stipulation and judgment. The court also found that the defendant had underreported\n   the values of his investment accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance, and anticipated tax refund; he also underreported the value of the plaintiff's share of a condominium in New Jersey. The court, therefore, ordered the amount and term of the alimony altered, the amounts the defendant owed to the plaintiff with respect to various marital assets and retirement accounts altered, and awarded the plaintiff attorney's fees. On September 27, 2013, the court issued a correction to its memorandum of decision; the correction fixed a calculation error, but the court declined to amend its prior award of attorney's fees.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Reinke\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20674\">\n    162 Conn.

As we previously have explained, \"[t]he purpose of a property division pursuant to a dissolution proceeding is to unscramble existing marital property in order to give each spouse his or her equitable share at the time of dissolution.... By comparison, the purpose of both periodic and lump sum alimony is to provide continuing support.... Hence, once the marital property is divided, the court has fulfilled its responsibility, and, therefore, continuing jurisdiction over divided marital property does not further the goal of the statutes.\" (Citations omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"518039\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/249/265/#p275\">\n     249 Conn. 265\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 275,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20A.2d%201023\">\n     752 A.2d 1023\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1999).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On appeal, the defendant does not dispute that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to open the judgment of dissolution.
