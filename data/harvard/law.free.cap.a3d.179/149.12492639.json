Defendant appeals his convictions for second-degree murder, reckless endangerment, and careless and negligent operation following a trial by jury. Defendant challenges the denial of his motion to suppress statements he gave to the police following his arrest, an evidentiary ruling at trial permitting certain expert testimony, the trial court's refusal to charge voluntary manslaughter, the denial of his motion for a new trial based on the prosecutor's statements in closing argument, and the trial court's imposition of a sentence of forty years to life on the murder conviction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Defendant claims errors related to various stages of the proceedings, and the facts common to all of his claims are as follows. During the afternoon of September 25, 2013, defendant was involved in an argument with his then-wife over defendant's continuing contact with another woman, with whom he had been having an affair for about a year. Defendant's wife had been aware of the affair for about nine months. Despite defendant's assurances to his wife he would end his relationship with the other woman, he had not. The fight with his wife on this day began during a telephone call that defendant made to his\n   wife as he was driving to meet the other woman, ostensibly to deliver the news that their affair was over. Defendant picked up the other woman at her apartment and drove to a parking area so they could talk. Defendant parked out of sight because his wife was threatening to come to the other woman's apartment. While defendant was talking with the other woman, his wife called defendant several times, yelling at him and threatening to \"kick [the other woman's] ass.\" Eventually, defendant dropped the other woman off at her apartment. While doing so, defendant noticed his wife parked nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. After leaving the apartment, defendant and his wife met at a gas station on Main Street in St. Albans, where she told him she was angry and sick of the situation. During their conversation, she took off her wedding rings, as she had done during previous arguments. Although his wife wanted to continue talking, defendant wanted to go to his father's house. Defendant left the gas station, driving north on Main Street at a high rate of speed. Defendant's wife followed a distance behind him in her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. At the intersection of Main Street and Lower Newton Road in downtown St. Albans, defendant ran a red light. At this same time, a car being driven by Anna Alger, accompanied by her fianc\u00e9, was attempting to turn left onto Main Street from Lower Newton Road and was cut off by defendant's car. Alger was able to avoid a collision and, as defendant's car passed, she made a gesture of arrant disdain at him with her middle finger. Defendant's wife saw defendant run the red light and called him to tell him about it, but he did not answer his phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. Shortly after passing through the intersection, defendant pulled his car to the side of the road and stopped. Alger pulled in behind him and also stopped. Unbeknownst to Alger, defendant had been contemplating shooting himself and had been driving with a loaded nine-millimeter pistol on his lap. Both defendant and Alger got out of their cars, with defendant carrying his pistol. Alger began walking toward defendant, and as she did so, she waved her arms and pointed at him, yelling, \"[W]hat kind a piece of shit do you think you are?\" When Alger got within about six feet of defendant, he opened fire with his pistol, firing up to eleven shots while emptying the clip. Alger was hit seven or eight times. He put another clip into the pistol while Alger's fianc\u00e9 got out of their car. Defendant pointed the gun at Alger's fianc\u00e9 and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. As defendant ran away, Alger's fianc\u00e9 summoned help from a passerby and went to check on Alger. She was already dead. The shooting, which occurred shortly after 5:00 p.m., was seen by several witnesses, including defendant's wife, who went up to him after the shooting, and saw him point the pistol at his head and pull the trigger. Again, the pistol did not fire. Defendant's wife took the pistol from him, as well as a second one he was carrying. The St. Albans police arrived at the scene very shortly after the incident and arrested defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Motion to Suppress\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Defendant moved to suppress statements he gave to a detective at the police station because, according to defendant, he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his Fifth Amendment rights. Specifically, defendant argues that he invoked his right to counsel when, following his arrest, he asked the detective who was interrogating him, \"[W]ould they be able to come right now so I could talk to you, lawyer?\" According to defendant, the detective's \"nonanswer\" to his \"direct question\" violated the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), and Vermont's Public Defender Act (PDA), 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 5237.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. After the shooting, a police detective arrested defendant and took him to the St. Albans Police Department. Shortly after 6:00 p.m., an officer, Detective Couture, introduced himself to defendant as a detective and brought defendant into an interview room. The following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Defendant]: Hello.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   DET. SGT.

Moreover, it was a comment about an issue on which both sides had presented expert testimony and had discussed in their closing arguments in some detail: whether defendant had the requisite intent to commit murder.

Unobjected-To Errors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6 29. Defendant also challenges three aspects of the prosecutor's closing argument to which he did not object at trial. First, defendant alleges that the prosecutor mischaracterized the defense as attempting to claim the victim was responsible for her own death. During closing argument, the prosecutor said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   I mean why are we talking about that, right? Because Anna was loud and Anna was outspoken, and Anna was saying what kind of piece of shit do you think you are? And Anna was pointing her finger at him. Why are we talking about that? Because that means Anna deserved to get shot? That means Anna had it coming? That she bought into this, that she's responsible for it? Anna could have just driven around because he pulled way over to the side of the road. So instead she stops to yell at this guy who just cut her off. So it should be okay for him to shoot her? No. None of this was Anna Alger's fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6 30. While defendant claims this comment was an improper attempt to characterize defendant's argument, in his closing argument, defendant's counsel pointed out testimony from a witness that there was room for Alger's vehicle to get past defendant's vehicle without stopping and there was no reason for her not to pass him. The prosecution interpreted the defense argument, based upon evidence from the witness, coupled with the claim\n   that defendant was provoked, to be raising the issue of the propriety of Alger's decision to stop and approach defendant in an angry fashion, thus calling her judgment into question. Another possible interpretation is that the evidence and defense counsel's comment upon it were directed at the impact Alger's decision to pull over may have had on defendant's state of mind. A prosecutor is entitled to make fair comment on the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brandt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702817\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/277/\">\n    2012 VT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702817\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/277/\">\n    192 Vt. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702817\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/192/277/\">\n    59 A.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both interpretations in the context of the trial are reasonable ones and, in light of this, the prosecutor's responsive comments were not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 31. Defendant also claims that the prosecutor improperly suggested defendant's expert was less than forthcoming in his expert opinions concerning defendant's lack of intent. The prosecutor told the jury that defendant's expert was \"hiding the ball\" and allegedly made a gesture to signify money by rubbing his fingers together. The defendant's expert, Dr. Holt, did not write a report concerning his opinions, and the prosecution contended that his opinions at trial exceeded those he disclosed in his deposition. Dr. Holt was cross-examined on both points by the prosecution in an attempt to establish bias on the part of the expert. He admitted that he had reached an opinion with more specificity since his deposition had been taken. This background provided the context for the prosecution's claim in closing argument that Dr. Holt was \"hiding the ball.\" Under the circumstances of this case, the prosecutor's statement was a fair comment on the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 32. During closing argument, the prosecutor rubbed his fingers together, in what defendant contends was a \"money gesture,\" when the prosecutor was discussing the absence of a written report by Dr. Holt. No objection was made to the gesture at the time. Defendant first raised the issue in his motion for a new trial. The trial court found the gesture to be equivocal in nature. Defendant does not contend the court's finding that the gesture was equivocal to be erroneous. Accordingly, we cannot discern any basis for error on this record concerning the gesture made by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 33. Lastly, in discussing the absence of the need to prove motive, the prosecutor said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   The only thing the law will require us to prove and for you to find is that he intended to do her great bodily harm. Going back to that hammer and nail for a minute this is a fellow who looked at the whole world like a hammer, carrying these two guns around all the time. If you look at the world like a hammer what does the rest of the world look like? It looks like a nail. You're going to find a reason, an excuse to act out in that way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defendant claims this comment was both a violation of the \"golden rule\" prohibition and an improper comment on defendant's violent propensity. A \"golden rule\" violation is an improper appeal to the sympathy of jurors by asking them to place themselves in the shoes of the victim.\n   <em>\n    State v. Scales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20VT%206\">\n    2017 VT 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28, --- Vt. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490066\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/652/\">\n    164 A.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This did not occur here. More to the point is defendant's argument that this comment suggested that defendant had a dangerous propensity because he viewed himself as a hammer, carrying around two guns all the time, and the world as a nail, and that he would find an excuse to act out in that way. The comment impugned defendant's character and was improper. The general rule is that character evidence is not admissible to prove a defendant \"acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Percy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840309\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/410/#p415\">\n    158 Vt. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4840309\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/158/410/#p415\">\n    612 A.2d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (1992) ; V.R.E. 404(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   However, this comment was isolated and the reference indirect. The jury was instructed that the attorneys' comments were not evidence in the case and that their verdict should be based solely on the evidence. While the prosecutor's closing argument in this respect was outside the bounds of proper argument, we cannot say that the closing argument was \"manifestly and egregiously improper.\" See\n   <em>\n    State v. Ayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4780193\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/421/#p426\">\n    148 Vt. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4780193\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/148/421/#p426\">\n    535 A.2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 (1987) (noting that reversible error is present only when an argument is \"manifestly and egregiously improper\" (quotation omitted)). Defendant's right to a fair trial was not impaired as a result of the improper propensity aspects of the State's closing argument.

Defendant raised all of these alleged errors-both the objected-to and unobjected-to errors-in a motion for a new trial.

Here, the trial court engaged in a reasoned and thorough review of defendant's claims of error and held that although the State engaged in improper argument, the comments did not deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial \"due to the overwhelming evidence that [d]efendant killed Anna Alger with the mental state necessary for the jury to convict [d]efendant of second-degree murder.\" The court applied the proper legal standard and did not abuse its discretion in reaching that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   IV. Decision not to Include Voluntary Manslaughter Charge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 35. Defendant claims that the court committed error by failing to charge voluntary manslaughter due to provocation by the victim. As part of that argument, defendant asserts that the State should have been required to disprove provocation on the part of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 36. At trial, defendant did not deny that he was the person who fired the shots, nor claimed that the shooting was done in self-defense; rather, defendant presented two theories of the crime that were, in some respects, inconsistent with each other. First, he asked the jury to find that, as a result of his diminished mental capacity at the time of the shooting, he lacked the intent to commit murder and he was therefore guilty only of involuntary manslaughter. Second, defendant argued that he was provoked and that he was therefore not guilty of second-degree murder or any of its lesser-included offenses, but instead guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The court instructed the jury on second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, not on voluntary manslaughter, and the jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder, meaning it found that he acted, at a minimum, \"with an\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to do\n   <em>\n    great bodily harm\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 37. The elements of voluntary manslaughter and second-degree murder are the same-(1) a defendant (2) caused the death of another person (3) that was unlawful and (4) did so with an intent to kill, an intent to do great bodily harm, or a wanton disregard of the likelihood that death or great bodily harm would result-and \"[t]he critical factor\" that distinguishes the crimes from each other is \"the existence of mitigating circumstances\" in a voluntary manslaughter case.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, defendant's legal theory in response to the second-degree murder charge was that, due to his diminished capacity, he was incapable of forming the intent necessary to satisfy a charge of second-degree murder. Defendant effectively contested only the intent element of the second-degree murder charge. Thus, he attempted to persuade the jury in closing argument that he was guilty of involuntary manslaughter, not murder, by admitting that he shot Alger while committing an illegal act, but that he had no intention to kill her. This legal theory was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 39. At the same time, he urged the trial court to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter, which is murder that would otherwise be second-degree, but is committed under circumstances where sudden passion or provocation mitigates, but does not excuse, the killing. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 30.

Thus, a heated exchange with one person provides no adequate provocation for a reaction directed at another. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, there was considerable evidence of defendant's angst over his predicament in being involved in an angry exchange with his wife during and shortly after having a conversation with his girlfriend. The situation he found himself in regarding his wife and his girlfriend plays no part, however, in whether defendant was adequately provoked by Alger. The evidence established that the shooting occurred when Alger pulled her car in behind defendant's vehicle, got out, and began walking toward defendant, who had also gotten out of his car. At that time, Alger was yelling at him and waving or pointing her arms. She had previously raised her middle finger at him. As she came toward him, she yelled words to the effect of, \"What kind of a piece of shit do you think you are?\" There was no suggestion she had any weapon; her actions were merely words and gestures. The gestures themselves were not described as threatening. Words and gestures are insufficient to constitute adequate provocation. See\n   <em>\n    Barron v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241594\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/297/706/\">\n    297 Ga. 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241594\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/297/706/\">\n    777 S.E.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 (2015) (contemptuous gestures not enough to downgrade to voluntary manslaughter);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under no view of the facts in this case can we say that Alger's actions would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control and to respond in a fit of anger without thinking. No reasonable juror could find that Alger's yelling and her waving or pointing upon her approach to defendant was such that a reasonable person would lose self-control and shoot Alger multiple times. Because no reasonable jury could find adequate provocation, the court was not required to instruct this jury on a charge of voluntary manslaughter. Passion or provocation were not fairly raised by the evidence, and defendant was not entitled\n   to a charge on those issues or to have the jury instructed on voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   V.

A sentencing court is not confined only to the facts and circumstances of a case in fashioning an appropriate sentence and it may consider factors, such as a prior conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, the court must consider \"the history and character of the defendant, the need for treatment, and the risk [the defendant poses to] others, and the community at large.\" 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7030(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 46. Here, the court considered the nature and circumstances of the crime, and at the sentencing hearing, described them as \"a frightening and sudden and devastating set of circumstances.\" The court acknowledged that defendant had no prior record of significance, presented a low to moderate risk to reoffend, and likely still required treatment for mental and physical ailments. The court found it likely that suicidality was the greatest precipitating factor in what occurred. Focusing on common law sentencing factors, the court emphasized the need for deterrence, citing the community's interest in general deterrence, retribution, incapacitation, and punishment. Finding that defendant's actions lacked any provocation, were deliberate, and were the result of a conscious decision on his part, and that defendant was entirely responsible for the outcome of those actions, the court imposed a forty-year minimum sentence on the second-degree murder conviction with a maximum of life. The court made the murder sentence consecutive to two consecutive sentences of eleven months to one year for defendant's misdemeanor convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 47. Although the sentence was significant, there is no suggestion that it was motivated by any bias or improper motive by the sentencing judge. On the contrary, the record reflects proper consideration of the sentencing factors. The judge placed heavy emphasis on the nature of the crime, a shooting occurring as the result of traffic incident, and the finding that defendant's response was entirely controlled by his decision to direct his rage at an innocent person and to shoot her. In addition, the judge placed considerable emphasis on the need for general deterrence in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6 48. Defendant has not shown any abuse of discretion here. He has not shown that the trial judge relied on improper information in imposing the sentence, or that the sentence was the result of any bias on the part of the sentencing judge. That a different judge may have imposed a different sentence or weighed the sentencing factors differently is not the test. Even if defendant's contention that the factors\n   relied on by the sentencing judge here would be present in every murder case, this would not amount to sentencing error. The court acted within its discretion in imposing the forty years to life sentence on the second-degree murder charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    In his suppression motion, defendant also asserted violations of the Sixth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution as grounds for suppression of his statements.
