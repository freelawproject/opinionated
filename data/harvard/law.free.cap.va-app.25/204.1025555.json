Both parties appeal the trial court ruling. We hold that the trial court erred in finding that the word \u201creside\u201d was an ambiguous term requiring the admission of parol evidence. Further, we hold that the evidence failed to prove that the former wife violated the \u201creside\u201d provision in the separation agreement. Finally, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the word \u201ccease\u201d was ambiguous and interpreting that term in the agreement to mean \u201ctemporarily suspend.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In April 1989, Stuart and Janice Bergman entered into a property settlement agreement in which Mr. Bergman agreed to pay spousal support in an amount equal to twenty-five percent of his salary up to $160,000 and twenty percent of his salary, including bonuses, that exceeded $160,000. The paragraph of the agreement in controversy stated, \u201c[s]pousal maintenance and support <em>shall cease </em>in the event Janice L. Bergman <em>resides with </em>a male person to whom she is not married excluding immediate relatives such as her father or a brother or male child.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court ratified, confirmed and approved the agreement and incorporated certain provisions, including the spousal support provision, into the final divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In 1994, Mr. Bergman filed a petition to terminate spousal support based on the foregoing provision of the settlement agreement. He alleged that Janice Bergman was residing with a male to whom she was not married.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">At the hearing on Mr. Bergman\u2019s petition, Mr. Bergman presented evidence that he had observed a man at his former wife\u2019s home on several occasions. Mr. Bergman then hired a private investigator, who began surveillance of Janice Bergman\u2019s home to determine whether the man was \u201cresiding\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>with her. The combined surveillance by Mr. Bergman and the investigator lasted several years. During that time, the man\u2019s vehicle and Janice Bergman\u2019s vehicle were seen at the same location, either at her home or his home, late at night on numerous occasions. Mr. Bergman introduced into evidence detailed notes and a calendar chronicling the dates and times on which he and the investigator observed that the man \u201cspent the night\u201d with Janice Bergman.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Janice Bergman confirmed that the truck seen at her home by her former husband and the investigator was that of a male friend whom she dated. She testified that they had a dating relationship and acknowledged that they had spent nights together but only on intermittent weekends. When the man stayed overnight, he slept in her room. Janice Bergman testified that her friend did not keep his clothing or toiletries at her home and did not have a key to her house. Further, her male friend did not receive mail at her house, nor did they have a joint post office box. Janice Bergman further testified that she and the man never helped each other financially and that she did not use his truck and he did not use her car. Janice Bergman refuted several of the investigator\u2019s entries, stating that she and her friend were out of town together at a time when, according to the investigator\u2019s notes, the investigator had purportedly observed their cars moving between the two houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The man\u2019s brother and sister, who lived with him at their parents\u2019 home, testified that he had moved into a bedroom in the basement of their parents\u2019 home in July or August of 1993. His sister testified that he usually had dinner with the family and rarely spent the night away from their home. The man\u2019s father testified that his son did not spend the night away from home often and that he did not pay rent or contribute to household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The man\u2019s employer testified that, due to the nature of his job in the maintenance department for Glass Dynamics, he was subject to being called to work at any time. However, the man never gave Janice Bergman\u2019s address or telephone num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ber to his employer. Instead, he gave his home and his parents\u2019 home phone numbers and addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The parties\u2019 son, Robert, lived at home with his mother until he went to college in 1994. He testified that, although his mother and the man had a dating relationship, the man kept no clothing or personal effects at his mother\u2019s home. The only item in the house that the son could recall that belonged to the man was a broken shop vacuum kept in the garage. While Robert was living at home, the man stayed at the house, at most, three or four nights per month and never two nights in a row. Robert also testified that the investigator\u2019s notes concerning the man\u2019s staying at the house during the weekend of December 4, 1993 were incorrect because he recalled being home alone studying.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The trial judge ruled that the term \u201creside\u201d as used in the settlement agreement was ambiguous; therefore, the judge received parol evidence to determine the parties\u2019 intent when using the term, \u201creside.\u201d After receiving the evidence, the trial judge ruled that the term \u201creside\u201d as used in the agreement meant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">that either party would move into the home of the other a significant amount of clothing or personal property[,] ... that the parties would spend more than four nights ... together per calendar month under the same roof with each other[,] ... that the parties would spend more than two consecutive nights together under the same roof, that would exclude vacations and out-of-town trips[, and] ... that a party received mail or had a phone listing or made a significant economical or nonmonetary contribution to . the home or the residence of the other____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The judge found that, based upon the evidence presented, the man was \u201cresiding\u201d with Janice Bergman in violation of the settlement agreement provision. The trial judge then interpreted the term \u201cshall cease\u201d in the same provision to mean that spousal support would be suspended while Janice Bergman was \u201cresiding\u201d with an unrelated male but would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>reinstated once she was no longer \u201cresiding\u201d with \u201ca male person\u201d other than her father, brother, or male child.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Property settlement agreements are contracts subject to the same rules of formation, validity, and interpretation as other contracts. <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>3 Va.App. 510, 513, 351 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1986); <em>Tiffany v. Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 15, 332 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1985). \u201cExtrinsic evidence can be admitted to explain an ambiguity in a document. However, the ambiguity must be apparent on the face of the instrument.\u201d <em>Cohan v. Thurston, </em>223 Va. 523, 525, 292 S.E.2d 45, 46 (1982). A contract term is not ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to the term\u2019s meaning. <em>Ross v. Craw, </em>231 Va. 206, 212-13, 343 S.E.2d 312, 316 (1986); <em>Smith, </em>3 Va.App. at 513-14, 351 S.E.2d at 595. Rather, the question of whether a writing is ambiguous is a matter of law, not of fact. <em>Langman v. Alumni Ass\u2019n of the Univ. of Virginia, </em>247 Va. 491, 498, 442 S.E.2d 669, 674 (1994); <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984). \u201cThus, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions on this issue, and we are permitted the same opportunity as the trial court to consider the contract provisions.\u201d <em>Tuomala v. Regent University, </em>252 Va. 368, 374, 477 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the contract made by the parties, not to make a contract for them. The question for the court is what did the parties agree to as evidenced by their contract. The guiding light in the construction of a contract is the intention of the parties as expressed by them in the words they have used, and courts are bound to say that the parties intended what the written instrument plainly declares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\"><em>Wilson, </em>227 Va. at 187, 313 S.E.2d at 398 (quoting <em>Meade v. Wallen, </em>226 Va. 465,467, 311 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">\u201cIn construing the terms of a property settlement agreement, just as in construing the terms of any contract, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to the construction of the disputed provisions.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>3 Va.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>513, 351 S.E.2d at 595 (citations omitted); <em>Hederick v. Hederick, </em>3 Va.App. 452, 455, 350 S.E.2d 526, 528 (1986). \u201c[I]f all the evidence which is necessary to construe a contract was presented to the trial court and is before the reviewing court, the meaning and effect of the contract is a question of law which can readily be ascertained by this court.\u201d <em>Fry v. Schwarting, 4 </em>Va.App. 173, 180, 355 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We hold that the term \u201creside,\u201d as used by the parties in this contract, is not ambiguous. No other provisions in the contract render the term confusing or ambiguous. The contract does not evidence any intent that the word was used in a special way or was intended to have a meaning other than its ordinary meaning. Thus, in construing and enforcing the provision of the agreement we apply the plain meaning of the term, \u201cresides with.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>3 Va.App. at 514, 351 S.E.2d at 595-96 (\u2018When the terms of a disputed provision are clear and definite, it is axiomatic that they are to be applied according to their ordinary meaning____\u201d). In common usage, to \u201creside\u201d is \u201c[to] settle oneself or a thing in a place, to be stationed, ... to dwell permanently or continuously, [to] have a settled abode for a time, [to] have one\u2019s residence or domicile.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1931 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Thus, the factors that determine whether a person \u201cresides\u201d with another, as that term is used in the parties\u2019 agreement, include, determining whether the persons are living together on a continuous or frequent basis with some degree of permanency, whether they have clothing and/or personal belongings in the same home or residence, whether they receive mail or frequent phone calls at each other\u2019s home, whether they contribute to the payment of bills or make significant nonmonetary contributions to the home, and whether they intend the home to be their residence. Unlike the term \u201ccohabit,\u201d the term \u201creside\u201d does not encompass consideration of the personal relationship between the individuals. <em>See Schweider v. Schweider, </em>243 Va. 245, 248, 415 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1992); <em>Frey v. Frey, </em>14 Va.App. 270, 273, 416 S.E.2d 40, 42 (1992). Thus, no proof of an intimate relationship would be necessary to prove that Janice Bergman was \u201cresiding\u201d with an unrelated male. Furthermore, the length of time that a person lives at a particular location is but one factor that governs whether the person \u201cresides\u201d at a location. Accordingly, we look to the circumstances of each case to determine whether one person \u201cresides with\u201d another.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Under the facts of this case, the evidence failed to prove, as a matter of law, that Janice Bergman was residing with the man she was dating. He did not have clothing, toiletries, or personal belongings at Janice Bergman\u2019s home. In addition, he did not have a key or access to her home. No evidence proved that he spent time there while Janice Bergman was away, as a person who \u201cresides\u201d at the home would have done. <em>See Pendleton v. Pendleton, </em>918 P.2d 159, 160 (Utah App.1996). No evidence was presented that the man intended to \u201creside with\u201d Janice Bergman. In fact, the evidence indicated that he was no more than a frequent overnight visitor during the two year period that they dated. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>hold that the trial court\u2019s finding that Janice Bergman was \u201cresiding with\u201d the man is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Turning to the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the term \u201cshall cease\u201d in the parties\u2019 agreement, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the term meant \u201ctemporarily suspend.\u201d \u201c \u2018[CJourts cannot read into contracts language which will add to or take away from the meaning of the words already contained therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderlite v. Henderlite, </em>3 Va.App. 539, 541, 351 S.E.2d 913, 914 (1987) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984)). \u201cWhere there is no ambiguity in the terms of a contract, we must construe it as written, ... and we are not at liberty to search for the meaning of the provisions beyond the pertinent instrument itself.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>3 Va.App. at 514, 351 S.E.2d at 595-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At the hearing, neither party contended that the term \u201cshall cease\u201d was ambiguous and no parol evidence was introduced as to what the parties intended when they used the term. The term \u201cshall cease\u201d is not ambiguous; its meaning is clear and certain. The contract provides that spousal support \u201cshall cease\u201d in the event of death of either party, the remarriage of Janice Bergman, or in the event she should reside with a male person to whom she is not married other than relatives, such as a father, brother, or son. As the term is used, it is clear that the parties intended \u201cshall cease\u201d to mean \u201cend permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and hold that Stuart Bergman failed to prove a change in condition under the terms of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. Accordingly, we dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">. Stuart Bergman, argues that \"reside\u201d is capable of being interpreted in more than one way, rendering the term ambiguous. Although \"reside\u201d is not synonymous with \"resident\u201d or \"residence,\u201d the definition of those terms supports our holding that \"reside\u201d is not an ambiguous term. To \"reside\u201d is to be a \"resident\u201d or have a \"residence\" as those terms have been interpreted by Virginia courts. Virginia cases interpreting the terms \"residence\u201d and \"resident\u201d have generally given the terms their plain meaning. <em>See Long v. Ryan, </em>71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718 (1878) (conflict of laws case interpreting \"residence\u201d to mean a place \"to abide, to sojourn, to dwell ... permanently or for a length of time[,] ... as contradistinguished from the mere temporary locality of existence\u201d); <em>Smith v. Smith\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>122 Va. 341, 94 S.E. 777 (1918) (same); <em>Griffin v. Woolford, </em>100 Va. 473, 41 S.E. 949 (1902) (same). Although the terms \u201cresident\u201d and \"residence\u201d have been interpreted to have the same meaning as \"domicile\u201d for purposes of the election laws and tax laws, <em>see Dotson v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 565, 66 S.E.2d 490 (1951) (election laws); <em>Talley v. Commonwealth, </em>127 Va. 516, 103 S.E. 612 (1920) (tax laws), the contract in this case contains nothing to indicate an intent by the parties that the term \"reside\u201d be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>given any meaning other than its ordinary one. <em>Compare USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hensley, </em>251 Va. 177, 181, 465 S.E.2d 791, 793 (1996) (giving special meaning to the term \"resident of the household\" as compared to \"resident\u201d); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Patterson, </em>231 Va. 358, 361, 344 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1986) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
