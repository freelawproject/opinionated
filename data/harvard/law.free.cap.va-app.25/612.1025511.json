McIntyre (husband) appeals the decision of the circuit court awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Garnet M. McIntyre (wife). Husband contends that the trial court: (1) lacked jurisdiction to award wife attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the course of a previous appeal; and (2) abused its discretion by awarding wife attorney\u2019s fees without proof of need or disproportionate ability to pay. We agree that the trial court lacked jurisdiction and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Under the terms of the final decree, the trial court provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">In the event that [husband] appeals the judgments set forth ..., bond or an irrevocable letter of credit conditioned upon the performance or satisfaction of the judgments, shall be posted with the Court in the amount of $35,000 suspending execution of the judgments during the appeal. The Clerk of Court is hereby directed to place any cash bond posted in an interest bearing account until further order of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfR\">This Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision and ordered husband to pay to wife \u201cdamages according to law.\u201d No express provision was made concerning wife\u2019s request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees. Wife filed with the trial court a Motion for Release of Bond, Interest on Judgment and Attorney\u2019s Fees upon the conclusion of husband\u2019s appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Court. However, husband filed a petition for appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia. Husband\u2019s petition, and his subsequent petition for rehearing, were both dismissed by the Supreme Court. Wife then filed with the trial court a new Motion for Release of Bond, Interest on Judgment and Attorney\u2019s Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 691, 479 S.E.2d 98, 98 (1996),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we held that, in the absence of a specific remand for attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to award appellate fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other. reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 695, 479 S.E.2d at 100 (footnote omitted). Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court awarded wife appellate attorney\u2019s fees or remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court awarding appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The trial court also awarded $2,800 in attorney\u2019s fees in connection with wife\u2019s motion. That award was within the trial court\u2019s discretionary authority and was supported by credible evidence. We find no abuse of that discretion and affirm that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-13\">. <em>O'Loughlin </em>was decided subsequent to the order appealed from herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b658-11\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AU4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">With all due respect, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that <em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 479 S.E.2d 98 (1996), decided that a circuit court judge \u201clacked jurisdiction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>to award attorney\u2019s fees following an appeal. Although <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>states that the question presented was \u201cwhether, absent an order from the Court of Appeals specifically remanding the issue of attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal, a trial court has jurisdiction to award such fees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 691, 479 S.E.2d at 98,1 do not read the opinion to address the question of the trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction to award fees. The opinion merely holds \u201cthat a specific remand for attorney\u2019s fees is required\u201d before the trial judge may assess attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>appears to be based on the following analysis: The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 695, 479 S.E.2d at 100 (footnote omitted). I disagree with that conclusion and with what I believe to be the <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>holding \u2014 that the trial judge is divested of the right to exercise discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees unless the mandate returned to the circuit court following an appeal specifically remands the issue. I would hold that Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-103, 20-79, and 20-99 provide independent authority for a circuit court judge to award attorney\u2019s fees. That authority, specifically conferred by the General Assembly, is not eliminated by a mandate from this Court implementing an opinion that does not address attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The context in which the fee request arose in this case is not atypical. During the initial proceeding in the circuit court, the trial judge awarded a divorce and other relief, including attorney\u2019s fees, to the wife. The husband appealed to this Court from the divorce decree and raised several issues. In response to that appeal and as part of her request for relief, the wife requested this Court to affirm the judgment and award her attorney\u2019s fees for the appeal. Although this Court affirmed the ruling of the trial judge in all aspects, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>failed to address the wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees for the appellate services provided by her counsel. The husband then filed a further appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court dismissed the husband\u2019s petition for appeal and, thereby, affirmed the ruling of the trial judge. However, the Supreme Court also failed to act upon the wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees for the appellate services of her counsel. As has been the usual practice in the Commonwealth, the wife sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees when the mandate was returned to the circuit court ending the husband\u2019s appeals. <em>See, e.g., Bandas v. Bandas, </em>32 Va. Cir. 285 (1993) (Circuit Court of the City of Richmond); <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>Chancery No. 90000011 (1994) (Circuit Court of Augusta County). The trial judge awarded her attorney\u2019s fees for the appellate services of her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Attorney\u2019s fees have long been considered a cost necessary to enable a spouse or child to maintain a suit for support. <em>See, e.g., Carswell v. Masterson, </em>224 Va. 329, 331, 295 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1982); <em>Ingram v. Ingram, </em>217 Va. 27, 29, 225 S.E.2d 362, 364 (1976); <em>McKeel v. McKeel, </em>185 Va. 108, 116-17, 37 S.E.2d 746, 750-51 (1946); <em>McClaugherty v. McClaugherty, </em>180 Va. 51, 69,21 S.E.2d 761, 768 (1942); <em>Heflin v. Heflin, </em>177 Va. 385, 399-400,14 S.E.2d 317, 322 (1941). By statute, the legislature has provided for attorney\u2019s fees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">In suits for divorce ..., the court having jurisdiction of the matter may, at any time pending a suit pursuant to this chapter, in the discretion of such court, make any order that may be proper (i) to compel a spouse to pay any sums necessary for the maintenance and support of the petitioning spouse, including an order that the other spouse provide health care coverage for the petitioning spouse, unless it is shown that such coverage cannot be obtained, (ii) <em>to enable such spouse to carry on the </em>suit____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Code \u00a7 20-103(A) (emphasis added). This statute allows an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>See Wilkerson v. Wilkerson, </em>214 Va. 395, 398, 200 S.E.2d 581, 584 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(1973); <em>Rowlee v. Rowlee, </em>211 Va. 689, 690, 179 S.E.2d 461, 462 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In addition, Code \u00a7 20-79(b) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">In any suit for divorce, the court in which the suit is instituted or pending, when either party to the proceedings so requests, shall provide in its decree for the maintenance, support, care or custody of the child or children in accordance with Chapter 6.1 (\u00a7 20-124.1 et. seq.), support and maintenance for the spouse, if the same be sought, and counsel fees and other costs, if in the judgment of the court any or all of the foregoing should be so decreed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">That statute also gives the circuit court judge discretionary authority to award attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Stratton v. Stratton, </em>16 Va.App. 878, 884, 433 S.E.2d 920, 923 (1993); <em>Alphin v. Alphin, </em>15 Va.App. 395, 406, 424 S.E.2d 572, 578 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Furthermore, \u201c[cjosts may be awarded to either party as equity and justice may require.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-99(5). This statute likewise authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees, if necessary, as the cost of enabling a spouse to carry on the suit. <em>See D\u2019Auria v. D\u2019Auria, </em>1 Va.App. 455, 461, 340 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">When the legislature enacted Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-79, 20-99, and 20-103, it clearly intended to protect the ability of an eligible spouse to obtain fees for that spouse\u2019s legal counsel. The need for attorney\u2019s fees is just as compelling when a spouse has been required to secure the services of counsel to defend on appeal a judgment in that spouse\u2019s favor. To enable judges to respond adequately to the needs of spouses, the legislature gave broad discretion to judges to award attorney\u2019s fees and did not limit in a strict manner the time in which attorney\u2019s fees could be awarded. The only statutory requirement is that the suit must be pending. Indeed, one of the statutory provisions allows the trial judge discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cat any time\u201d in a pending suit for divorce. Code \u00a7 20-103. <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>does not hold that the divorce suit is not pending when the mandate has issued and is before the circuit court on remand. It also does not address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>authority of the circuit court judge to award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-103 while the suit is still pending on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Generally, when a trial judge has discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees, that discretion may be invoked after an appeal has resolved the merits of the case. <em>See White v. New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Sec., </em>455 U.S. 445, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). A request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs has traditionally been deemed to be collateral to the judgment because the request seeks a benefit as a consequence of the judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 451-52, 102 S.Ct. at 1166-67; <em>see also Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 168-69, 59 S.Ct. 777, 780-81, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939). Thus, a trial judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under Code \u00a7 20-103 for services rendered on appeal is collateral to the remand order contained in the mandate. <em>Accord Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>636 A.2d 888, 890 (Del.1993) (holding that trial judge\u2019s statutory power \u201cto award attorney\u2019s fees following an appeal is not dependent upon a remand ... for that purpose\u201d); <em>Dahnke v. Dahnke, </em>571 N.E.2d 1278, 1282 (Ind.Ct.App.1991) (holding that appellate attorney\u2019s fees were incurred during the divorce proceedings and were awardable by the trial judge). As long as the remand order is still pending, Code \u00a7 20-103(A) is statutory authority, independent of the mandate, that empowers the judge to award attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Accord Tolman v. Tolman, </em>93 Idaho 374, 461 P.2d 433, 435 (1969) (stating that a trial judge\u2019s statutory authority to award attorney\u2019s fees in a pending divorce action is \u201cunaffected by the fact that the mandate ... did not mention attorney fees\u201d). Thus, I would hold that, in a case such as this, where the trial judge otherwise has authority to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the trial judge may properly consider a timely motion to award attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal even though the appellate court has not ruled upon the fee request and has not addressed the issue in its remand order. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Contrary to <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>I do not believe that \u201cthe appellate court ... [is] the [only] proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>appeal.\u201d 23 Va.App. at 695, 479 S.E.2d at 100. Indeed, Virginia authority suggests that the trial judge is initially in the best position to assess both the entitlement and quantum of attorney\u2019s fees, leaving to the appellate court a review of that decision. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Craig v. Craig, </em>115 Va. 764, 80 S.E. 507 (1914), remanded to the circuit court judge the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court did not hold that the appellee was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. The Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">Counsel for appellee have asked that an allowance for counsel fees be made for services rendered in this court. This we decline to do, being of opinion that <em>the trial court is in a better position to inquire into and do what is right and just between the parties in the first instance than this court. </em>We shall, therefore, affirm the decree and remand the cause, but with leave to counsel for appellee to prosecute their claim for compensation before the law and equity court in the first instance, with the right of appeal to this court if a proper case shall be made for its exercise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 765, 80 S.E. 507 (emphasis added). Thus, the Supreme Court recognized that both the issues of entitlement and quantum of fees were matters that could properly be addressed initially by the trial judge. <em>See id.; accord Knighton v. Watkins, </em>616 F.2d 795, 801 (5th Cir.1980); <em>White v. White, </em>683 So.2d 510, 512 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (stating that because the appellate court has \u201cno way of knowing how great is the need ..., nor how great is the ability to pay,\u201d the propriety and amount of an award of attorney\u2019s fees usually should first be \u201caddressed by the trial court\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>695 So.2d 381 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997) <em>(en </em>banc). Indeed, the trial judge is better positioned to assess the financial needs of the parties and consider evidence germane to the reasonableness of the fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The practical effect of the rule pronounced in <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>is to require this Court to superintend attorney\u2019s fees requests in domestic relations appeals. After <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>to preserve a claim for attorney\u2019s fees expended on appeal, counsel must present the issue of attorney\u2019s fees as a question presented on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>appeal either in the appellant\u2019s opening brief or in appellee\u2019s cross-appeal. This Court might possibly consider a timely separate motion bringing the issue to the attention of this Court. Less certain is a mechanism for presenting the issue before the Supreme Court at the petition stage. Moreover, as this case demonstrates, if the appellate courts fail to rule on the issue, counsel must request a rehearing to raise anew the entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees and request a ruling. I believe the statutes make that effort unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Because I believe that the statutes clearly authorize the trial judge to consider a timely motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees when the mandate is pending on remand, I would affirm the judgment. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
