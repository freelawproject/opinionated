A panel of this Court reversed the convictions on the ground that the trial court erroneously excluded as hearsay two statements offered by the defense. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 225, 475 S.E.2d 836 (1996). We granted the Commonwealth a rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Upon rehearing, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendant\u2019s out-of-court question to a police officer was inadmissible hearsay. However, we hold that an out-of-court conversation which allegedly occurred between the victim and defendant was not hearsay because it was offered to prove that the victim and defendant knew one another or had previously met; it was not offered to prove the truth or falsity of the assertions contained therein. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred by refusing to admit testimony that a witness overheard the conversation between the victim and the defendant. However, we hold that the error in excluding the conversation was harmless because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The victim testified that on June 25, 1994, she went to bed around 12:30 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. Some time later, she awoke and found the defendant, who was naked, standing over her bed. The victim screamed and tried to get away. The defendant grabbed the victim by the neck, hit her in the face, and choked her. He then threw her across the bed and raped her, forcing her to engage in both oral and anal sodomy. After forcing the victim to have intercourse, the defendant fell asleep and the victim fled from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">A passing motorist saw the victim \u201crunning down the road naked.\u201d The motorist testified that the victim was \u201cbloody\u201d and \u201cscared to death.\u201d The victim told the motorist that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>man had broken into her apartment and raped her. The motorist called the police. When the police arrived, they found the victim in the back seat of the motorist\u2019s car wrapped in a sheet, which the motorist had provided. Officer R.L. Shaner testified that the victim\u2019s right eye was \u201cswollen and bruised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The police went to the victim\u2019s apartment and arrested the defendant, who was asleep in the victim\u2019s bed. The defendant told the police that he had consensual intercourse with the victim. He said that he had gone to the victim\u2019s apartment because he had obtained marijuana for her. He told the officers that he and the victim did not consume all of the marijuana. The police found no marijuana in the apartment, and the victim\u2019s blood tested negative for marijuana. The defendant\u2019s blood tested positive for cocaine but showed no trace of marijuana. A forensic expert testified that marijuana would be present in a person\u2019s blood for at least twenty-four hours after the last use.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">When the police searched the victim\u2019s apartment, they found a chair placed against the outside of the victim\u2019s kitchen window. The kitchen window sill was bent, and the screen was damaged. The defendant\u2019s palm prints were found on the kitchen sink facing inward from the kitchen window. The defendant\u2019s shoes were on the kitchen sink, and . dirt on his shoes appeared to match the dirt in the victim\u2019s backyard. Furniture in the apartment had been overturned. Blood was found in eight different areas on the bed sheet and on the victim\u2019s t-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">A doctor examined the victim that night and stated that the victim was \u201cclearly nervous and jittery.\u201d The victim\u2019s right eye was bleeding and swollen shut, and she had several red marks on her forehead. In addition, she had several scratches on her right front thigh, several red marks on her throat, and dried blood on her head, hair, and perineum. Her nose was bloody, and blood was found under all of her fingernails. Her perineum was slightly swollen and red.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>In response to the victim\u2019s claim that she had bitten her attacker\u2019s thumb, the police examined the defendant\u2019s thumb when he was arrested and found bite marks. The bite marks were open and raw and appeared to be of recent origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">At trial, the defendant testified that he had known the victim for around two and one-half months before the incident, that she had admitted him to the apartment that night, and that they had consensual sexual intercourse. He denied using any force or violence on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>II. OFFICER BERRYMAN\u2019S TESTIMONY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHf\">At trial, Officer Matthew Berryman testified that, at the police station, the defendant \u201casked me twice if Peggy [the victim] knew he was here.\u201d The prosecutor objected on the ground that the statement was hearsay. The trial judge sustained the objection and ruled that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Hearsay is \u201c[a] statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial \u2014 offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>649 (5th ed.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Whether an extrajudicial statement is hearsay depends upon the purpose for which it is offered and received into evidence. If the statement is received to prove the truth [or falsity] of its content, then it is hearsay and, in order to be admissible, must come within one of the many established exceptions to the general prohibition against admitting hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\"><em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 187, 416 S.E.2d 14, 22 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cPart of the difficulty in \u2018not-for-truth\u2019 situations is due to the fact that often such evidence will have a dual nature; the declaration may indeed be relevant on some matter unrelated to the truth of the content of the statement, and yet the content of the statement may go to the issues of the case as well. <em>See, e.g., Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>[225 Va. 145, 300 S.E.2d 768 (1983) ]. This is perhaps the situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>which creates the greatest dilemma for the courts. In that regard, however, it should be remembered that it is a time-honored principle of evidence law that, in general, if evidence is admissible for <em>any </em>purpose, it is admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am2\"><em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 508, 521, 471 S.E.2d 785, 791 (1996) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-3, at 95-96 (4th ed.1993) (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The initial issue in this case is whether an extrajudicial statement that is in the form of a question, such as \u201cDoes Peggy know I am here?\u201d, can be an assertion or declaration of fact that can constitute hearsay. In order for a statement to be hearsay it must assert the truth or falsity of a fact. In many instances, questions by an out-of-court declarant contain no assertion; they simply seek answers. <em>See Carlton v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 436, 681 A.2d 1181, 1184, <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 328, 686 A.2d 634 (1996). However, a question can include an implied assertion. \u201cFor example, the question, \u2018Do you need change?\u2019 impliedly asserts that the questioner has change. The question, \u201cWhy did you stab me, Brutus?\u2019 impliedly asserts that the questioner was stabbed by Brutus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As these questions demonstrate, the extent to which the question may or may not contain an implied assertion depends on the nature of the question and the circumstances. <em>But see Bolen v. Paragon Plastics, Inc., </em>754 F.Supp. 221, 225 (D.Mass.1990) (holding that, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an inquiry cannot be an assertion); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>902 F.2d 1176, 1179 (5th Cir.1990) (same); <em>State v. Carter, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, 971 (holding that the question posed by the accused in this case was not an assertion because it was incapable of being proved either true or false), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 575, 133 L.Ed.2d 498 (1995); <em>Washington v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 132, 589 A.2d 493, 495 (1991) (holding that the question posed by the accused was not offered as an assertion of truth).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The Virginia Supreme Court recognized in <em>Stevenson v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 462, 237 S.E.2d 779 (1977), that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>assertion can be implied, in that case from a declarant\u2019s conduct, and that such an implied assertion is inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the assertion implied from the conduct. In <em>Stevenson, </em>the defendant was suspected of committing a homicide. A police officer came to the defendant\u2019s home and asked his wife if the defendant had changed clothes the day of the homicide. In response to the officer\u2019s question, the defendant\u2019s wife retrieved a shirt and gave it to the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 237 S.E.2d at 781. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe conduct of [the defendant\u2019s wife] was intended as a nonverbal assertion for the purpose of showing that the shirt not only belonged to [the defendant] but was in fact worn by him on the day of the crime\u201d and was, therefore, inadmissible hearsay evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 237 S.E.2d at 781-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In this case, when the defendant asked \u201cDoes Peggy know I am here?\u201d, he was necessarily implying or asserting, \u201cI know Peggy personally.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970) (finding that a witness\u2019 statement included an implicit identification of the accused); <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949) (finding that a conspirator\u2019s statement implied petitioner\u2019s guilt); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>715 F.2d 99 (3d Cir.1983) (recognizing the validity of implied assertions and holding that codefendant\u2019s statement, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them anything about you,\u201d was relevant only to prove the accused\u2019s guilt and, therefore, inadmissible hearsay); <em>see also </em>Laurence H. Tribe, <em>Triangulating Hearsay, </em>87 Harv. L.Rev. 957, 958 (1974); Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Implied Hearsay: Defining the Battle Line Between Pragmatism and Theory, </em>11 S. Ill. U. L.J. 1127, 1141 (1987). The Virginia Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he rule against hearsay prohibits ... the admission of extra-judicial statements \u2018only when offered for a special purpose, namely, as assertions to evidence the truth of the matter asserted.\u2019\u201d <em>Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 211-12, 335 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1985). The defendant offered the statement, \u201cDoes Peggy know I am here?\u201d, to prove by implication from the question that he personally knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>victim. In order for the jury to infer from the statement that the defendant knew the victim, the jury had to determine the truth or falsity of the implied assertion. The statement\u2019s probative value depended entirely upon the truth of an inferred fact that the statement implied and as such it was hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Defendant\u2019s statement to Officer Berryman was not relevant for any other purpose and the fact that the statement was made in no way proved the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim unless the truthfulness of the implied assertion was accepted. Therefore, the statement was offered to prove the truth of its content and it was inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>III. CHARLES GENTRY\u2019S TESTIMONY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A defense witness, Charles Gentry, testified that he had seen the defendant and the victim together on two or three occasions. Defense counsel sought to have Gentry testify that he had \u201coverheard a conversation between the defendant and [the victim] involving trading sex and cocaine that took place in the area of Gibson\u2019s store.\u201d The trial judge ruled that the fact of the conversation, but not the content, was admissible because the content was hearsay and was not proper impeachment of the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not know the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The trial judge correctly ruled that the fact a conversation purportedly occurred was admissible to prove that the defendant and the victim knew one another. The fact that the conversation took place would also have been relevant to impeach the victim if the jury believed Gentry\u2019s evidence that the conversation occurred. However, the defendant did not seek to introduce the evidence that a conversation had occurred between the victim and the defendant after the trial judge ruled that Gentry could not testify as to the nature and particulars of the alleged conversation. Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>trial court erred in ruling that Gentry could not testify to the nature and content of the alleged conversation in order to prove that the defendant and victim knew one another and to prove the nature of the relationship. <em>See Manetta, v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 123, 127, 340 S.E.2d 828, 830 (1986) (\u201cIf the court can determine, from the context and from the other evidence in the case, that the evidence is offered for a ... purpose [other than to establish the truth of the facts asserted], the hearsay rule is no barrier to its admission.\u201d). Gentry would have testified that he had seen the victim and the defendant together on two or three occasions before the alleged offense and that on one occasion their conversation was about trading sex for cocaine. Gentry\u2019s testimony was offered to prove the fact that the statements about trading sex for cocaine were made; therefore, the truth or falsity of the alleged conversation was not at issue. However, the nature of the conversation between the victim and defendant tended to prove, if the fact finder believed it occurred, that the conversants were not strangers and were, in fact, more than casual acquaintances. The fact that the defendant and victim had engaged in a conversation of an intimate or personal nature prior to the alleged offense was relevant, if believed, to prove the prior relationship between them. Although the conversation would be inadmissible as hearsay to prove the truth or falsity of whether they in fact traded sex for cocaine, the fact that they may have engaged in an intimate conversation would prove that they knew one another, which is relevant to whether they engaged in consensual sex, and it could be considered to refute the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not know the defendant. Thus, the content of the alleged conversation \u201cwas not hearsay, but was admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to establish the probability of a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Church, </em>230 Va. at 212, 335 S.E.2d at 825.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). The trial court had discretion to limit the extent to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>witness would be permitted to give the details and particulars of the conversation. However, because the alleged conversation was relevant to prove the nature of the relationship between the victim and the defendant, which fact was material to prove whether the sexual intercourse was consensual or against the victim\u2019s will by force or violence, it was error to prohibit Gentry from testifying about the general content of the alleged conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Although the trial court erred by refusing to admit Charles Gentry\u2019s testimony, the error was harmless. \u201cA defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one.\u201d <em>Lutwak v. United States, </em>344 U.S. 604, 619, 73 S.Ct. 481, 490, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953). \u201c[A]n erroneous evidentiary ruling does not require reversal of a criminal conviction where the error is harmless.\u201d <em>Weller v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 886, 896, 434 S.E.2d 330, 337 (1993) (holding that exclusion of non-hearsay testimony was harmless error), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>443 S.E.2d 171 (1994) (affirming order unpublished in Virginia Court of Appeals Reports). Because the defendant conceded that he had sexual intercourse with the victim, the only issues for the jury to decide were whether the intercourse was accomplished through the use of physical force and against the will of the victim. Evidence independent of the victim\u2019s testimony and without regard to her credibility proved overwhelmingly that the defendant used force to accomplish non-consensual sexual intercourse. <em>See Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 454, 423 S.E.2d 360, 366 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036, 113 S.Ct. 1862, 123 L.Ed.2d 483 (1993); <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 288, 237 S.E.2d 136, 138-39 (1977). Thus, even if the jury believed that the defendant and the victim discussed exchanging sex for drugs and that such a conversation affected the victim\u2019s credibility, those determinations would have had no bearing upon the jury\u2019s decision that the defendant used force to have non-consensual sexual intercourse with the victim. Therefore, neither the jury\u2019s guilty verdict nor its recommended sentence would have been influenced by admitting Charles Gentry\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In Virginia, non-constitutional error is harmless \u201c[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d \u201c[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u201d are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict. ... An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (alteration in original) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Here, overwhelming evidence, independent of the victim\u2019s testimony, proved that the defendant used physical force to accomplish non-consensual sexual intercourse with the victim. All the witnesses who saw the victim on the night of the alleged crimes testified that she was clearly injured. The motorist testified that the victim was \u201cbloody\u201d and \u201cscared to death.\u201d The police officer testified that the victim\u2019s right eye was swollen and bruised. The emergency room physician stated that the victim had numerous injuries consistent with forced sexual intercourse, including a bloody right eye that was swollen shut, a bloody nose, red marks on her forehead, several scratches on her right front thigh, several red marks on her throat, and dried blood on her head, hair, and perineum. Blood was found under all of the victim\u2019s fingernails, and her perineum was slightly swollen and red.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The physical evidence in the apartment proved a forcible entry. A chair had been placed against the wall below the kitchen window. The window sill into the apartment was bent, and the screen to the kitchen window was damaged. Palm prints that were identified as belonging to the defendant were found on the kitchen sink facing inward from the kitchen window. The defendant\u2019s shoes were found on the kitchen sink, and dirt on the shoes appeared to match the dirt in the victim\u2019s backyard. Furniture had been knocked over in the apartment, and blood was found in approximately eight differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ent areas on a bed sheet. Blood was also found on the \u2022victim\u2019s t-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The defendant\u2019s story to the police was inconsistent with the physical evidence. The defendant told the police that he went to the victim\u2019s apartment because he had obtained marijuana for her. However, no marijuana was found in the apartment, and the victim\u2019s blood did not test positive for marijuana. Furthermore, although the defendant\u2019s blood tested positive for cocaine, it showed no trace of marijuana. A forensic expert testified that marijuana would be present in a person\u2019s blood for at least twenty-four hours after the last use. The police found recent bite marks on the defendant\u2019s thumb, which were consistent with the victim\u2019s claim that she had bitten it.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In light of the overwhelming evidence, the admission of Charles Gentry\u2019s testimony that he claimed to have overheard a conversation between the defendant and victim tending to prove that they knew one another and discussed trading cocaine for sex would not have affected the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. <em>See Hanson, </em>14 Va.App. at 191, 416 S.E.2d at 24 (holding that certain hearsay statements that should have been excluded were nonetheless \u201cinconsequential\u201d in light of the overwhelming evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt). The defendant testified that the victim let him into her apartment and that no violence occurred. However, a reasonable fact finder could not have inferred that the violence or battering of the victim occurred after consensual sexual intercourse. The physical evidence discredited the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>See LaPrade v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 410, 418, 61 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1950) (\u201c[W]hat inferences are to be drawn from proved facts is within the province of the jury and not the court so long as the inferences are <em>reasonable and justified\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s error did not affect the defendant\u2019s sentence. The fact that the jury recommended the maximum sentence on all four counts does not require a finding that the error affected the jury\u2019s sentence recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>dations; rather, we must evaluate the seriousness of the error. <em>See Yager v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 608, 615, 260 S.E.2d 251, 256 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">At the sentencing phase in this bifurcated trial, the Commonwealth proved that in 1993 the defendant had been convicted of sodomy and assault and battery; in 1991 he had been convicted of grand larceny and breaking and entering; in 1990 he had been convicted of driving as an habitual offender and possession of cocaine; in 1989 he had been convicted of petit larceny and escape; and in 1985 he had been convicted of breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The jury\u2019s sentence recommendations were undoubtedly influenced by the brutality of the crimes against this victim and by the defendant\u2019s record of multiple felony convictions. The verdict and sentences would not have been affected by the admission of Charles Gentry\u2019s testimony that he purportedly overheard a conversation between the defendant and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In summary, the trial court did not err by refusing to admit Officer Berryman\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement indicating that he knew the victim. Furthermore, although it was error to exclude Charles Gentry\u2019s testimony concerning the nature and subject matter of the conversation that he allegedly overheard, the error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">.

Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 1068, 1070, 421 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1992). \u201cUnless it is offered to show its truth, an out-of-court statement is not subject to the rule against hearsay and is admissible if relevant.\u201d <em>Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 212, 335 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1985); <em>see also Hamm v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 150, 156, 428 S.E.2d 517, 521 (1993) (\u201cIf a statement is offered for any purpose other than to prove the truth or falsity of the content of the statement, such as to explain the declarant\u2019s conduct or that of the person to whom it was made, it is not objectionable as hearsay.\u201d),</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">For a statement to be considered hearsay, the statement must contain an assertion of fact. \u201cAccording to the very definition of hearsay, an inquiry [or question] is not an assertion and therefore does not constitute hearsay.\u201d <em>Bolen v. Paragon Plastics, Inc., </em>754 F.Supp. 221, 225 (D.Mass.1990); <em>accord United States v. Lewis, </em>902 F.2d 1176, 1179 (5th Cir.1990); <em>State v. Carter, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, 971, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 575, 133 L.Ed.2d 498 (1995); <em>Washington v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 132, 589 A.2d 493, 495 (Md.1991). Because the testimony the trial judge excluded was the police officer\u2019s report that Brown asked a question, I would hold that the testimony was not barred by the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">I find nothing in Virginia decisions to support the majority\u2019s expanded definition of hearsay. Although some jurisdictions have recognized that implied assertions may be hearsay, <em>see, e.g., Carlton v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 436, 681 A.2d 1181, 1184 (1996), the Supreme Court of Virginia has not adopted that rule. In determining Virginia law, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that \u201c[t]he rule against hearsay prohibits ... the admission of extra-judicial statements <em>\u2018only </em>when offered for a special purpose, namely, as <em>assertions to evidence the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>truth of the matter asserted.\u2019 \u201d Church, </em>230 Va. at 211-12, 335 S.E.2d at 825 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Church </em>that a child\u2019s out-of-court statement \u201cthat sex is \u2018dirty, nasty and it hurt\u2019 \u201d was not hearsay and was admissible as circumstantial evidence \u201cto show the child\u2019s attitude toward sex, an attitude likely to have been created by a traumatic experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 335 S.E.2d at 825-26. This ruling can only be interpreted as rejecting an \u201cimplied assertion\u201d analysis because the evidential predicate for the admission of the testimony in <em>Church </em>was most certainly \u201cimplied\u201d within the child\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The majority contends, however, that the Supreme Court in an earlier decision, <em>Stevenson v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 462, 237 S.E.2d 779 (1977), accepted the principle that implied assertions are hearsay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I disagree. The rule announced in <em>Stevenson </em>concerns the impropriety of using \u201c[njonverbal conduct of a person intended by him as an assertion ... [as] evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 237 S.E.2d at 781. The <em>Stevenson </em>opinion contains no discussion of \u201cimplied assertions\u201d and had no need to do so because the Court concluded that \u201cnonverbal conduct of a person\u201d is a \u201cstatement\u201d if it is intended as an assertion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Moreover, in <em>Stevenson, </em>the parties did not dispute the content of the assertion. <em>See id. </em>at 465-66, 237 S.E.2d at 781-82. Here, however, despite Brown\u2019s literal words, the majority designates as the \u201cimplied assertion\u201d what it perceives Brown intended to assert, or, more precisely, what a trier of fact could possibly infer from Brown\u2019s words. I cannot agree that the rule in <em>Stevenson, </em>finding an assertion in <em>conduct </em>consistent with that assertion, supports the majority\u2019s new rule, which finds an \u201cimplied assertion\u201d in a facially non-assertive question containing <em>words </em>with an entirely different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>meaning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Clearly, the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that an implied assertion contained within a non-assertive statement or question is hearsay is inconsistent with Virginia decisions. <em>See Church, </em>280 Va. at 211-12, 335 S.E.2d at 825-26; <em>Weller v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 886, 894-95, 434 S.E.2d 330, 336 (1993), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>443 S.E.2d 171 (1994) (affirming order unpublished in Virginia Court of Appeals Reports); <em>see also </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Implied Hearsay: Defusing the Battle Line between Pragmatism and Theory, </em>11 S. Ill. U. L.J. 1127, 1141-43 (noting that the Supreme Court declined to adopt an implied hearsay analysis in <em>Church).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Even under the majority\u2019s expanded definition of hearsay, I would hold that the officer\u2019s testimony did not constitute hearsay. According to the majority, a question may be hearsay if it contains an implied assertion of fact and is offered to prove that fact. In applying the new rule to this case, the majority states that \u201cwhen [Brown] asked \u2018Does [the complainant] know I am here?\u2019, he was necessarily implying or asserting, T know [the complainant] personally.\u2019 \u201d Even if I were to assume that the question contains an implied assertion of a fact, I disagree that it is the assertion the majority posits. If the question contains an implied assertion, it can be no more than an assertion that Brown was at the police station or that the complainant knew he was there. Simply put, I cannot agree that the question impliedly asserts that Brown knew the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although the trial judge ruled that the police officer could not testify that Brown asked the question, the judge later acknowledged that \u201cthe purpose of the question is not, Does she really know I\u2019m here?, but it\u2019s offered for the jury to establish some knowledge of a person that [Brown] would think to ask that as a question.\u201d I agree with the trial judge\u2019s observation that if any implied assertion is contained in the question, the assertion is either that the complainant knew Brown was at the police station or that Brown was at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The trial judge\u2019s comment precisely states the non-hearsay - purpose recognized in <em>Church </em>\u2014 circumstantial <em>evidence </em>of a fact not asserted in the statement. Here, the trial judge correctly acknowledged that the question was not offered to prove either that Brown was at the police station or that the complainant knew he was at the police station. Rather, it was offered for the non-hearsay purpose of showing Brown\u2019s state of mind toward the complainant that would cause him to ask that question. The fact that the question was asked also tended to prove by circumstantial evidence Brown\u2019s incredulity at being arrested \u2014 a state of mind likely to have arisen from his belief that his contact with the complainant was consensual. The trial judge\u2019s comment properly addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the purpose of offering in evidence the question. Brown\u2019s state of mind, that he was familiar with the complainant and believed the encounter was consensual, was proved by the fact that he asked the question and was central to his defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The evidence that was offered by Brown in this case fits squarely within the principle of <em>Church. </em>Because the police officer\u2019s testimony relating Brown\u2019s question was not hearsay under Virginia decisional law, I would reverse the trial judge\u2019s refusal to admit the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">GENTRYS TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">At trial, defense counsel sought to introduce testimony that Charles Gentry \u201cha[d] seen [Brown] and [the complainant] together on more than one occasion ... [and that] on one occasion, he overheard a conversation between [Brown] and [the complainant] involving trading sex and cocaine.\u201d In offering the evidence, Brown\u2019s counsel stated that the purpose of Gentry\u2019s testimony was to prove that Brown was well acquainted with the complainant. Brown\u2019s defense rested upon proving that he and the complainant knew each other and had consensual sexual intercourse. While I agree with the majority that the trial judge erred in excluding Gentry\u2019s testimony, I disagree with the conclusion that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\u201c \u2018[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u2019 are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). Gentry\u2019s testimony, if believed by the jury, would have tended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to prove an element of Brown\u2019s consent defense. Although the Commonwealth introduced physical evidence of disarray in the apartment and the complainant\u2019s injuries as proof of the sexual offenses, the question of rape or consensual sex ultimately rested upon the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of the witnesses. It is well settled that the credibility of witnesses, the weight accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters that are within the province of the fact finder. <em>See Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">If the trial judge had not barred the evidence and the jury found Gentry to be a credible witness, the jury would have had a basis upon which it could have found that the complainant lied concerning her relationship with Brown. Because the complainant and Brown agreed that sexual relations occurred but differed on whether the acts were consensual, the credibility of each \u201cwas paramount in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 210, 361 S.E.2d 436, 448 (1987). Thus, we cannot \u201cconclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>231 Va. at 107, 341 S.E.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Furthermore, a harmless error analysis is not merely a sufficiency of the evidence analysis. <em>See Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992). The evidence in this case was disputed. Even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed testimony may well have affected the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978). Where, as here, the trial judge excludes evidence that tends to support the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, the harmful effect of that error cannot be determined merely by weighing the merits of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The harmful error lies in improperly denying the defendant an opportunity to put before the jury evidence to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>I would reverse the convictions and remand the case to the circuit court.

Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 710, 467 S.E.2d 297 (1996), discussed <em>infra </em>at note 2, stated that the \"conduct [at issue in <em>Stevenson </em>] was an implied assertion.\" <em>Id. </em>at 718, 467 S.E.2d at 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-5\">. Indeed, in <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 710, 717-19, 467 S.E.2d 297, 301-02 (1996), a panel of this Court rejected a defendant\u2019s objection that testimony concerning nonverbal conduct that contained an assertion was hearsay. <em>See id. </em>That decision distinguished <em>Stevenson </em>and tacitly applied a <em>Church </em>analysis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>White, </em>a defendant was tried on various charges including malicious wounding and larceny of a police officer\u2019s handgun. <em>See id. </em>at 710, 467 S.E.2d at 297. A police officer testified that the defendant shot him. <em>See id. </em>at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302. After a scuffle with the defendant, the officer saw the defendant leaving with a gun. <em>See id. </em>The officer then discovered that his 9mm handgun was missing. <em>See id. </em>The Commonwealth sought to offer as evidence the police officer\u2019s 9mm handgun and testimony of a ballistics expert. <em>See id. </em>at 717, 467 S.E.2d at 301. Obviously, file police officer would have been a sufficient testimonial sponsor for the admission of his gun. However, the Commonwealth sought to establish a foundation for the admission of the gun by using another witness\u2019 testimony to prove the circumstances under which the gun was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The witness testified that the defendant visited her apartment the night after the shooting and asked the witness to arrange with the witness' neighbor an exchange of a 9mm gun for cocaine. <em>See id. </em>at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302. The witness testified that after she went to speak to the neighbor, the defendant visited the neighbor and returned with cocaine. <em>See id. </em>No testimony established that the witness saw the gun. <em>See id. </em>Over objection, the witness was allowed to testify that at the request of the police she went to her neighbor the following morning and retrieved a 9mm handgun. <em>See id. </em>at 718-19, 467 S.E.2d at 301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendant in <em>White </em>relied upon <em>Stevenson </em>for his contention that the evidence was hearsay. <em>See id. </em>at 717, 467 S.E.2d at 301. However, the opinion in <em>White </em>stated that the defendant asserted that this testimony was hearsay because it necessarily contained the neighbor's implied assertion that the gun given to the witness was the same handgun that the defendant gave to the neighbor the previous day. <em>See id. </em>at 717-18, 467 S.E.2d at 301. Whatever argument the defendant advanced, the opinion in <em>White, </em>like the majority in this case, analyzed <em>Stevenson </em>and stated that the \"conduct [at issue in <em>Stevenson </em>] was an implied assertion.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 718, 467 S.E.2d at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">However, no discussion in <em>Stevenson </em>referred to any \"implied assertion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The <em>White </em>decision held that the trial judge did not err in allowing the testimony because \"[cjircumstantial evidence, other than the neighbors' act of giving the gun to [the witness], connected the defendant with the 9mm handgun\u201d that the witness retrieved. <em>Id. </em>at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302. The decision elaborated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">The trier of fact did not have to rely on a nonverbal assertion by the neighbors to connect the defendant with the gun introduced at trial. <em>Proof </em>that [the officer\u2019s] gun was missing after the scuffle with the defendant, that the defendant was seen leaving the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>with a handgun, that the same evening the defendant arranged an exchange of a gun for drugs, and <em>that [the officer's] gun was retrieved from the persons who purportedly exchanged drugs for the gun, are circumstances </em>which prove that the handgun... was taken by the defendant from [the officer].</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The neighbor who purportedly gave cocaine to the defendant for a gun did not testify. Instead, the Commonwealth linked the gun to the defendant by using the testimony of the witness concerning the circumstances of the gun's retrieval. The issue to be established by the witness\u2019 testimony was that the gun the neighbor gave to the witness was the same gun that the neighbor received from the defendant. Obviously, under the majority\u2019s implied hearsay analysis, the witness\u2019 testimony that she received \"a 9mm handgun\u201d from the neighbor contains the implied assertion by the neighbor that it was the same handgun that the defendant earlier gave to the neighbor. No evidence proved that the witness saw the handgun in the defendant\u2019s possession or could testify from her own knowledge that it was the handgun the defendant possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Although the <em>White </em>decision did not cite <em>Church, </em>clearly its discussion of \"[cjircumstantial evidence\u201d and \"circumstances which prove that the handgun admitted in evidence was taken by the defendant from [the officer]\u201d tacitly applied the <em>Church </em>analysis. <em>See White, </em>21 Va.App. at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302. That <em>Church-type </em>analysis relied on \u201d[p]roof that ... [the officer\u2019s] gun was retrieved from the persons who purportedly exchanged drugs for the gun\u201d as a chain in the circumstantial evidence tending to \"prove that the handgun admitted in evidence was taken by the defendant from [the officer].\u201d <em>White, </em>21 Va.App. at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302; <em>cf. Church, </em>230 Va. at 212, 335 S.E.2d at 825-26. Although the \"proof that ... [the officer's] gun was retrieved from the persons who purportedly exchanged drugs for the gun\u201d necessarily contains the neighbor\u2019s assertion, this Court relied on that proof as admissible circumstantial evidence linking the gun to the defendant. <em>See White, </em>21 Va.App. at 719, 467 S.E.2d at 302. Thus, <em>White </em>implicitly rejected the majority\u2019s implied hearsay analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-10\">.
