Finding no error, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the claimant, the prevailing party, the evidence proved that claimant was moving five to seven five-gallon paint buckets from one location to another within a storage shed when he \u201cstarted feeling just a sore place\u201d in his lower back. As soon as he felt this \u201csoreness,\u201d he stopped moving the buckets and sat down. Claimant testified that \u201cthe longer I sat there the more the pain started really getting bad then. It was like my back was almost getting ready to lock up on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">After claimant was injured, he reported his injury to his supervisor, who had come to the storage shed. Claimant attempted to continue working but was unable to do so. The next morning, he again attempted to work but could not stay because he was in pain. The following day, claimant went to the doctor and was later diagnosed with a right paracentral disc herniation at L2-L3, a mild disc bulge at L3-L4, and a central subligamentous disc herniation at L4-L5.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u201cTo qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, an employee\u2019s injuries must result from an event \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc. v. Helmes, </em>242 Va. 378, 380, 410 S.E.2d 646, 647 (1991). \u201cA finding by the commission that an injury arose out of and in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>employment is a mixed finding of law and fact and is properly reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>Dublin Garment Co. v. Jones, </em>2 Va.App. 165, 167, 342 S.E.2d 638, 638 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u201cIn order to carry his burden of proving an \u2018injury by accident,\u2019 a claimant must prove that the <em>cause </em>of his injury was an <em>identifiable incident or sudden precipitating event </em>and that it resulted in an <em>obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 589, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865 (1989) (emphasis in original). A disc herniation is a mechanical or structural change in the body. The employer contends, however, that claimant\u2019s injury was gradually incurred over the course of moving several paint buckets and was not the result of a \u201csudden precipitating event.\u201d Although a claimant must prove a \u201csudden precipitating event\u201d that caused the injury, \u201c[t]o constitute injury by accident it is not necessary that there should be an extraordinary occurrence in or about the work engaged in.\u201d <em>Kemp v. Tidewater Kiewit, </em>7 Va.App. 360, 363, 373 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1988) (quoting <em>Derby v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>188 Va. 336, 344, 49 S.E.2d 417, 421 (1948)). \u201cSudden\u201d as used in this context means an \u201cimmediate\u201d event that causes or precipitates an injury; \u201csudden\u201d is not used here to connote an <em>unexpected </em>consequence. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2284 (1981). Thus, \u201csudden precipitating\u201d event is one that \u201cimmediately\u201d causes an injury, as distinguished from an injury that appears or occurs gradually. <em>See Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795 (1996). However, an injury or injuries may be caused by one or several \u201csudden [or immediate] events\u201d that cause the mechanical changes to occur in the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The commission did not err by finding that claimant suffered the herniated discs as the result of a compensable accident \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. While moving the five-gallon paint buckets, claimant felt a pain in his back and stopped moving the buckets. There was no evidence that the herniated discs occurred gradually or over a period of time. There was no evidence that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>had a history of a prior disc problem. The commission, as finder of fact, could reasonably have found on these facts that while lifting the five to seven buckets the claimant felt \u201csoreness\u201d which was the pain that he was experiencing as the discs herniated as a result of his lifting one or more of the five to seven buckets. Lifting one or more of the buckets was the \u201csudden precipitating event\u201d or events that caused the discs to herniate, which was \u201can obvious sudden ... structural change in the body.\u201d The fact that the claimant did not or could not identify precisely which bucket or buckets he was lifting when the disc or discs herniated does not constitute a failure to prove that an immediate or sudden event or events caused the discs to herniate. Unlike the claimant in <em>Morris, </em>who, after unloading seven steel doors from a truck, later developed soreness in his back and could not recall a specific incident that caused his injury, claimant immediately felt \u201csoreness\u201d while he lifted the buckets. These facts support the commission\u2019s finding that when claimant felt \u201csoreness\u201d as he was lifting several buckets he was experiencing pain associated with the discs herniating, which were sudden mechanical or structural changes in the body. Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
