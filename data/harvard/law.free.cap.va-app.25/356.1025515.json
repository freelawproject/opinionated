Following an appeal by Social Services, a circuit court judge ruled that the juvenile court judge lacked authority to order that treatment because Social Services had the sole statutory authority to determine the minor\u2019s placement. By her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the minor contends in this appeal that the juvenile court judge had the authority to order treatment. We agree and reverse the circuit court judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The minor was brought before the juvenile court for violating the terms of her probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A juvenile court judge ruled that the minor had violated the terms of her probation and ordered that (1) Prince William County Community Services examine the minor and treat her if necessary, (2) Prince William County Department of Social Services (Social Services) prepare an assessment of the minor by October 5, 1995, and (3) the probation office refer the case to a Family Assessment and Planning Team (FAPT) to complete a report by October 5,1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">After that order was entered, the minor, by her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>moved the juvenile court judge to transfer legal custody of the minor to Social Services. Before the scheduled hearing on October 5, 1995, the FAPT issued a report recommending that the minor, her mother, and her stepfather attend counseling and that the minor be released from probation. After the October 5, 1995 hearing, the juvenile court judge returned the minor to her mother\u2019s custody, released the minor from probation, and ordered the minor, her mother, and her stepfather to participate in counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Shortly after the minor was returned to her mother\u2019s custody, the minor ran away from home and did not attend school. The juvenile court judge then placed the minor in the legal custody of Social Services and indicated that this was done \u201c[a]s a partial disposition.\u201d The judge made the findings that \u201creasonable efforts ... ha[d] been made ... to prevent removal and that continued placement in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As required by Code \u00a7 16.1-281, Social Services filed with the juvenile court a foster care service plan. The juvenile court judge approved the plan. After that approval, Social Services placed the minor at the home of her paternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">On review of the minor\u2019s case, the juvenile court judge ordered the FAJPT to reevaluate the minor\u2019s status and issue a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>new report. The FAPT issued a report which recommended that treatment for the minor \u201cbe explored\u201d at a therapeutic foster home or a residential treatment facility. The FAPT report also noted \u201c[s]ome concerns ... regarding the safety and appropriateness of [the minor\u2019s] grandparent\u2019s home\u201d and recommended that Social Services determine whether the home was a \u201csafe environment.\u201d The minor, by her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>moved the juvenile court judge to enter an order requiring treatment of the minor in a residential treatment facility. After hearing the arguments of counsel, the juvenile court judge entered an order providing, in relevant part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">[T]he Court having received the [FAPT] recommendations of 19 March 1996, it appearing to the Court that the best interest of the [minor] would be served by placing her in a therapeutic foster home ... it is ... DECREED that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">1. [Social Services] shall arrange for the placement of ... [the minor] in a Therapeutic Foster Home through United Methodist Family Services (or its equivalent); and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">2. If [Social Services] cannot place ... [the minor] in a Therapeutic Foster Home through United Methodist Family Services (or its equivalent), [Social Services] shall arrange for her placement in a[n] appropriate residential facility to be approved by this Court prior to the Court\u2019s next review date____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Social Services appealed the order to the circuit court and filed a demurrer, asserting that the juvenile court judge was without jurisdiction or authority to enter the order. The circuit court judge sustained the demurrer \u201con the [ground] that as long as custody remains with [Social Services], Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8(13)(c) places authority for placement with [Social Services].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court judge reversed the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The issue on appeal is whether a juvenile court judge can order Social Services to place a minor in a facility for treatment when custody of the child has been granted to Social Services pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">If a child is found to be in need of services, the juvenile court or the circuit court may make any of the following orders of disposition for the supervision, care and rehabilitation of the child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">6. Transfer legal custody to any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">H\u00ed sfc H! sfc H\u00ed H\u00ed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">c. The local board of public welfare or social services of the county or city in which the court has jurisdiction____ <em>The board to which the child is committed shall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement for the child.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">(Emphasis added). Social Services argues, and the circuit court judge agreed, that because Social Services has \u201cfinal authority to determine the appropriate placement for the child,\u201d the juvenile court judge lacked the power to enter the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The juvenile court judge based his authority to enter the order on Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-757 and 16.1-281. The order granting the minor\u2019s motion stated that the minor sought \u201c(1) pursuant to [Code \u00a7 ] 2.1-757 E____, an Order placing [the minor] in an appropriate residential treatment facility ... and (2) pursuant to [Code \u00a7 ] 16.1-281 E., a review of [the minor\u2019s] present living circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">Preliminarily, we note that Code \u00a7 2.1-757 establishes a statutory funding mechanism for the Comprehensive Services Act for At-Risk Youth and Families (CSA). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>745 to 2.1-759.1. In addition to providing funding, Code \u00a7 2.1-757(E) provides the juvenile court with the following power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_t\">In any matter properly before a court wherein the [FAPT] has recommended a level of treatment and services needed by the child and family, the court shall consider the recommendations of the [FAPT]. However, the court may make such other disposition as is authorized or required by law, and services ordered pursuant to such disposition shall qualify for funding under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The purpose of that section is to authorize funding for placements ordered by a judge in a proper case even when the judge elects not to follow the FAPT\u2019s recommendation. <em>Cf. Fauquier Co. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Robinson, </em>20 Va.App. 142, 154, 455 S.E.2d 734, 740 (1995). By its express terms, Code \u00a7 2.1-757(E) requires that the \u201cmatter [be] properly before a court\u201d and authorizes funding only for dispositions that are \u201cauthorized or required by law.\u201d Thus, the juvenile court judge could rely on Code \u00a7 2.1-757 as authority for his disposition if the matter involving the minor was properly before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The other provision the juvenile court judge relied upon, Code \u00a7 16.1-281, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">A. In any case in which ... legal custody of a child is given to ... [S]ocial [S]ervices ..., [Social Services] ... or the ... [FAPT] established pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 2.1-753 shall prepare a foster care plan for such child____ [Social Services] ... shall file the plan with the juvenile ... court within sixty days following the transfer of custody____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">* * # # * :{:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">C. A copy of the entire foster care plan shall be sent by the court to the attorney for the child, the child\u2019s parents or any other person standing in loco parentis at the time ... [Social Services] obtained custody---- Any party receiving a copy of the plan may petition the court for a review of the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>E. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the juvenile [court] judge or the staff of the juvenile court, upon order of the judge, to review the status of children in the custody of ... [S]ocial [Services ... on its own motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANL\">The minor argues that the power \u201cto review the status of children\u201d set forth in subsection E granted the juvenile court judge the authority to consider the FAPT report and order Social Services to obtain treatment for the minor in a residential treatment facility. Social Services argues that the juvenile court judge divested himself of that authority when he granted Social Services legal custody of the minor under Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c), which states that Social Services \u201cshall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We hold that the juvenile court judge retained the authority to \u201creview the status\u201d of the minor even after she was placed in the custody of Social Services. Code \u00a7 16.1-281(E) expressly states that children in the custody of Social Services are those the juvenile court judge can review pursuant to that section. <em>See id. </em>(giving the juvenile court judge the power \u201cto review the status of children in the custody of local boards of ... social services\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Contrary to the argument of Social Services, Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(e) does not mandate a different result. The statement that \u201c[t]he [local] board [of social services] to which the child is committed shall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement for the child,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c), was intended to give Social Services the power to override the wishes or recommendations of the child\u2019s parents, the FAPT, or any other interested party. That section was not intended to divest the juvenile court judge of power to review the status of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Social Services argues that allowing the juvenile court judge to review its placement decisions would unduly interfere with its operations and thereby undermine the ability of Social Services to provide services to children. However persuasive that argument may be, nothing in the Code indicates an intent by the General Assembly to prevent the juvenile courts from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>reviewing the foster care decisions of Social Services. Rather, Code \u00a7 16.1-281 requires Social Services or the FAPT to file a foster care plan with the juvenile court within sixty days of receiving custody of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-281(A). The plan must contain the detailed information required by Code \u00a7 16.1-281(B). Thereafter, any interested party may petition the juvenile court for a review of the plan and the juvenile court judge may revise the plan. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-281(C). Moreover, under Code \u00a7 16.1-281(E), the juvenile court judge may, on the judge\u2019s own motion, \u201creview the status\u201d of the child. Thus, the scope of the judge\u2019s power to oversee the provision of treatment and care to a particular child is not limited to a review of the plan submitted by Social Services or the FAPT. The General Assembly clearly intended to provide the juvenile courts, under Code \u00a7 16.2-281, broad authority to oversee the status of children in the custody of Social Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u201cStatutes must be construed consistently with each other and so as to reasonably and logically effectuate their intended purpose.\u201d <em>Nelson v. County of Henrico, </em>10 Va.App. 558, 561, 393 S.E.2d 644, 646 (1990). We cannot conclude that in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c), the General Assembly intended to divest the juvenile court of the authority it granted to the juvenile court in Code \u00a7 16.1-281. Rather, we hold that the General Assembly intended to provide that an order granting an agency custody of a child gives that agency the power, as against the child\u2019s parents, relatives, and other interested parties, to determine appropriate placements for that child. The General Assembly did not intend to prohibit the juvenile court from exercising the authority granted to it in Code \u00a7 16.1-281.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the juvenile court judge had the authority to enter the decree ordering Social Services to provide treatment for the minor in a residential treatment facility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The circuit court order reversing that decree was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>error. We, therefore, reverse the order and remand the case to the circuit court for an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">. Although the minor asserts on brief that she initially was brought into juvenile court \"as a result of a routine Child in Need of Supervision [CHINS] ... petition filed ... when school authorities reported her as truant,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5, the record does not contain the initial petition. Evidence in the record does indicate, however, that this was a CHINS proceeding. <em>See infra </em>note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. FAPTs are authorized to \u201cassess the strengths and needs of troubled youths and families ... and determine the complement of services required to meet these unique needs.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-754. <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-745 to 2.1-759.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">A juvenile court judge is required, upon finding that a child is in need of supervision, <em>see infra </em>note 3, to have the child\u2019s needs evaluated. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5(A). The judge may have the FAPT perform this evaluation. <em>See id.; see also Fauquier Co. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Robinson, </em>20 Va.App. 142, 151-52, 455 S.E.2d 734, 739 (1995) (stating that Code \u00a7 16.1-278(A) authorizes courts \"to compel the FAPT ... to provide any necessary services\u201d); Code \u00a7 2.1-757(D). Thus, the juvenile court judge's order directing the probation office to refer the case to a FAPT was authorized by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. The motion previously filed by the guardian <em>ad litem </em>sought a change of custody pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8, the provision for delinquent juveniles. When the judge eventually transferred custody to Social Services, the judge did not set forth the provision under which he was proceeding. However, the foster care service plan, issued after custody was transferred to Social Services, lists \"CHINS\" as the minor\u2019s \"Custody Status.\u201d \"CHINS\" is an abbreviation for \"child in need of supervision\u201d or \"child in need of services.\u201d At oral argument, Social Services agreed that this proceeding was initiated by a CHINS petition. Accordingly, we conclude that the juvenile court judge acted pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.5(B)(1) (\"Child in need of supervision\u201d) (authorizing the juvenile court judge to enter any order authorized in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4 (\"Child in need of services\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The judge's reference to the minor as a \"child,\u201d rather than a \"juvenile,\u201d lends additional support to our conclusion that the trial judge was treating the minor as a child in need of supervision or services and not as a juvenile. <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c) (\"Any order ... transferring legal custody of a <em>child </em>to ... [Sjocial [Sjervices as provided in this subdivision shall be entered only upon a finding ... that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal and ... continued placement in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the <em>child </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>with </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8(13)(c) (\"Any order ... transferring legal custody of a <em>juvenile </em>to ...

The provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-278.8(13)(c) relied upon by the circuit court judge is also contained in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.4(6)(c). Thus, our conclusion that the juvenile court judge proceeded under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 278.4(6)(c) does not affect the circuit court judge\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-16\">.

Social Services argues on brief that the FAPT was an essential party to the proceedings. However, Social Services lacks standing to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the failure to include another party.
