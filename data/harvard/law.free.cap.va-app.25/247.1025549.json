Hawks (mother) appeals the trial court\u2019s order terminating her residual legal rights to remain the parent of her son, James Leroy Walker (child). She contends that the trial court erred when it concluded that child had not reached an \u201cage of discretion\u201d and did not allow her to secure his presence in court so that he could express his opinion on the termination proceeding. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On July 26,1989, after being incarcerated, mother signed an entrustment agreement granting custody of child to the Dinwiddie County Department of Social Services (department). Mother was released from incarceration in 1992. After several failed attempts to permanently reunite mother and child, in January, 1996, the department filed a petition seeking the termination of mother\u2019s residual parental rights. A juvenile and domestic relations court terminated mother\u2019s residual parental rights in June, 1996, and mother appealed to the circuit court (trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The trial court held a hearing on the department\u2019s petition on September 17, 1996. The child was not present at the hearing, and mother moved for a continuance so that he could be present to testify. Mother argued that child had reached an \u201cage of discretion\u201d and that under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) the trial court should grant him an opportunity to object to the termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Before deciding mother\u2019s motion, the trial court heard evidence on the issue of whether child had attained an \u201cage of discretion.\u201d Dorthea Townes, a senior social worker with the department, testified that she had been involved with mother\u2019s and child\u2019s case since its inception. She testified that the child is eleven and one-half years of age and that he is smart, bright, \u201cvery good mannered,\u201d and \u201cdoes well [talking] with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>adults.\u201d She testified that child \u201cthinks more like an 11-year-old, not like an older child.\u201d She testified that child had problems completing assignments in school during the previous year and had been held back to repeat the fifth grade. She also testified that child has been diagnosed with hyperactivity and depression and currently received therapy and medication for these conditions. She testified that she had met with child approximately four times since the beginning of the termination proceeding and had explained to him \u201cwhy we were coming to court and the decisions that the judge makes.\u201d She testified that child was capable of explaining to the trial court his feelings about his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Michelle L. Ferris, child\u2019s guardian <em>ad litem, </em>also testified on the issue of whether child had reached the \u201cage of discretion.\u201d She testified that she met with child several times during the proceedings and that their last meeting took place six months before the termination hearing. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aji\">We discussed all of the proceedings. He will tell you how he feels about his mother and, you know, there is no doubt that he will tell you that he loves her. He will tell that to Mrs. Townes. He will tell that to anybody. He also will tell you, though, that he understands she cannot take care of him. And I think in making that statement that shows a level of maturity on his part to recognize that he doesn\u2019t blame his mother for that, he just accepts it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">She also testified that child appears to be \u201cnormal\u201d for his age. She concurred with the opinion of Amy R. Gilbert, child\u2019s psychological counselor, that child needs a \u201cnurturing stable structuring environment\u201d to cope with his problems in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">A report written by Ms. Gilbert was also made part of the record. In the report, Ms. Gilbert stated that child suffered from depression \u201crelated to his relationship\u201d with mother. She wrote that child exhibited \u201cattention seeking\u201d behavior that stemmed from his lack of nurturing in his early years. At his foster parents\u2019 home, child had \u201csneaked\u201d food from the kitchen and hidden it under his pillow and had \u201ctaken money and toys\u201d from his foster parents and other children. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>opined that child will need continued psychiatric treatment \u201cto deal with his depression related to these abandonment issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial court concluded that child had not reached an \u201cage of discretion\u201d and denied mother\u2019s motion for a continuance to secure child\u2019s presence. It reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">I think [Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) ] uses the age of 14 for a reason and I think in light of the history of this child, 11, who is experiencing some psychological, emotional problems, is not on grade at school, has not exhibited any tendencies to make him older than his years, I think that would all have to be taken into consideration in determining whether he was at the age of discretion.... <em>I think that he at this age </em>\u2014 it <em>would have to be something here to indicate that he is </em>extraordinary and older than most children at 11 and <em>able to comprehend and appreciate the circumstances. I do not find that from the record.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">(Emphasis added). The trial court proceeded to hear evidence and ordered the termination of mother\u2019s residual parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">AGE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Mother contends that the trial court erred when it refused to allow her to secure child\u2019s presence in court so that he could state his opinion regarding the termination proceeding. Specifically, she argues that the trial court erred when it concluded that child had not reached an \u201cage of discretion\u201d that would have empowered him to block the termination hearing under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283 establishes the procedures and grounds pursuant to which a court may order the termination of residual parental rights. The section contains a \u201cchild preference clause\u201d that limits the power of a court to terminate parental rights in certain circumstances. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, residual parental rights shall not be terminated if it is established that the child, if he is fourteen years of age or older <em>or otherwise of an age of discretion as determined by the court, </em>objects to such termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">(Emphasis added). A child who falls under one of the classes of children described in the statute \u201cmust be afforded a meaningful opportunity to object\u201d to the proceeding to terminate the residual parental rights of his or her parent. <em>Deahl v. Winchester Dept. of Social Services, </em>224 Va. 664, 676, 299 S.E.2d 863, 869 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In cases in which the testimony of a child younger than fourteen is sought, the determination of whether or not the child has reached an \u201cage of discretion\u201d is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See id. </em>at 676, 299 S.E.2d at 869. However, if the evidence proves that a child is \u201csufficiently mature to have intelligent views and wishes on the subject\u201d of the termination proceeding, then the trial court should conclude that a child who is younger than fourteen has reached the \u201cage of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 299 S.E.2d at 869. When determining whether a child is mature enough to have intelligent views and wishes on the subject, the trial court should consider all of the circumstances, including the \u201ccapacity, information, intelligence, and judgment of the child.\u201d <em>Coffee v. Black, </em>82 Va. 567, 569-70 (1886). The trial court\u2019s determination will be reversed on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">When reviewing the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See Logan v. Fairfax County Dept. of Human Development, </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991). Where, as here, evidence is heard <em>ore tenus, </em>we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s judgment unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id.; Lowe v. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 282, 343 S.E.2d 70, 73 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>We hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it concluded that child had not reached an \u201cage of discretion.\u201d The trial court based its conclusion on the finding that no evidence in the record indicated that child was \u201cable to comprehend and appreciate the circumstances\u201d of the termination proceeding. The evidence in the record was insufficient to support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The only evidence in the record regarding child\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the termination proceeding indicates that he was aware of its existence and understood its ramifications. Ms. Townes testified that child was aware of both the juvenile and domestic relations court\u2019s decision terminating mother\u2019s parental rights and mother\u2019s decision to appeal to the trial court. She testified that she talked with child on four separate occasions about the termination proceeding and that she explained to him \u201cwhy we were coming to court and the decisions that the judge makes.\u201d She also testified that child could explain to the trial judge his feelings about his mother. Ms. Ferris testified that she \u201cdiscussed all of the proceedings\u201d with child during her last meeting with him and that the two had a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d Moreover, child neither appeared before nor met with the trial judge to discuss his understanding of the proceeding, and no evidence indicates that child, despite his psychological and emotional problems, was unable to comprehend the information about the proceeding conveyed to him by Ms. Townes and Ms. Ferris. Because the trial court based its conclusion that child had not reached an age of discretion on a finding not supported by the evidence, its conclusion was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In addition, the trial court\u2019s legal analysis of the \u201cage of discretion\u201d issue is somewhat confusing. Prior to hearing the evidence on this issue, the trial court correctly recited the test for determining whether a child has reached the \u201cage of discretion\u201d set forth in <em>Deahl. See </em>224 Va. at 675-76, 299 S.E.2d at 869 (stating that a child is of the \u201cage of discretion\u201d when he or she is \u201csufficiently mature to have intelligent views and wishes on the subject\u201d). However, in its analysis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>evidence, the trial court appeared to indicate that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) required it to find that child\u2019s maturity level equaled or exceeded that of a fourteen-year-old. The trial court stated that \u201c[Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) ] uses the age of 14 for a reason\u201d and that the test for determining whether a child under 14 had reached an age of discretion required \u201csomething [in the record] ... to indicate that [the child] is extraordinary and older than most children\u201d of his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">However, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) does not include such a requirement. Indeed, the statute, as construed in <em>Deahl, </em>prohibits a trial court from basing its determination of whether a child has reached the \u201cage of discretion\u201d solely on presumptions regarding the child\u2019s age. Instead, the focus of the inquiry is whether the child, regardless of how old he or she may be, is mature enough to intelligently consider the circumstances and ramifications of the termination proceeding. The <em>Deahl </em>test is consistent with the general consensus among child development theorists and researchers that the decision-making capabilities of children develop gradually until they reach an adult level in their mid-teens but that the pace of development is dynamic and varies from child to child based on experience. <em>See </em>Wallace J. Mlyniec, <em>A Judge\u2019s Ethical Dilemma: Assessing a Child\u2019s Capacity to Choose, </em>64 Fordham L.Rev. 1873, 1878-85 (1996) (summarizing current theory and research on child development). Thus, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) requires an assessment of the particular child\u2019s circumstances, including his or her capacity, information, intelligence, and judgment, in order to determine whether that child possesses sufficient maturity to have intelligent views and wishes on the termination of his or her parent\u2019s parental rights. <em>See Deahl, </em>224 Va. at 675-76, 299 S.E.2d at 869; <em>Coffee, </em>82 Va. at 569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For the foregoing reasons we reverse the order of the trial court ordering the termination of mother\u2019s residual parental rights and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
