Miller was convicted for knowingly and intentionally possessing a firearm after having been previously convicted of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Raising an issue of first impression in the Commonwealth, Miller argues that his conviction was obtained in violation of his right to due process of law. We agree, reverse his conviction and dismiss the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Miller, a convicted felon, knew he was prohibited from possessing a firearm. Knowing the prohibition extended to his hunting activities, Miller, a lifetime hunter, sold his hunting guns following his conviction. He continued to hunt with a bow and arrows until his bow was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Wanting to pursue his sport, Miller sought to determine whether he, as a convicted felon, could possess a muzzle-loading rifle. Miller knew that Virginia law distinguished muzzle-loading rifles from other guns. Specifically, he knew that Virginia did not require a criminal background check to be performed on individuals seeking to purchase muzzle-loading rifles. He also knew that Virginia defined different hunting seasons for and issued different licenses to hunters using muzzle-loading rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Miller testified that he \u201ctalked to everyone who [he] thought might know the answer.\u201d He spoke with his probation officer, who told him he could have a muzzle-loading rifle. He also inquired of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF), and representatives from each, who knew Miller was a convicted felon, told him he could have a muzzle loader. Miller acknowledged that no one told him he could possess a \u201cfirearm\u201d and that a muzzle loader was \u201cin a sense\u201d a firearm because \u201cit fires.\u201d Relying on the interpretation provided by the government officials contacted, Miller purchased a muzzle loader and obtained a license to hunt with it. In short, Miller, a convicted felon, knowingly and intentionally possessed a muzzle-loading rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Miller\u2019s possession of the muzzle loader was discovered by police officers during an unrelated search of the house in which Miller was living. Charged with possession of the gun as a convicted felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, Miller argued at trial that his muzzle loader was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The trial court disagreed, and Miller has now abandoned that contention. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we will assume without deciding that Miller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>muzzle loader was a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Miller argued at trial that his \u201cgood faith reliance\u201d on the advice he received regarding the propriety of his possession of the muzzle loader, regardless of the accuracy of that advice, precludes his conviction. His argument is grounded in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court believed Miller\u2019s testimony concerning the content of the information he received but concluded that the sources of Miller\u2019s information were not sufficient to preclude his conviction on due process grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Reflecting the axiom that everyone is \u201cpresumed to know the law,\u201d the common law rule that \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d admitted of few exceptions. <em>See People v. Studifin, </em>132 Misc.2d 326, 504 N.Y.S.2d 608, 609 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1986); <em>Wimbish v. Commonwealth, </em>75 Va. 839, 844 (1880). The common law position was based on the fact that most common law crimes were <em>malum in se. Studifin, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 609. Seen as \u201cinherently and essentially evil ... without any regard to the fact of [their] being noticed or punished by the law of the state,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>959 (6th ed.1990), ignorance of the prohibition of such crimes was simply untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The rationale underlying the rule is less compelling for crimes that are <em>malum prohibitum, viz., </em>acts that are \u201cwrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>because prohibited,\u201d not by virtue of their inherent character. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>960 (6th ed.1990); <em>see generally Studifin, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 609-10. Yet, the proposition that ignorance of the law is no excuse generally maintains with respect to crimes <em>malum prohibitum, </em>largely for pragmatic purposes. <em>Studifin, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 610; <em>see also </em>21 Am. Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 142 (1981) (Without the rule, \u201cchaos and impossibility of law enforcement would ensue.\u201d) (citation omitted). Although leading at times to seemingly \u201cunfair\u201d results, rigid application of the rule promotes the policy it serves: \u201cto encourage people to learn and know the law.\u201d <em>E.g., Clark v. State, </em>739 P.2d 777, 779 (Ak.app.1987); <em>see also Wimbish, </em>75 Va. at 845; Oliver W. Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>48 (1881) (\u201cIt is no doubt true that there are many cases in which the criminal could not have known that he was breaking the law, but to admit the excuse at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know and obey____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Nonetheless, \u201c[w]ith \u2018the increasing complexity of law, the multiplication of crimes <em>mala prohibita, </em>and a more exact definition of fundamental principles of criminal liability,\u2019 certain exceptions to the general rule have emerged.\u201d <em>Studifin, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 610 (citation omitted). It is such an exception that we address in the present case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The exception at issue addresses the legal consequences of a violation of the criminal law by an individual who takes measures to learn what conduct the government has proscribed, but is misadvised by the government itself. A number of states have adopted statutes bearing on the subject, but Virginia has not. <em>See generally </em>Jeffrey F. Ghent, Annotation, <em>Criminal Law: \u201cOfficial Statement\u201d Mistake of Law Defense, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>89 A.L.R.4th 1026 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Miller, thus constrained to rely on constitutional principles for his defense, contends that his prosecution and conviction for possessing a firearm violates his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The defense Miller advances grew from a trilogy of United States Supreme Court cases, <em>Raley v. Ohio, </em>360 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 1257, 3 L.Ed.2d 1344 (1959); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965); <em>United States v. Pennsylvania Chem. Corp., </em>411 U.S. 655, 93 S.Ct. 1804, 36 L.Ed.2d 567 (1973) (PICCO). The defendants in <em>Raley </em>were called to answer questions before the Ohio State legislature\u2019s \u201cUn-American Activities Commission.\u201d The chairman of the Commission apprised the defendants that, at the inquiry, they were entitled to rely upon the privilege against self-incrimination. A state immunity statute, however, deprived the defendants of the protection of the privilege. After relying upon the privilege, the defendants were indicted for failing to answer the Commission\u2019s questions. The Ohio Supreme Court held that the defendants were presumed to know that the law deprived them of the protection of the privilege and that, therefore, they had committed an offense by failing to answer the questions to which they asserted the privilege. The United States Supreme Court reversed the convictions, finding that \u201cthe Chairman of the Commission, who clearly appeared to be the agent of the State in a position to give such assurances, apprised [the defendants] that the privilege in fact existed.\u201d 360 U.S. at 437, 79 S.Ct. at 1266. The Court farther noted that \u201cother members of the Commission and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>counsel made statements which were totally inconsistent with any belief in the applicability of the immunity statute, and it is fair to characterize the whole conduct of the inquiry ... as identical with what it would have been if Ohio had had no immunity statute at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 79 S.Ct. at 1266. The Court found the representations of the Commission \u201cactively] misleading,\u201d not \u201csimply vague or even contradictory,\u201d and although the representations were legally erroneous, the Commission was \u201cthe voice of the State most presently speaking to the [defendants].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 79 S.Ct. at 1267. The Court concluded that to sustain the convictions \u201cwould be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by the State\u2014 convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 79 S.Ct. at 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The defendant in <em>Cox </em>was convicted for demonstrating \u201cnear\u201d a courthouse in violation of a Louisiana statute. The United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction, finding that \u201cthe highest police officials of the city, in the presence of the Sheriff and Mayor, in effect told the demonstrators that they could meet where they did.\u201d 379 U.S. at 571, 85 S.Ct. at 484. The Court noted the \u201clack of specificity\u201d in the use of the word \u201cnear\u201d in the statute, which the Court found \u201cforesees a degree of on the spot administrative interpretation by officials charged with responsibility for administering and enforcing it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 85 S.Ct. at 483. The Court found it apparent that demonstrators \u201cwould justifiably tend to rely on [an] administrative interpretation of how \u2018near\u2019 the courthouse a particular demonstration might take place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 85 S.Ct. at 483. Applying <em>Raley, </em>the Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for demonstrating \u201cnear\u201d the courthouse after he had been told that his demonstration was not \u201cnear\u201d the courthouse. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 85 S.Ct. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The defendant corporation in <em>PICCO </em>was convicted for discharging industrial refuse into a river, in violation of \u00a7 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. In its regulations promulgated under the Act, the Army Corps of Engineers had consistently construed \u00a7 13 as limited to discharges that af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>fected navigation. PICCO\u2019s discharge was such that it would not affect navigation. Relying on <em>Raley </em>and <em>Cox, </em>the Court reversed the conviction, finding</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">[t] here can be no question that PICCO had a right to look to the Corps of Engineers\u2019 regulations for guidance. The Corps is the responsible administrative agency under the 1899 Act, and \u201cthe rulings, interpretations and opinions of the [responsible agency] ..., while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which ... litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d Moreover, although the regulations did not of themselves purport to create or define the statutory offense in question, it is certainly true that their designed purpose was to guide persons as to the meaning and requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">411 U.S. at 674, 93 S.Ct. at 1816 (citations omitted). The Court remanded the case for a determination of whether PICCO\u2019s reliance was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The defense derived from the <em>Raley, Cox, PICCO </em>trilogy applies where a defendant has reasonably relied upon affirmative assurances that certain conduct is lawful, when those assurances are given by a public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct with respect to the offense at issue. The defense is a due process defense, <em>Raley, </em>360 U.S. at 437, 79 S.Ct. at 1265-66; <em>Cox, </em>379 U.S. at 571, 85 S.Ct. at 484, grounded in \u201ctraditional notions of fairness inherent in our system of criminal justice.\u201d <em>PICCO, </em>411 U.S. at 674, 93 S.Ct. at 1817; <em>United States v. Caron, </em>64 F.3d 713, 715 (1st Cir.1995) (applying standard of fundamental fairness), <em>modified in part on other grounds, </em>77 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 2569, 135 L.Ed.2d 1085 (1996); <em>United States v.

Miami L.Rev. 627, 632 (1994) (characterizing <em>Raley </em>and <em>Cox </em>as grounded in \u201csubstantive due process\u201d analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><em>Raley </em>relied on prior United States Supreme Court cases addressing elementary notions of fairness in the criminal process, and emphasized that \u201ccriminal sanctions are not supportable if they are to be imposed under Vague and undefined\u2019 commands (citing <em>Lanzetta v. New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939)); or if they are \u2018inexplicably contradictory5 (citing <em>United States v. Cardiff, </em>344 U.S. 174, 73 S.Ct. 189, 97 L.Ed. 200 (1952)); and certainly not if the Government\u2019s conduct constitutes \u2018active misleading\u2019 (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 189, 197, 63 S.Ct. 549, 553, 87 L.Ed. 704 (1943)).\u201d <em>United States v. Laub, </em>385 U.S. 475, 487, 87 S.Ct. 574, 581, 17 L.Ed.2d 526 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The due process argument is, in essence, \u201cthat the criminal statute under which the defendant is being prosecuted cannot constitutionally be applied to the defendant without violating due process of law, where government officials have misled the defendant into believing that his conduct was not prohibited.\u201d Ghent, <em>supra, </em>at 1031; <em>see also Studifin, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 610 (\u201c[F]or the state to prosecute someone for innocently acting upon such mistaken advice is akin to throwing water on a man and arresting him because he\u2019s wet.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The ultimate due process inquiry is whether a defendant\u2019s conviction, for reasonably and in good faith doing that which he was told he could do, is fundamentally unfair in light of the content of the information he received and its source. The cases addressing the defense demonstrate that the defendant must establish, as a threshold matter, the legal sufficiency of the content and source of the information received. <em>See PICCO, </em>411 U.S. at 674-75, 93 S.Ct. at 1816-17 (establishing threshold determination that defense was legally \u201cavailable\u201d). The application of the defense then requires a factual determination whether the defendant\u2019s reliance upon the information received was reasonable and in good faith. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant bears the burden of establishing the affirmative defense. <em>See id. </em>at 675, 93 S.Ct. at 1817; <em>Howell, </em>37 F.3d at 1205.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>With respect to content, the defense is available only where the information upon which the defendant has relied is an affirmative assurance that the conduct giving rise to the conviction is lawful.

Indeed, \u201c[t]his is necessary as a matter of constitutional law because the Due Process Clause ... is limited to \u2018state action.\u2019 \u201d Connelly, <em>supra, </em>at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">However, a government official\u2019s status as \u201cstate actor\u201d has not alone been sufficient to invoke the defense in cases recognizing its availability. The issue is not whether an \u201cagent\u201d of the state has bound the government by his or her word. The issue is whether convicting an individual who has reasonably relied on the advice of a state actor is so fundamentally unfair as to raise due process concerns. Such concerns are implicated only when the source of the information is a public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct with respect to the offense at issue. <em>See Raley, </em>360 U.S. at 439, 79 S.Ct. at 1267 (source of information was Commission conducting inquiry at which defendants asserted privilege against self-incrimination); <em>Cox, </em>379 U.S. at 568, 85 S.Ct. at 482-83 (sources of information were highest police officials of city, who were \u201ccharged with responsibility for administering and enforcing\u201d statute by virtue of legislature\u2019s use of word \u201cnear,\u201d which \u201cfore[saw] a degree of on-the-spot administrative interpretation\u201d of permissible conduct); <em>PICCO, </em>411 U.S. at 674, 93 S.Ct. at 1816 (source was Corps of Army Engineers, which was \u201cthe responsible administrative agency under the [Act defining the offense]\u201d and whose \u201c \u2018rulings, interpretations and opinions ... constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which ... litigants may properly resort for guidance\u2019 \u201d as to what conduct was permissible); <em>Abcasis, </em>45 F.3d at 43 (source was law enforcement agent who allegedly solicited defendant to engage in otherwise criminal conduct as a cooperating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>informant); <em>United States v.

The defense has been nearly universally rejected in this dual-sovereign context. <em>See generally Caron, </em>64 F.3d at 715-16. The only exceptions are cases where a defendant has relied on the advice of a state judge with respect to federal law. These cases are thought to raise sufficient fairness concerns to warrant application of the defense as a bar to federal prosecution. <em>Compare Brady, </em>710 F.Supp. at 295, <em>with United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 321 (4th Cir.), <em>and United States v. Bruscantini, </em>761 F.2d 640, 642 (11th Cir.). <em>Brady, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>applied the defense, addressed the fairness concerns inherent in that context by virtue of the state court judge\u2019s constitutional duty to interpret and apply federal law. Conversely, <em>Bruscantini </em>and <em>Etheridge </em>concluded that the dual-sovereignty context eviscerated the fairness concerns giving rise to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The rule of <em>Cox </em>and <em>Raley </em>is a narrow exception to the general principle that ignorance of the law is no defense. It was prompted by the Court\u2019s observation that permitting the government to prosecute individuals who reasonably rely upon that government\u2019s interpretation of the law would constitute a kind of entrapment. Where, however, the government that advises and the government that prosecutes are not the same, the entrapment problem is different.</p>\n<p id=\"AXs\"><em>Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d at 321 (quoting <em>Bruscantini, </em>761 F.2d at 641-42).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In the present case, the trial court found that Miller\u2019s probation officer and representatives from ATF and VDGIF told Miller that he could possess a muzzle-loading rifle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that Miller had established the legal sufficiency of the content of the information he received, <em>viz., </em>an affirmative assurance that certain conduct \u2014 his possession of the muzzle loader \u2014 was lawful. <em>Cf. Aquino-Chacon, </em>109 F.3d at 939 (explaining that defendant must show more than \u201cvague or even contradictory\u201d statements by government; must demonstrate that there was \u201cactive misleading\u201d); <em>Clark, </em>986 F.2d at 69 (holding observation upon which defendant allegedly relied not an \u201cassurance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Moreover, there can be no doubt that the sources upon which appellant relied \u2014 a federal ATF agent, a VDGIF agent, and his probation officer \u2014 were \u201cstate actors.\u201d <em>Cf. Clark, </em>986 F.2d at 69 (taxidermist not government official); <em>Indelicate, </em>887 F.Supp. at 25 (private attorney not government official). The determinative issue, therefore, is whether these sources were legally sufficient to invoke the due process defense, <em>viz., </em>whether the sources were charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct with respect to offense for which Miller was convicted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">We hold that Miller\u2019s case fails as a matter of law with respect to the ATF agent and the VDGIF agent. Neither of those agents was charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The ATF agent, although arguably charged with such responsibility under federal firearms laws, has no such duty with respect to Virginia law. The ATF officer\u2019s opinion as to whether Miller could possess a muzzle loading rifle under Virginia law simply does not invoke due process concerns in the Commonwealth of Virginia\u2019s bid to prosecute Miller. <em>See Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d at 321; <em>Bruscantini, </em>761 F.2d at 642; <em>Brady, </em>710 F.Supp. at 295. Likewise, the Commonwealth of Virginia has not charged the VDGIF with the duty of defining permissible conduct under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The VDGIF exists to provide public, informational and educational services related to Title 29.1, which concerns Game, Inland Fisheries and Boating. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 29.1-109.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is the agency responsible for the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>tion and enforcement of all rules and regulations of Title 29.1 and related acts, but it is not charged with defining what conduct Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 proscribes. Thus, the opinion of VDGIF with respect to the permissibility of Miller\u2019s possessing a muzzle loader does not implicate due process concerns. <em>Cf. PICCO, </em>411 U.S. at 674, 93 S.Ct. at 1816; <em>Cox, </em>379 U.S. at 568, 85 S.Ct. at 482-83; <em>Raley, </em>360 U.S. at 439, 79 S.Ct. at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">By contrast, however, Miller\u2019s probation officer was charged by the Commonwealth with responsibility for defining Miller\u2019s permissible conduct with respect to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. The legislature granted the probation officer supervisory responsibility for Miller\u2019s conduct and treatment during the course of his probation, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-145,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>responsibility for arresting him for a violation of his probation. Violation of the law regarding the possession of a firearm by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>convicted felon was surely one. It follows that a probation officer, statutorily required to supervise, assist, and provide a probationer with a statement of the conditions of his release from confinement, as well as to arrest a probationer for a violation of the terms of his release, is, <em>a fortiori, </em>charged by law with defining a probationer\u2019s permissible or impermissible conduct. The authority to enforce the law and effect an arrest, of necessity, requires an interpretation of what constitutes permissible conduct. For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erroneously concluded that Miller\u2019s probation officer was not a source legally sufficient to invoke the Due Process Clause as a bar to his prosecution and conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>5. Make and enter into all contracts and agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of his duties and the execution of his powers, including, but not limited to, contracts with the United States, other state agencies and governmental subdivisions of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>It remains only to be determined whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, Miller\u2019s reliance on the advice of his probation officer was reasonable and in good faith. Upon review of the uncontradicted evidence in this case, we find, as a matter of law, that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Miller\u2019s conviction is accordingly reversed, and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">. In particular, the court stated, \"I don\u2019t believe that his conversations with ATF or [VDGIF] ... come close to rising to the level of something upon which he could properly rely in his position.\u201d Continuing, the trial court stated that it was \"much more concerned\u201d about Miller\u2019s conversation with his probation officer. The court stated, \"the probation officer acts in a much more direct way with this Defendant and is an arm of the Commonwealth for this Defendant\u2019s purposes.\u201d \"But,\u201d the court found,</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I am unpersuaded actually, based upon the testimony that was provided, that the probation officer was in such a position relative to this Defendant that would rise to the level of the authorities in the cases in which this defense has been recognized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"><em>. </em>The defense Miller advances has been characterized as \u201c 'a narrow exception to the general principle that ignorance of the law is no defense,' \" <em>e.g., United States v.

Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 321 (4th Cir.1991)), which should be applied with \" \u2018great caution.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

A typical formulation of the exception is reflected in \u00a7 2.04(3)(b) of the Model Penal Code, which provides that a belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense to a prosecution for that offense based on such conduct when the defendant acts in reasonable reliance on an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in (1) a statute or other enactment; (2) a judicial decision, opinion, or judgment; (3) an administrative order or grant of permission; or (4) an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for the interpretation, administration, or enforcement of the law defining the offense. Ghent, <em>supra, </em>at 1030.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">. The defense has come to be known as \"entrapment by estoppel,\u201d although it is neither \"entrapment,\u201d <em>see </em>Note, <em>Applying Estoppel Principles in Criminal Cases, </em>78 Yale L.J. 1046, 1046-47 (1969), nor \"an estoppel at all in any meaningful sense.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>710 F.Supp. at 295. Indeed, the Supreme Court has never used the term \"entrapment by estoppel.\u201d Moreover, neither <em>Raley </em>nor <em>Cox </em>use the word \"estoppel,\u201d and it remains unclear whether the Supreme Court considers <em>PICCO </em>to have been decided on estoppel grounds. <em>Compare Heckler v. Community Health Services, </em>467 U.S. 51, 60 n. 12, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 2224 n. 12, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984) (suggesting <em>PICCO </em>decided on estoppel grounds), <em>with </em>id.. at 68, 104 S.Ct. at 2228 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in the judgment) (stating that <em>PICCO </em>was not an estoppel case).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The \"entrapment by estoppel\u201d misnomer inhibits clear analysis and application of the defense, because the use of the word \u201cestoppel\u201d unnecessarily places the due process basis for the defense in conflict with the well-established principle that \"the Government may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>estopped on the same terms as any other litigant.\u201d <em>Heckler, </em>467 U.S. at 60, 104 S.Ct. at 2224; <em>see also Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 544, 548, 413 S.E.2d 658, 660 (1992) (\"[Tjhe doctrine of estoppel does not prevent the Commonwealth from enforcing laws in its governmental function.\u201d). Furthermore, the use of the word \"estoppel\" improvidently suggests that the dispositive analysis is grounded in the application of agency principles rather than constitutional concerns. <em>See Brady, </em>710 F.Supp. at 295 (\u201d[T]he doctrine stems from the due process clause, not from the common law of contract, equity or agency.\u201d); <em>see also Austin, </em>915 F.2d at 366 (same); <em>Conley, </em>859 F.Supp. at 932 (\"The focus of the Due Process inquiry into fundamental fairness and substantial justice ... should not be arbitrarily constrained by concepts taken from other contexts such as estoppel, actual authority or deterrence.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\">. Of course, the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s reliance is inextricably linked to the content of the information received and its source. <em>See, e.g., Howell, </em>37 F.3d at 1204 (Reliance must be reasonable \"in light of the identity of the agent, the point of law represented, and the substance of the misrepresentation.\u201d). Ultimately, however, \"reasonableness\u201d can be determined only after a finding that the content and source of the information are legally sufficient to invoke due process concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. We note that the seriousness of the crime at issue as well sis other policy concerns may preclude the application of the defense as a matter of law. <em>See Cox, </em>379 U.S. at 569, 85 S.Ct. at 483 (\"Obviously telling demonstrators how far from the courthouse steps is \u2018near\u2019 the courthouse for purposes of a permissible peaceful demonstration is a far cry from allowing one to commit, for example, murder, or robbery.\u201d); Connelly, <em>supra, </em>at 636 (explaining that even where the technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>elements of the defense are found, the court could still refuse to apply the defense when policy considerations so demand). <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>at 1060 (discussing nature of the offense at issue). Indeed, we believe it could scarcely be said that an individual could reasonably and in good faith rely on advice condoning the commission of a serious crime.
