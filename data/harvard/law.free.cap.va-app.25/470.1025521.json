Whitlock (claimant) was, at the time of his injury, a sole proprietor who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>qualified as an \u201cemployee\u201d and thus was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(n). Claimant argues that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission erred in finding that he was an independent contractor who failed to properly elect coverage pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-305 and 65.2-101(l)(n) and that he was not entitled to benefits as a sole proprietor under these code sections. For the reasons that follow, we find no error and affirm the judgment of the commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On October 17, 1994, claimant fell and broke his leg and ankle during the course of his employment. At the time of his injury, claimant was a sole proprietor, trading as \u201cWhitlock Mechanical,\u201d who engaged in the business of providing heating and air conditioning services. Claimant had procured the job from a custom builder. The job involved installing an air conditioner in the ceiling of a new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">During that period, claimant had a business relationship with an entity called Check Services, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Check). For a small fee, Check performed various tasks for claimant. Check withheld claimant\u2019s state and federal taxes, performed payroll services, and occasionally referred claimant jobs in his field. The nature of Check\u2019s business was unrelated to the heating and air conditioning trade; rather, it was a \u201cleasing\u201d company that was \u201cessentially a bookkeeping service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Pennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Insurance Company. (PMA) provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Check. Following his injury, claimant applied for workers\u2019 compensation medical benefits through PMA. By letter dated August 2,1995, PMA denied claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>claim, stating that claimant was \u201cnot technically an employee of [the] insured, Check Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">A hearing regarding claimant\u2019s coverage by PMA was held on May 9, 1996 before a deputy commissioner. Claimant described the relationship between his company and Check in the following terms: \u201cHunt Financial and Check Services, I work for them. And the[ ] way I did that is she took out my Workmen\u2019s Comp, [premiums] and she took out my federal and state income tax.\u201d Claimant explained that a representative from Check told him that Check Services was a \u201cleasing company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Claimant further testified that Whitlock Mechanical was a sole proprietorship, and that he, trading as Whitlock Mechanical, had no other employees. He indicated that at the time he was injured, he \u201cjust worked for [him]self \u2019 and was in \u201ccontrol at the jobsite.\u201d Finally, he admitted that he did not fill out or sign any document that he understood to be an application for workers\u2019 compensation insurance and that he did not make a specific election for coverage under Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-305 and 65.2-101(l)(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Mike Stafford, an account claims executive with PMA, also testified at the hearing. He reviewed the PMA insurance policy and stated that \u201cthe coverage for Check Services, Inc. would be to all officers or employees of Check Services.\u201d He further testified that the policy covered only the \u201cnamed insured\u201d and that claimant was not covered under this policy because \u201che was not an employee of Check Services but that he was a sole proprietor and that he had control over his work product, and for that reason was not [an] employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">By opinion dated May 10, 1996, the deputy commissioner found that claimant was \u201ccovered under Check Services\u2019 policy\u201d and that \u201cthe claimant contracted with Check Services, Inc. for very specific reasons, reasons which included workers\u2019 compensation coverage.\u201d In reaching this decision, the deputy commissioner specifically referred to the certificate of insurance produced by claimant \u201cwhich indicated that WHIT-LOCK MECHANICAL\u2019 had WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSA-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>TTON\u2019 coverage under Check Services\u2019 policy at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">However, upon review, the full commission determined that claimant was an independent contractor, not an employee of Check, and reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. Additionally, the commission found that claimant operated Whit-lock Mechanical as a sole proprietor and as such did not come within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Although the commission confirmed that Check occasionally obtained contracts for air conditioning services for Whitlock Mechanical to perform, provided bookkeeping services for claimant, collected money for work performed by claimant, deposited state and federal taxes on behalf of claimant, and issued checks to claimant, the commission found that Check exercised <em>no control </em>over claimant or his work. The commission concluded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">PMA covered only the employees of the independent contractor, Whitlock Mechanical, and [ ] this was the purpose of the certificate. <em>The claimant himself, as an independent contractor, could not he a statutory employee of another contractor, nor of Check Services, Inc. </em>Only Whitlock Mechanical\u2019s employees, had there been any, would qualify as statutory employees (\u00a7 65.2-302, Code of Virginia).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We find no contract of employment between Check Services, Inc. and the claimant____ <em>We find insufficient evidence that the claimant himself has elected to be covered under the PMA </em>policy____ <em>Such an election is provided by [Code \u00a7 65.2-305], </em>but it is clear that this [s]ection contemplates the employer itself directly applying with an insurance carrier for such insurance and being specifically a named insured [Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(n) ]. In this case, the claimant attempts to establish coverage through the policy issued to another insured. His effort fails for the reasons set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">II. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR v. EMPLOYEE</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">It is undisputed that at the time of his injury, claimant was a sole proprietor. However, on appeal, claimant argues that the commission erred in finding that he was an independent contractor rather than an employee of Check.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">A sole proprietor ... is not necessarily an independent contractor. A sole proprietor may have employees who are subject to the act. A sole proprietor may also elect to be an employee covered by the act. <em>Whether a sole proprietor who does not so elect is an employee or an independent contractor depends upon the nature of the relationship, </em>particularly whether the person who hires him or her retains the right to control the work to be performed. Whether such a person is an employee under the act is usually a question of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\"><em>Metropolitan Cleaning Corp., Inc. v. Crawley, </em>14 Va.App. 261, 265, 416 S.E.2d 35, 38 (1992) (emphasis added) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>omitted). \u201c What constitutes an employee is a question of law; but, whether the facts bring a person within the law\u2019s designation, is usually a question of fact.\u2019 The worker\u2019s status \u2018must be determined from the facts of the particular case in the light of well settled principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Intermodal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 600, 364 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1988) (quoting <em>Baker v. Nussman, </em>152 Va. 293, 302, 147 S.E. 246, 249 (1929), and <em>Brown v. Fox, </em>189 Va. 509, 516, 54 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u201c \u2018On appellate review, we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. Factual findings by the commission that are supported by credible evidence are conclusive and binding upon this Court on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>White Elec. Co., Inc. v. Bak, </em>22 Va.App. 17, 23, 467 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1996) (quoting <em>Barnes v. Wise Fashions, </em>16 Va.App. 108, 109, 428 S.E.2d 301, 301-02 (1993)); <em>see also Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 120, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">Generally, \u201ca person is an employee if he works for wages or a salary and the person who hires him reserves the power to fire him and the power to exercise control over the work to be performed.\u201d The right of control is the determining factor in ascertaining the parties\u2019 status in an analysis of an employment relationship. And the right of control includes not only the power to specify the result to be attained, but the power to control \u201cthe means and methods by which the result is to be accomplished.\u201d An employer-employee relationship exists if the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work. \u201c[I]f the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Intermodal Servs., </em>234 Va. at 601, 364 S.E.2d at 224 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In the instant case, the record clearly established that Check exercised no control over claimant or his work. Check primarily provided unrelated administrative services for claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ant. Check had no contract of employment with claimant. Check did not pay claimant a salary or wages nor did it have the power to fire him. Claimant maintained exclusive control over his work. Accordingly, we find that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s determination that claimant was not an employee of Check but was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">III. COVERAGE UNDER THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Additionally, claimant contends that he meets the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(n) and that he elected workers\u2019 compensation coverage by entering into an employment contract with Check and by paying premiums to Check. Claimant also argues that the commission misinterpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-305.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As support for his contention, claimant points to Check\u2019s policy and the Certificate of Insurance issued by PMA identifying Whitlock Mechanical as a covered contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">It is uncontroverted that claimant was a sole proprietor at the time of his injury. A sole proprietor may obtain coverage as an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 65.2 \u2014 101(l)(n) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Any sole proprietor or all partners of a business <em>electing </em>to be included as an employee under the workers\u2019 compensation coverage of such business 2/the insurer is notified of this election. Any sole proprietor or the partners shall, <em>upon such election, </em>be entitled to employee benefits and be subject to employee responsibilities prescribed in this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">When any partner or proprietor is entitled to receive coverage under this title, such person shall be subject to all provisions of this title as if he were an employee; however, the notices required under \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-405 and 65.2-600 of this title shall be given to the insurance carrier, and the panel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>physicians required under \u00a7 65.2-603 shall be selected by the insurance carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">(Emphasis added). Additionally, the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-305(A) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">Those employers not subject to this title may, by complying with the provisions of this title and the applicable rules of the Commission, <em>voluntarily elect to be bound </em>by it as to accidents or occupational diseases or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">(Emphasis added). Thus, the crux of the issue is whether claimant\u2019s actions constituted an \u201celection\u201d under the Act and whether the insurer was sufficiently \u201cnotified\u201d of his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">It is undisputed that Check was the insured of PMA. As stated above, claimant was not an employee of Check and thus was not covered under the insurance policy in that capacity. Moreover, no evidence in the record proved that claimant specifically elected to be covered under the policy as a sole proprietor, and no evidence proved that he gave express notice to the insurer of his intention to be personally covered. While claimant testified he paid Check to retain workers\u2019 compensation coverage, he also testified that he never filled out or signed any document or form that he understood to be an application for workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Claimant gave no written notice to PMA or to Check that he elected to be covered under workers\u2019 compensation. Claimant admitted that he dealt only with Check personnel up until the time of his injury, and nothing in the record indicates that claimant communicated with any agent of PMA or any other insurance underwriter for the purpose of electing coverage as a sole proprietor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Moreover, the commission stated that \u201cPMA covered only the employees of the independent contractor, Whitlock Mechanical, and that this was the purpose of the [insurance] certificate.\u201d The commission found no contract of employment between Check and claimant; rather, the commission determined that claimant was a customer of Check and that Check provided bookkeeping services for claimant and referred work to him occasionally. The commission further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>established that Check was not in the building or construction trade, or any business that required services of a heating and air conditioning mechanic. The commission specifically decided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">[There is] insufficient evidence that the claimant himself has elected to be covered under the PMA policy____ Such an election is provided by statute [Code \u00a7 65.2-305], but it is clear that this [s]ection contemplates the employer itself directly applying with an insurance carrier for such insurance and being specifically a named insured [Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(n) ]. In this case, the claimant attempts to establish coverage through the policy issued to another insured. His effort fails____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Giving deference to the matters coming within the cognizance, expertise, and knowledge of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, <em>Metropolitan Cleaning Corp., Inc., </em>14 Va.App. at 265, 416 S.E.2d at 38, and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the employer, who prevailed below, <em>White Elec. Co., </em>22 Va.App. at 23, 467 S.E.2d at 830, we find that claimant made no election for coverage as a sole proprietor and provided no notice of any such election to the insurer. Thus, we hold that claimant was ineligible to receive benefits as an \u201cemployee\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l)(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Auq\">. Employer also contends that the deputy commissioner erred by failing to take judicial notice of certain insurance provisions. However, we do not address this issue, as we affirm on other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. Check Services, Inc. went out of business in December 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-302 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">A. When any person ... undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person ... for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title he would have been liable to pay if the worker had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">B. When any person ... contracts to perform or execute any work for another person which work or undertaking is not a part of the trade, business or occupation of such other person and contracts with any other person ... for the execution or performance by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such contractor, then the contractor shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>which he would have been liable to pay if that worker had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">C.

Claimant argues that under Code \u00a7 65.2-305 he was not responsible for notifying PMA of his election for coverage and that he was not responsible for \"directly applying] to the insurance company for coverage.\u201d However, claimant cites no authority for this proposition. We find no basis to support claimant's interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-305.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
