Cregger (defendant) was convicted in a bench trial of driving \u201cwhile having a blood alcohol content of 0.08 percent or while under the influence of alcohol\u201d (DUI). On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erroneously admitted a \u201cCertificate of Breath Alcohol Analysis\u201d (certificate) into evidence, a copy of which had not been provided to him by the attorney for the Commonwealth in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-187. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">/. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">On April 8, 1995, Trooper L.F. Valley observed an automobile enter an intersection \u201cwithout stopping at the stop sign,\u201d \u201cnearly hitting\u201d the trooper\u2019s vehicle. Upon approaching the car, Valley \u201cdetected ... an odor of alcohol\u201d and ascertained that defendant was, the driver. Subsequent analysis of defendant\u2019s breath, reported on the disputed certificate, revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.13 grams per 210 liters of breath, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A warrant charging defendant with the subject offense was thereafter obtained, returnable to the \u2018Wythe General District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>On August 17, 1995, defendant\u2019s counsel, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187, requested the attorney for the Commonwealth to furnish a copy of the certificate prior to defendant\u2019s trial in the general district court. The Commonwealth failed to comply, but the district court admitted the certificate into evidence over defendant\u2019s objection, resulting in conviction. Defendant appealed to the circuit court, without requesting a copy of the certificate incidental to prosecution of the offense in that forum. Nevertheless, defendant objected to introduction of the certificate into evidence during trial in the circuit court, again arguing that the Commonwealth had neglected to comply with his earlier motion in the general district court. The trial court overruled the objection, admitted the disputed certificate, and convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">In any <em>hearing </em>or <em>trial </em>of any criminal offense or in any proceeding brought pursuant to Chapter 22.1 ... of this title, a certificate of analysis ... shall be admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided (i) <em>the </em>certificate of analysis is filed with <em>the </em>clerk of <em>the </em>court hearing <em>the </em>case at least seven days prior to <em>the hearing </em>or <em>trial </em>and (ii) a copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered by <em>the </em>clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to <em>the hearing </em>or <em>trial </em>upon request of such counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">(Emphasis added.) It is well established that \u201c\u00a7 19.2-187 should be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused, since \u2018it undertakes to make admissible evidence which otherwise might be subject to a valid hearsay objection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 372, 374, 404 S.E.2d 237, 238 (1991) (quoting <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 943, 945, 265 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1980)). <em>But see Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (\u201c[Pjenal laws ... \u2018ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1271-72, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974))). A certificate is, therefore, inadmissible when \u201cthe Commonwealth fails strictly to comply with ... [the statute],\u201d including a default in providing an accused with a copy of the certificate pursuant to its provisions. <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 672, 674, 432 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1993); <em>see also Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 466, 468-69, 457 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">However, a principle of equal dignity in our jurisprudence instructs that \u201c[t]he province of [statutory] construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u201d <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 408, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954); <em>see Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. v. Featherstone Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>253 Va. 364, 368, 484 S.E.2d 883,-(1997). \u201cWords are ambiguous if they admit to \u2018being understood in more than one way[,]\u2019 ... refer to \u2018two or more things simultaneously^ ... are \u2018difficult to comprehend,\u2019 \u2018of doubtful import,\u2019 or lack \u2018clearness and definiteness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 301-02, 369 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). Absent such infirmities, the manifest intent of the legislature clearly expressed in its enactments should not be judicially thwarted under the guise of statutory construction. <em>See Winston, </em>196 Va. at 407-08, 83 S.E.2d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 renders a \u201ccertificate of analysis\u201d admissible in certain proceedings, including \u201cany hearing or trial of any criminal offense,\u201d provided it is timely \u201cfiled with <em>the </em>clerk of <em>the </em>court <em>hearing </em>the <em>case </em>\u201d and \u201ca copy ... is mailed or delivered by <em>the </em>clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for <em>the </em>accused ... prior to <em>the hearing </em>or <em>trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) By repeatedly employing the article \u201cthe,\u201d the legislature plainly and unambiguously referenced a specific \u201chearing or trial\u201d pending in a particular tribunal, imposing upon its clerk, the attorney for the accused and the attorney for the Commonwealth certain attendant responsibilities. <em>See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1222 (1989). The statute clearly does not contemplate a conjectural hearing or trial in an unknown forum. <em>See Allen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 657, 663-64, 353 S.E.2d 162,165-66 (1987) (filing of certificate in general district court clerk\u2019s office did not constitute statutory filing \u201cwith the clerk of the [circuit] court hearing the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, defendant\u2019s only request for a copy of the certificate related to the prosecution then underway in the general district court. When defendant subsequently appealed the conviction in that court to the circuit court, he invoked the jurisdiction of the trial court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-132, commencing a proceeding <em>de novo </em>pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-136 and \u201cannul[ling] the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.\u201d <em>Walker v. Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 563, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982); <em>see Buck v. City of Danville, </em>213 Va. 387, 388, 192 S.E.2d 758, 759 (1972). Under such circumstances, \u201cit appears entirely fair that <em>the accused and the State should start again at </em>parity____\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 579, 586, 186 S.E.2d 53, 58 (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>407 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 2458, 32 L.Ed.2d 812 (1972); <em>see also id. </em>at 584-86, 186 S.E.2d at 57-58 (circuit court is not bound by sentence imposed in district court); <em>Harbaugh v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 695, 698-99, 167 S.E.2d 329, 332 (1969) (defendant is not bound by a guilty plea entered in district court); <em>Ledbetter v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 805, 809, 447 S.E.2d 250, 252-53 (1994) (Commonwealth not bound by actions of prosecutor in district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Thus, absent a request by defendant for a copy of the certificate incidental to the <em>de novo </em>proceedings in the circuit court, Code \u00a7 19.2-187 imposed no duty upon the attorney for the Commonwealth, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s earlier request during the pendency of trial in the general district court. Accordingly, the certificate was properly received into evidence, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\">.

I would hold that the trial court erroneously denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the certificate of analysis (certificate) because the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney failed to comply with the request by appellant\u2019s counsel for a copy of the certificate before trial. I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 requires a defense counsel to renew a request for a copy of a certificate previously made to a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney when the defendant\u2019s case is appealed from a general district court to a circuit court. Consequently, I would reverse the conviction and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides that hearsay statements contained in a certificate are admissible to prove the truth of their assertions if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca copy of such certificate is mailed or delivered by the ... attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial <em>upon request of such counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We have repeatedly held that because Code \u00a7 19.2-187 provides an exception to the hearsay rule, a certificate is not admissible if the Commonwealth fails to strictly comply with the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, we have strictly construed the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 because it is a penal statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>I would hold that the trial court erred when it admitted the hearsay statements of the certificate because the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney failed to comply with the mailing requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-187. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested a copy of the certificate from the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney on August 17, 1995. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney neither mailed nor delivered a copy of the certificate to appellant\u2019s counsel prior to appellant\u2019s trial in the circuit court on October 24. We have previously held that the failure of either the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney or the clerk of court to strictly comply with the mailing requirement renders a certificate inadmissible. <em>See Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 466, 469, 457 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1995) (reversing conviction when clerk failed to mail a copy of certificate prior to trial); <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 515, 517, 452 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1995) (reversing conviction when Commonwealth\u2019s attorney delivered a copy of certificate only three days prior to trial); <em>Woodward v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 672, 674-75, 432 S.E.2d 510, 511-12 (1993) (holding that trial court erroneously admitted certificate when a copy was not sent prior to trial); <em>Mullins v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 372, 375, 404 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1991) (reversing conviction under a prior version of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 when clerk failed to send a copy prior to trial even though defendant\u2019s counsel had obtained a copy through discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 to require a defense counsel, who has already requested a copy of a certificate from the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney prior to a trial in general district court, to make a second request if the case is appealed to the circuit court. This interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 has no textual support and is inconsistent with a narrow reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-187 entitles a defense counsel to receive a copy of the certificate from a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney \u201cupon request.\u201d The plain language of the statute does not specify the manner in which such a request must be made and does not require a defense counsel to renew the request <em>ever, </em>much less following the appeal of his or her client\u2019s case from a general district court to a circuit court. <em>Cf. Woodward, </em>16 Va.App. at 675, 482 S.E.2d at 512 (holding that the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 does not prohibit a defendant\u2019s counsel from requesting a copy of a certificate <em>before </em>it is filed with the trial court). Instead, as Code \u00a7 19.2-187 is currently written, the duty of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to send a copy of a certificate arises <em>once a defense counsel has made a request. </em>Nothing in the statute indicates that this duty ceases when a <em>de novo </em>appeal of the defendant\u2019s case is taken to a circuit court. Thus, the majority\u2019s broad reading of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 to require a defense counsel to make two separate requests for the same certificate of analysis when the defendant\u2019s case involves a trial in both general district court and circuit court contradicts our well established jurisprudence regarding the construction of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In addition, the majority concludes that, through repeated use of the article \u201cthe,\u201d the General Assembly intended the delivery/mailing requirement of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 to apply to \u201ca specific \u2018hearing or trial\u2019 pending in a particular tribunal.\u201d This conclusion leads to anomalous results when cases are tried in both general district court and circuit court. Under the majority\u2019s logic, not only is a defense counsel required to renew his or her request to a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney for a certificate when the defendant\u2019s conviction is appealed to the circuit court, a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney who has already complied once with the delivery/mailing requirement at the general district level is likewise required to provide the defense counsel with a <em>second </em>copy of the same certificate or risk violating the mandates of Code \u00a7 19.2-187. I do not believe that the General Assembly intended the word \u201cthe\u201d to mandate such a meaningless redundancy in these situations. In addition, the statute regarding <em>de novo </em>appeals of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>cases from general district court was not intended to transform the otherwise streamlined procedural safeguards of Code \u00a7 19.2-187 into a procedural booby trap for both defense counsel and Commonwealth\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. <em>See Bottoms v.
