Johnson (\u201cwife\u201d) appeals the judgment of the circuit court deciding matters of equitable distribution and spousal support. Wife asserts that the trial court: (1) abused its discretion in dividing the parties\u2019 intangible marital personal property; (2) erred in determining the amount of spousal support to be paid to wife; and (3) erred in limiting the duration of the spousal support award to thirty-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>We hold that the trial court erred in making the equitable distribution award and accordingly, we reverse and remand for reconsideration of the award consistent with this opinion. Because we reverse the equitable distribution award, we also remand for reconsideration of the spousal support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Wife and Edgar Johnson (\u201chusband\u201d) were married on October 11,1964. The parties have one child who was twenty-four years old at the time of parties\u2019 divorce. When the parties married, husband was serving in the United States Navy. In 1968, he was hired by the Virginia State Police and has been employed as a state trooper since that time. Wife left her work as an employee at a sewing factory when the parties married and did not re-enter the work force until 1976. At that time, wife began working part-time as a school bus driver, driving a bus four hours a day. Wife continued to work as a school bus driver throughout the course of the parties\u2019 marriage and also worked part-time for K-Mart for a brief period.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The parties\u2019 marital assets consisted of their residence valued at $150,000, with equity of approximately $110,000, and various investments and retirement benefits. These interests included three hundred shares of Wal-Mart stock valued at $6,300, a Virginia Credit Union account with a balance of $2,600, a deferred compensation account in the husband\u2019s name with a balance of $12,111.12, a deferred compensation account in wife\u2019s name with a balance of $1,703.45, an individual retirement account in the husband\u2019s name with a balance of $5,127.96, an individual retirement account in wife\u2019s name with a balance of $2,315, and a life insurance policy with a cash value of $4,696.28. The marital assets also included husband\u2019s state police pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Husband asserted his pension\u2019s value to be $46,830.09, based on the cash surrender value of his pension if he withdrew all contributions and interest from his pension fund before retirement. No evidence was presented that the funds were to be withdrawn at or near the time of the hearing. Wife, however, argued that the pension was worth $510,539.22. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>This sum was determined by multiplying husband\u2019s estimated monthly pension benefit of $1,765.35, constituting husband\u2019s vested benefit amount if he were to retire at the time of the parties\u2019 divorce, by husband\u2019s remaining 24.1 year life expectancy as provided by Code \u00a7 8.01^419. The $510,539.22 value did not reflect discounting to present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The parties separated on October 21, 1993, allegedly because husband became physically abusive. Wife sought and was granted a protective order by the juvenile and domestic relations court and was granted exclusive occupation of the marital residence. The court also ordered husband to pay <em>pendente lite </em>spousal support in the amount of $1,500 a month. On the basis of their twelve month separation, the parties obtained a final decree of divorce on November 13, 1996. Both wife and husband were fifty-one years old at the time of the divorce and were in good health. The trial court ordered an equal division of all tangible personal and real property. The court awarded each party one-half of the Wal-Mart stock, Virginia Credit Union account, and the cash value of the life insurance policy. The court further ordered that the parties were to retain their respective individual retirement accounts, deferred compensation accounts, and retirement benefits. As part of the equitable distribution award, the court also ordered husband to pay wife the sum of $15,000 in order to \u201cbalance the equities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The court vacated the <em>pendente lite </em>spousal support of $1,500 and ordered husband to pay spousal support in the amount of $400 a month for a period of thirty-six months or until wife\u2019s death or remarriage, \u201cwhichever first occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Pension Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The trial court\u2019s letter opinion of October 4, 1996, provided the following distribution of the parties\u2019 intangible personal property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">The intangible personal property consists of Wal-Mart stock, a Virginia Credit Union account of [husband\u2019s], a deferred compensation account of [husband\u2019s], the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>respective IRA\u2019s, cash value in Mr. Johnson\u2019s life insurance policy, and <em>the parties\u2019 respective retirement accounts with their respective employers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">(Emphasis added). After ordering the division of all assets except the \u201cparties\u2019 respective retirement accounts,\u201d the trial court provided that \u201c[t]he court will allocate [wife\u2019s] retirement benefits 100% to her. The court will allocate [husband\u2019s] retirement benefits 100% to him.\u201d The court\u2019s final order incorporated its letter opinion and made no additional reference to retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The trial court listed the parties\u2019 respective IRAs and deferred compensation accounts in addition to \u201cthe parties\u2019 retirement accounts with their respective employers,\u201d and distributed each of these interests. However, we find no evidence in the record that wife had a \u201cretirement account\u201d with her employer. To the contrary, husband testified that while wife had an IRA and a deferred compensation account, he was not aware of wife having any form of pension. Accordingly, because the award was based upon the erroneous premise that wife had retirement benefits, we reverse and remand for reconsideration of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Upon reconsideration of the equitable distribution award, particularly regarding husband\u2019s pension benefits, we make the following observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In considering valuation of the marital estate, we have held that Code \u00a7 20-107.3 \u201c \u2018mandates\u2019 that trial courts determine the ownership and value of all real and personal property of the parties.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201cconsistent with established Virginia jurisprudence, the litigants have the burden to present evidence sufficient for the court to discharge its duty.\u201d <em>Bowers v. Bowers, 4 </em>Va.App. 610, 617, 359 S.E.2d 546, 550 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Here, the parties introduced minimal credible evidence regarding the value of husband\u2019s pension, rendering it virtually impossible for the trial court to evaluate it effectively. The husband\u2019s value was grossly understated and the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>claimed value was grossly overstated. The only evidence introduced by husband regarding the value of his pension was husband\u2019s exhibit number 6, a \u201cMember Benefit Profile\u201d produced by the Virginia Retirement System (\u2018VRS\u201d), prepared for husband on June 30, 1994. The VRS profile reported husband\u2019s vested benefits and indicated that should husband choose to retire at age fifty-one, his monthly benefit would be $1,765.35, and if he retired at age sixty, his monthly benefit would be $2,414.89. The VRS profile indicated that these amounts did not include the \u201claw enforcement supplement\u201d and no additional evidence was presented indicating the amount or value of such supplement. The VRS profile also reported that if husband terminated employment before retirement, he was entitled to withdraw his contributions to the plan, with interest. At the time the VRS profile was prepared this sum amounted to $46,830.09, the value assigned by husband to his pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">While no evidence other than the VRS profile was introduced regarding the value of husband\u2019s pension benefits, the profile was sufficient to establish that the pension benefits had value well in excess of $46,830.09. Husband\u2019s vested monthly benefit, had he retired at age fifty-one, paid out to him over the course of his remaining life expectancy of 24.1 years, as determined by Code \u00a7 8.01-419, would result in income to him of $510,539.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We have previously held that a court is not required to place a present value on pension benefits if the court orders <em>deferred </em>distribution of the benefit, using the formula set out in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(l). Indeed, to order deferred distribution based on present value, is error. <em>Zipf v. Zipf, </em>8 Va.App. 387, 382 S.E.2d 263 (1989). However, where an award of the entire pension is made to the owning spouse at the time of the divorce, the court must determine the present value of the pension fund before such an award can be made. <em>See </em>Brett R. Turner, <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 6:12 (2d ed.1994). The present value of a defined benefit plan, such as the plan before the court, is not simply the total value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>contributions of the beneficiary at the time of the hearing. Turner, \u00a7 6:12 at 368, 374. Such a method would reach \u201cinaccurate results, because it does not recognize the fact that contributions appreciate in value after they are made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374. Instead, a multiple step process is required to determine the present value, including a determination of future benefits and the application of various discount factors. <em>Id. </em>at 368-71. The party suggesting such an award must provide proof of value. Where, as here, the evidence renders a precise determination of a pension\u2019s value practically impossible an award of pension benefits to a payee spouse, as those benefits are received by the payor spouse, as permitted by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G)(1), may prove the only equitable method of considering the pension benefits in making an award. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 143, 480 S.E.2d 760, 769 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Spousal Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Because the equitable distribution award must be redetermined, the spousal support award must also be redetermined. Recognizing that some of the issues presented in this appeal may arise upon rehearing, we make the following comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Here, the record establishes that the parties were married for nearly thirty years. During that time husband was employed full time as a state trooper, while wife worked as a homemaker, mother, and for more than twenty years, \u00e1s a part-time bus driver. At the time of the parties\u2019 divorce, wife earned approximately $9,600 a year while husband earned $48,899 a year. The record also established that wife possessed an associates degree from a community college, was fifty-one years of age, and was in good health. Wife also introduced evidence of monthly expenses in the amount of $2,305.83. While $581.51 of these expenses were attributable to the mortgage payment which wife would not continue to incur, wife would have to acquire additional housing and thereby incur some significant expense in the form of rent or mortgage payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Based on the evidence presented, wife\u2019s monthly income of $800, combined with $400 of monthly spousal support, would not be sufficient to sustain her standard of living or to enable her to meet her monthly expenses. Further, the evidence did not support a finding that wife, at age fifty-one, with an associates degree and no work experience other than driving a school bus, was likely in the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future to acquire a position with substantially greater compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Upon remand and upon the evidence presented, it would be error for the court to limit the award of spousal support to a thirty-six month period. Code \u00a7 20-107.1 provides that \u201c[t]he court, in its discretion, may decree that maintenance and support of a spouse be made in periodic payments, or in lump sum award, or both.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1 does not empower the trial court to award periodic payments for a limited period without evidence that the need for support will cease within the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>217 Va. 502, 229 S.E.2d 887 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
