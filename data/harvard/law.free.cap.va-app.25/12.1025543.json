On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial based on a juror\u2019s delayed response to a <em>voir dire </em>question. Finding no error, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court asked prospective jurors, \u201cHave any of you ever been the victim or have any members of your immediate family ever been the victim of a violent crime?\u201d Juror Clements did not respond. Following the exercise of peremptory challenges, Clements was included as a jury member. After impanelment and opening statements, but before evidence was presented, the court recessed for lunch. Upon reconvening, Clements revealed that she had not disclosed during <em>voir dire </em>that her husband had been held up at gunpoint earlier that year. Clements reiterated the inadvertence of her nondisclosure and stated her belief that she could try the case at bar on the basis of the evidence presented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel asked no questions of Clements but requested a mistrial, stating</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">I doubt very seriously if there would have been grounds to strike her for cause, I think you probably would have allowed her to stay on the panel, but that would have been information that only she could have provided to us that would have been valuable to us in determining whether or not we wanted to exercise a strike to remove her from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We now are at the point where we\u2019ve exhausted all of our strikes, the jury has been selected and seated and now this information comes to bear; and I can tell the Court that with someone who\u2019d been, someone who had a family member, a husband who\u2019d been robbed at gunpoint within the last six months and with the assailant not being apprehended, I would have, on behalf of my client, exercised a strike to remove that person from the panel, not because I would have felt that the person would have been biased or prejudiced either in favor of the Commonwealth or the defendant, but because those life experiences may have in some way filtered over into her decision-making process here today.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">I am now without the ability to do that. The only way I can get the ability to select a jury based on the information from the questioning being given properly is that that information is given before I have the opportunity to use up my strikes. That being passed, I would ask that the Court grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The court found that Clements had not intentionally withheld the information and that \u201cshe honestly believe[d] and demonstrated that [the incident would] not interfere with her judgment.\u201d The court denied appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial, finding that going forward would not prejudice appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We address the issue whether Clements\u2019 failure to give a timely response to the <em>voir dire </em>question prejudiced appellant\u2019s right of peremptory challenge such that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018On appeal the denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be overruled unless there exists a manifest probability that the denial of a mistrial was prejudicial.\u2019\u201d <em>Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 378, 385, 470 S.E.2d 153, 157 (1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">While the issue presented in this case has not been addressed in Virginia, it was settled by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 104 S.Ct. 845, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984). <em>See also Zerka v. Green, </em>49 F.3d 1181 (6th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Edmond, </em>43 F.3d 472 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Rasmussen v. Sharapata, </em>895 P.2d 391 (Utah.Ct.App.1995). <em>But see State v. Scher, </em>278 N.J.Super. 249, 650 A.2d 1012, 1018-21 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The <em>McDonough </em>Court evaluated whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial when it learned that a juror had failed to respond affirmatively to a <em>voir dire </em>question. The Court premised its analysis on harmless error principles, which the Court found to reflect \u201cthe practical necessities of judicial management.\u201d 464 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>at 553-56,104 S.Ct. at 848-50.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that light, the Court found that \u201cit ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have obtained from a juror on <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 104 S.Ct. at 850. Thus, the Court adopted the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire, </em>and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror\u2019s impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI\"><em>Id. </em>at 556, 104 S.Ct. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Applying the <em>McDonough </em>analytical model here, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Notwithstanding Clements\u2019 failure to respond timely to the question propounded during <em>voir dire, </em>there was no dispute at trial that she stood indifferent to the cause. Because there was no basis for a challenge for cause, Clements\u2019 presence on the jury did not affect the essential fairness of the trial, notwithstanding the impairment to appellant\u2019s right of peremptory challenge. Thus, we find no manifest probability that the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">. In a conference room out of the jury\u2019s presence but in the presence of appellant and the attorneys for both parties, the following colloquy transpired between the court and juror Clements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-12\">COURT: Okay. Miss Clements, we\u2019re back here in my chambers. I understand the Bailiff tells me that you have remembered that you husband had been the victim of a violent crime, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">JUROR: Well, you know, when you said violent crime, it didn\u2019t really register and, you know what I mean, he was held up\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">COURT: At gunpoint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-14\">JUROR: Gunpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-15\">COURT: When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>JUROR: You know what, I can\u2019t \u2014 This is awful. It was either the spring or the early summer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">COURT: This year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">JUROR: This year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">COURT: Was there a trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">JUROR: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">COURT: Never had to go to court or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">JUROR: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">COURT: Well, the question, you know, I've asked others is that do you think that that experience would in any way prevent you from trying this case, listening to the evidence and making a decision in this case without being affected, prejudiced in any way by the experience your husband had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">JUROR: I wouldn\u2019t think so. Now, I'm saying I wouldn\u2019t think so in the respect that I didn't even remember it, I really didn\u2019t, and I said I\u2019ve got to tell somebody because I got real nervous about it after I remembered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">COURT: I think it\u2019s appropriate\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-15\">JUROR: I didn\u2019t mean to do this, I really didn\u2019t. I\u2019m so sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\">COURT: Do you think then it would in some way affect you ability to make a decision based on the evidence you hear in court or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">JUROR: I\u2019m trying to be as objective as I know how and I don\u2019t think it would because I don't think that it would affect my judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-18\">COURT: Okay. You think that you could put that out of your mind, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-19\">JUROR: I'm trying, now that I remember \u2014 I know this sounds terrible and I hate to do this to you worse than anything in the world\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-20\">COURT: That\u2019s all right. I want you to be honest and straightforward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-21\">JUROR: It made me real nervous, scared me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-22\">COURT: I understand that. Don\u2019t be afraid because we understand. What I want to know now, though, is now that you've remembered it, do you believe you could try this case today and the next couple of days and render a verdict based only on the law and the evidence that you hear in this case without in any way being affected by the experience or the knowledge that your husband had this experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-23\">Are you having some trouble? You\u2019re hesitating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-24\">JUROR: Yes, I am, and that's why; it scared me to death, it really did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-25\">COURT: What scared you to death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-26\">JUROR: It scared me it didn't come to my mind and then when I thought about it I said Oh, my Lord. Then when I started thinking about it, the more I thought about it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-27\">COURT: The more you thought about the incident, you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-28\">JUROR: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-29\">COURT: The more you thought about it, what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-30\">JUROR: That I'm trying, I\u2019m going to be as objective, use my own judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-31\">COURT: You mean you can use your own judgment without being affected by the knowledge that your husband was held up, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>JUROR: Yes, sir. I\u2019m \u2014 I feel terrible about this, I really do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">COURT: Stop worrying about that now, about the fact that you didn't tell us. That\u2019s neither here nor there right now. What I want to know is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">JUROR: Whether I can do this right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">COURT: You can do this without having that interfere with your judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">JUROR: To the best of my ability, I\u2019ll do the best I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">COURT: I know you will, but do you think you can put that out of your mind and try this case just on the evidence that you hear in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-15\">JUROR: Yes, sir, I think I can.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\">. The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument on brief is that Clements' disclosure established that she was unable to stand indifferent to the cause and that the trial court, therefore, erred in refusing to grant a mistrial. Appellant did not raise this argument at trial, where he stated his belief that Clements was not subject to a strike for cause. To the extent appellant now argues that Clements should have been stricken for cause, his contention is procedurally barred. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">.
