Thomas (appellant) appeals his conviction of use of a firearm during the commission of robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that the object he possessed and used during his robbery of a cab driver was a \u201cfirearm.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">At trial, the evidence established that on June 9, 1996 at about 10:30 p.m., the victim, a Richmond cab driver, picked up appellant as his next fare. Appellant sat in the back seat of the cab and told the victim that he wished to be driven first to a house on \u201cthe 3500 block of Idlewood\u201d to pick up his girlfriend and then to the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">When the victim arrived at the house, appellant told him to park the cab behind another parked car. Appellant then placed an object to the back of the victim\u2019s head. The victim reached behind his head and felt the tip of the object and testified that it \u201cfelt like\u201d the barrel of a gun. He grabbed the object and started pulling it away from his head. Appellant responded by \u201cjerking<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d the object out of the victim\u2019s hand and forcefully returning it to the back of the victim\u2019s head. Appellant then demanded that the victim give him all of his money, and the victim \u201cpulled some cash out of one of [his] pockets and handed it to him.\u201d A short while later, the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>managed to flee from the cab with the keys to its ignition. At all times during the encounter with appellant, the victim \u201clooked straight ahead,\u201d and he never <em>saw </em>the object placed by appellant against the back of his head. Instead, he only \u201cfelt what appeared to be ... the barrel of a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Appellant was arrested by police officers within the next thirty minutes. The arresting officers searched appellant and recovered a metallic, \u201cblue steel,\u201d BB pistol from his right pants pocket. In this appeal, appellant does not question that the evidence proved the object felt by the victim in the cab was this BB pistol. The BB pistol recovered by the officers was admitted into evidence as Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit number one and is contained in the record on appeal. It has the size, weight, and shape of a small handgun. The police officer who helped recover the BB pistol from appellant testified that he neither test-fired the pistol nor examined it to see if it contained any BBs.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">\u201cFIREARM\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 18.2-58.1</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that the BB pistol he used during Ms robbery of the victim was a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Because the evidence proved that the BB pistol gave the appearance of having a firing capability, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">\u201cIt shall be uMawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other <em>firearm </em>or display such weapon m a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit ... robbery____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">(Emphasis added). In a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Commonwealth is required to prove four elements: (1) that the accused \u201cpossessed\u201d an object; (2) that tMs object was a \u201cpistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm\u201d; (3) that the accused \u201cused or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm m a threatening manner\u201d; and (4) that tMs action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>involving the firearm occurred during the commission or attempt to commit one of the felonies enumerated in the statute. <em>See Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 215, 218, 441 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1994) (stating that \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove that the accused actually had a firearm in his possession and that he used or attempted to use the firearm or displayed the firearm in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit robbery or one of the other specified felonies\u201d); <em>Sprouse v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 548, 551-52, 453 S.E.2d 303, 306 (1995) (stating that the Commonwealth must prove that \u201cthe object used to cause the victim to reasonably believe it was a firearm was, in fact, a firearm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The General Assembly did not define the word \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. However, the Virginia Supreme Court has previously construed the General Assembly\u2019s intended meaning of this term and has set forth parameters of what does and does not constitute a \u201cfirearm\u201d under the statute. <em>See Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198-99, 269 S.E.2d 356, 357-58 (1980). First, because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cis aimed at preventing actual physical injury or death,\u201d the term \u201cfirearm\u201d includes any instrument that is capable of expelling a projectile by the force of gunpowder. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In addition, the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 includes some objects that are not capable of firing projectiles by an explosion of gunpowder. In <em>Holloman, </em>the Supreme Court held that any instrument that \u201cgives the appearance\u201d of having the capacity to propel a bullet by the force of gunpowder is a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. <em>See id. </em>at 199, 269 S.E.2d at 358 (holding that a BB pistol that fires BBs by the force of a spring but resembled a .45 caliber handgun was a \u201cfirearm\u201d because it \u201cgave the appearance of having a firing capability\u201d). The Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for this expanded meaning of \u201cfirearm\u201d was twofold. First, it reasoned that the word \u201cfirearm\u201d included instruments that merely appear to have a firing capability because the General Assembly intended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cto discourage criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm\u201d and the victim of a crime \u201ccan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>be intimidated as much by a revolver that does not fire bullets as by one that does.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358. In addition, the Supreme Court reasoned that, as a practical matter, a crime victim \u201ccannot be required to distinguish between a loaded pistol and a spring gun when it is brandished during the commission of a felony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Applying these principles, this Court has held that a rusted, inoperable revolver was a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 because it \u201chad not \u2018lost its identity as a firearm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 208, 213, 475 S.E.2d 828, 830 (1996). On the other hand, we have held that an object that appeared to the victim to be a gun but that the Commonwealth conceded was only a \u201ctoy pistol\u201d was not \u201cin fact, a firearm.\u201d <em>Sprouse, </em>19 Va.App. at 551-52, 453 S.E.2d at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Whether a particular object used by an accused during the commission of a felony was a firearm may be proved by direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. <em>See McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 603, 607, 484 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 146, 150-51, 474 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1996). Prior case law indicates that, when determining whether a particular object is a \u201cfirearm,\u201d the fact finder may consider the victim\u2019s visual and nonvisual observations of the object,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the victim\u2019s knowledge of firearms,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the accused\u2019s representations about the object during the commission of the felony,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>xnony,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the appearance of the object itself when it is admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the evidence regarding the object must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is a \u201cfirearm\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and when the evidence regarding the object is purely circumstantial, it must exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. <em>See Yarborough, </em>247 Va. at 218, 441 S.E.2d at 344; <em>Byers, </em>23 Va.App. at 150-52, 474 S.E.2d at 854-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443. 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). This Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992). Instead, the trial court\u2019s judgment will not be set aside unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the BB pistol used by appellant while robbing the victim was a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Both the victim\u2019s observations of the pistol during the robbery and an examination of the pistol itself, which was introduced into evidence, support the conclusion that it was an instrument that gave the appearance of having a firing capability. During the robbery, the victim grabbed the tip of the BB pistol with his hand and observed that it \u201cfelt like the barrel of a gun.\u201d In addition, an examination of the BB pistol reveals that it looks like a small handgun that is capable of firing bullets by the explosion of gunpowder. This direct evidence of the BB pistol\u2019s appearance excludes as a reasonable hypothesis the possibility that it is a mere \u201ctoy pistol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the conviction of use of a firearm during the commission of robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">.
