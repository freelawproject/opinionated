On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erroneously relied solely upon a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) transcript to establish the requisite prior offense, finding such conviction constitutional without affirmative proof that defendant had been represented by or waived counsel or had been punished without incarceration. Concluding that the earlier offense was properly proven, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">It is uncontroverted that defendant operated a motor vehicle in Alleghany County on August 26, 1995, while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A). Seeking the enhanced punishment for a \u201csecond offense committed within less than five years after a first offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-266,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-270,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Commonwealth introduced into evidence a DMV \u201ctranscript\u201d which reported a timely prior conviction of defendant for DUI in the General District Court of Roanoke County, Virginia. The parties agree, however, that the transcript did not indicate \u201c(a) whether Defendant was represented by counsel or (b) whether she was sentenced to jail, with time to serve ...,\u201d and the record provides no further particulars of the earlier proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>THE PRIOR CONVICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-270 prescribes several penalties for DUI in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, enhanced for second and subsequent offenses. However, to convict and punish an accused for successive violations, \u201cthe prior offense[s] must be charged and proven.\u201d <em>Calfee v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 253, 255, 208 S.E.2d 740, 741 (1974) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Ellett, </em>174 Va. 403, 413, 4 S.E.2d 762, 766 (1939)). In aid of such proof, Code \u00a7 46.2-384 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Every law-enforcement officer who has arrested any person for (i)[DUI] ... shall request from the [DMV] an abstract or <em>transcript </em>of the person\u2019s driver\u2019s conviction record on file at the [DMV]---- In any such prosecution wherein a necessary element of the offense charged is that the defendant was previously convicted of the same or similar offense, ... (2) that <em>portion </em>of the <em>transcript relating </em>to the <em>relevant prior conviction </em>[ ] shall be <em>prima facie evidence </em>of the facts stated therein with respect to the prior offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANO\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Prima facie </em>evidence is \u201c \u2018sufficient to raise a presumption of fact or establish the fact in question unless rebutted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moffitt v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 983, 987, 434 S.E.2d 684, 687 (1993) (quoting <em>Babbitt v. Miller, </em>192 Va. 372, 379-80, 64 S.E.2d 718, 722 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Here, defendant was arrested and prosecuted for DUI, \u201csubsequent offense,\u201d a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, which, if proven, would mandate an enhanced penalty. Thus, \u201ca necessary element of the offense charged\u201d was a previous conviction for the \u201csame or similar offense,\u201d a circumstance clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-384, permitting the introduction of \u201cthat portion of [defendant\u2019s DMV] transcript relating to the relevant prior conviction\u201d as \u201cprima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-384. Accordingly, the disputed transcript sufficiently proved defendant\u2019s earlier DUI <em>conviction </em>until \u201c \u2018that ... evidence ... be repelled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moffitt, </em>16 Va.App. at 987, 434 S.E.2d at 687 (quoting <em>Babbitt, </em>192 Va. at 380, 64 S.E.2d at 722); <em>see Nesselrodt v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 448, 451-52, 452 S.E.2d 676, 678 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">\n<em>THE ENHANCED PUNISHMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Nevertheless, defendant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence must also affirmatively establish that the earlier conviction was free from constitutional infirmity by proof that she (1) served no jail time, or (2) either waived her Sixth Amendment right to counsel or was represented by counsel. Because the transcript relied upon by the Commonwealth was silent on these incidents of the previous proceedings, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support imposition of an enhanced punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">It is now well established that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that did not result in actual incarceration may constitute proper evidence of recidivism, although punishment for the <em>enhanced </em>offense may include jail or imprisonment. <em>See Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 746-49,114 S.Ct 1921, 1926-29, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994); <em>see also Griswold v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 113,116-17, 472 S.E.2d 789, 790-91 (1996). Conversely, however, a previous misdemeanor conviction attended by incarceration is constitutionally offensive and may support neither guilt nor enhanced punishment for a later offense, unless the accused either waived or was represented by counsel in the earlier proceeding. <em>See Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 746, 114 S.Ct. at 1927 (citing <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 372-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 1161-62, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979)); <em>see also Griswold, </em>252 Va. at 116-17, 472 S.E.2d at 790-91. Although we have not heretofore allocated the burden of proof in assessing compliance with defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>right to counsel in the absence of evidence of both counsel and incarceration, we have approved shifting the burden to a defendant challenging the constitutionality of a prior guilty plea under such circumstances. <em>See James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 750-52, 446 S.E.2d 900, 902-04 (1994); <em>see also Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 29, 113 S.Ct. 517, 523, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (guilty plea constitutes waiver of Sixth Amendment rights to jury trial and confrontation and Fifth Amendment privilege against s elf-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">In <em>James, </em>we rejected the argument that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of a prior DUI for enhancement purposes in another prosecution must affirmatively establish that James had \u201cknowingly and intelligently waived his constitutional rights\u201d in tendering his guilty plea to the previous offense. <em>Id. </em>at 749, 446 S.E.2d at 902 (citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)). We acknowledged that, on <em>direct </em>appeal of a conviction, \u201cno waiver of constitutional rights will be presumed and a silent record cannot be considered a waiver,\u201d but distinguished our standard of review of a conviction under <em>collateral attack </em>in a subsequent trial. <em>Id. </em>at 750-51, 446 S.E.2d at 902-03. In the latter proceeding, the Commonwealth is entitled to a presumption of regularity which attends the prior conviction because \u201c \u2018every act of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be presumed to have been rightly done, till the contrary appears.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751, 446 S.E.2d at 903 (quoting <em>Parke, </em>506 U.S. at 30, 113 S.Ct. at 523).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Thus,</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">the Commonwealth satisfies its burden ... when it produces a properly certified conviction from a court of competent jurisdiction which appears on its face to be a valid final judgment, provided that in all <em>felony </em>cases and those <em>misdemeanor proceedings where imprisonment resulted, </em>there is evidence establishing that the defendant was represented by or properly waived counsel in the earlier criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 752, 446 S.E.2d at 904 (emphasis added). \u201cA silent record or the mere naked assertion by an accused\u201d that his constitutional rights were violated is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to rebut the presumption of validity. <em>Id. </em>Here, the transcript established defendant\u2019s previous misdemeanor conviction, without suggestion of imprisonment, a circumstance which did not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a collateral review of the conviction, <em>see Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 746, 114 S.Ct. at 1927, and entitled the Commonwealth to the presumption of regularity without offending due process. <em>See Parke, </em>506 U.S. at 27-34, 113 S.Ct. at 522-26; <em>James, </em>18 Va.App. at 750-52, 446 S.E.2d at 902-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Griswold v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 113, 472 S.E.2d 789 (1996), is misplaced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Griswold, </em>the record affirmatively disclosed that Griswold had been imprisoned for a prior misdemeanor conviction, rendered without the benefit of counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 114-15, 472 S.E.2d at 790. The conviction, therefore, was not favored with a presumption of regularity. In contrast, the transcript of defendant\u2019s disputed misdemeanor conviction reflects neither the imposition of jail time nor the absence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Similarly, our view is not inconsistent with <em>Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967), and its progeny. The evidence of the previous conviction in <em>Burgett </em>included two \u201crecords,\u201d one reciting that the accused appeared \u201c \u201cwithout Counsel,\u2019 \u201d and the other making no reference to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 88 S.Ct. at 260. The Court, therefore, reasoned that the <em>\u201crecords </em>of ... conviction <em>on their face </em>raise a presumption that petitioner was denied his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 88 S.Ct. at 261-62 (emphasis added). The record in this instance reflects nothing with respect to counsel, conflicting or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>In <em>Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992), which, like <em>James, </em>addressed a challenge to the evidence of voluntariness incidental to a prior guilty plea, the accused urged a broad reading of <em>Burgett </em>to support \u201cthe proposition that every previous conviction used to enhance punishment is \u2018presumptively void\u2019 if waiver of [any] claimed constitutional right does not appear from the face of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 113 S.Ct. at 524. However, the Court refused to \u201cread the decision [in <em>Burgett </em>] so broadly,\u201d emphasizing that</p>\n<p id=\"ASC\">[a]t the time the prior conviction at issue in <em>Burgett </em>was entered, state criminal defendants\u2019 federal constitutional right to counsel had not yet been recognized, and so it was reasonable to presume [from a silent record] that the defendant had not waived a right he did not possess.... [T]he same cannot be said about a record that, by virtue of its unavailability on collateral review, fails to show compliance with ... well-established [constitutional] requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court\u2019s distinction between <em>Parke </em>and <em>Burgett </em>arose from jurisprudential evolution rather than the disparate treatment of coequal constitutional safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>Parke </em>clearly instructs that, \u201ceven when a collateral attack on a final conviction rests on constitutional grounds, the presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments makes it appropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Surveying the practices followed in both guilty plea <em>and </em>right-to-counsel cases, the Court expressly recognized that \u201cstate courts ... have allocated proof burdens differently,\u201d noting with approval that some</p>\n<p id=\"At9\">place the full burden on the prosecution. Others assign the entire burden to the defendant once the government has established the fact of conviction. Several, like Kentucky [the state practice at issue in <em>Parke </em>], take a middle position that requires the defendant to produce evidence of invalidity once the fact of conviction is proved but that shifts the burden back to the prosecution once the defendant satisfies his burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 113 S.Ct. at 525 (citations omitted). The Court concluded that \u201c[t]his range of contemporary state practice certainly does not suggest that allocating some burden to the defendant is fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33, 113 S.Ct. at 525.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Accordingly, the record of a prior misdemeanor conviction, silent with respect to related incarceration or representation of the accused by counsel, is entitled to a presumption of regularity on collateral attack in a recidivist proceeding and may provide sufficient evidence to support the imposition of an enhanced punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-11\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-270 provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">Any person convicted of a second offense committed within less than five years after a first offense under \u00a7 18.2-266 shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $200 nor more than $2,500 and by confinement in jail for not less than one month nor more than one year.
