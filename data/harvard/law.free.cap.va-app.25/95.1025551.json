On appeal, he contends (1) that his prosecution by the Commonwealth was barred by Code \u00a7 19.2-294 due to his previous acquittal in federal court for a similar statutory offense, and (2) that prosecutorial misconduct barred his retrial for attempted murder. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">On November 26, 1992, Weaver was charged with the November 25, 1992 malicious wounding of Charles Michael Hudson, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51. Following his arrest, federal authorities investigated a possible connection between the attack and Hudson\u2019s role as a witness in an upcoming federal trial. On January 22, 1993, a federal grand jury indicted Weaver for conspiracy to murder and attempted murder of a witness to prevent him from testifying in a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>criminal trial. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1512(a)(1)(A). On January 28,1993, the Martinsville General District Court entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the malicious wounding charge on motion of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. On November 11, 1993, a federal jury acquitted Weaver of both federal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On May 2, 1994, Weaver was indicted in the Martinsville Circuit Court for attempted murder of Hudson. He was tried on December 27, 1995. After approximately two hours of deliberations, the jury recessed for the evening and resumed deliberations the following day. The trial judge instructed the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone and advised them that they should not be \u201cinfluenced in anyway by anyone.\u201d The jury was not instructed to avoid media coverage of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">That evening, a local cable television station called Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Randy Smith at his home and asked him to discuss the case during a live call-in program. Mr. Smith responded to the television host\u2019s questions about the case. Several persons called the talk show in response to Mr. Smith\u2019s remarks, \u201cboth criticizing his alleged unprofessional-ism and defending his right to inform the public.\u201d Weaver called the television station to complain and stated on the air that he had been found not guilty at his federal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">A juror heard part of the talk show after Mr. Smith\u2019s interview, including the telephone call from Weaver. The juror reported to the trial court that his ability to remain impartial had been affected. The trial court granted Weaver\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Relying upon the Double Jeopardy Clause, Weaver moved to dismiss the charge due to prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court denied the motion. Upon retrial, a jury convicted Weaver of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Weaver contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 barred this prosecution. Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">If the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, or of two or more ordinances, or of one or more statutes and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>one or more ordinances, conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others. <em>Furthermore, if the same act be a violation of both a state and a federal statute a prosecution under the federal statute shall be a bar to a prosecution under the state statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">(Emphasis added.) Weaver contends that his prosecution for attempted murder in violation of federal witness protection statutes bars his subsequent state prosecution for attempted murder, a common law crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u201cSection 19.2-294, however, applies only where two or more <em>statutory </em>offenses are involved.\u201d <em>Blythe v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981) (emphasis in original) (defendant\u2019s prior conviction for statutory offense did not bar prosecution for common law offense). Thus, \u201cthis section is not applicable when one crime is a common law offense.\u201d <em>Darnell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 948, 957, 408 S.E.2d 540, 545 (1991). <em>Accord Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 1, 8-9, 406 S.E.2d 15, 19 (1991) (defendant\u2019s prior conviction for statutory offense did not bar subsequent prosecution for common law offense of attempted murder \u201c[e]ven if we assume that [defendant\u2019s] conduct constituted only one act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Weaver notes correctly that <em>Blythe </em>and its progeny addressed successive prosecutions in state courts, rather than successive proceedings in federal and state courts. He argues that the provision in Code \u00a7 19.2-294 covering successive federal and state prosecutions should be interpreted differently from its companion provision governing successive state prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Weaver argues that the term \u201cstatute\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-294 should be construed broadly to include both common law and statutory offenses. He cites <em>Owens v. Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 757, 105 S.E. 531 (1921), and <em>Sigmon v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 258, 105 S.E.2d 171 (1958). His reliance upon those decisions is misplaced. Despite general reference in <em>Owens </em>and <em>Sigmon </em>to state \u201claw,\u201d rather than state \u201cstatute,\u201d both decisions concerned application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>statutory bar to successive federal and state prosecutions for <em>statutory offenses </em>and, thus, did not involve prosecution for a common law crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Weaver argues- also that the General Assembly did not intend for Code \u00a7 19.2-294 to exclude coverage of common law offenses. <em>Blythe, </em>which held clearly that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 does not apply to prosecutions for common law crimes, was decided in 1981. The legislature revised Code \u00a7 19.2-294 in 1987. 1987 Va. Acts ch. 241. Had the General Assembly disagreed with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, it could have amended the statute to include common law crimes. \u201c \u2018[W]here the General Assembly acts in an area in which this Court has already spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the Court has stated it and to acquiesce therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFadden v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 226, 230, 348 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1986) (quoting <em>Burns v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984)). <em>See also Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 898-99, 421 S.E.2d 455, 460 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Finally, \u201c \u2018[nontechnical words in statutes are taken to have been used in their ordinary sense and acceptation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 650, 655, 353 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1987) (citations omitted). In ascertaining the meaning of \u201cstatute,\u201d we note with approval the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Common law. As distinguished from law created by the enactment of legislatures, the common law comprises the body of those principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts____</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Statute, n. An act of the legislature declaring, commanding, or prohibiting something---- This word is used to designate the legislatively created laws in contradistinction to court decided or unwritten laws. See Common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Dictionary, </em>250-51, 1264-65 (5th ed.1979). While either \u201cstatute\u201d or \u201ccommon law\u201d may be referred to in a general sense as the \u201claw,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 795-96, they are mutually exclusive terms. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 1-10 (noting that the common law remains in force in the Commonwealth except where modified by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">To conclude that the term \u201cstatute\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 19.2-294 excludes common law crimes in the first sentence, but includes them in the second sentence, would lead to an absurd result. <em>Cf. Shull </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 667, 670, 431 S.E.2d 924, 925 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201c[W]here a word is used in different sections of a statute and its meaning is clear in all but one instance, \u2018[t]he same meaning ... will be attributed to it elsewhere unless there be something in the context which clearly indicates that the Legislature intended some other and different meaning.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\"><em>Walthall v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 674, 680, 353 S.E.2d 169, 172 (1987) (quoting <em>Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County v. Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 761-62, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">We hold that the use of the term \u201cstatute\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-294 excludes common law offenses from the entire purview of the statute. Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 did not bar Weaver\u2019s prosecution for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">Weaver next contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the attempted murder charge on double jeopardy grounds following the granting of the mistrial. He argues that Mr. Smith should have known that his televised discussion of the trial would violate an attorney disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>rule<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and would necessitate a defense motion for a mistrial. Weaver urges us to reconsider our prior decisions and to adopt a lesser standard that will bar successive prosecution when the prosecutor \u201cwas aware but consciously disregarded the risk that an objectionable event for which he was responsible would require a mistrial at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d <em>See Bauder v. State, </em>921 S.W.2d 696, 699 (Tex.Ct.Crim.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 551, 553, 439 S.E.2d 622, 623, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 814, 447 S.E.2d 542 (1994), we held that prosecutorial misconduct causing a mistrial does not bar retrial unless the prosecutor <em>intended </em>to subvert the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 439 S.E.2d at 623 (citing <em>MacKenzie v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 236, 240, 380 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1989)). The United States Supreme Court has pronounced the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2089, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We have consistently adhered to the foregoing standard, and we decline to deviate from our prior decisions. <em>See, e.g., Bennefield v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 729, 467 S.E.2d 306 (1996) (noting that protections afforded under Virginia Constitution are coexistent with those in federal constitution); <em>Robinson, </em>17 Va.App. at 553, 439 S.E.2d at 623 (\u201cWithout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>requisite intent ... gross prosecutorial misconduct will not satisfy the exception set forth in <em>Kennedy.\u201d); Kemph v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 335, 341, 437 S.E.2d 210, 213-14 (1993); <em>MacKenzie, </em>8 Va.App. at 239-40, 380 S.E.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u201cIn <em>Kennedy, </em>the Supreme Court made it clear that the exclusive focus should not be on the fact of prosecutorial error or on the impact of such error upon the defendant, but only on the intent of the prosecutor in committing the error.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>17 Va.App. at 553, 439 S.E.2d at 624. Thus, as the trial court determined, the dispositive issue here is not whether Mr. Smith\u2019s \u201cpossible violation of a disciplinary rule bars the defendant\u2019s retrial, but whether or not the actions of Mr. Smith, which may have ethical implications, were done by him with the intent to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In proving \u201cthat the second prosecution is barred by double jeopardy, [the defendant] must produce sufficient evidence to allow the court to infer \u2018the existence or nonexistence of intent from objective facts and circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson, </em>17 Va.App. at 553, 439 S.E.2d at 624 (quoting <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675, 102 S.Ct. at 2089).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In this case, the trial court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">Even though this Court is disturbed by the actions of a prosecutor of Mr. Smith\u2019s long experience, the Court does not believe there was any Machiavellian scheme involved in Mr. Smith\u2019s mind to subvert the trial process, even though that was the likely and eventual result, and find [sic] that the prosecution did not intend to cause a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are binding unless they are without evidence to support them. Here, Mr. Smith did not initiate contact with the cable television station. The interview, while regrettable, did not, by itself, evince an intent to compel or provoke Weaver to seek a mistrial. Viewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>record and the objective facts and circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s ruling was without evidentiary support.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. Without a statutory definition of the offense, the mere fact that Code \u00a7 18.2-26 fixes the <em>punishment </em>for attempted murder does not transform attempted murder into a statutory offense to which Code \u00a7 19.2-294 would apply. <em>See Blythe, </em>222 Va. at 725, 284 S.E.2d at 797; <em>Darnell, </em>12 Va.App. at 957 n. 6, 408 S.E.2d at 545 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">. DR 7-106(A) of the Disciplinary Rules of the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility provides that: \"A lawyer participating in ... the prosecution ... of a criminal matter that may be tried by a jury shall not make or participate in making an extra-judicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication that he knows, or should know, constitutes a clear and present danger of interfering with the fairness of the trial by a jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
