The sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant drove a vehicle recklessly on a highway in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-852. We find that the evidence is insufficient and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-852 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Reckless driving; general rule. \u2014 Irrespective of the maximum speeds permitted by law, any person who drives a vehicle on any highway recklessly or at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be guilty of reckless driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Upon familiar principles, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). On August 28, 1995, Hopewell Police Officer Daniel Pisarck (Pisarck) was informed of \u201ca possible broken down vehicle\u201d near the intersection of 6th Street and Route 10 and proceeded to determine the reason for the stopped vehicle. Pisarck testified that at approximately 11:40 p.m., he arrived at the designated location and found appellant\u2019s car stopped in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the lane of travel on North 6th Avenue. He said that the operator was \u201cpassed out\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> behind the wheel and that appellant\u2019s car was situated in a \u201cheavily travelled area,\u201d particularly at that time of night. Pisarck found that the car\u2019s ignition switch and headlights were on, and its battery and alternator indicator lights were illuminated on the instrument panel. Pisarck opined that appellant\u2019s car was a traffic hazard which posed a threat to appellant\u2019s safety and to the safety of other motorists. However, Pisarck never saw the car in motion prior to or during his investigation. Pisarck confirmed that he had not observed appellant driving the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Pisarck tapped on the driver\u2019s side window with his flashlight and shined the light in appellant\u2019s face attempting to wake her. When she awoke, appellant told him she was \u201cheaded home to Chesterfield.\u201d Pisarck noted that the direction of her vehicle was such that she was really \u201ccoming from Chesterfield.\u201d Pisarck noticed a strong odor of alcohol escaping from the vehicle and discovered two open alcoholic beverage containers therein. Appellant admitted she had been drinking. Her speech was slurred and she was unsteady on her feet. Pisarck arrested appellant for driving while intoxicated. Appellant\u2019s certificate of breath analysis showed an alcohol content of \u201c.17 grams per 210 liters of breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">For reasons not disclosed in the record, the prosecutor elected not to proceed on the charge for which appellant was arrested and amended the charge to reckless driving. To support a conviction for reckless driving in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-852, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused drove the vehicle in a reckless manner \u201cso as to endanger the life, limb, or property\u201d of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Commonwealth relies upon <em>Kennedy v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va.App. 469, 339 S.E.2d 905 (1986), to support appellant\u2019s conviction. Kennedy and his family had been on the road for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>eight hours when Kennedy ran his van off of the road into a wooded median strip. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71, 339 S.E.2d at 906. This Court affirmed Kennedy\u2019s conviction even though no eyewitness testimony proved Kennedy drove in a reckless manner. The Court in <em>Kennedy </em>stated that the circumstances of the accident were such as to give rise to an inference that the car had been driven in a reckless manner in violation of the Code. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 339 S.E.2d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The circumstances in which Pisarck found appellant\u2019s car were such as to give rise to an inference that appellant drove her car to the location where Pisarck found her. In fact, we have held in similar circumstances that a defendant could be convicted of driving or operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. <em>See Propst v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 791, 485 S.E.2d 657 (1997). However, the circumstances in appellant\u2019s case do not give rise to an inference that she drove her car in a reckless manner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See City of Baton Rouge v. Copley, </em>372 So.2d 1215 (1979); <em>Jenson v. Fletcher, </em>277 A.D. 454,101 N.Y.S.2d 75 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In <em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1970), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">The word \u201crecklessly\u201d as used in the statute imparts a disregard by the driver of a motor vehicle for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb or property____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">The essence of the offense of reckless driving lies not in the act of operating a vehicle, but in the manner and circumstances of its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We hold that under the facts shown by this record, the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of reckless driving in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-852.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-12\">. Although the record contains two references to Code \u00a7 46.2-853, the parties agree that appellant was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-852. Thus, our inquiry here is focused upon the application and interpretation of Code \u00a7 46.2-852.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">. Pisarck did not confirm whether appellant had \"passed out\u201d from an illness or had merely fallen asleep and appeared to surmise that it was one or the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\">. \"[W]hile evidence of intoxication is a factor that might bear upon proof of dangerous or reckless driving in a given case, it does not, of itself, prove reckless driving.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, 20 </em>Va.App. 206, 210, 455 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1995). \" 'One may be both drunk and reckless. He may be reckless though not drunk; he may even be a total abstainer, and he may be under the influence of intoxicants and yet drive carefully.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Spickard v. City of Lynchburg, </em>174 Va. 502, 504-505, 6 S.E.2d 610, 611 (1940)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
