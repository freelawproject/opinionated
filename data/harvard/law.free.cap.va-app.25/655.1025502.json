Defendant complains on appeal that he was denied a speedy trial in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-248. Finding that defendant was continuously in custody in excess of five months from the finding of probable cause to the commencement of trial, contrary to statute, we reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The pertinent procedural history is uncontroverted. Defendant was arrested and incarcerated on September 19, 1995, upon petitions alleging the instant offenses. Defendant was then on probation and subject to the attendant supervision and jurisdiction of the Newport News Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (district court) as a result of unrelated prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>On motion of the Commonwealth to transfer defendant to the circuit court for prosecution as an adult, the district court conducted a hearing in accordance with former Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on October 4,1995. At the conclusion of these proceedings, the district court found \u201cprobable cause to believe [defendant] committed the delinquent act[s] alleged,\u201d ordered him transferred and certified to the circuit court for \u201cproper criminal [prosecution],\u201d and \u201c[r]emanded to ... the Newport News City Jail.\u201d The district court also determined that defendant had violated terms of the unrelated probation and \u201ccommitted\u201d him to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice (Department). Defendant did not appeal either disposition and remained in custody on both.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Defendant was indicted in the circuit court (trial court) for the subject crimes on November 13, 1995, and trial was scheduled for December 15,1995. Subsequently, the prosecutor discovered that the trial court had entered no order \u201cadvising the attorney for the Commonwealth that he may seek an indictment\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(B), and, on December 15, 1995, moved the court to \u201cquash\u201d the November indictments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant, though still in custody, did not appear for argument on the motion; however, his counsel was present, voiced no objection, and the court granted the motion. The record reflects no related consideration or modification of defendant\u2019s continuing custodial status pursuant to the transfer order of October 4,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Shortly thereafter, defendant\u2019s probation officer, Gregory Haywood, learned of the December 15, 1995 proceedings, contacted the prosecutor on December 18,1995, and reminded him that defendant was in the custody of the Department. Haywood testified that, as a result of the instant offenses, the Department had \u201cclassified\u201d defendant as a \u201cmajor offender,\u201d thereby changing his \u201clength of stay\u201d from \u201cseveral months\u201d on the unrelated probation violation to \u201cindeterminate,\u201d pending a disposition by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On January 3,1996, the trial court entered an order properly authorizing the Commonwealth to seek indictments and directing that defendant \u201cbe transferred from the juvenile detention facility to the Newport News City Jail.\u201d Accordingly, defendant was again indicted on January 8, 1996, and thereafter arrested on a capias and \u201cremanded to jail,\u201d although already in custody dating from arrest on September 19, 1995. He remained in custody until trial on July 11, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-243, oftentimes referenced as the \u201cspeedy trial statute,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">[wjhere a general district court has found that there is probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a felony, the accused, if he is held continuously in custody thereafter, shall be forever discharged from prosecution for such offense if no trial is commenced in the circuit court within five months from the date such probable cause was found by the district court;____</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">If there was no preliminary hearing in the district court, or if such preliminary hearing was waived by the accused, the commencement of the running of the five and nine months periods, respectively, set forth in this section, shall be from the date an indictment or presentment is found against the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">If an indictment or presentment is found against the accused but he has not been arrested for the offense charged therein, the five and nine months periods, respec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tively, shall commence to run from the date of his arrest thereon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ...</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On May 9, 1996, defendant moved to dismiss the prosecutions as violative of the speedy trial statute. The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant at trial on July 11, 1996. Defendant argues on appeal that \u201ceven after the [initial] indictments were quashed, the underlying transferred charges still rested in the bosom of the [circuit] court, awaiting action by the judge in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(B).\u201d Thus, defendant reasons that he remained in continuous custody on the offenses from the finding of probable cause by the district court on October 4,1995, until trial on July 11,1996, a period substantially in excess of the five months prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In response, the Commonwealth suggests that the district court proceedings did not constitute a \u201cpreliminary hearing\u201d and lacked the determination of probable cause contemplated by the speedy trial statute. The Commonwealth, therefore, maintains that defendant was prosecuted on the indictments of January 8, 1996, following a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the previous indictments, thus triggering the speedy trial time clock on January 8, 1996, not October 4, 1995.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commonwealth attributes defendant\u2019s \u201ccontinuous custody\u201d to \u201cother charges,\u201d which excluded the instant prosecution from the limitations of Code \u00a7 19.2-243. The Commonwealth\u2019s arguments, however, overlook the procedural course of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Defendant, a juvenile, came before the district court, the court having \u201cexclusive, original jurisdiction,\u201d upon petitions alleging commission of the offenses. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241; <em>Burfoot v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 38, 45, 473 S.E.2d 724, 728 (1996) (citing <em>Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 79,147 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>739, 742 (1966)). On motion of the Commonwealth, the district court conducted a transfer hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1, which provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">If a juvenile fourteen years of age or older is charged with an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult, the court shall, on motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth and prior to a hearing on the merits, hold a transfer hearing and may retain jurisdiction or transfer such juvenile for proper criminal proceedings to the appropriate circuit court having criminal jurisdiction of such offenses if committed by an adult. Any transfer to the appropriate circuit court shall be subject to the ... condition[ ] [that] ... [t]he juvenile court finds that <em>probable cause </em>exists to believe that the juvenile committed the delinquent act as alleged or a lesser included delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">1994 Va. Acts chs. 859, 949 (emphasis added) (codified as Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 and amended by 1996 Va. Acts chs. 755, 914). Thus, the jurisdiction of the circuit court over defendant was predicated upon a proper transfer hearing in the district court and related order.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This statutory scheme \u201c \u2018afford[s] juvenile defendants ... the protection and expertise of the juvenile court <em>during the preliminary, </em>or certification, <em>hearing stage of a criminal </em>prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 46, 473 S.E.2d at 728 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Payne v. Warden, </em>223 Va. 180, 184, 285 S.E.2d 886, 888 (1982)). Although the transfer hearing \u201c \u2018is not as limited in its scope as a preliminary hearing under the criminal procedures applicable to an adult,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 46, 473 S.E.2d at 728 (quoting <em>Peyton, </em>207 Va. at 78, 147 S.E.2d at 742), both proceedings require the district court to find probable cause to believe that the accused committed the alleged felonious act as a condition to further prosecution of the offense in the circuit court. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(A)(2); Code \u00a7 19.2-218; <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 45, 473 S.E.2d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Accordingly, when the district court certified and transferred defendant for trial as an adult in the circuit court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the district court necessarily found the requisite probable cause contemplated by the speedy trial statute. Because the transfer order directed that defendant be \u201c[rjemanded to jail,\u201d the prescribed five month limitation of Code \u00a7 19.2-243 commenced on October 4, 1995. It is immaterial that such custody coincided with detention of defendant incidental to the unrelated commitment. <em>See Funk v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 694, 695-96, 432 S.E.2d 193,194 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Following entry of the transfer order by the district court, Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(A) directed that \u201cthe clerk [of the district court] ... forward ... all papers connected with the case\u201d to the trial court, Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(A), which \u201cshall [then] ... examine all such papers, ... and enter an order either remanding the case to the juvenile court or advising the attorney for the Commonwealth that he may seek an indictment.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(B). Upon authorizing indictment, the circuit court must order transfer of the \u201cjuvenile from the juvenile detention facility to an appropriate local correctional facility,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(B), and the juvenile court shall be \u201cdivest[ed] ... of its jurisdiction over the case.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(C). Adherence to the statutory transfer procedure is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 48-49, 473 S.E.2d at 730; <em>see Peyton, </em>207 Va. at 80, 147 S.E.2d at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Thus, irrespective of the trial court\u2019s order to quash, the initial indictments of defendant were a nullity, obtained without the benefit of the enabling order required by Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(B). The court simply remedied of record an error or oversight in the proceedings, without disturbing the legal efficacy of the pending transfer order or effecting a <em>nolle prosequi. See Cheeks v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 578, 586, 459 S.E.2d 107, 111 (1995) (reversed and remanded to circuit court a conviction resulting from erroneous transfer proceedings in the circuit court). Otherwise, the circuit court would have been without the procedural vehicle necessary to authorize the January 8, 1996 indictments pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Accordingly, defendant was held continuously in custody from the finding of probable cause in the district court on October 4, 1995, until trial on July 11, 1996, in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-243, and we must reverse and dismiss the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-5\">.
