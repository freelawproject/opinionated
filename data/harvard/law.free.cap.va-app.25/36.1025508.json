Appellant contends that the trial court erred in limiting the scope of his cross-examination of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses on the issue of that witness\u2019 bias or motive to testify. We find that the trial court erred, but, under the facts of this case, we find the error to have been harmless and affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Zenobia Jones and Tamika Young testified for the Commonwealth concerning the events in question. They testified that Jones, Young, Kimberly Taylor and appellant spent the day drinking and taking drugs at Jones\u2019 home. Joseph Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>joined the group early the same evening. During the course of the evening, a dispute arose over Ford\u2019s payment for sexual acts he engaged in with Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Young had decided to forego payment when Taylor intervened and demanded that Ford pay Young. Taylor and Ford began fighting and eventually drew the attention of appellant, who was Taylor\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Together, appellant and Taylor fought Ford to the ground, where they continued to hit him. Ford was released when he agreed to pay, but shortly thereafter he ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Taylor and appellant gave chase, caught up with Ford and resumed hitting him, this time more aggressively. Taylor hit Ford with a glass object as appellant held Ford down. Appellant and Taylor were trying to get money from Ford, which Ford held in his mouth. When it appeared Ford would not give her any money, Taylor \u201cgot mad\u201d and stated, \u201cshoot, forget it. I\u2019m just going to kill him.\u201d Taylor went to the kitchen and returned with an object which she used to hit Ford while appellant continued to hold Ford down. Appellant resumed hitting Ford, stating he was going to get the money. Taylor continued hitting Ford and eventually strangled him with a belt. Appellant held Ford while Taylor strangled him. Ford fell to the couch, and appellant and Taylor dragged him outside. After returning inside, appellant gave Taylor some blood-stained money. Ford was killed in the course of the fight. Later that evening, appellant told his sister, \u201cwe just killed a dude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Linwood Wiggins, Jr. also testified for the Commonwealth. Wiggins testified that, while in jail, appellant told him he had beaten Ford in the head with an ashtray because Ford had $1,000. Wiggins further testified that he had been convicted of five or six felonies as well as misdemeanors involving stealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">On cross-examination, Wiggins admitted that his criminal record reflected seven felony convictions. Wiggins also testified that he faced a pending sentencing proceeding on three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>felony charges in a different judicial circuit. Wiggins stated his understanding that the sentence he would receive for his recent convictions would likely relate to his prior convictions. Wiggins stated that although he was not \u201cpromised\u201d anything, the Commonwealth had agreed to make Wiggins\u2019 sentencing judge \u201caware\u201d of his cooperation. Wiggins agreed that he was testifying, hoping \u201cthey don\u2019t give me the 15 years the charges carry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then attempted to ask Wiggins about the date and nature of each of his felony and misdemeanor convictions, but, upon the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the court ruled that only inquiry into felonies and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude was relevant. In a subsequent proffer, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to clarify his position. He argued that he was entitled to inquire into the number and nature of each of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions on the theory that the nature of each of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions would demonstrate the extent of his motive to testify against appellant, in the \u201chope\u201d of receiving leniency at his forthcoming sentencing hearing. The court was unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Although the court\u2019s initial ruling on the matter was not clear, it subsequently stated that it did not intend to preclude appellant\u2019s counsel from eliciting testimony concerning the nature of Wiggins\u2019 prior felonies and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude. Following the court\u2019s clarification, counsel argued that he should not be limited to inquiring about prior felonies and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude, although he stated he would \u201cprefer that middle ground rather than no ground.\u201d However, appellant\u2019s counsel made no further attempt to elicit testimony concerning Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions for felonies and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude. The court also refused counsel\u2019s request to elicit testimony on Wiggins\u2019 other convictions, <em>viz., </em>his misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude, further stating that counsel had elicited testimony concerning Wiggins\u2019 \u201chope\u201d or \u201cexpectation\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>receive some consideration for leniency at Ms forthcoming sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellant contends that the court erred in limiting Ms inquiry on cross-examination into the nature of Wiggins\u2019 prior criminal convictions. Imtially, we note that the trial court did not limit inquiry into the nature of all of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions. Instead, the trial court limited appellant\u2019s cross-examination only as it concerned misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude. Although there was some imtial confusion on the issue of appellant\u2019s inquiry into the nature of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions for felomes and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude, the trial court made clear that it would allow appellant to make such inquiry. Appellant\u2019s counsel clearly understood the court\u2019s clarification, stating that he would \u201cprefer that middle ground rather than no ground.\u201d The issue on appeal, therefore, is limited to the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow appellant to cross-examine Wiggins concerning Ms prior convictions for misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Where the purpose of the inquiry is to impeach a witness\u2019 veracity, cross-examination concerning a witness\u2019 pri- or convictions is limited to prior felony convictions and convictions for misdemeanors involving moral turpitude. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 525, 528, 298 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1982); <em>Chrisman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 89, 93-100, 348 S.E.2d 399, 401-05 (1986). However, it is error to apply the principles governing cross-examination for purposes of impeaching a witness\u2019 veracity to limit cross-examination designed to demonstrate a witness\u2019 bias or motive to testify. <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 460, 463-64, 437 S.E.2d 563, 564-65 (1993) (\u201cAn accused has a right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses to show bias or motivation and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>right, when not abused, is absolute. The right emanates from the constitutional right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d); <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 967, 234 S.E.2d 79, 80 (1977); <em>Fulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 96, 99, 306 S.E.2d 874, 876 (1983). We find this to be precisely the error the trial court committed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">It remains only to determine whether the trial court\u2019s error in restricting appellant\u2019s right to cross-examination was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Maynard v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 437, 448, 399 S.E.2d 635, 641 (1990) (en banc); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 53, 78, 354 S.E.2d 79, 93 (1987); <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); <em>see also Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc) (constitutional error harmless only when reviewing court able to declare belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt). \u201c \u2018The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, [we] might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Maynard, </em>11 Va.App. at 448, 399 S.E.2d at 641 (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438); <em>see also Williams, </em>4 Va.App. at 78, 354 S.E.2d at 93; <em>Shanklin v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 862, 864-65, 284 S.E.2d 611, 612-13 (1981). Thus, to determine whether the trial error was harmless, our analysis turns not on the evidence excluded, <em>viz., </em>evidence of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions for misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude, but on the evidence in the record, <em>viz., </em>Wiggins\u2019 testimony, which was not fully subject to cross-examination. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438; <em>Maynard, </em>11 Va.App. at 448, 399 S.E.2d at 641; <em>Williams, 4 </em>Va.App. at 78, 354 S.E.2d at 93; <em>Shanklin, </em>222 Va. at 864-65, 284 S.E.2d at 612-13. As such, our harmless error analysis is akin to harmless error review in cases of improperly admitted evidence, where the error is held harmless if the record contains \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of guilt. <em>See Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 91, 472 S.E.2d 263, 270 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 972, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>L.Ed.2d 856 (1997); <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 454, 423 S.E.2d 360, 366 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036, 113 S.Ct. 1862,123 L.Ed.2d 483 (1993). In this case, Wiggins\u2019 testimony is the \u201cimproper\u201d evidence we evaluate, to determine its effect, if any, on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Our analysis of the effect of Wiggins\u2019 testimony is guided by specific factors. In determining whether the trial court\u2019s error in limiting appellant\u2019s right to cross-examine Wiggins was harmless, we evaluate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201cthe importance of [Wiggins\u2019] testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether [Wiggins\u2019] testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting [Wiggins\u2019] testimony on material points, the extent of cross-examination [of Wiggins] otherwise permitted and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\"><em>Williams, 4 </em>Va.App. at 78-79, 354 S.E.2d at 93 (quoting <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438); <em>Maynard, </em>11 Va.App. at 448, 399 S.E.2d at 641-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. The overall strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against appellant is manifest. The facts established by testimony of witnesses other than Wiggins, standing alone, provided overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. That evidence established that appellant participated, with malice, in the deadly attack on Ford. Appellant struck Ford repeatedly and held Ford down as Taylor struck him with various objects and eventually strangled him with a belt. In the face of Taylor\u2019s stated intention to kill Ford, appellant continued his participation in the attack. Appellant later told his sister, \u201cwe just killed a dude.\u201d The evidence further established that appellant and Taylor sought to take Ford\u2019s money, by force, throughout the attack. After depositing Ford\u2019s body, appellant returned with blood-stained money, the same money, it could reasonably be inferred, that Ford had placed in his mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Furthermore, Wiggins\u2019 testimony was relatively insignificant to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Compare Shanklin, </em>222 Va. at 865, 284 S.E.2d at 613 (evidence sufficient to support conviction in absence of witness\u2019 testimony), <em>and Fulcher, </em>226 Va. at 99-100, 306 S.E.2d at 876-77 (same), <em>with Brown, </em>246 Va. at 465, 437 S.E.2d at 565 (witness\u2019 testimony only evidence identifying or impheating defendant as perpetrator), <em>and Whittaker, </em>217 Va. at 967, 234 S.E.2d at 80 (same). Wiggins\u2019 testimony was corroborating evidence of appellant\u2019s participation in the attack on Ford and the motivation behind the attack. It did not materially contradict the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s other witnesses, which alone provided evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Finally, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s exclusion of misdemeanor offenses not involving moral turpitude as evidence related to Wiggins\u2019 bias, it is clear that appellant was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine Wiggins extensively on that very point. The court allowed appellant to elicit testimony concerning Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions for felonies and misdemeanors involving moral turpitude. The jury was aware of at least ten of Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions, seven of which it knew were for felonies. The jury knew of Wiggins\u2019 forthcoming sentencing and knew Wiggins believed that his prior criminal record would likely be relevant to the sentence he received. The jury was further aware that, in exchange for his testimony, Wiggins hoped, \u201cthey [would not give him] the 15 years the charges carry.\u201d In short, the issue of Wiggins\u2019 bias and motive to lie was clearly before the jury; the jury knew that Wiggins hoped to avoid a long sentence in his three pending cases and that Wiggins knew the number of his prior convictions, both misdemeanor and felony, could bear on the length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of the sentence. Wiggins\u2019 bias could have been further underscored and developed only by disclosure of additional criminal conduct that was manifestly of a less serious nature than the conduct of which the jury was aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In sum, based on our review of the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s participation in the crimes, the cumulative nature of Wiggins\u2019 testimony, and the significant opportunity appellant was provided to present evidence concerning Wiggins\u2019 bias or motive to testify, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that any error in refusing to allow cross-examination with respect to Wiggins\u2019 prior convictions for misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. Appellant proffered Wiggins' criminal record to the trial court. While Wiggins\u2019 criminal record appears nowhere in the record on appeal, it is manifest from our reading of the record that Wiggins had been convicted of misdemeanors not involving moral turpitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. Although only Wiggins\u2019 testimony placed an ashtray in appellant's hand, it is immaterial to appellant\u2019s conviction for second degree murder whether, acting as a principal in the first degree, appellant struck Ford with an ashtray or whether, acting as a principal in the second degree, he held Ford down while Taylor struck him and eventually strangled him. Furthermore, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the extent to which Wiggins' testimony established premeditation is immaterial to appellant\u2019s conviction for second degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b89-8\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AXz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The trial judge erred in limiting Tyrone Scott\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Linwood Wiggins, the inmate who testified for the Commonwealth. The questioning related to Wiggins\u2019 bias and, thus, tended to undermine his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">An accused has a right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses to show bias or motivation and that right, when not abused, is absolute. The right emanates from the constitutional right to confront one\u2019s accusers.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\"><em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 460, 464, 437 S.E.2d 563, 564-65 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">The majority holds that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless. I disagree. The rule is well established that \u201c \u2018[a] fan-trial on the merits and substantial justice\u2019 are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). Thus, \u201ca harmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992). Even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed testimony may well have affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Both Zenobia Jones and Tamika Young testified for the Commonwealth concerning the events that occurred in Jones\u2019 house. Both testified that Jones, Young, Kimberly Taylor, Tyrone Scott, and the victim had spent most of the day drinking beer and using both cocaine and heroin. Young testified that in the evening she and the victim went upstairs, disrobed, and began to engage in sexual touching. When the victim refused to pay Young for sexual acts, Taylor entered the room and attempted to force the victim to pay Young. Young testified that Taylor and the victim began to fight. During the fighting, the victim hit Young and pushed her to the floor. After Young was pushed to the floor, she called Scott to stop the fighting. The testimony of the events that then followed was in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Young testified that Scott came upstairs and only became involved in the dispute after the victim hit Young. Young testified that Scott asked the victim to give Young the money he owed her. Young testified that after Scott spoke to the victim, the victim and Scott started fighting. The fighting moved from the bedroom to a room downstairs. Young testified that Taylor hit the victim while Scott held him. She also testified that Taylor stabbed the victim and strangled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Jones testified that sometime after 8:00 p.m. Taylor, Young, Scott, and the victim were \u201cshoving amongst themselves.\u201d Jones said that she ordered them to leave her house. All of them walked down the stairs. Jones testified that after she ordered all of them to leave her house she saw Scott holding the victim and did not know \u201cwhether [Scott] was helping him or steadying him.\u201d She testified that she did not see Scott hit the victim. However, as Jones opened the door, Taylor became aggressive and began hitting the victim with an object. Young testified that Taylor hit the victim with a glass object and strangled him.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Wiggins, the prison inmate who was not present at the house, testified that Scott said he hit the victim with an ashtray. Wiggins also testified that Scott said he got involved in the dispute because the victim had a thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Scott testified that he only hit the victim to defend himself when the victim became belligerent. Both Young and Taylor testified that Scott asked Taylor to stop assaulting the victim. Indeed, Scott\u2019s testimony that he only hit the victim in self-defense is not inconsistent with the testimony of Jones and Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The testimony concerning Scott\u2019s participation was conflicting. Although Wiggins testified that Scott admitted hitting the victim with an ashtray, both Young and Jones testified that Taylor, not Scott, hit the victim with an object. Young also testified that Taylor stabbed the victim with an object. Neither Jones nor Young testified that Scott hit the victim with any object. Thus, the jury was required to resolve four different versions of the events from the testimony of the three people who were in the house \u2014 Jones, Young, and Scott \u2014 and Wiggins, who was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Wiggins\u2019 testimony was offered by the Commonwealth to fill substantial gaps in its case and to support the inferences the jury was required to draw to convict Scott. Indeed, only Wiggins\u2019 testimony, if believed, proved that Scott hit the victim with an ashtray and tended to prove that Scott took money from the victim. Thus, on one hand, if the jury believed Wiggins, the jury could have reached the same verdicts based solely on his testimony (i.e., even if the jury disbelieved the testimony of Young, Jones, and Scott). On the other hand, if the jury had disbelieved Wiggins\u2019 testimony, the jury would have had no evidence to support a finding that Scott hit the victim with any object and could only speculate that Scott took money from the victim or that any money was even taken from the victim. Moreover, Wiggins\u2019 testimony was the only evidence that directly contradicted Scott\u2019s assertion that he acted in self-defense. Thus, Wiggins\u2019 credibility was critically important.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In finding the error harmless, the majority posits that other witnesses proved facts in dispute. However, that \u201c[o]ther evidence of a disputed fact [exists in the record] ... does hot establish that an error is harmless.\u201d <em>Hooker, </em>14 Va.App. at 458, 418 S.E.2d at 345. It is well settled that the credibility of witnesses, the weight accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters that are within the province of the fact finder. <em>See Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986). When the trial judge errs in limiting a defendant\u2019s cross-examination of a witness on a matter that bears on credibility, that error cannot be harmless where the determination of the sufficiency of proof involves the jury\u2019s assessment of that witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See Waller v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 53, 61, 467 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1996). Because the jury could have founded its verdicts on Wiggins\u2019 testimony, the trial judge\u2019s limitation of Scott\u2019s counsel\u2019s examination of Wiggins for bias cannot be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Wiggins\u2019 testimony was the only evidence that tended to prove Scott premeditated the killing and hit the victim with an object to take his money. His testimony was the strongest evidence tending to prove Scott acted with malice. Most importantly, Wiggins was the only -witness whose testimony directly contradicted Scott\u2019s testimony. Thus, it cannot be said, as the majority asserts, that Wiggins\u2019 testimony was merely cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The majority concludes that the evidence would have had little impact because \u201cthe issue of Wiggins\u2019 bias and motive to lie was [already] ... before the jury\u201d and the crimes excluded were less serious than the crimes admitted. Even assuming that the jury would have only slightly further discounted Wiggins\u2019 testimony, the effect on the <em>verdict </em>\u2014 the relevant harmless error issue \u2014 may have been significant. Wiggins\u2019 testimony was critical to the prosecution and extremely damaging to Scott\u2019s defense. Even the slightest further diminution of Wiggins\u2019 credibility may have had a significant impact on the <em>verdict. </em>As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Brown:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>We do not accept the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that any error was harmless. [The witness\u2019] testimony was the only evidence directly identifying [the accused] as the perpetrator of the murder. It is true that the Commonwealth presented certain circumstantial evidence that implicated [the accused], but this evidence alone may not have been sufficient to support the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">246 Va. at 465, 437 S.E.2d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Scott testified that he was merely defending himself. His testimony was not inconsistent with the testimony of Jones and Young, the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. Indeed, upon the evidence proved at trial, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could render a verdict of manslaughter, a killing committed without premeditation or malice. Moreover, based on the verdict of second degree murder, the conclusion is inescapable that the jury disbelieved Wiggins\u2019 testimony to the extent that it was offered to prove premeditation. Thus, had Scott\u2019s counsel been permitted to develop fully Wiggins\u2019 possible bias, the jury may have further discounted Wiggins\u2019 testimony and rendered a verdict of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The majority states that \u201cthe extent to which Wiggins\u2019 testimony established premeditation is immaterial to [Scott\u2019s] conviction for second degree murder.\u201d That assertion ignores the harmless error inquiry \u2014 whether the error may have affected the verdict. <em>See Cartera, </em>219 Va. at 519, 248 S.E.2d at 786. Wiggins\u2019 testimony was the only evidence that tended to prove Scott possessed the most blameworthy state of mind \u2014 premeditating a malicious killing. Because Wiggins\u2019 testimony was extremely prejudicial as to malice, it cannot be said that the error did not affect the verdict simply because the jury did not convict for first degree murder. Wiggins\u2019 testimony may have caused the jury to find second decree murder instead of finding manslaughter or acquitting Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Obviously, from the record in this case \u201c[w]e cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that, if the jury had believed [Wiggins\u2019] testimony was unreliable, the[ ] verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>970, 234 S.E.2d 79, 82 (1977). We cannot say that if the evidence relating to Wiggins\u2019 bias had been thoroughly explored, the jury nevertheless would have credited his testimony as proof of malice and returned the same verdict. <em>See id. </em>That is, we cannot exclude the possibility that, had Wiggins\u2019 bias been further revealed, the jury would have returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter or not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
