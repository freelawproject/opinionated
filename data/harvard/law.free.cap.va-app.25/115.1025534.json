Kenbridge argues that the commission erred in ruling that the services provided by Poole\u2019s wife are compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Charles Edward Poole fractured his skull on July 20, 1994 while working for Kenbridge. As a result, Poole suffers from cognitive brain damage and is blind in one eye. The commission approved the parties\u2019 memorandum of agreement and awarded Poole $466 per week in temporary total disability benefits for lost wages and medical benefits for as long as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">A deputy commissioner held a hearing on Poole\u2019s claim for payment for the services provided by Poole\u2019s wife between 10:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. every day.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The evidence at that hearing proved that Poole requires continuous care. Aides give Poole assistance during the day. Poole\u2019s wife is the only person who cares for Poole during the nighttime.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">Dr. Nathan D. Zasler, Poole\u2019s brain rehabilitation specialist, reported that Poole\u2019s wife \u201chas been providing and will need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>continue to provide medically necessary attention in the home on a 24-hour basis due to ... Poole\u2019s condition.\u201d He also wrote that Poole\u2019s wife provided care that \u201chas been under [his] direction.\u201d Dr. Zasler stated that her care \u201cinvolves the type of care that would be rendered by trained attendants in most other settings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Dr. Gary R. Zeevi, Poole\u2019s cardiologist, reported that Poole\u2019s wife provides \u201cin-home medical attention which would otherwise require in-office care.\u201d He added that she \u201cmonitor[s] his cardiac condition, heart rates[,] and reaction to medications in a fashion usually reserved for people with nursing degrees.\u201d Dr. E.D. Baugh, Poole\u2019s primary physician, reported that Poole\u2019s wife keeps a daily record of Poole\u2019s medications, blood pressure, and pulse rate. Poole\u2019s pharmacist stated that Poole\u2019s wife \u201chas become very knowledgeable about his drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Poole\u2019s vafe testified that after Poole\u2019s accident, Poole\u2019s doctor told her that she \u201cmust learn how to regulate his heart \u2014 to check his heart every morning.\u201d After she was told that she \u201cmust learn the seizure procedures,\u201d she sought and received \u201ctrain[ing] ... for [Poole\u2019s] particular needs.\u201d Specifically, Poole\u2019s wife has been trained to administer enemas and suppositories, take stool samples, take blood pressure readings, and monitor heart rates. Aji experienced nurse testified that she trained Poole\u2019s wife to perform most of these tasks. In addition, Poole\u2019s wife enrolled in a class to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques (CPR).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Poole\u2019s wife has performed some physical therapy for her husband. In addition, she monitors all of his medications and prepares his medication sheets. Although she remains in close contact with Poole\u2019s doctors, one doctor has told her to use her own discretion when monitoring Poole\u2019s medication. Poole\u2019s wife testified that she gets up from four to fifteen times each night to care for Poole.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In awarding payment for Poole\u2019s wife\u2019s services, the commission found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[Poole\u2019s wife] has clearly been trained to provide services which qualify as \u201cmedical attention.\u201d She has been trained in CPR, physical therapy, seizure control, the monitoring of vital functions, bowel and bladder programs, and to a limited extent, the administration of medication____ The necessity of her services has been certified by Drs. Zasler, Zeevi, and Baugh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The commission ruled that Poole\u2019s wife\u2019s services should be compensated at the rate of $7 per hour, three hours per night, seven days per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u201cWhen the issue is the sufficiency of the evidence and there is no conflict in the evidence, the issue is purely a question of law____ \u2018[W]e must ... determine if the correct legal conclusion has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va.App. 319, 324, 416 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1992) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 337, 428 S.E.2d 905 (1993). The parties agree that, \u201cafter an accident, the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished ... necessary medical attention.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1). Kenbridge argues, however, that the facts of this case do not meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-603 as a matter of law because the services Poole\u2019s wife provides do not constitute \u201cmedical attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">The rule is well settled that nursing services, whether provided at a medical facility or in a patient\u2019s home, \u201care included among the medical benefits that an employer and insurer must furnish, provided the services are necessary and authorized.\u201d <em>Warren Trucking Co. v. Chandler, </em>221 Va. 1108, 1115, 277 S.E.2d 488, 492-93 (1981). In applying the rule, the following factors are relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">[T]he employer must pay for the care when it is performed by a spouse, if (1) the employer knows of the employee\u2019s need for medical attention at home as a result of the industrial accident; (2) the medical attention is performed under the direction and control of a physician, that is, a physician must state home nursing care is necessary as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>result of the accident and must describe with a reasonable degree of particularity the nature and extent of duties to be performed by the spouse; (3) the care rendered by the spouse must be of the type usually rendered only by trained attendants and beyond the scope of normal household duties; and (4) there is a means to determine with proper certainty the reasonable value of the services performed by the spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1116, 277 S.E.2d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In <em>Chandler, </em>the Supreme Court held that the services provided by Chandler\u2019s wife were not of the kind normally provided by a trained medical care provider. <em>See id. </em>at 1118, 277 S.E.2d at 494. The evidence proved that Chandler\u2019s wife\u2019s \u201ccare consisted of bathing, shaving, feeding, assistance in walking, help with braces, aid upon falling, driving[,] and administering routine medication.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The evidence in this case proved that the services provided by Poole\u2019s wife are significantly more extensive. Poole\u2019s wife is required to monitor Poole\u2019s heart rate and blood pressure, give him suppositories and enemas, monitor his medications and any side effects, and remain in close contact with his doctors. When Poole has seizures, she must determine the cause and make judgments about the appropriate emergency care. Indeed, Dr. Zasler wrote the following in his report to the commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">This care involves medication administration and monitoring for side-effects, monitoring for seizures and providing appropriate emergency care when seizures occur, monitoring for cardiovascular problems related to ... Poole\u2019s post-injury cardiac arrhythmia, [and] supervising and implementing appropriate bowel and bladder programs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Both Dr. Zasler and Dr. Zeevi opined that the care provided by Poole\u2019s wife is usually performed by trained attendants or nurses. Moreover, the evidence proved that Poole\u2019s wife has received extensive training at hospitals and from a registered nurse. She provides these services to Poole at the direction of Poole\u2019s physicians. Based on this evidence, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>services provided by Poole\u2019s wife are \u201cof the type usually rendered only by trained attendants and beyond the scope of normal household duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1116, 277 S.E.2d at 493. Accordingly, the commission did not err in awarding Poole benefits for the services provided by his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Contrary to Poole\u2019s assertion, however, we hold that the commission did not err in awarding compensation for only three hours per night. No evidence supports a finding that Poole\u2019s wife remains awake and monitors Poole constantly from 10:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m. Indeed, Poole\u2019s wife testified that Poole wakes her during the night. Thus, the evidence supports a finding that Poole\u2019s wife does not render services for the full ten hours per night. This evidence and the reasonable inferences that flow from the evidence support the commission\u2019s award of $7 per hour for three hours per night.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
