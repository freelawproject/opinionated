Bottenfield (appellant) was convicted in a jury trial of aggravated sexual battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 and of taking indecent liberties with a minor in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370. On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in: (1) overruling his motion to suppress his confession; (2) preventing him from arguing the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the jury; and (3) allowing the Commonwealth to amend the indictment. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">On August 25, 1995, Sergeant Dwight Wood (Wood) of the Augusta County Sheriffs Department asked Christopher D. Bottenfield (appellant) to come to the Sheriffs Department to discuss allegations of sexual abuse made by the victim, Kelly Bottenfield (Kelly). Before the interview began, Wood told appellant that no charges were pending against him and that he did not have to discuss the allegations. However, appellant agreed to meet and talk with Wood regarding the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The interview, which occurred the following day, lasted approximately thirty-four minutes and was not recorded. Wood realized at the beginning of the interview that appellant was \u201cslow,\u201d and he phrased his questions to appellant accordingly. Following the question and answer part of the interview, Wood made a list of short statements (a \u201cvery, very simple\u201d statement) relating to the questions and answers. He went over these statements several times with appellant. Appellant signed the bottom of the page, and the interview terminated. At no time, either before or during the interview, were <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to appellant. After the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>view, Wood wrote down from memory his questions and appellant\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">On September 1, 1995, appellant was arrested and on October 23, 1995, he was indicted for attempted rape, sodomy, aggravated sexual battery, and taking indecent liberties. Appellant filed a motion to suppress statements made during the August 26,1995 interview on the basis that this confession was involuntary. On March 18, 1996, the suppression hearing was held, and the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">[W]e\u2019ve got a case here where [ ] an adult has been charged with engaging in sexual activity with a child under the age of thirteen years. And [ ] an experienced police investigator calls him on the phone and asks him if he will voluntarily come to the Sheriffs Department. This individual then drives his own vehicle ... to the Augusta County Sheriffs Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">... And the [ ] investigator talks to him and determines that he is slow. But he also determines that he has been employed for seven years and that he does drive. He asks him some questions. I haven\u2019t seen the questions. I haven\u2019t seen the statement. I don\u2019t know what he asked him. I don\u2019t know what the answers are. I don\u2019t know whether the man signed it. The police officer, again, of twenty some years, believed this man understood what he was admitting to. And, if that\u2019s the case, gentlemen, the statement was voluntary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">... And if the interrogation is not custodial, the <em>Miranda </em>... presumption doesn\u2019t apply. And this is not a custodial interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Wood testified at the jury trial that at the time of the August 26,1995 interview, no arrest warrants or charges were pending against appellant. Wood stated that appellant was free to leave at any time and that appellant was never told that he was under arrest or going to be charged. Appellant was not searched, frisked, or placed in handcuffs. Wood further testified that, although he realized appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cslow,\u201d appellant was able to carry on an intelligent conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Dr. Joseph Conley, Jr. (Dr. Conley) testified on behalf of appellant and was qualified as an expert in neuropsychology. Prior to trial, he interviewed and examined appellant, and determined that his IQ was sixty-one, which is, according to Dr. Conley, in the mentally retarded range. He testified at trial regarding appellant\u2019s intelligence, reading ability, reading comprehension, spelling ability, and mathematics ability, and concluded that appellant was unable to comprehend the terminology used in the confession he signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In admitting appellant\u2019s statement into evidence, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">[T]he jury is ... not gonna hear evidence concerning the ... <em>admissibility </em>of this confession. It\u2019s not gonna hear evidence concerning whether this confession was voluntary, as that ... term is a legal term.... But, certainly, this man\u2019s mental capability and his ability to understand words and whatever \u2014 certainly, that is admissible, because the jury is gonna have to determine what <em>weight </em>to give to this confession; not being limited in any respect with that regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The motion was overruled. The Commonwealth then requested to change the code section of the taking indecent liberties charge, and the court allowed the amendment. The court specifically found that \u201cthe amendments are technical in nature; they don\u2019t change the nature of the charge in either ... situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">II. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Appellant argued at the pretrial suppression hearing that the confession obtained during his questioning on August 26, 1995 was \u201cnot voluntary as is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that his confession was voluntary, because the trial court failed to independently evaluate the circumstances surrounding his confession. Although we agree that the trial court erred when it apparently relied primarily on Wood\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary, we also conclude, based on our independent review of the record, that appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Commonwealth has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant\u2019s confession was freely and voluntarily given. <em>See Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 549, 554, 413 S.E.2d 655, 658 (1992); <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 825, 830, 75 S.E.2d 468, 471 (1953). In determining whether a statement or a confession was voluntary, the trial court must decide whether the statement was the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u201d or whether the maker\u2019s will \u201chas been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Peterson, </em>15 Va.App. 486, 487-88, 424 S.E.2d 722, 723 (1992) (citations omitted). In so deciding, the trial court must look to \u201cthe <em>totality of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d Id. </em>at 488, 424 S.E.2d at 723 (emphasis added). The court must consider the defendant\u2019s age, intelligence, mental and physical condition, background and experience with the criminal justice system, the conduct of the police, and the circumstances of the interview. <em>See id.; Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 575, 579, 439 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1994). Because only state action may violate a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights, \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntar/ within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 522, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we consider the entire record in determining whether the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 644, 648, 440 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1994) (citing <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 543 (1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 985, 109 S.Ct. 541, 102 L.Ed.2d 571 (1988)). \u201c[T]he standard for appellate review of whether a confession is voluntary [ ] requires] an independent examination of the totality of the circumstances____\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>13 Va.App. at 551, 413 S.E.2d at 656; <em>see also Midkiff v. Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 262, 268-69, 462 S.E.2d 112, 116 (1995) (voluntariness of a confession \u201cis a question of law, subject to independent appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s relatively low intelligence and defective education are factors which should be weighed, along with all surrounding circumstances, in determining whether ... his confession was voluntary.\u201d <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 564, 318 S.E.2d 386, 390 (1984) (citation omitted); <em>see also Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 165, 107 S.Ct. at 520-21 (stating that \u201cmental condition is surely relevant to an individual\u2019s susceptibility to police coercion\u201d). However, \u201ca defendant\u2019s mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should [never] dispose of the inquiry into constitutional \u2018voluntariness.\u2019\u201d <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 164, 107 S.Ct. at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Indeed, in <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that a defendant\u2019s mental condition is \u201csurely relevant to an individual\u2019s susceptibility to police coercion.\u201d <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 165, 107 S.Ct. at 521 (holding that defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary, even though defendant argued that he suffered from chronic schizophrenia and command hallucinations that interfered with his volitional abilities). However, the Court also determined that the \u201cmere examination of the confessant\u2019s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its analysis of a defendant\u2019s ability to make a voluntary confession, the Court reasoned that, \u201c[a]bsent police conduct causally related to the confession there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law.\u201d The Court ultimately held that \u201ccoercive police activity is a <em>necessary predicate </em>to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary5 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 107 S.Ct. at 522 (emphasis added). In relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Connelly, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he amount of coercion necessary to trigger the due process clause may be lower if the defendant\u2019s ability to withstand the coercion is reduced ... but some level of coercive police activity must occur before a statement or confession can be said to be involuntary.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>15 Va.App. at 488, 424 S.E.2d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We first hold that the trial court\u2019s ruling that appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary was erroneous because the trial court did not base its conclusion on an analysis of the totality of the circumstances. In its ruling, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">[Sergeant Wood] asked [appellant] some questions. I haven\u2019t seen the questions. I haven\u2019t seen the statement. I don\u2019t know what he asked him. I don\u2019t- know what the answers are. I don\u2019t know whether the man signed it. The police officer, again, of twenty some years, believed this man understood the questions that he was being asked; he understood what he was admitting to. And, <em>if that\u2019s the case, gentlemen, the statement was voluntary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">(Emphasis added). The trial court apparently adopted Wood\u2019s determination that appellant \u201cunderstood what he was admitting to.\u201d Because the trial court did not independently consider the circumstances relevant to the issue of voluntariness, its decision to deny appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession was based upon an erroneous predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">However, based upon our review of the entire record adduced, we hold that appellant\u2019s oral confession to Wood was voluntary. Appellant was asked by Wood to come to the Sheriffs Department to discuss the allegations against him, and he voluntarily drove himself to the Sheriffs Department for the interview. Wood told appellant that no charges were pending against him and that he did not have to discuss the allegations or speak further. Wood testified that the door to his office was open during the entire interview and that appellant was free to leave at any time. The first part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>interview consisted of an oral discussion of the victim\u2019s allegations against appellant. Wood phrased his questions simply and made notes of appellant\u2019s oral responses. Wood testified that he noticed that appellant was \u201climited in education\u201d and that he had \u201cto ask [his] questions sometimes more than once and in different ways, for [appellant] to understand them.\u201d During this stage of the interview, appellant stated that, among other things, he had made the victim touch and put her mouth on his penis and that he had touched and placed his finger inside the victim\u2019s vagina.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The evidence regarding this stage of the interview does not indicate that appellant\u2019s oral confession was coerced in any way by Wood. In addition, Wood did not use complex ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tions or other tactics aimed at exploiting appellant\u2019s disability in order to compel an unintentional confession. On the contrary, Wood testified that he framed his questions simply and repeated them several times when it appeared that appellant did not understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Here, appellant identifies no coercive tactics used by the police to overbear his will nor any circumstances that caused him to be \u201cespecially susceptible.\u201d Appellant\u2019s low IQ standing alone is insufficient to outweigh all other considerations and to render the statement involuntary. <em>See also Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 249, 349 S.E.2d 161 (1986) (holding that defendant\u2019s mental retardation and intoxication did not interfere with his ability to make a voluntary confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellant additionally contends that his confession was involuntary because he did not understand the <em>written </em>confession that he signed. We disagree that appellant\u2019s signature on the written confession amounted to a constitutional violation. The record indicates that after the oral portion of the interview, Wood drafted a confession containing eight statements. The record also indicates that the content of these written statements merely summarized appellant\u2019s oral responses to Wood\u2019s questions about his sexual activity with the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wood read each statement to appellant, and appellant signed the written confession. Appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Conley, testified that appellant probably did not understand the content of this written confession because the eight statements were \u201cdrafted ... at a higher level than that which ... [appellant] was capable of comprehending.\u201d However, no evidence in the record impugned appellant\u2019s ability to respond accurately to Wood\u2019s oral questions. Because the content of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the written confession did not vary from the content of appellant\u2019s oral confession, which was the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice,\u201d we conclude that appellant\u2019s due process rights were not violated when Sergeant Wood had him sign the written confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Accordingly, the record establishes that appellant \u201cwas folly cognizant of his situation, was in control of his cognitive powers, understood the circumstances, and was exercising his free will when he admitted his involvement in the crime[s] ... the circumstances ... were not so compulsive or coercive that [appellant] was prevented from weighing his options, understanding the situation, and making a knowing and calculated decision to confess to his involvement.\u201d <em>See Wilson, </em>13 Va.App. at 554, 413 S.E.2d at 658. The standard used by the trial court when ruling on the voluntariness issue, while erroneous, worked no injustice. Upon review of the entire record, we hold that the confession was voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">III. <em>MIRANDA </em>WARNINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Next, appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the confession despite the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and that the issue of the absence of the warnings should have been argued to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he Supreme Court has made it clear that the prescribed warnings must be given before statements are taken from suspects only where there is custodial interrogation as thus defined in <em>Miranda: </em>\u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Novak v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 373, 384-85, 457 S.E.2d 402, 407 (1995) (quoting <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 46, 307 S.E.2d 864, 872 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109, 104 S.Ct. 1617, 80 L.Ed.2d 145 (1984)). Whether a detention amounts to a custodial interrogation for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>depends on all of the circumstances surrounding the detention. <em>See Cherry v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 135, 140, 415 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>242, 244 (1992). Factors we may consider include, <em>inter alia, </em>whether Wood informed appellant that he was not under arrest, whether appellant knew or had been apprised of the nature of the investigation, and the point at which appellant became the focus of the investigation. <em>See Wass v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 27, 32-34, 359 S.E.2d 836, 839-40 (1987); <em>Cherry, </em>14 Va.App. at 139, 415 S.E.2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">On appeal, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. <em>Novak, </em>20 Va.App. at 385, 457 S.E.2d at 408. Additionally, in our analysis, we must view the situation from the vantage point of a \u201creasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The record demonstrates that appellant\u2019s statements were made during an informal interview that was conducted as part of Wood\u2019s investigation. <em>Miranda </em>does not apply to a police officer\u2019s general questioning in the course of the fact-finding process. <em>See Pruett v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 271, 351 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 940, 110 S.Ct. 2194, 109 L.Ed.2d 522 (1990). Wood informed appellant that no charges were pending against him, that he was not under arrest, and he informed appellant of the nature of the allegations. The record also makes clear that appellant\u2019s freedom was not constrained in any way during the interview. We hold that the trial court correctly found that appellant was not in custody at the time of the confession. Accordingly, no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. <em>See Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977); <em>Addison v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 713, 299 S.E.2d 521 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Appellant further contends that, in order to support his theory of voluntariness, he should have been allowed to argue to the jury the fact that he received no <em>Miranda </em>warnings. However, appellant cites no authority to support this argument. The issue of whether <em>Miranda </em>rights were required is a question of law, properly determined by the trial court and not, as appellant contends, a question of fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>could be considered by a jury in determining the weight to be given to the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">IV. AMENDMENT OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Lastly, appellant argues that the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to amend the indictment at the close of its case-in-chief, because the amendment changed the nature and character of the offense charged. The Commonwealth was permitted to amend the indictment charging appellant with taking indecent liberties from Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, which requires proving a supervisory relationship between the accused and the victim, to Code \u00a7 18.2-370, which does not contain such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-231 states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">If there be any defect in form in any indictment ... or if there shall appear to be any variance between the allegations therein and the evidence offered in proof thereof, the court may permit amendment of such indictment ... at any time before the jury returns a verdict or the court finds the accused guilty or not guilty, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged---- If the court finds that such amendment operates as a surprise to the accused, he shall be entitled, upon request, to a continuance of the case for a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfZ\">Additionally, \u201cRule 3A:6 provides that an error in the citation of the statute which defines the offense ... shall not be ground for dismissal of an indictment ... \u2018unless the court finds that the error or omission prejudiced the accused in preparing his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>George v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 264, 281, 411 S.E.2d 12, 22 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 973, 112 S.Ct. 1591, 118 L.Ed.2d 308 (1992) (quoting Rule 3A:6).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing the amendment. Notably, appellant did not allege surprise at the time of the amendment or request a continuance of the case. Code \u00a7 18.2-370 is the <em>same offense </em>as Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, except the former does not require proof that the offender was in a custodial or supervisory relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>with the victim. The amendment did not add elements to the charges or otherwise jeopardize appellant\u2019s opportunity to adequately defend himself. Finally, the original indictment gave appellant adequate notice of the essential elements of the charge against him. <em>See George, </em>242 Va. at 280-81, 411 S.E.2d at 22 (no error in permitting the Commonwealth, after resting its case, to amend the indictment to correct a wrong code section, where amendment did not prejudice the accused in preparing his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">. At appellant's trial. Wood testified that he had made notes of his questions and appellant\u2019s answers during the oral stage of the interview. He then read these notes into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">Okay. As I said, this interview was on the 26th of August, and in my office at approximately 7:30 P.M. \"[The victim] said you have touched her and made her do some things that she didn\u2019t like.\u201d His answer, with no denial, \"I\u2019ve done some things.\u201d \"[The victim] said you have \u2014 you took her clothes off, and yours.\u201d His answer, \"Just one time.\u201d \"[The victim] said you laid on top of her.\u201d His reply, \u2018Yes, but I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d My reply to that, \"you didn\u2019t-you didn\u2019t have any clothes on or she.
