She contends the evidence does not support the court\u2019s finding that she withheld her consent to the adoption contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. The disposition of this appeal turns on a construction and application of Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1, which has not been addressed by the Virginia appellate courts heretofore. We find that Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 codifies the standard promulgated by the Virginia appellate courts in cases decided under prior law and that the evidence in the present case supports the circuit court\u2019s finding under that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">K.D.M. (child) was born on February 7, 1992. Appellant, Jennifer Rebecca Hickman (Hickman), is the child\u2019s birth mother. James Clayton Miller, Sr. (Miller) is the child\u2019s birth father. Hickman and Miller were never married. They lived together until Miller was incarcerated three weeks after the child\u2019s birth, following which Hickman and the child lived at the Salvation Army. Appellees, Jeffrey Scott Futty and Patricia Irene Kennedy Futty (Futtys), thereafter took Hickman and the child into their home. Mrs. Futty is the child\u2019s paternal grandmother. Hickman remained with the child in the Futtys\u2019 home for seven weeks, until Mrs. Futty asked her to leave. Hickman was under investigation for welfare fraud, and the Futtys were granted custody of the child. In August 1992, Hickman and Miller were granted limited, supervised visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>In February 1996, the Futtys filed a petition to adopt the child. The Campbell County Department of Social Services (DSS) prepared a home study report addressing the placement of the child for adoption with the Futtys. Ultimately, DSS recommended the Futtys as suitable adoptive parents for the child. DSS reported that the Futtys\u2019 home was the only home the child had ever known, that the child identified only the Futtys as her parents, and that the Futtys, as well as the Futtys\u2019 children, treated the child as part of their family. The evidence showed that the child was thriving in the Futtys\u2019 home, which was described as stable and loving. There is no dispute concerning the suitability of the Futtys as custodians of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Miller consented to the adoption. Hickman did not. At the circuit court hearing, Hickman agreed that the Futtys provided a suitable home for the child. She disagreed, however, that the Futtys should be allowed to adopt the child. Hickman reported to DSS that she had never been given a chance to parent the child and only wanted to prove that she could. At the hearing, Hickman testified that she wanted the child to stay with the Futtys until she could get on her feet and establish a mother/daughter relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Hickman admitted, however, that she did not have \u201cmuch of a relationship\u201d with the child. Indeed, since she was granted visitation in August 1992, Hickman visited the child only nine times, for \u201cvery short\u201d periods, and most recently in June 1995, eight months before the petition for adoption was filed. Over the four-year period, Hickman phoned the Futtys only once. Since the Futtys gained custody of the child in April 1992, Hickman had not petitioned for custody or additional visitation, and she had provided no financial support for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Hickman attributed the infrequency of her visits and her failure to pursue custody to her \u201cvery abusive\u201d relationship with Miller, which did not end until the Spring of 1995. She testified that she was afraid of Miller and that she had not sought custody of the child because she believed it to be in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>child\u2019s best interests to remain with the Futtys while her relationship with Miller continued. Hickman also reported to DSS that she was reluctant to visit the child at the Futtys\u2019 residence because Miller was present each time she went. She reported that she wanted to visit the child without Miller being present. Hickman further reported to DSS that Mrs. Futty did not like her because she was dating a black man and that the Futtys were racist. She also testified that her visitation problems were due in part to transportation difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The Futtys denied the allegation that they were racist and denied having hindered Hickman\u2019s visitation rights. Miller testified that he had done nothing to prevent Hickman from visiting the child. The DSS social worker testified that she was unaware of any efforts by Miller to prevent visitation by Hickman, although she acknowledged that Miller had been incarcerated for thirteen months for \u201cbeating on\u201d Hickman. The Futtys both reported to DSS and testified at the hearing that on all but one of Hickman\u2019s visitations she had accompanied Miller to visit the child. In April 1994, Hickman gave birth to another child (the infant), which Miller had fathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">At the circuit court hearing, the DSS social worker testified that she did not believe Hickman was able to care for the child. She pointed to Hickman\u2019s difficulty in caring for the infant and noted the intervention of Child Protective Services to monitor Hickman\u2019s ability to parent the infant and a health condition of the infant that required special attention. The social worker also pointed to Hickman\u2019s recent job loss and inability to maintain a residence. DSS reported one founded complaint against Hickman for lack of supervision and two founded complaints against Hickman and Miller for medical and physical neglect of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In preparing its report, DSS attempted but was unable to contact Hickman in June and July 1995 at the address they had listed for her. Subsequently, DSS scheduled a home visit with Hickman at another address. When DSS arrived, the homeowner reported that she had taken Hickman in because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Hickman was her son\u2019s friend. One morning, the homeowner woke to find Hickman and the infant asleep on her back porch. Eventually, however, the homeowner \u201ckicked [Hickman] out, [because she] could not put up with her laziness.\u201d The homeowner reported that \u201c[a]ll [Hickman] wanted to do was sleep all day and eat. She did not want to get a job and help pay for food.\u201d The homeowner provided DSS a forwarding address at which DSS was able to locate Hickman. Hickman and the infant subsequently left that address and lived in an emergency shelter, following which they again lived with \u201csome friends.\u201d DSS reported that most recently, Hickman and the infant were living in a residence with nine other people. Hickman testified that since August 1992, she had been incarcerated three times, twice for two-week periods and once for a month. She further testified that since leaving the Futtys\u2019 residence in April 1992 she had lived in eight separate locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">DSS reported that Hickman had been fired from a job at Hardee\u2019s. By the time of the hearing, Hickman had regained her employment at Hardee\u2019s, having worked at McDonald\u2019s and Subway in the interim. At the hearing, Hickman testified that she had acquired a car two days earlier and that she expected to have an apartment of her own in two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Upon the evidence adduced at the hearing and upon consideration of the DSS reports, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) Hickman had made little or no effort to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child; (2) the Futtys had done nothing to thwart Hickman\u2019s efforts to assert her parental rights; (3) Hickman was unable to care for the child; (4) the child is over four years of age; (5) there had been no previous relationship between Hickman and the child or between the child and the infant; (6) the child has a good relationship with the Futtys\u2019 other children; (7) Hickman admitted that the Futtys had taken good care of the child and could find no fault in the custodial environment they provided; (8) the child had been with the Futtys continuously since a few weeks after her birth; and (9) that any change of custody would be emotionally devastating to the child. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>court accordingly found that Hickman was withholding her consent to the child\u2019s adoption contrary to the child\u2019s best interests and granted the adoption over Hickman\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Adoption of a child may be ordered without the consent of the child\u2019s birth parent if that parent\u2019s consent to the adoption is being withheld \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the child as set forth in [Code] \u00a7 63.1-225.1.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-225(F). In determining whether such consent is being withheld \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the child,\u201d the court shall consider \u201cwhether the failure to grant the petition for adoption would be detrimental to the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1. In determining whether the failure to grant the adoption would be detrimental to the child, the court shall consider \u201call relevant factors,\u201d including: (1) the birth parent\u2019s efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child; (2) whether the birth parent\u2019s efforts to assert parental rights were thwarted by other people; (3) the birth parent\u2019s ability to care for the child; (4) the child\u2019s age; (5) the quality of any previous relationship between the birth parent and the child and between the birth parent and any other minor children; (6) the duration and suitability of the child\u2019s present custodial environment; and (7) the effect on the child of a change of physical custody. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1, enacted in 1995, codifies the standard promulgated by the Virginia appellate courts in cases decided under prior law, when the statute contained no explicit standard. <em>See Linkous v. Kingery, </em>10 Va.App. 45, 390 S.E.2d 188 (1990); <em>Frye v. Spotte, </em>4 Va.App. 530, 359 S.E.2d 315 (1987); <em>Jolliff v. Crabtree, </em>224 Va. 654, 299 S.E.2d 358 (1983); <em>Cunningham v. Gray, </em>221 Va. 792, 273 S.E.2d 562 (1981); <em>Ward v. Faw, </em>219 Va. 1120, 253 S.E.2d 658 (1979); <em>Malpass v. Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794 (1972). Under those cases, the determination of whether consent to adoption was being withheld \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the child\u201d required an analysis of \u201cthe full breadth of the parent-child connection in all its dimensions,\u201d <em>Ward, </em>219 Va. at 1125, 253 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>662, through \u201cthe careful application of a series of guiding principles.\u201d <em>Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 56, 390 S.E.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Under those principles, the placement of the child in the prospective adoptive home must have furthered the child\u2019s best interests. The child\u2019s good relationship with the prospective adoptive parents and the ability of the prospective adoptive parents to suitably provide for the child were common factors in each of the prior cases. <em>See Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 57, 390 S.E.2d at 195; <em>Frye, </em>4 Va.App. at 534, 359 S.E.2d at 318; <em>Jolliff, </em>224 Va. at 656, 299 S.E.2d at 359; <em>Cunningham, </em>221 Va. at 794, 273 S.E.2d at 563; <em>Ward, </em>219 Va. at 1122, 253 S.E.2d at 660; <em>Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 395, 192 S.E.2d at 796. Indeed, were the prospective adoptive parents found to be unfit to provide for the child, consent to the adoption could hardly be withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Under the prior cases, however, the suitability of placement in the prospective adoptive home was not alone sufficient to warrant a finding that consent to the adoption was being withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. <em>E.g., Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 398-99, 192 S.E.2d at 798; <em>Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 56, 390 S.E.2d at 194. Indeed, were that the case, the consent requirement of the adoption statute would be meaningless, <em>see Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 398, 192 S.E.2d at 798, and, in practical effect, the court could forever divest a natural parent of all rights and obligations with respect to the child, <em>see Frye, </em>4 Va.App. at 533, 359 S.E.2d at 316, simply by finding placement in the prospective adoptive home more suitable to the child than placement with the child\u2019s birth parent. Instead, the relationship between the child and his or her birth parent had to be considered. <em>E.g., Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 56, 390 S.E.2d at 194. Where the continued relationship between parent and child would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare, it would follow that consent to the adoption was being withheld, not in the child\u2019s interests, but as an \u201cobstinately self-willed\u201d act in \u201cprejudic[e] to the child\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 390 S.E.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Under the prior cases, the Court recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>[f]inding that the continuation of a poor, strained or nonexistent parent-child relationship will be detrimental to a child\u2019s future welfare is difficult. No one can divine with any assurance the future course of human events. Nevertheless, past actions and relationships over a meaningful period serve as good indicators of what the future may be expected to hold. Trial courts may, when presented with clear and convincing evidence, make an informed and rational judgment and determine that the continued relationship between a child and a non-consenting parent will be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Frye, 4 </em>Va.App. at 536, 359 S.E.2d at 319. The relationship between child and birth parent was evaluated, in part, in terms of the birth parent\u2019s fitness to provide for the child. Where there was no question of the fitness of the birth parent and that parent had not, by conduct or legal action, lost his or her rights to the child, it had to be shown that continuance of the parent-child relationship would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. <em>E.g., Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 399, 192 S.E.2d at 799; <em>Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 56, 390 S.E.2d at 194. And, even where the parent proved unfit, the unfitness had to make the continuance of the relationship detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare. <em>Lyle v. Eskridge, </em>14 Va.App. 874, 876-77, 419 S.E.2d 863, 865 (1992) (quoting <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>222 Va. 736, 746, 284 S.E.2d 799, 805 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The relationship between child and birth parent was also evaluated qualitatively, in terms of the birth parent\u2019s contact with the child since his or her separation from the child. <em>E.g., Malpass, </em>213 Va. at 395, 192 S.E.2d at 796; <em>Jolliff, </em>224 Va. at 656-57, 299 S.E.2d at 359-60. The adverse consequences of sporadic, or even non-existent, visitation patterns were tempered by evaluating the extent to which, if at all, efforts at visitation were thwarted by the child\u2019s custodian. <em>E.g., Jolliff, </em>224 Va. at 657, 299 S.E.2d at 360; <em>Frye, 4 </em>Va.App. at 534, 359 S.E.2d at 318. The quality of the relationship was also evaluated in terms of any prior abuse of the child by the non-consenting parent. <em>Frye, 4 </em>Va.App. at 534-35, 359 S.E.2d at 318-19. Finally, the relationship evaluated was not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>a \u201csocial, familial, or custodial connection, but [also] include[d] the legal affiliation always present between parent and child.\u201d <em>Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 57, 390 S.E.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Under the prior case law, the totality of these factors was evaluated to strike the appropriate balance between the best interests of the child and the rights of the non-consenting, natural parent. <em>Linkous, </em>10 Va.App. at 56, 390 S.E.2d at 194. In <em>Malpass, Ward, </em>and <em>Jolliff, </em>the fitness of the non-consenting parent was undisputed, and, after consideration of the \u201cfull breadth of the parent-child connection in all its dimensions,\u201d the Court in each case concluded that consent was not being withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In <em>Malpass, </em>the non-consenting parent had maintained a regular pattern of visitation and support, when such efforts were not thwarted by the child\u2019s custodian. There was no showing in <em>Malpass </em>that the child\u2019s continued relationship with the non-consenting parent would be detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare; it was only established that \u201cfriction\u201d would be created by the non-consenting parent\u2019s continued visitation. Such \u201cfriction\u201d was not sufficient to support the finding that consent had been withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">In <em>Ward, </em>the non-consenting parent paid support for the child, sent the child gifts on a regular basis, and alleged that the child\u2019s custodian had thwarted his efforts to visit the child. The Court found that the non-consenting parent had maintained a social and familial relationship with the child and emphasized the legal relationship that the non-consenting parent continued to share with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In <em>Jolliff, </em>although the non-consenting parent had not seen the child in eight years, the evidence showed that his ability to do so had been rendered impossible by the actions of the child\u2019s custodian: for eight years the non-consenting parent did not know the location of the child. The evidence further showed that the non-consenting parent was willing to visit and support the child, and the Court again emphasized the continuation of the legal relationship between parent and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In <em>Cunningham, Frye, </em>and <em>Linkous, </em>by contrast, the relative unfitness of the non-consenting parent was an important factor. In <em>Cunningham, </em>the evidence showed that the non-consenting parent had a poor employment record, that he had been convicted of a minor crime, that there was \u201cfriction\u201d between the child\u2019s natural parents, and that the non-consenting parent\u2019s occasional violence toward the custodial parent upset the child. On balance, however, the Court found that the evidence did not support a finding that the continuation of the parent-child relationship would have been disruptive to the child. Although the non-consenting parent had seen the child only once in approximately five years, he alleged that his efforts to visit the child had been thwarted by the custodial parent. Indeed, the evidence showed that the custodial parent relocated with the child from New Jersey, where the non-consenting parent resided, to Virginia. The evidence also showed that although his pattern of support had been sporadic, the non-consenting parent intended to support the child into the future and to satisfy a child support arrearage he owed. Finally, the evidence showed that the non-consenting parent\u2019s objection to the adoption was not motivated by anything but a sincere desire to maintain the parent-child connection with his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In <em>Frye, </em>the non-consenting parent\u2019s fitness and the quality of the parent-child relationship were undermined by evidence of physical and sexual abuse by the non-consenting parent against the custodial parent and his adopted child and stepchild. The evidence also showed that the non-consenting parent had provided sporadic, if any, support of the children and that he had visited them only four or five times since he deserted them and made frequent trips to the area without contacting them. The evidence did not support an allegation that the custodial parent had thwarted the non-consenting parent\u2019s efforts to visit the children. The evidence further showed that the non-consenting parent had deserted his children, leaving them in necessitous circumstances, and showed no interest in them until the filing of the petition for adoption. On balance, the Court found that the evidence supported a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>finding that the continued relationship would be detrimental to the children and thus concluded that consent was being withheld contrary to their best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In <em>Linkous, </em>the non-consenting parent was incarcerated, serving a thirty-two year sentence, and, while incarcerated, he was convicted of another offense and received an additional ten year sentence. The non-consenting parent was able to visit the children only once since his incarceration. While the evidence showed that the custodial parent refused to take the children to the prison for further visits, the evidence supported that decision on the ground that the prison visits were detrimental to the children. The evidence showed that the non-consenting parent had been only a \u201cmarginal\u201d parent before his incarceration and that the children would have nothing but a legal relationship with him in the future. The Court found that the non-consenting parent\u2019s unfitness was compounded by the occurrence of his repeated criminal activity and, on balance, found the continuation of the relationship to be detrimental to the children. Thus, the Court concluded that consent was being withheld contrary to the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The balance struck in these prior cases is achieved through an application of the factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1. Those factors encompass both aspects of the standard developed in the prior case law: a court must consider the relationship between the child and the prospective adoptive parents as well as the relationship between the child and the non-consenting parent. A finding with respect to only one of these relationships is insufficient. Under Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1, as under the prior case law, not only must the prospective adoptive placement serve the child\u2019s best interests, but the continued relationship with the non-consenting parent must prove to be detrimental. Detriment is determined, as it was under the prior case law, by considering the non-consenting parent\u2019s fitness, or ability, to parent the child as well as the relationship the non-consenting parent maintains with the child and other children, if any. That relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ship, as it was under the prior case law, is evaluated in terms of the non-consenting parent\u2019s willingness to provide for the child, that parent\u2019s record of asserting parental rights, taking into consideration the extent to which, if any, such efforts were thwarted by other people, and the quality of the parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In sum, the factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 compel the court to consider the child\u2019s best interests <em>vis-a-vis </em>both the prospective adoptive parents and the parent whose consent to the adoption is being withheld. Where the evidence reveals that adoption would be in the child\u2019s best interests and the continued relationship with the non-consenting parent would be detrimental, it follows that the failure to grant the adoption would be detrimental to the child. In such a case, the conclusion that consent is withheld contrary to the child\u2019s best interests is compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In the present case, the trial court tracked Code \u00a7 63.1-225.1 and found by clear and convincing evidence that Hickman withheld her consent to the adoption contrary to the child\u2019s best interests. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision, when based upon an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Frye, 4 </em>Va.App. at 537, 359 S.E.2d at 319-20. We find that the record supports the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">There is no dispute with respect to the suitability of the Futtys as parents for the child. They are the only parents the child has known, and they and their children have integrated the child into their family structure. Indeed, Hickman admitted at the hearing that the Futtys provided a suitable home for the child and she stated that she did not seek to change the child\u2019s custodial placement for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The child\u2019s relationship with Hickman is clearly strained and tenuous. Hickman admitted at the hearing that she did not have \u201cmuch of a relationship\u201d with the child, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>record shows that her choices, decisions and conduct reflected little interest in the child prior to the Futtys\u2019 petition for adoption. The evidence showed that Hickman had made little, if any, attempt to establish a relationship with the child since the child was placed in the Futtys\u2019 custody. Hickman never sought to regain custody of the child, which she lost within two months of the child\u2019s birth. Furthermore, the evidence showed that in nearly four years since Hickman was granted visitation rights, she had visited the child only nine times and had phoned the Futtys only once. The evidence further showed that Hickman provided no support for the child while she was in the Futtys\u2019 care, nearly the child\u2019s entire life.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Hickman alleged that she was thwarted in her attempts to visit the child, but the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary. Mrs. Futty, Miller, and the DSS social worker all testified that no one had thwarted Hickman\u2019s attempt to exercise her parental rights. Hickman alleged that she was afraid of Miller, who was present at the Futtys\u2019 home when she went to visit. The evidence showed, however, that on all but one of Hickman\u2019s visits, Hickman accompanied Miller to the Futty residence. Moreover, Hickman gave birth to another child fathered by Miller more than two years after her first child was placed in the Futtys\u2019 custody. In any event, Hickman made no effort to modify the situation and establish visitation elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Furthermore, Hickman\u2019s ability to parent the child clearly weighed in the court\u2019s determination, and the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Hickman is unable or unwilling to care for the child. The evidence showed that Hickman had several founded complaints for child neglect with DSS and that DSS had been monitoring Hickman\u2019s relationship with her other child. The evidence further showed that Hickman had been incapable of maintaining a permanent residence or employment. Aside from her three periods of incarceration, Hickman resided in eight separate locations during the relevant t\u00fane period.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>In sum, the choices Hickman exercised in relation to the parent-child relationship manifest a failure of both her willingness and ability to parent the child. The factors addressing the child\u2019s relationship with Hickman and those addressing the child\u2019s relationship with the Futtys support the conclusion that failure to grant the adoption would be detrimental to the child. Accordingly, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Hickman withheld her consent to the adoption contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
