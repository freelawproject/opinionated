Cochran, assignee, etc.</parties><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAhE\" pgmap=\"662\">This was a claim against the insolvent, who had been a banker, presented to his assignee in April, 1884, and contested under the statute. It was in the form of a slip or ticket signed by his cashier, dated June 17, 1878, and showed a deposit by appellant of $800; and the defense was payment. Upon the trial, on appeal from the county court, the issue was found for the defendant, a motion for a new trial overruled and judgment entered. The only reason here urged for a reversal was that the verdict was against the evidence; but it was not denied, nor could it be in the face of their record, that there was much to support it. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADy\" pgmap=\"662(1) 663(6)\">Attorney for appellant, Mr. W. II.
