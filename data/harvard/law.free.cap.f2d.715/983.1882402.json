LSA-RS 23:1032 (West Supp.1983). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether a statutory relationship exists is a question of fact to be determined by the totality of the circumstances surrounding each case. <em>Penton v. Crown Zellerbach Corporation, </em>699 F.2d 737, 741 (5th Cir.1983), <em>quoting Ortego v. Union Oil Company of California, </em>667 F.2d 1241 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">In the instant diversity action, Larry Hall, a painter injured in the course of his work, appeals from a jury finding that such a statutory employment relationship precludes his tort claim against Crown Zellerbach Corporation. Hall contends that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to conclude that a statutory relationship existed, and that the court below erred in its instruction to the jury on the statutory employer defense. Unfortunately, Hall\u2019s counsel failed properly to preserve these issues for our review. We are therefore forced to consider these questions under the stringent \u201cplain error\u201d standard. Applying this strict test to a murky record, we cannot find that the jury, or the court, committed \u201cplain error,\u201d or that a miscarriage of justice would result were the verdict allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">In 1976, Crown Zellerbach Corporation (Crown) commenced a four-year, multi-million dollar \u201cmodernization\u201d project to expand and upgrade its paper mill in Bogalusa, Louisiana. Most of the work was contracted out; however, Crown used its own employees to perform various tasks connected with the project as well as retaining control by designating itself the general contractor and appointing a special project manager, Robert Martin, to oversee the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">Part of the modernization program included the installation of two high density tanks and a diffuser washer system. Crown contracted with Kamyr, Inc. to erect those steel structures; the contract called for Kamyr to erect them completely primed but without a finish coat of paint. For budget reasons, the priming was later eliminated from the Crown-Kamyr contract, and the tanks were erected unprimed. Subsequently, Crown contracted with Belle Chasse Contractors, Inc. to prime and paint the tanks in question. Hall, a painter\u2019s helper employed by Belle Chasse, was engaged in preparation for priming the steel pursuant to this contract when he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">Hall sought recovery from Crown under Louisiana tort law on theories of negligence and strict liability. At the conclusion of a three-day trial, Crown moved for summary judgment on the ground that LSA-RS 23:1061 rendered it immune from tort liability because it was Hall\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer.\u201d The district court denied the motion and submitted the question of the existence of a statutory employment relationship to the jury, which found for Crown on this determinative issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">On appeal, Hall asserts that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to reach its conclusion and that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the \u201cstatutory employer\u201d defense. However, neither of these issues are properly before us, since Hall\u2019s counsel failed to preserve them for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqYv\">It is the law in this circuit, as generally elsewhere, that the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict is not reviewable on appeal, ... unless a motion for directed verdict was made at the close of all the evidence by the party seeking that review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\"><em>Quinn v. Southwest Wood Products, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 1018, 1024 (5th Cir.1979). <em>See Coughlin v. Capitol Cement Co., </em>571 F.2d 290, 297 (5th Cir.1978), and cases cited therein. As this court has previously explained,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the rule is designed to prevent litigants from gambling that the jury will rule in their favor, while reserving the option of challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal should the jury rule against them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-5\">When a claimed deficiency in the evidence is called to the attention of the trial judge and of counsel before the jury has commenced deliberation, counsel still may do whatever can be done to mend his case. But if the court and counsel learn of such a claim for the first time after verdict, both are ambushed and nothing can be done except by way of a complete new trial. It is contrary to the spirit of our procedures to permit counsel to be sandbagged by such tactics or the trial court to be so put in error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\"><em>Quinn, </em>597 F.2d at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">This case presents a core example of a fatally belated challenge to the evidence. Plaintiff did not move for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor indeed did plaintiff assert any deficiency in the evidence by way of a motion for relief prior to the jury\u2019s commencement of its deliberations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where plaintiff has thus failed to preserve the issue of sufficiency of the evidence for appellate review,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-13\">\u201cour inquiry is limited to whether there was any evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency, or whether plain error was committed which, if not noticed, would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-14\"><em>Coughlin, </em>571 F.2d at 297, <em>citing American Lease Plans, Inc. v. Houghton Construction Co., </em>492 F.2d 34, 35 (5th Cir.1974); <em>Little v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>426 F.2d at 511 (5th Cir.1970). <em>See also Patton v. Archer, </em>590 F.2d 1319, 1323 (5th Cir.1979); <em>House of Koscot Development Corp. v. American Line Cosmetics, Inc., </em>468 F.2d 64, 67, 68 nn. 4, 5 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Ramada Development Co. v. Rauch, </em>644 F.2d 1097, 1102-03 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">Prior to reviewing the record for some evidence of a statutory employment relationship, we take a moment to specify what evidence we seek. The standard for determining the existence of a statutory employment relationship was established by this court in <em>Blanchard v. Engine &amp; Gas Compressor Services, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 65, 69 (5th Cir.1980) <em>(Blanchard II). </em>In that seminal case<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-16\">The proper standard, as we see it, is whether the activity done by the injured employee or' his actual immediate employer is part of the usual or customary prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>tice of the principal or others in the same operational business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-5\">More specifically, we should first consider whether the particular principal involved in the case customarily does the type of work performed by the contractor and whether the contractor\u2019s work is an integral part of the work customarily performed by the principal. If either of these situations exist, then there is a statutory employment relationship, and the inquiry ends there. If, however, the principal does not normally engage in this type of activity, or if it is not normally a part of his practices, then it is necessary to determine if others engaged in businesses similar to that of the principal customarily do this type of work or if it is an integral part of their businesses. If either of these inquiries yields an affirmative answer, then the general custom of the trade will control to make the relationship between the principal in question and his contractors\u2019 employees that of statutory employer and employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-6\">In applying this test, it is proper to consider all facts which would or would not suggest a statutory employment relationship. Whether the work is essential to the business of the principal or others engaged in similar businesses, may be one such fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-7\">Another fact to consider is whether the principal, or others engaged in like operational activities, normally subcontract out the work <em>or whether they have employees who can, and customarily do, do the work.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">613 F.2d at 71 (emphasis added). Cases since <em>Blanchard II </em>in both state and federal courts have affirmed the analysis we performed in that case and further clarified the standard we outlined there. <em>See, e.g., Penton v. Crown Zellerbach Corporation, </em>699 F.2d 737 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Williams v. Shell Oil Co., </em>677 F.2d 506 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 570, 74 L.Ed.2d 933 (1982); <em>Darville v. Texaco, </em>674 F.2d 443 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, </em>denied,-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 298, 74 L.Ed.2d 280 (1982); <em>Barrios v. Engine &amp; Compressor Services, Inc., </em>669 F.2d 350 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Murphy v. Georgia Pacific Corp., </em>628 F.2d 862 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Melancon v. Tassin Amphibious Equipment Corp., </em>427 So.2d 932, 935 (La.App.1983) (approving <em>Blanchard II </em>analysis and test).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">This case requires that we examine the precise definition and significance that our <em>post-Blanchard II </em>cases, and those of the Louisiana courts, have given to the issue of whether the work in question is usually performed by the principal\u2019s own employees. It is clear that \u201cthe determination of whether a principal is the statutory employer of a contractor\u2019s employee is not dependent upon the principal\u2019s having employees performing the same task.\u201d <em>Guinn v. Progress Drilling, Inc., </em>398 So.2d 128, 130, (La.App.1981). <em>See Murphy v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., </em>628 F.2d at 868, n. 12 (\u201cDefendant\u2019s ... emphasis on the fact the Georgia-Pacific employees had the skills necessary to perform the work done by plaintiff when he was injured is misplaced. The construction project must be considered as a whole, ... otherwise, by hiring \u2018jacks of all trades,\u2019 a principal employer would make any activity part of its \u2018trade, business or occupation\u2019.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Penton, </em>699 F.2d at 744 (\u201cThe argument that Crown employed persons who could have performed appellant\u2019s particular task, without more, does little more than muddy the waters.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Shell Oil, </em>677 F.2d at 509, n. 3; <em>Elliott v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., </em>671 F.2d 865, 867 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Blanchard II </em>at 71 (fact that principal does not have his own employees to do duties is not determinative), <em>citing Barnes v. Sun Oil Co., </em>362 So.2d 761 (La.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-17\">The cases indicate that while it is not determinative whether the employee performs <em>duties </em>(e.g. painting, welding, etc.) which the principal\u2019s employees also perform, it is relevant to a <em>Blanchard II </em>inquiry whether the <em>project </em>on which the employee in question was injured was the sort of project which the principal usually employed his own employees to perform (e.g. new construction or routine repair). As this court put the distinction recently in <em>Penton v. Crown Zellerbach, supra, </em>a case which like this one involved an employee of an independent contractor injured while working on Crown\u2019s Bogalusa moderniza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>tion: \u201cIn this connection, focus is directed to the relationship between the independent contractor and the principal employer rather than the specific duties of the injured employee.\u201d 699 F.2d at 741. <em>See id. </em>at 744 (relevant issue is \u201cwhether the magnitude and type of Crown\u2019s update and modification of the Bogalusa plant facility was part of its usual and customary practice\u201d; \u201cfull airing of (Crown\u2019s) day-to-day operations\u201d needed for resolution of issue); <em>Murphy, </em>628 F.2d at 867-68 (upholding directed verdict denying existence of statutory relationship where plaintiff injured during major expansion of paper mill and principal\u2019s employees had never been used on major new construction); <em>Barrios v. Engine &amp; Gas Compressor Services, Inc., </em>669 F.2d at 354-55 (upholding district court finding of statutory employer relationship where principal\u2019s employees \u201cregularly performed the same repairs and maintenance work on compressor engines that plaintiff was doing at time of accident,\u201d and \u201cit was essential to [principal] to keep compressors in top working order at all times\u201d); <em>Darville v. Texaco, </em>674 F.2d at 444-46 (affirming summary judgment finding statutory employment relationship where plaintiff\u2019s vacuuming of oil separators necessary to operation of principal\u2019s plant; fact that principal always contracted out vacuuming at this plant not enough to raise triable issue of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">In the instant case, the evidence as to the existence of a statutory relationship focused almost exclusively on the fact that Crown employed persons who could and did do painting associated with other parts of the modernization project. Robert Martin, formerly project manager of the modernization project, testified that Crown employed</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">a regular crew of \u201cfacility mechanics\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who put the finishing coat of paint on other elements of the modernization project. Martin also testified that Crown\u2019s usual course of proceeding, at its mills other than the Bogalusa mill, was to have Crown employees paint new equipment installed by Crown<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and do maintenance work. If, however, Crown lacked the manpower for the job, Crown would hire independent contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">To repeat, the posture of this case precludes us from reviewing the weight or adequacy of this evidence. Under the applicable \u201cany evidence\u201d standard, we cannot find that the record is totally devoid of any evidence of a statutory relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">\n<em>The Instruction to the Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">Hall asserts that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury on the statutory employer defense. Unfortunately, Hall\u2019s counsel again failed properly to preserve this issue for our review. Although counsel for plaintiff timely objected to the court\u2019s instruction, he did not adequately specify the grounds for his objection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">We cannot overlook this failure to comply with the requirement of Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 51 that any objection to a jury instruction \u201cstate distinctly the ... grounds of the objection.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number><em>McKinnon v. Skil Corp., </em>638 F.2d 270 (1st Cir.1981). <em>See Pruett v. Marshall, </em>283 F.2d 436, 441 (5th Cir.1960). Plaintiff\u2019s objection did not provide adequate guidance for the trial court to revise its instructions since the objection did not indicate what conflict plaintiff saw between the instruction and the applicable law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are aware that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1058-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Rule 51 promotes judicial economy and integrity by serving a dual purpose.
