HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">In October, 1976, DEA Agent Forrest Beverly, working undercover, went to a motel room to purchase a quantity of cocaine. In the motel room, Beverly met with Stephen Vilmain and an informant named Mark Aftuck. After negotiations were completed, Vilmain left the room to get the cocaine and when he returned, he was accompanied by John Keen. Keen produced a pound of cocaine from a paper bag and handed it to the agent. Beverly then inquired about the possibility of undertaking another similar transaction and Keen told Beverly that if he could wait until 6:00 p.m. that same evening, Keen could probably get more drugs. Thereupon Vilmain and Keen were placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">Keen agreed to cooperate with the authorities and presented appellant August Males as the source of the cocaine. Keen informed the agents that he had no way of contacting Males and would have to wait to be contacted by him. With Keen\u2019s permission, recording devices were attached to his person and his telephone. On the same evening of the arrest, Keen received a call from Males. A meeting was set up to take place in the parking lot of Keen\u2019s apartment later that evening. When Males arrived, DEA agents observed the two men talking and recorded a conversation concerning the possibility of Males supplying more cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"Acp\">Males was arrested and subsequently charged in a two count indictment with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and with distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). After a jury trial, Males was found guilty on both counts. He now appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">Males first challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, claiming that the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to establish venue. Specifically, Males contends that the government failed to prove that the offense took place in \u201cDade County, in the Southern District of Florida,\u201d as alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-18\">The constitution guarantees the right of criminal defendants to be tried in the state and district in which the crime was committed. U.S. Const, amend. VI. <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 18. When faced with a claim of improper venue, the standard of review this court must apply is \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and making all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict .. . the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that the crimes occurred within the Southern District of Florida. <em>United States v. White, </em>611 F.2d 531, 535 (5th Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert, denied, </em>446 U.S. 992, 100 S.Ct. 2978, 64 L.Ed.2d 849 (1980). This burden can be met through the use of direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d 1343, 1357 (11th Cir.1982), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>51 U.S.L.W. 3775 (U.S. April 14, 1983) (No. 82-1687); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>666 F.2d 195, 199, 200 (5th Cir. Unit B. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">There was no direct testimony during trial that the offenses took place in Dade County, Florida. A review of the record, however, indicates that there were a sufficient number of references to the City of Miami from which the jury could have inferred proper venue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Agent Beverly testified that soon after Keen was arrested the cocaine was taken to the \u201cMiami Regional Laboratory.\u201d Another agent testified that Keen was taken to the Miami regional office and arrived there \u201cabout 15 minutes after his arrest.\u201d Although the motel where the arrest took place was never described as being in Miami, it was identified as the Howard Johnson\u2019s at 7330 N.W. 36th Street, and one witness testified that the hotel was near the airport. Moreover, Keen\u2019s apartment, where Keen allegedly received the cocaine from Males, was described on several occasions as being at 8267 S.W. 128th Street. Keen testified that he lived in the Sunshine Point Condominium, at S.W. 128th Street near 82nd Avenue. Similar references to local streets and buildings have been found by the former Fifth Circuit to be sufficient to establish venue. <em>See generally United States v. Turner, </em>586 F.2d 395, 397 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>440 U.S. 926, 99 S.Ct. 1258, 59 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Additionally, during opening argument the government described the Howard Johnson\u2019s as being near the Palmetto Expressway, a throughfare which Males admits is associated with Miami.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although not evidence, argument of counsel \u201care factors which the jury may consider to infer that the offense was committed in the location as charged.\u201d Weaver v. <em>United States, </em>298 F.2d 496, 497 (5th Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">In the final analysis, therefore, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find that venue was established by a preponderance of the evidence and that the district court did not err in denying Males\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">Males also argues on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of extrinsic acts. He claims that, despite his objections,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the government was permitted to question Keen about previous transactions involving cocaine, in violation of Fed.R. Evid. 404(b), and that the error was compounded by the court\u2019s failure to give a cautionary instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The challenged testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">Q. When did you first meet Mr. Males?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-17\">A. I believe around September of 75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-18\">Q. And as a result of that meeting, did you have occasion to participate in any narcotics transactions with Mr. Miles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-19\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-20\">Q. How did these transactions occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2i\">Defense counsel: Objection, irrelevant and immaterial. We are talking about October 21st.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">The Court: Overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-24\">A. I would be fronting goods and in return I would sell it and give the money back to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-25\">Q. When you use the term, \u201cfront,\u201d what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-26\">A. It was given to me on a, without putting my money up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-27\">Q. By whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>A. Mr. Males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Q. And you would sell the quantity of \u2022 drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">Defense counsel: Objection, leading the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">The court: Do not lead the witness, Counselor ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">Q. Did you continue to have contact with Mr. Males?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">Q. In the same manner that you previously described?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">The instant case is similar to the situation addressed by this court in <em>United States v. Costa, </em>691 F.2d 1358 (11th Cir.1982). In that case, Costa and Campbell, a co-defendant, were indicted and charged with possession, and conspiracy to possess, cocaine with intent to distribute. Campbell cooperated with authorities and named Costa as his source. During trial, Campbell was permitted to testify as to previous cocaine dealings with Costa. On appeal, Costa challenged the introduction of the testimony citing Rule 404(b). The court rejected that challenge and held that since \u201c[t]he evidence concerning the prior acts and that used to prove the crime charged were inextricably intertwined,\u201d Rule 404(b) did not come into play. <em>Id. </em>at 1361. In so ruling, the court found that the \u201ctestimony about Costa\u2019s previous dealings in cocaine was necessary because it formed an integral and natural part of the witness\u2019s accounts of the circumstances surrounding the offenses for which the defendant was indicted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">In the case at bar, the testimony in question was elicited to show how Keen was able to have cocaine fronted to him by Males, and then pay for it later. Keen testified further that the cocaine in the charged offenses came to him in the same manner. The evidence was not extrinsic to the charged offenses, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">Finally, Males argues that plain error occurred at two points during the government\u2019s closing argument. First, Males claims that the government improperly commented on his refusal to testify. Second, he claims that error occurred when the government commented that Keen feared bodily harm because he had cooperated with the authorities against Males. In reviewing these claims, it is unnecessary for this court to apply the plain error standard because no reversible error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">During closing argument, Male\u2019s attorney stated to the jury: \u201cThe defendant did not testify in this case because there was nothing he could testify to, other than he was not guilty.\u201d In response to this statement, the government commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-20\">Mr. Bloom also made this statement, the defendant did not testify because he could not say anything other than he is not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-21\">Well, think about that for a while and think about that when you go back in to deliberate, whether or not the defendant could have said anything else, if he could have shed some light on something that may be said during the course of this trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">The doctrine of \u201cinvited error\u201d applies here. Under that doctrine, \u201cwhere the injection of allegedly inadmissible evidence is attributable to the action of the defense, its introduction does not constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>United States v. Doran, </em>564 F.2d 1176, 1177 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>435 U.S. 928, 98 S.Ct. 1498, 55 L.Ed.2d 524 (1978). The doctrine has been applied to arguably impermissible comments during closing argument. <em>See United States v. Meneses-Davila, </em>580 F.2d 888, 895-96 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>421 F.2d 676, 677 (5th Cir.1970). The record indicates that the government\u2019s comment in the ease at bar was in response to defense counsel\u2019s reference to his client\u2019s silence. Accordingly, the admission of the arguably impermissible comment does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">Similarly, Male\u2019s argument with regard to the government\u2019s comment that Keen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>feared bodily harm must also be rejected. On several occasions during cross-examination, defense counsel questioned witnesses concerning the payment of $500 in relocation money to Keen. During closing argument, defense counsel raised the $500 payment several times in an attempt to argue to the jury that the money was paid as an inducement for favorable testimony. It was in response to this invitation by defense counsel that the government, in its closing argument, argued to the jury that the money was paid to Males in order to relocate because he feared bodily harm. Again, under the \u201cinvited error\u201d doctrine, the admission of the government\u2019s argument that Keen feared harm is not reversible error. <em>See United States v. Meneses-Davila, </em>580 F.2d at 895-96; <em>United States v. Doran, </em>564 F.2d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Because we find that none of the contentions raised by the appellant merit reversal, we</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-14\">. The government argues that Males waived the challenge by not preserving it in the district court. This argument is without merit. As the government points out in its brief, Males moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence on the ground that \u201cthe government has not proved each and every element of the indictment.\u201d The location of the offense was included as an element alleged in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">. This court can take-judicial notice that Miami is in Dade County, Florida. <em>See Gov\u2019t, of Canal Zone v. Burjan, </em>596 F.2d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">.
