J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEQ\">In the first portion of a bifurcated trial, a jury convicted Francisco U. Uriarte of one count of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, one count of second degree murder <em>(ibid.), </em>and two counts of attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664 and 187). On the attempted murder counts it found that Uriarte had inflicted great bodily injury. (\u00a7 12022.7.) The jury also found that Uriarte used a firearm in the commission of these crimes. (\u00a7 12022.5.) In the second portion of the trial, the jury determined that Uriarte was sane at the time of the shootings. On motion for new trial, the court reduced the conviction in count one to second degree murder. It then sentenced Uriarte to the maximum possible term of 38 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Uriarte argues the trial court erred in failing to give a requested instruction and abused its discretion in imposing consecutive sentences. As we shall explain, we disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Beginning in 1985, friends, family members and acquaintances of Uriarte noticed stark changes in his behavior. Strong circumstantial evidence attributed these behavioral changes to Uriarte\u2019s use of cocaine and marijuana and his abuse of alcohol. Uriarte\u2019s problems included hallucinations. He would \u201csee\u201d animals in the house and look for nonexistent people under the furniture.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">In October 1987, Uriarte\u2019s wife Elma was operated on for the removal of a kidney. Elma\u2019s illness disturbed Uriarte greatly. He appeared nervous, unsettled and demanding. Elma remained in the hospital from October 12 through October 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>At approximately 9:30 p.m. on October 15, Uriarte knocked at the door of Jo Fish\u2019s apartment in the same complex where Uriarte lived. Uriarte had a blank expression and smelled of alcohol. He looked worried and spoke to Fish in Spanish. Deanna Roberts, a friend of Fish\u2019s visiting at the time, understood a little Spanish and testified Uriarte was saying something about his wife. He tried to look into the apartment. Fish tried to tell him she did not understand. Uriarte left after several minutes but returned three times over the next half hour. On each occasion he asked about his wife and attempted to look into the apartment. Each time Fish and Roberts explained they did not understand him.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">John Alva was in his apartment in the same complex that evening talking with two friends, Jay and Nancy Constantino. At approximately 10 p.m., Alva responded to a knock at the door and observed Uriarte standing in the doorway. Alva had seen Uriarte around the complex periodically and had spoken with him about six times.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">When Alva first opened the door, Uriarte was wildly waving a semiautomatic pistol. He accused Alva and the Constantinos of holding his wife in a closet and of laughing at him. Alva, who spoke Spanish, responded that he didn\u2019t even know Uriarte\u2019s wife. At that point, the Constantinos got up to leave the room. Uriarte said, \u201cNobody\u2019s leaving\u201d and started shooting. Jay Constantino was shot first, followed by his wife and Alva. Both Constantinos died. Alva was shot three times before he fell. After that, Uriarte entered the apartment and shot at Alva again.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Uriarte left Alva\u2019s apartment and encountered Donald Bessette, a neighbor who was running towards Alva\u2019s apartment to investigate the shots. Bessette saw Uriarte stuff a handgun into the waistband of his pants. He appeared \u201cbewildered\u201d and \u201cconfused.\u201d Although Bessette spoke only English and Uriarte only Spanish, Bessette testified that Uriarte said to him, \u201cGo look. I shot them people.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">As Uriarte fled from the apartment complex, Thomas Eberwein was sitting in the garage of his parents\u2019 house nearby. When Eberwein heard the sounds of someone attempting to climb a chain link fence across the street, he walked down the driveway to investigate and found Uriarte moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>toward him. Uriarte slowed down and then stopped within several feet of Eberwein. Eberwein asked what was going on. Uriarte raised a pistol from his side and shot Eberwein as he tried to duck. Eberwein yelled as Uriarte started to run away. Uriarte turned, raised the pistol with both hands and pointed it at Eberwein. When Eberwein ducked behind some parked cars, Uriarte ran away without firing another shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Uriarte was caught and arrested a short distance from Eberwein\u2019s garage. He repeatedly told the deputy sheriffs making the arrest, \u201cThey abused her. They abused her.\u201d He explained to one of the deputies, \u201cI shot them because they took advantage of my wife.\u201d He also said he had used cocaine a short while ago and needed some more. A search incident to Uriarte\u2019s arrest yielded a bag with 14.8 grams of cocaine. Later at the Lemon Grove sheriff\u2019s station, Uriarte stated that the people he had shot \u201cdeserved to die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Considerable evidence was introduced concerning Uriarte\u2019s use of drugs, consumption of alcohol and bizarre behavior in the days and hours prior to the shootings. Two psychiatrists testified. Both independently concluded Uriarte was suffering from a delusional mental state at the time of the shootings caused principally by his abuse of cocaine. Such a mental state, according to the doctors, means that the subject misperceives reality. He may see things which are not there. He believes things are true which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">At the sanity phase of the trial, both doctors testified to their opinion that Uriarte was insane at the time of the shootings. The prosecution introduced no contrary medical testimony. The doctors conceded, however, that Uriarte\u2019s delusions were the product of a temporary \u201ccocaine psychosis\u201d which would generally last as long as the intoxicating effects of the cocaine. Relying on a standard CALJIC sanity phase instruction (No. 4.02)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 565, 576-577 [111 Cal.Rptr. 171, 516 P.2d 875], the prosecutor argued that any insanity attributable to Uriarte was not \u201csettled\u201d because it disappeared as the cocaine itself was dissipated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">1. <em>Honest-but-unreasonable Belief Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Uriarte requested an instruction (CALJIC No. 5.17) which would have informed the jury he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>murder if it found that as a result of his delusional mental state, Uriarte honestly but unreasonably believed the killings were necessary to prevent imminent great bodily injury to his wife.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].) The prosecutor argued that the <em>Flannel </em>principles apply only where there is some reasonable objective basis for the defendant\u2019s unreasonable belief. He asserted that an honest belief caused by voluntary intoxication does not eliminate the malice necessary for murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court ultimately refused to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Because Uriarte\u2019s theory for requesting the instruction is correct, we were initially sympathetic to his argument that the instruction should have been given. The focus of <em>Flannel </em>is that a person who honestly believes there is an imminent threat to his own life or the lives of others cannot harbor malice. Nowhere does <em>Flannel </em>suggest that only \u201creasonably unreasonable\u201d defendants may avail themselves of its rationale. A defendant\u2019s mental state is the same when he kills in the honest-but-mistaken belief that the victim was reaching for a gun whether such belief is the product of a delusion or a mistaken interpretation of the victim\u2019s reaching for his car keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">But it must be remembered that the <em>Flannel </em>honest-but-unreasonable belief doctrine, which mitigates the culpability of a homicide, derives directly from traditional common law doctrines of self-defense and defense of others which completely justify certain homicides if the defendant\u2019s belief is both honest <em>and </em>reasonable. In order to justify a homicide under these traditional principles, the defendant must have reason to believe that the danger is <em>imminent </em>and that lethal force is <em>necessary </em>to prevent death or great bodily injury. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 197, subd. 3; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) \u00a7\u00a7 239, 241-242, pp. 275-276, 277-279; CAL-JIC No. 5.12 (1989 rev.).) Consistent with its doctrinal foundations, <em>Flannel </em>recognizes that in order to warrant a conviction of manslaughter rather than murder, the defendant must honestly (if unreasonably) believe that serious injury is imminent and that lethal force is necessary. (25 Cal.3d at p. 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The evidence in this case, viewed most favorably to Uriarte, suggests the shootings of Alva and the Constantinos were motivated by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>belief that they were holding his wife Elma in a closet. While his statement, \u201cThey abused her\u201d certainly suggests a perception of physical harm, it is unclear whether he believed additional harm was imminent and would constitute great bodily injury. In any event, assuming Elma was being held in a closet in Alva\u2019s apartment and had been abused, there was no evidence that Uriarte believed it was necessary to shoot the victims in order to save Elma. We cannot overcome the fact that Uriarte fired a fourth shot at Alva after he was already incapacitated, which was hardly necessary to rescue his wife. In addition, Uriarte\u2019s shooting of Eberwein\u2014who had no even ostensible connection to Elma\u2014undercuts his defense. Absent direct testimony from Uriarte about what he was thinking or circumstantial evidence suggesting his belief in imminence and necessity, there is an insufficient basis for giving the CALJIC No. 5.17 instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In the final analysis, Uriarte\u2014who the facts show to be concededly \u201ccrazy\u201d in the colloquial sense of the term\u2014appears to fall into a legal crack between the concepts of \u201cimperfect\u201d defense of others and insanity. Under a more enlightened definition of insanity (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 333 [149 Cal.Rptr. 275, 583 P.2d 1318]) or without artificial distinctions (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at pp. 576-577, discussed <em>ante </em>at p. 196, fn. 6), Uriarte might be legally as well as colloquially insane. We are bound, however, to work within the present system with its present limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">2. <em>Sentencing </em>Discretion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Work, J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 15, 1990.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Deanna Roberts testified that after Uriarte left Jo Fish\u2019s apartment for the third time, she heard two bangs which sounded like firecrackers.

This would be so even though a reasonable person in the same situation seeing and knowing the same facts would not have had the same belief.
