Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">On April 19, 1989, Plaintiff, Grace Vaughn, filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against defendants Hugo Neu Proler International (Neu), Proler International Corporation, Neil Kerney and Jack Fletcher (Fletcher). The complaint alleged causes of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (first), intentional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1615\">*1615</page-number>negligent interference with prospective business advantage (second and third), intentional infliction of emotional distress (fourth), negligent infliction of emotional distress (fifth) and civil conspiracy (sixth).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">Defendants filed special demurrers to the first and fourth causes of action and general demurrers to all causes of action. The trial court sustained all the demurrers on the grounds stated in the demurrers. Plaintiff chose not to amend the complaint and stipulated to a dismissal of the action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2). Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal from the order granting dismissal. We affirm the dismissal of the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the fourth cause of action but reverse the dismissal of all other causes of action. In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss the correctness of the trial court\u2019s order sustaining a demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action premised on the Unruh Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Pursuant to settled case law, we assume the truth of all properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1988) 210 Cal.App.3d 1060, 1065 [243 Cal.Rptr. 196].) Plaintiff alleged that she was in the business of procuring and selling scrap metal to various scrap metal processing and distribution centers. Plaintiff entered into various oral agreements with third parties to assist her in procuring and selling scrap metal. Defendants were aware of the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">The complaint further alleged that all defendants owned and operated a scrap metal processing and distribution facility on Terminal Island. On May 29, 1985, plaintiff filed a lawsuit (L.A. Super. Ct. case No. C549491) against Neu in which it was alleged that she and other females were not permitted to enter defendants\u2019 business in order to assist in the unloading of scrap metal although men were permitted to do so. The suit sought relief under the Unruh Civil Rights Act based on Neu\u2019s discrimination against plaintiff because she was a woman. That gender discrimination action was resolved in April 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Following settlement of that lawsuit, defendants sporadically allowed plaintiff access to unwanted scrap metal at the Terminal Island facility. Defendants had scrap metal which they could not use and allowed other scrap metal dealers to enter their premises to remove the unwanted scrap metal. Eventually, in February 1989, plaintiff and persons acting on her behalf were refused access to the property to pick up the unwanted scrap metal. Defendants also refused to purchase scrap metal from plaintiff or her assistants. Persons other than plaintiff and her assistants were allowed free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1616\">*1616</page-number>egress from and ingress onto defendants\u2019 property to pick up discarded scrap metal. Persons other than plaintiff and her assistants were also allowed to pick up abandoned metal from surrounding areas and from the truck beds of other scrap metal sellers. Defendants prohibited plaintiff from entering adjoining property to pick up discarded scrap metal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">On January 20, 1989, while plaintiff was on the property adjoining defendants\u2019 premises, defendants advised the Port of Los Angeles Police Department that plaintiff was trespassing and requested that she be arrested. Nearly one month later on February 15, 1989, one of plaintiff\u2019s assistants was injured by Fletcher who was acting on behalf of the other defendants. Fletcher struck and grabbed plaintiff\u2019s assistant as he attempted to procure unwanted scrap metal from the property next to defendant\u2019s scrap metal business. Plaintiff alleged that defendants\u2019 actions were taken in retaliation for the underlying gender discrimination lawsuit filed in May 1985 by her against Neu, which had been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AjH\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">In this appeal, plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the special and general demurrers.  Where a plaintiff is given the opportunity to amend the complaint and chooses not to do so, an appellate court is required to construe the complaint strictly and to presume that the plaintiff has stated as strong a case as possible. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 621, 635 [137 Cal.Rptr. 681].) A judgment of dismissal must be affirmed if the complaint is objectionable on any ground raised by the demurrer. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">B. <em>The First Cause of Action Under the Unruh Civil Rights Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining general and special demurrers to her first cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (\u00a751 et seq.). For the reasons stated below, we conclude that both demurrers should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">1. General Demurrer</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Defendants contend that since plaintiff was not a member of a class when she filed the lawsuit in this case she has no claim under the act. They claim that they are free to discriminate against any \u201cindividual.\u201d Section 51 provides in part: \u201cAll persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1617\">*1617</page-number>national origin, or blindness or other physical disability are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.\u201d  The Supreme Court has held that the conduct that is enumerated in section 51 is illustrative rather than restrictive. <em>(In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal. 3d 205, 212 [90 CaLRptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992].) Both the language of the statute and its history \u201cdisclose a clear and large design to interdict all arbitrary discrimination by a business enterprise.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cThe act protects all persons from arbitrary discrimination . . . .\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 790, 795 [191 Cal.Rptr. 320, 662 P.2d 427].) It is not limited to a category of \u201cprotected classes.\u201d <em>(Marina Point, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wolfson </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 721, 730 [180 Cal.Rptr. 496, 640 P.2d 115, 30 A.L.R.4th 1161].) The statutory right afforded \u201call persons\u201d by section 51 is of an individual nature. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 738.) Section 51 was derived \u201cfrom the common law doctrine which imposed upon certain enterprises affected with a public interest ' \u201cthe duty to serve <em>all </em>customers on reasonable terms without discrimination.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Under this common law principle, each member of the public, as an individual, possessed the right to obtain services of such enterprises. [Citations.] [\u00b6] The rights afforded by the Unruh Act similarly are enjoyed by all persons, as individuals.\u201d (30 Cal.3d at p. 738.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Defendants urge this court to narrowly construe the language in <em>Cox </em>and <em>Marina Point </em>which hold business establishments cannot discriminate against classes of persons to mean that the statute is limited to persons who have been identified as members of a particular class. Such a construction would be inconsistent with the express language of the statute which does not limit the application of the statute to identifiable members of a particular class but includes \u201call persons.\u201d There are also numerous cases which have upheld the rights of an individual to be free from discrimination by business establishments. For example, in <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc. </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 734, 737-739 [227 P.2d 449], a case interpreting preUnruh Act civil rights statutes, the Supreme Court concluded that a person who had been convicted of gambling could not be excluded from a race track because of his allegedly immoral character. In <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Drummond Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 362, 370-372 [192 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1618\">*1618</page-number>650], the Court of Appeal determined that a person who filed a complaint with a state agency against a medical group could not be denied access to the medical facility in retaliation for having filed the complaint. In <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>English </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 125, 128-130 [133 Cal.Rptr. 20], the court held that a person who associated with Blacks could not be discriminated against because of that association. In the case of <em>In re Cox, supra, </em>3 Cal. 3d at pages 210-216, the Supreme Court held that a person who associated with a \u201chippie\u201d could not be excluded from a shopping center due to that association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Furthermore, the act is to be liberally construed with a view to effecting its object and to promote justice. (\u00a7 4; <em>Koire </em>v. <em>Metro Car Wash </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 24, 28 [219 Cal.Rptr. 133, 707 P.2d 195].) Allowing defendants to discriminate against plaintiff because she had previously filed a gender discrimination lawsuit would be contrary to the primary purpose of the act which \u201cis to compel recognition of the equality of all persons in the right to the particular service offered by an organization or entity covered by the act.\u201d <em>(Curran </em>v. <em>Mount Diablo Council of the Boy Scouts </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 712, 733 [195 Cal.Rptr. 325, 38 A.L.R.4th 607].) Having concluded that the terms and primary purpose of the Unruh Civil Rights Act were violated by defendants\u2019 alleged conduct, we now distinguish the present case from the principal authority relied upon by defendants and those cases where the act has been held inapplicable for discriminatory conduct by business enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Defendants rely on <em>Frantz </em>v. <em>Blackwell </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 96 [234 Cal.Rptr. 178], to support their contention that they could retaliate against plaintiff as an individual without violating the act. In <em>Frantz, </em>the plaintiff contended that defendant refused to sell him real estate in violation of the act. Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Frantz </em>is misplaced for two reasons. First, <em>Frantz </em>did not hold as a matter of law that a defendant could retaliate against a person for filing a complaint against defendant. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In fact, the court concluded that the allegation of retaliation which was the basis of the complaint \u201c[was] not beyond the scope of the Unruh [Civil Rights] Act simply because it [was] not included within the act\u2019s terms or court precedent.\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at p. 95.) Second, the court concluded as a matter of law that the discrimination was not arbitrary based upon the plaintiff\u2019s conduct as a real estate speculator which was revealed by the judicially noticed exhibits that were attached to the complaint. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 95-96.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">The only cases where courts have upheld discriminatory practices have been where the practice was not arbitrary, was based upon the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1619\">*1619</page-number>right to exclude a person because of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because a regulation was adopted for a rational reason which was related to services performed or services provided by the defendant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the act excluded a particular business from its coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   A business establishment may place reasonable restrictions on its customers as long as the restrictions are rationally related to the services performed and the facilities provided. <em>(O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Village Green Owners Assn., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 794; <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Monterey Club, supra, </em>111 CaI.App.3d at p. 796.)  In this case, there were no facts before the court to establish that the defendants were discriminating against plaintiff for any reason other than the fact that she had previously filed a lawsuit against them for sex discrimination. Thus, her exclusion from the premises is not rationally related to the services performed or services provided by defendants. <em>(Ibid.) </em>More importantly, exclusion solely on the basis of the previously filed lawsuit was arbitrary and unreasonable pursuant to section 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Defendants argue that since the Unruh Civil Rights Act does not specifically provide for a cause of action for retaliation they can discriminate against plaintiff by excluding her from the same privileges as the general public. California \u201ccourts have not hesitated to prohibit retaliatory exercises of broad private powers when they interfere with public policy\u201d <em>(Schweiger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 507, 515 [90 Cal.Rptr. 729, 476 P.2d 97]) notwithstanding the absence of a statutory cause of action. In <em>Schweiger, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a tenant\u2019s right against retaliatory eviction prior to enactment of section 1942.5. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>S.P. Growers Assn. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 719, 728-729 [552 P.2d 721], the Supreme Court held that a property owner may not evict a tenant in response to the filing of a suit in federal court by the tenant charging a violation of a federal law. In <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Clearman\u2019s Golden Cock Inn </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 793, 795-796 [13 Cal.Rptr. 769], the court held that an employee could not be discharged in retaliation for applying for union membership. In <em>Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 184, 188-189 [344 P.2d 25], the Court of Appeal concluded that an employee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1620\">*1620</page-number>improperly discharged for refusing to give false testimony to an Assembly committee. <em>Schweiger, S.P. Growers Assn., Glenn, </em>and <em>Petermann </em>are but a few examples of cases where California courts have prohibited the retaliatory exercise of private powers. In the present case, permitting defendants to discriminate against plaintiff in retaliation for exercising a statutory right would be contrary to public policy. Plaintiff alleged in her 1985 complaint that defendants were excluding women from the same privileges and accommodations given to men. Because she chose to challenge unlawful discrimination by filing a lawsuit to correct that illegal practice, defendants have engaged in discriminatory conduct towards her as an individual. The public has a strong interest in preventing business establishments from engaging in discriminatory practices for arbitrary reasons. When a person challenges such practices in a suit filed pursuant to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, the public has an interest in protecting that person from retaliatory conduct by the offending party. Accordingly, the general demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act claim should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">B.2.-H.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">IV.
