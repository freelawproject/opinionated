It is readily conceded that the complaint might well have been more concise, logical, and clear; but we are of the opinion that its manifest defects are not fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">In addition to the jurisdictional facts, it alleges, in effect, that at the times in question the defendant to the action was the owner of and engaged in operating a railroad from Clifton, Ariz., to Hachita, N. M. (then territories, but since become states), carrying both passengers and freight for hire over its road between the points mentioned; that at Clifton it owned and maintained as a part of its road a large number of tracks, turnouts, and switches, for the storage of cars, and for the making up of trains, which tracks and switches extended from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>the company's depot in Clifton southerly about a quarter of a mile to where die company\u2019s bridge crosses the San Francisco river; that about 800 feet north of the bridge one of the company\u2019s switches left its main track and extended a distance of about one-half mile to die smelter of the Shannon Copper Company, the grade of which switch is so steep that the engine upon which the plaintiff was engineer could haul only four of the company\u2019s cars at any one trip; that the company's main line from the bridge to the smelter switch is downgrade to such an extent that cars placed thereon, without brakes set, or without being well chocked, would not remain still, but would run to and past the switch; that at the time of the accident in question, to wit, March 15, 1911, the company had in its yards at Clifton 12 freight cars, brought from without the then territory of Arizona over its road, which were loaded with coke and merchandise and consigned to the Shannon Copper Company; that the plaintiff was then engaged as engineer of the company\u2019s switch engine used by it in moving such interstate commerce; that in moving the 12 freight cars mentioned the company, furnished the plaintiff with a crew of helpers consisting of a fireman, the yardmaster, the foreman, and two brakemen, and that, when the plaintiff and the said crew began the removal of the 12 cars, eight of them were brought down the main track to a point about 450 feet north of the bridge and 200 feet south of the smelter switch, where four of the cars were uncoupled and left on the main track, and four of them were coupled to the switch engine; that,, when the four cars were uncoupled and left at the point about 200 feet south of the switch, it became and was the duty of the three helpers left in charge of them to set the brakes thereon and securely chock and fasten them, so that they would not run down the track to the point where the plaintiff was engaged in hauling the other four of the cars onto the switch, which duties the said helpers wholly failed to perform, on account of which negligence the four cars so left standing began to move and run down the track towards the switch, which the plaintiff was entering with his engine and the four cars attached thereto, when the said foreman and one of the brakemen carelessly and wrongfully signalled the plaintiff to stop his engine, which he did within eight seconds, resulting in the tender of the engine cab in which the plaintiff was at the time sitting being struck with great force by the four cars that had been left on the main track, resulting, in the loss of one of the plaintiff\u2019s eyes and other serious bodily .injuries to him. The complaint also alleged that the company\u2019s roadbed was defective and unsafe; that the brakes on the said cars and their eoupling apparatus were out of repair and unsafe; that there were not enough brakemen furnished by the company to manage the cars, of all of which the company was well aware, and that the cars were negligently and carelessly managed and operated; and that the negligence alleged was the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">In its answer the defendant put in issue all the allegations in respect, to its negligence, and alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by his own negligence and want of care, and also set up that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>juries received by him were tlie result wholly of the ordinary risks of his employment, which risks were known to him or would have been known to him 'by the use of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> At the trial, upon the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved the court for a directed verdict in its favor, the denial of which motion constitutes one of the assignments of error. A conclusive answer to the point is that the defendant proceeded to introduce testimony in its own behalf upon the issues in the case, and did not renew the motion upon the conclusion of all of the evidence. Sigafus v. Porter, 179 U. S. 121, 21 Sup. Ct. 34, 45 L. Ed. 113; Columbia, etc., v. Hawthorne, 144 U. S. 202, 12 Sup. Ct. 591, 36 L. Ed. 405; Robertson v. Perkins, 129 U. S. 233, 9 Sup. Ct. 279, 32 L. Ed. 686; Grand Trunk Railway v. Cummings, 106 U. S. 700, 1 Sup. Ct. 493, 27 L. Ed. 266; American Smelting Co. v. Karapa, 173 Fed. 607, 97 C. C. A. 517, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The ruling of the trial court refusing to permit the defendant to introduce the testimony of two witnesses\u2014Kelly and Kline\u2014is also assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In respect to Kelly, the record shows that the defendant asked the witness whether the plaintiff was a careful or negligent man in the operation of his engine in switching cars, and whether he knew of any instances prior to the accident and within the space of two years where he was negligent in the operation of his engine in respect to obeying signals, and offered to show by the witness that the plaintiff for two years previous to the accident in question \u201cwas habitually careless and negligent in obeying signals given him while operating his engine in switching cars in the yards of the defendant\u201d; and of the witness Kline the defendant asked the question, \u201cDo you know his (plaintiff\u2019s) general reputation as to being a safe and conservative engineer, or as to his reputation of being a reckless engineer in the operation of his engine?\u201d objections to all of which the court sustained, to which rulings the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">We think the rulings right. So far as concerns the signals, the evidence showed that the plaintiff strictly obeyed the signals given him in the instance in question by stopping his engine within eight seconds after receiving it, resulting in the injuries complained of, and we find nothing in the evidence to the contrary. Whether he failed to obey some other signal at some other time was manifestly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In 29 Cyc. 619, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">\u201cBy the weight, of authority evidence of plaintiff\u2019s habits and usual conduct as to a particular act, or of his character for prudence or recklessness, is not-admissible on the question of contributory negligence\u201d\u2014citing numerous cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">See, also, Id. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">In 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Eaw (2d Ed.) 518, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-12\">\u201cIt is a general rule that in an action for negligence evidence is not admissible of other independent and disconnected acts of negligence as going to show negligence in the case at bar. It is fundamental, indeed, that evidence of any alleged negligent act or omission which could not by any possibility have contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries should not be received. But where, though an act or omission may in a sense be collateral, yet from it an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>fornico of fact inay be drawn bearing upon the particular act or omission alleged to be negligent, and from which the injuries resulted, evidence thereof is not Incompetent. And so where the injuries complained of resulted from the combined or concurrent effect of the acts of several parties, evidence of the negligent act of each, performed independently of the others, is admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">See, also, Missouri, K. &amp; T. Railway Co. v. Johnson, 92 Tex. 380, 48 S. W. 568; 6 Thompson on Negligence, \u00a7 7792.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The refusal of the court below to admit in evidence the deposition of the plaintiff\u2019s physician\u2014Dr. Dietrich\u2014is assigned as error. That deposition, while printed in the transcript, is not included in the hill of exceptions, or in any way made a part of the record of the case, and is not, therefore, for our consideration. In Russell v. Ely, 2 Black, 575, 580 (17 L. Ed. 258), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">\u201cWhat purports to bo the entire deposition of Baker is sent up by the clerk of the District Court, and is printed in the record before us, and if properly before us might sustain the exception; but this deposition is not incorporated1 in the bill of exceptions, nor so referred to in it as to be made a part of the record of the case. It is only a useless incumbrance of the transcript, and an expense to the litigating parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">That case was cited with approval by the same court in United States v. Copper Queen Mining Co., 185 U. S. 495, 498, 22 Sup. Ct. 761, <em>46 </em>L. Ed. 1008. See, also, Alaska Commercial Co. v. Dinkelspiel, 126 Fed. 164, 61 C. C. A. 108; Boatmen\u2019s Bank v. Trower Bros. Co., 181 Fed. 809, 104 C. C. A. 314; Star Co. v. Madden, 188 Fed. 910, 110 C. C. A. 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\"><bracketnum>\u00a1 S ]</bracketnum> The defendant company also sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Stark, an oculist, who was called to examine the plaintiff\u2019s eyes, and upon objections of counsel for the latter the court excluded his testimony upon the ground that such examination and the attending communications between the physician and patient were privileged, to which ruling the defendant excepted, and here assigns it as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">A statute of Arizona provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">\u201cA physician or surgeon cannot bo examined without the consent of his patient as to any communication made by his patient with reference to any physical or supposed physical disease, or any knowledge obtained by personal examination of such patient; Provided, that if a person offer himself as a witness and voluntarily testify with reference to such communications, that is to be deemed a consent to the examination of such physician-or attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Such statutes are designed to protect the patient, and should be liberally construed to that end. Underhill on Crim. Evid. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 179, p. 341; 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Eaw (2d Ed.) pp. 83, 84, 85, and numerous cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">It is contended on behalf of the plaintiff in error that \u201cDr. Stark was employed and paid by the defendant company for the purpose of being advised of the condition of the patient\u2019s eye at the date of examination\u201d; and such appears from the evidence to have been the fact. But the trial court found that the plaintiff did not know the real purpose of the calling in of Dr. Stark, but believed that the latter\u2019s services were engaged for his, plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and as his physician in connection with Dr. Dietrich. The record contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>large amount of testimony on that point which is inore or. less conflicting\u2014there being some inconsistency in the testimony of the plaintiff himself, as will be seen from this excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">\u201cQ.

Didn\u2019t Dr. Dietrich tell you the company wanted an examination made for their information as to your condition, and didn\u2019t you so understand it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-36\">\u201cMr. Kearney: We object to that as a privileged communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-37\">\u201cThe Court: I overrule the -objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201cThe Witness: I told Dr. Dietrich about it, and he tried to examine it himself, and then he made the date with Dr. Stark a few days afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-4\"><em>\"Q. </em>Didn\u2019t you understand it was for the information of the company to find out what the condition of your eye was? A. I supposed that was the object\u2014very likely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">\"Q. You understood when the examination was made that it was for the purpose of getting information for tlie company? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">\"Mr. Ivibhcy: Now, we think it is competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">\"Tlie Court: That answer is contradictory to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\"Air.

Seabury: However, we also claim that his direct examination shows much more facts and circumstances in connection with the matter than the mere answer to that one question, and I think from the witness\u2019 testimony, both under cross and direct examination, that it is perfectly clear that lie thought Dr. Dietrich called Dr. Stark as a consulting physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">\u201cAir. Kibbey: I think it is quite obvious to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">\u201cAir. Seabury: We differ in regard to tlie inferences to be drawn from the evidence.

What did you understand w\u00e1s tlie object of this examination of your eye? A. To know whether it was injured or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-15\">\"Q. What difference did it make whether it was injured or not, in your judgment? A. It would make a whole lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-16\">\u201cQ. In what way? A. From good sight to blindness\u2014I wanted that information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-17\">\u201cQ. Who wanted it? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-18\">\u201cQ. You wanted it? A. I wanted to know the condition of it. When I reported to Dr. Dietrich, he said they had no oculist, and that they would get one, and then 1 left the thing to Dr. Dietrich, and when they made the appointment I appeared there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-19\">\u201cAir. Seabury: We think that makes it too clear, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-20\">\"The Court: i think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">The real purpose, as practically conceded by counsel for the plaintiff in error, of Dr. Stark\u2019s examination of the plaintiff being to obtain information to be used against any claim on his part for damages, good faith required that the plaintiff should have been frankly told that Dr. Stark came as the representative of the company, and not left to infer that he came as his own physician, as he very well might from the statement of Dr. Dietrich, according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, that he needed an oculist to consult with.

Thomas, 152 Fed. 365, 81 C. C. A. 491, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">We therefore think the court below was right in excluding the testimony of the witness in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> There are various assignments of error in respect to giving and refusal to give certain instructions to the jury which we are precluded from considering for the reason that exceptions thereto were not seasonably taken. The record shows that, after the jury had been instructed and retired in charge of the bailiffs, certain exceptions were taken by counsel for the respective parties, and the record shows that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-24\">\"Before the jury retired to consider of their verdict that the court granted permission to the defendant to embody in its bill of exceptions, if it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>tender one, its objections to the instructions of tbe court to tbe jury more at length and in detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">That none of such exceptions can be here considered was distinctly decided by this court in the case of Western Union Tel. Co. v. Baker, 85 Fed. 690, 29 C. C. A. 392, and has been so held by many other federal courts. See the numerous cases cited in that last mentioned, and in Star Co. v. Madden, 188 Fed. 910, 110 C. C. A. 652, where is set out the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in Phelps v. Mayer, 15 How. 161, 14 L. Ed. 643, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">\u201cIt has been repeatedly decided by this court that it must appear by the transcript, not only that the instructions were given or refused at the trial, but also that the party who complains of them excepted to them while the jury were at the bar. The statute of Westminster II, which provides for the proceeding by exception, requires, in explicit terms, that this slioulu be done, and if it is not done, the charge of the court, or its refusal to charge as requested, form no part of the record, and cannot be carried before the appellate court by writ .of error. It need not be drawn out in form and signed before the jury retire; but it must be taken in open court, and must appear, by the certificate of the judge who authenticates it, to have been so taken. Nor is this a mere formal or technical provision. It was introduced and is adhered to for purposes of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> There remains to consider only the objections to the amount of the judgment. The plaintiff in error contends that the judgment of the court below is erroneous in that by it the plaintiff is allowed interest on the amount of the verdict from the' date of the judgment, and cites in support of the point the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in the case of White et al. v. United States, 202 Fed. 501, which decision does not at all support the contention. That was an action for damages for the cutting and conversion of timber from the lands of the government, and in which the jury by its verdict allowed interest from the date of the conversion to the date of the trial of the case\u2014a period of 13 years. The Court of Appeals, in disposing of the case, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cTbe oral charge of the court is set out in the bill of exceptions in its entirety, and contains no reference to the question of interest. Interest in actions of tort in the federal courts is not allowable as a matter of right; \u2022 but its allowance, as part of plaintiff\u2019s damages, is discretionary with the jury. Eddy v. Lafayette, 103 U. S. 458-467, 16 Sup. Ct. 1082, 41 L. Ed. 225.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">\u201cThe jury were not instructed by the court below that they possessed any such discretion, and probably included interest in their verdict upon the idea that the plaintiff was entitled to it as a matter of right, and not of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">\u201cIt is true the plaintiffs in error do not assign error because of this omission of the court; but a plain error may be noticed by us, and in the absence of any assignment.' In view of the long and unexplained delay on the part of the government in instituting the suit, we feel that a proper exercise of discretion by the jury would have denied the plaintiff interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">The case of Eddy v. Lafayette, 163 U. S., there cited, is. however, authority for the approval of the judgment of the court below in the present case in allowing interest from the date of the judgment. See pages 461-467 of 163 U. S., 16 Sup. Ct. 1082, 41 L. Ed. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> Under the well-established rule prevailing in the federal courts,-, the question of the amount of damages awarded the plaintiff is not for our consideration. Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co. v. Behymer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>189 U. S. 469, 23 Sup. Ct. 622, 47 L. Ed. 905; Western Gas Construction Co. v. Danner, 97 Fed. 883, 890, 38 C. C. A. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><bracketnum>[9]-</bracketnum> The statute of Arizona entitled \u201cAn act securing compensation for injuries to workmen and their dependents received while engaged in dangerous and hazardous service, and providing remedies therefor,\u201d approved June 8, 1912 (Session Daws of Arizona 19.12, p. 23 [Sp. Sess.]), and relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff in error, having been passed long subsequent to plaintiff\u2019s injuries, has no application to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">It results from what has been said that the judgment of the court below must be, and it is accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
