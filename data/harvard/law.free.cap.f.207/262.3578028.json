There was a motion to quash the writ of summons in that court. This motion was overruled with leave to plead. The ease w as then removed to the District Court for ihe District of Maryland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-4\">The statement of facts by the learned judge who heard the case below is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff sues the defendant for an alleged breach of contract by which tiie plaintiff became general agent for the defendant. The plaintiff will be called the \u2018agent,\u2019 the defendant the \u2018company.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">\u201cThe declaration sets forth the agreement in full. By it, the agent became general agent of the company, for the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. In that territory he was to appoint all agents or subagents. His compensation was to be 32% per cent, on all premiums, less return premiums and re-insurances, collected for all business written within the territory for account of Hie company. Many of ihe expenses of the agency were to lie paid by the agent, others by the company. The agent was to give bond for ,\u00b6&gt;20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">\u201cThe contract provided: \u2018It is understood and agreed that this contract shall continue in force after approval of said bond for ten years from ihe date hereof. * S: * It is further agreed that said company reserves the right to cancel this contract if at any time after the first year, or any year thereafter, the losses and expenses exceed the receipts for two consecutive years.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-9\">\"The agent agreed to make certain daily and monthly reports and to remit at ihe times and in the manner prescribed in the agreement. This agreement was dated May 31, 1910. The agent gave the bond and entered on the discharge of his duties under tlle agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-10\">\u201cThe declaration alleges that on the 4th of August, 1911, the company wrote him that the board of directors, after thoroughly analyzing his account and business sent to the company, found that the same had produced a very heavy fire loss and for that reason the board had determined to ask him not to send any new business or renewals from the date of tlie receipt of the letter. excepting risks of the preferred class. He was directed to decline all special hazards and outside unprotected risks. The letter said: \u2018You are familiar with the excess losses which your territory has produced, and as a matter for our own protection we are forced to demand a more limited classification. You are also aware that the company cannot be reasonably expected to maintain an agency plant at a state that is producing such excessive losses. We desire as far as within our power to minimize the losses and ask your hearty co-operation and trust: you will agree with us and work to attain the end desired.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-11\">\u201cThe declaration says that the company thereafter declined, to accept policies of insurance, whether the class known as new business or renewal, written by the agent and forwarded to the company, and from the time of such letter ihe company wrongfully refused to permit the agent to perform said contract. It alleges the readiness and willingness of the agent to have performed it. It says that the action of the company in'refusing to accept from the agent tlie insurance' policies, oilier than risks of the preferred class, amounted to a breach of tlie contract to the damage of the agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">\"The company for a first plea said that the contract was by mutual agreement rescinded, and set. forth in the plea certain correspondence which had passed between the agent and the company. From this correspondence it appears that the agent, through his attorneys, on the 10th of August, declined to admit the right of the company to limit in tlie manner attempted the business he might do. He notified the company that until further informed he should continue to write business as theretofore. On the 23d day of August he again wrote through his attorneys. \u2019These gentlemen said that they had advised the agent that the demand to restrict his future business.to the preferred class and the company's subsequent refusal to retain insurance written by the agent for risks other than the preferred class was practically a nullification of his contract of agency and entitled him to rescind the contract and to demand the return of the consideration therefor ns well as compensation for the losses he lias sustained. They add: 'By reason of this breach of contract by our company in manner indicated, Mr. Wolfe has concluded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rescind the same and we hereby notify you of his rescission thereof and demand on his behalf a return of the consideration therefor as well as full compensation for his expenditures and losses.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">\u201cThey further say that they had instructed the agent that owing to the breach of contract by the company he was not to make his monthly remittances as agent until che matter was adjusted. They added that in order to minimize the company\u2019s loss as much as possible he would, until further notice, without waiving any of his rights, continue to forward such business as may be forthcoming until the company could make such other arrangements as it saw fit to care for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">\u25a0 \u201cOn the 26th of August the company replied through its attorneys. In that letter they said, \u2018We accept your notice of such rescission.\u2019 The agent was notified not to write any further business. They said that if the agent did not make his monthly remittances as agent in accordance with the terms of the contract now rescinded by him suit would be brought upon his bond. In another letter addressed to the agent and written on the same day as the last, viz., August 26, 1911, he was told that the company accepted notice of his rescission of the contract \u2018which, in accordance with your election, we now tteat as terminated.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">\u201cThe company\u2019s second plea alleged full performance by it and breach by the agent. On the second plea the agent joined issue, and to the first plea he replied that from the correspondence contained in the company\u2019s first plea and from the additional letters reproduced in the agent\u2019s replication it did not appear that there was any joint concurrence by the parties to the said contract under which the same was by mutual agreement rescinded. These additional letters consist of a letter from the agent\u2019s attorneys to the company under date of September 8, 1911, in\" which they demanded $25,000 damages and loss sustained by the agent by reason of breach by the company of its contract with him. $5,000 of this is the amount, required of the agent for the purchase of stock in the company in order to obtain the general agency. $20,000 was the estimated loss of profits on business written and. to be written during the life of the contract if it had not been broken. In reply to this letter the company\u2019s attorneys under date of September 11, 1911, explained that \u2018the losses of the company had become so great and were increasing so rapidly that the oflicers of the company called together the directors from the different parts of the state * * * to consider what could be done to reduce these losses and protect the interests of the company, both of the policyholders and the stockholders.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-8\">\u201cThe directors \u2018decided that the interest of the company imperatively demanded that steps be taken at once to curtail the losses, and with this end in view, and this only, they decided that in those states where the business had been unprofitable and where the losses had been so great, they would, at least for the time being, instruct their agents to eliminate the unprofitable business and take only such risks as the company might safely carry.\u2019 They stated that the agent \u2018seemed to take the view that this was an assault upon his contract, and through you, as we understand the communication, he threw up the contract, and .the company, through us, accepted the resignation and has since then been proceeding on the basis of his being no longer a general agent of this company.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">\u201cIn reply under date of September 19, 1911, the attorneys for the agent write, among other things, that the business \u2018he handed in to jmur company was such business as was done by all insurance companies in the ordinary course of insurance business, and that when you cut him down and limited him to the character of insurance which you required him to take, his business was practically gone and that he would not realize enough from it to pay his office rent, much less the many other expenses of the same. From this viewpoint we have advised Mr. Wolfe that the action on the part of your company was a rescission of the contract and he accepted the same as a rescission and a violation of the terms of the contract which would entitle him to substantial damages for such violation.\u2019 \u2018If we are correct in this view, Mr. Wolfe will be entitled to repayment of the $5,000 consideration _and also to such, damages as he may have sustained measured by the profits which he might have made during the continuance of the agreement.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u201cOn September 27th the attorneys for the company answered. They said, among other things: \u2018If we understand your position, it is that Mr. Wolfe is entitled to a repayment of the consideration which he paid for stock in the \u201ccompany\u201d; but you do not say whether he still owns the stock, nor do you offer to return it to the company. We would like, therefore, to know definitely whether Mr. Wolfe still owns this stock, or whether he has disposed of it, and what ho considers the stock worth. We do not understand that, in any, event, lie would bo entitled to receive back the consideration, even if he should return, or offer to return, the stock. It was a reasonable requirement on the part of the company, in appointing its general agents, that they should have a substantial interest in the company by owning stock, and Mr. Wolfe certainly could not claim that he could throw up his agency because of a real or fancied grievance, and then cancel his stockholding and recover back the money he had paid for it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">\u201cOn October 7th the agent\u2019s attorneys answered that they had taken it for granted that the proposition made by them that the $5,000 should be returned to the agent included a return by him of the stock. This letter stated that the suit would be brought in a few days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">\u201cThe company demurred to this replication. It says that at the time suit was brought the contract had been rescinded by mutual consent. The agreement had so far ceased to exist that no actiom could be maintained upon it. The agent denies that what passed between the parties amounted to a rescission. He does not question that he in so many words told the company that he had elected to rescind the contract and the company expressly said that it accepted such rescission. He does claim, however, that all that in fact happened was that he offered to rescind upon terms that the company could not accept the offer otherwise than upon such terms, and that it never did assent to the latter. If so the rescission never became effective. The contract still remained in force. The correspondence does not suggest that the agent thought that in telling the company that he had elected to rescind he supposed he was making it an offer. Quite clearly he conceived himself to be exercising a legal right which under the circumstances as he saw them was absolute. Having so elected, he made demand upon the company for those things to which in consequence of his choice he felt he ha d become entitled. The company in effect replied: \u2018We assent to your rescission ol' the contract. We do not think that your view of what follows from such action is in all respects correct* If he had chosen, the agent might,thereupon have safely acted upon the assumption that the contract was at an end. The company would not have been heard to say, \u2018We did not assent to your rescission of the contract because we expressed our nonconcurrcnce in your understanding of the legal consequences which it entailed.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">The court below sustained the defendant\u2019s first plea and also the demurrer to the declaration upon which final judgment was entered in favor of the defendant, and the ease comes here on writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-7\">T.

Therefore, in the absence of an express agreement on the part of the company to the contrary, it would be unreasonable to hold that it, was the intention of the defendant \u25a0company in this instance to issue policies of every class whatsoever and not reserve unto itself the right to restrict those to be issued to' a particular class in the event it should in the future appear that the issuance of policies of a certain class would result disastrously, and thereby impair the financial ability of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We are therefore of the opinion that the ruling of the court below as respects this phase of the question was eminently proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> However, it is also insisted by counsel for defendant that'the contract in this case has been rescinded, and that therefore in no event would an action lie for an alleged breach thereof, and, even if the contract was broken by the defendant, still the plaintiff would not have a cause of action for the breach thereof, because the plaintiff in the first instance elected not to sue for the breach, but to rescind the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The court below in referring to this phase of the question said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">\u201cAt the time the correspondence began the agent thought that the company had broken its contract. If that were so, he had a right, if he would, to treat the contract as still alive and to sue for the damages he had suffered by its breach. He was not required to do so. He might, if he preferred, rescind it. If he did the latter, he could demand back the consideration he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>paid, repayment of money laid out by liim and compensation upon a quantum meruit for tlie services lie liad rendered. If he elected to treat the contract in force, by suing for damages for Its breach, lie could not ask for the return of the consideration he had paid. The measure of damages for the breach of a contract; is tlie amount which would put the injured party in tlie same position as be would have been bad the contract been performed. He who recovers such damages is in theory of law placed in the same situation he would have been had no breach occurred. To give liim back in addition the consideration ho bad paid to induce tlie other party to enter into <em>the </em>contract would be to give him all the benefits of the contract while relieving liim from all its burdens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The court below held that the plaintiff had offered to rescind the contract, and that the defendant acquiesced therein. It appears that on the 4th day of August, 1911, the defendant company after carefully considering the situation, \u201con account of the heavy fire loss,\u201d instructed plaintiff \u201cnot to send us any new business or renewals from the date of the receipt of this letter, except risks of the preferred class, declining for us all special hazards and outside unprotected risks.\u201d Thus the plaintiff was fully informed as to the course that the defendant company had decided to pursue, and the reason therefor, and after making further inquiry by letter dated August 10, 1911, demanded the exact cause which prompted the finance committee of the defendant company to make the recommendation it did, and on August 23, 1911, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys wrote another letter, in which it was asserted that the defendant company did not have the right to fix any limitation as to the character of risks to be written, and, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u2018\u2022We have, therefore, advised him that the demand from your company to restrict his future business to the preferred class, as stated in your letter of August 4th, and its subsequent refusal <em>to </em>retain insurance written by him <em>for </em>risks other than the preferred class, as enumerated in your letter to him of August 18, 19J1, is practically a nullification of his contract of agent, amounting to a breach thereof, and entitles him to rescind the contract and demand the return of the consideration therefor as well as compensation for the losses he has sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cBy reason of this breach of contract by your company in manner indicated, Air. Wolfe has concluded to rescind same, and we hereby notify you of his rescission thereof and demand, oil his behalf, a return of the consideration therefor as well as full compensation for his expenditures and losses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">After the receipt of this letter, to wit, on the 26th day of August, 1911, the defendant company addressed a letter to the plaintiff, in which, among other things, the following language was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201cAssuming that you, as attorneys and agents for Mr. F. E. S. Wolfe, of your city, have the right to give <em>notice to the </em>International Irire Insurance Company, of Mr. Wolfe's rescission of bis contract with that company, we accept your notice of such rescission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">A similar letter was addressed to the plaintiff, and the language emploj-ed therein is such as to leave no doubt <em>as </em>to its true meaning. In the first place, the attorneys for the plaintiff clearly and concisely stated the reasons why they thought the contract should be rescinded, and then notified the defendant company that the same had been rescinded, and, in reply thereto, counsel for defendant advised the attorneys for the plaintiff that the notice of rescission had been ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>cepted, and a copy of this letter was also \u201csent to the plaintiff. Here the correspondence as respects this matter ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">If the plaintiff, when notified as to the action of his attorneys, had' felt that they had exceeded their authority in rescinding the contract, .he could have notified the defendant company that his attorneys had exceeded the scope of their authority in proposing to rescind the contract, but, instead of so doing, the plaintiff remained silent, and thereby assented to what had been done in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">An inspection of the letters and other documentary evidence in this case forces us to the conclusion that the refusal \u00f3f the defendant company to permit plaintiff to write only the preferred class of policies was considered by plaintiff as a breach of his contract, and that he then and there deliberately elected to rescind the contract and to demand the return of the consideration which he had paid in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It? was for the court below, and not the jury, to decide as to whether upon the established facts there had been a rescission of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In the case of Sea Insurance Co. v. Johnston, 105 Fed. 286, 44 C. C.. A. 477, the correspondence between the agent and the company was very much like that of the case at bar, and there the court held that the court below acted properly in deciding that the correspondence between the parties constituted a rescission of the agreement. In that case the court, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\u201cOn tire question under discussion\u2014tlie question of rescission\u2014there is no conflict in the legal evidence. It depends upon the correspondence, with nothing needed to supplement it, unless, perhaps, the conceded fact of the acceptance and collection and failure to return the check inclosed in the letter of February 21st. The Circuit Court should have granted the request of the Sea Insurance Company, and directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">When we consider the correspondence between the parties in this instance, we are clearly of the opinion that the same constitutes a rescission of the agreement, and, such being the case, it follows that an action of this character cannot be based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"ATD\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the lower \u2018court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Affirmed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
