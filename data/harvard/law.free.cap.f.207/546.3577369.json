But the general situation satisfies me that the libelant has not sustained the burden of proof by credible testimony. There is no doubt that the Superior came from the New Jersey shore and was angling over towards New York. Nor is there any doubt that the Interstate was bound downstream. Whatever the truth may be as to what happened after that, I fail to see any faint on the part of the Superior. She kept her course, as she had a perfect right to do, and as she was bound to do, and I think that the preponderance of the evidence shows that this accident happened when both the Superior on her course and the Interstate off her course, from whatever reason, were pointing in towards and were near the New York shore. Such being my conclusion, it is unnecessary to discuss the testimony concerning the steering gear of the Superior. I shall have to dismiss the libel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-13\">This cause comes here upon appeal from a decree of the District Court, Southern District of New York, dismissing a libel filed against the steam tug Superior to recover damages sustained by steam lighter No. 20 from a collision with the Superior.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-14\">Foley &amp; Martin and F.
