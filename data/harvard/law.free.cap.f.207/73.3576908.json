It was contended that while lying there she was in collision with a car\u201efloat\u2019of the dock company in tow of its chartered tug Timmins. That, while the tug was bringing the car float into the bridge of the company\u2019s slip, she first ran into the rack and then,' rebounding therefrom, struck the barge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-4\">J.

There are four witnesses who testified as to the alleged collision. They are flatly opposed to each other (two to two), with no theory which can harmonize their conflicting stories. The District Judge who saw them all states squarely that he believed two of them and, inferentially, that he did not believe the other two. We can find nothing in the record to convince us that he was mistaken in his judgment' of the value of their <em>testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
