The title to the -land is in the German Reformed and Lutheran churches. Prior to about 1860 it was used as a public burying ground, although 'the church controlled it, and might charge a fee for burying unless they saw fit to remit such charge. There have been practically <em>no </em>burials in it for possibly forty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-5\">The village council decided to appropriate this land for the purpose of erecting public buildings. Being more ground than would be required for the buildings proper, the appropriation resolution and subsequent proceedings used the following language, \u201cfor parks and public building purposes,\u201d etc., it being intended that the ground around' the buildings should be kept as incidental to the buildings, .although not to be built upon. Plaintiff claimed that this language made the proceedings involve more than one subject, and therefore illegal under the statute. The .resolution did not specify the estate to be taken and the plaintiff urged this as an error, but defendant claimed that under the present statute, which provides that an estate in fee shall be taken unless some other estate is asked, the village was entitled-to the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-6\">No certificate of the clerk -of the corporation was filed showing the money in the treasury for the appropriation. Plaintiff in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>sisted that this also was an error. Plaintiff also claimed that the village had no right to appropriate the land, because it was already used for public purposes and was in fact public property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-4\">The circuit court found all of plaintiff\u2019s objections not well founded, and that the village had the right to appropriate the land. This judgment of the circuit court was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b525-5\">Dustin, J.; Wilson, J., and Sullivan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-19\"> Affirmed by the Supreme Court without report, 79 Ohio State, \u2014\u2014,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">We think the Village of Miamisburg has the power to appropriate th\u00e9 cemetery in question for public purposes. It has not been in \u201cuse\u201d for forty years. The right of- eminent domain is sovereign, and all private and corporate realty is subject to it, except that where the right has already been exercised, and the 'property continues ip the,use for which it .was conveyed or appropriated, it can not again be taken for a different or inconsistent purpose. <em>Cemetery of Spring Grove </em>v. <em>Cin. Ry., </em>7 W. L. J., 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">- In this case it appearing that interments were- made on payment of a fee, no title to the ground being granted to individuals, the only rights acquired by the survivors were to have the bodies of their dead remain long enough for thorough decomposition, and removed to another burying ground, when the property should be used for secular purposes. <em>Windt </em>v. <em>German Reformed Church, </em>4 Sand. Chan. Rep., 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">It did not render the ordinance invalid to state several harmonious purposes for which the property was to be used. Indeed it was the. only practicable way. Should several'ordinances be passed and several actions brought to condemn different parts of the same tract? That would complicate the situation, require an unnecessary multiplicity of suits and largely increased costs for no good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The necessity for the appropriation can not be questioned except for fraud and collusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The' Burns law does not apply and could not be made to apply in advance of any knowledge as to what the premises would cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Nor was it necessary to declare the estate or interest to be acquired; for a fee simple is presumed unless a lesser estate is mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Put we think the trustees of the churches should have been individually named as such. To generally designate parties to a suit as \u201ctrustees\u201d of a. church without giving their names leaves the identification of the parties wholly to the determination of the officer 'serving the process; and there is no means of testing the correctness of the service by comparison with the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Opportunity will' be afforded, however, .to correct the condemnation proceedings' in that respect, so .as to bring the proper parties into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The case therefore will be continued for that purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
