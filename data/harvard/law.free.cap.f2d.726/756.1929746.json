To prove Heller\u2019s guilt, the government would first have to prove the maximum allowable price, which in Heller\u2019s case would be calculated by reference to the \u201cnearest comparable outlet.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(b)(3) (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government designated a particular service station, operated by the Cities Service Company (\u201cCities Service\u201d or \u201cCitgo\u201d) and located at 326 Cambridge Street, Boston, Massachusetts, as the nearest comparable outlet. The district court then granted Heller\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence regarding the comparability of his station and the Citgo station. The issue on this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that, because Heller\u2019s was an independent retail station while the Cit-go station was refiner-operated, the two outlets were not comparable as a matter of law. Because the ownership of the outlet does not determine comparability, but is merely one factor to be considered in making such a determination, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Familiarity with our earlier opinion in this case, <em>United States v. Heller, </em>635 F.2d 848 (Temp.Emer.Ct.App.1980) <em>(Heller I), </em>is assumed. Because that opinion sets out the factual background and regulatory scheme in some detail, this opinion will only set forth those facts necessary for understanding the issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Glenn Martin Heller, doing business as Beacon Hill Gulf, operated a retail gasoline station at 358 Cambridge Street, Boston, Massachusetts under lease from the Gulf Oil Corporation (Gulf), commencing on or about August 18, 1976. In August 1979, a grand jury returned an indictment charging that, between June 1 and June 14, 1979, Heller willfully sold gasoline at prices in excess of those authorized by federal regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The regulations, 10 C.F.R. Part 212, were promulgated pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(a), by the Federal Energy Office (FEO) (now Department of Energy (DOE)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They set up a system of mandatory price controls covering a number of petroleum products, including gasoline. The regulatory scheme generally uses May 15,1973, as a base price date; a seller\u2019s allowable prices are calculated by adding his increased product costs to \u201cthe weighted average price at which the item was lawfully priced by the seller in transactions with the class of purchaser concerned on May 15, 1973.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.93. A seller such as Heller, who was not in business or did not sell a particular covered product on May 15, 1973, must refer either to 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(b), the \u201cnew item\u201d rule, or to 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(c), the \u201cac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>quisition\u201d rule, in order to determine his base price.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Because of the result we reached in <em>Heller I, </em>see <em>infra </em>p. 759, the \u201cnew item\u201d rule is the only one of the two that is relevant to this appeal. That rule defines a \u201cnew item\u201d as one which \u201c[t]he firm concerned did not produce or sell ... in the same or substantially similar form- at any time during the one-year period immediately preceding the day on which the firm offers it for sale,\u201d and which \u201cis substantially different in purpose, function, quality, or technology, or its use or service effects a substantially different result from any other item which the firm concerned currently sells or sold at any time during the 1-year period immediately preceding the first date on which the firm offers it for sale.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.-111(a)(1). The rule then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">(b) <em>Base price determination</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">(1) <em>Refiners, </em>(i) A refiner in existence on May 15, 1973 which offers a new item shall determine the base price for' that item pursuant to the base price provisions of \u00a7 212.82(b). However, for purposes of determining the price at which the item was lawfully priced in transactions on May 15, 1973, the refiner shall use the average price received on May 15, 1973 for the same or most nearly similar item sold to the same market by other refiners selling the same or most nearly comparable item in the same marketing area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">(ii) A refiner coming into existence after May 15, 1973 which offers a new item shall determine the base price for that item pursuant to the base price provisions of \u00a7 212.82(b). However, for- purposes of computing the base price, the increased product costs shall be calculated using the cost of the item first offered for sale rather than the May 1973 cost for the item, and the price at which that item is priced in transactions by other refiners selling the same or most nearly comparable item in the same marketing area on the day when the item is first offered for sale shall be used rather than the May 15, 1973 selling price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-10\">(3) <em>Resellers. </em>A reseller, reseller-retailer or retailer, offering a \u201cnew item,\u201d shall for purposes of applying the price rule of \u00a7 212.93 determine the May 15,1973 selling price for that item as the price at which that item is placed in transactions at the nearest comparable outlet on the day when the item is first offered for sale....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.111(b). The parties agree that Citgo is a \u201crefiner\u201d and Heller is a \u201cretailer,\u201d as those terms are defined in 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.31.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Heller was tried before a jury on the theory that he had violated either the \u201cacquisition\u201d rule or the \u201cnew item\u201d rule. The evidence included the testimony of Fred Bernard, manager of pricing allocation for Cities Service Company, who testified as to the retail prices charged by the Citgo station at 326 Cambridge Street, Boston, during August 1976. This testimony was adduced by the government, on the assumption that the Citgo station was comparable to Heller\u2019s station, within the meaning of the \u201cnearest comparable outlet\u201d language of the new item . rule. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>submitted the case to the jury with an instruction that assumed Heller had violated one of the rules, but did not require the jury to specify which rule he had violated; the jury was asked to determine only the issues of willfulness. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">This court reversed Heller\u2019s conviction on appeal, finding that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. We held, first, that Heller was not subject to the \u201cacquisition\u201d rule, and thus could not have violated it. <em>Heller I, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 855-56. Next, we found that although Heller was subject to the \u201cnew item\u201d rule, the trial court was not entitled to find as a matter of law that he had violated it. <em>Id. </em>at 855-57. As we stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">[T]he new-item rule requires that the base price of an item that falls within its purview be determined by applying to that item the nearest comparable outlet\u2019s base price for the same item. The testimony of Bernard of Cities Service Company .. . offered by the government, was addressed to this subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-7\">The issue of comparability was a question for the jury. Regrettably, the trial court, by its instruction, removed this issue from jury consideration. To do so was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 857. The case was remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">On remand,. the government filed an amended bill of particulars specifying the Citgo outlet located at 326 Cambridge Street, Boston, as the \u201cnearest comparable outlet\u201d within the meaning of the new item rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> App. at 32. Heller then moved to dismiss the indictment on a number of grounds. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Citgo outlet was not comparable to his outlet as a matter of law, and that recent DOE administrative proceedings precluded any conviction under the indictment. In the alternative, he moved to suppress all evidence relating to the comparability of the two outlets. App. at 33-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">The administrative proceedings may be summarized as follows. On December 13, 1978, DOE served Heller with a Notice of Probable Violation (NOPV), alleging that he had overcharged his customers since August 1976. App. at 230. On December 22, 1978, DOE served him with an Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance (IROIC). <em>Id. </em>In January 1979, Heller applied for first, a temporary, and then a permanent stay, of the IROIC; DOE granted both requests. <em>Id. </em>On February 1,1979 (some six months before his indictment), Heller filed an application with DOE for retroactive and prospective relief from the pricing regulations of Part 212, pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart D. <em>Id. </em>at 221. On October 7, 1981, DOE\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) granted retroactive exception relief for the period from September 26, 1976 through July 15, 1979.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 226. Finding that \u201c[ajdherence to the price regulations [of Part 212] would have forced Heller to abandon his operation of the outlet,\u201d the OHA allowed him a maximum mark-up of 14 cents per gallon over acquisition cost, for the relevant period. <em>Id. </em>at 225. On March 8, 1982, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>sued a proposed order upholding the grant of retroactive exception relief and increasing Heller\u2019s maximum mark-up to 15.2 cents per gallon. <em>Id. </em>at 235. The order became final on August 27, 1982. <em>Id. </em>at 236 \u2014 41.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After holding an evidentiary hearing on the comparability of Heller\u2019s station and the Citgo station located at 326 Cambridge Street, App. at 59-200, the district court denied Heller\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment but granted his motion to suppress. The court\u2019s opinion discussed only two of the grounds that Heller had raised in support of his motion. First, the court considered and rejected Heller\u2019s argument that the OHA\u2019s grant of retroactive exception relief precluded any conviction under the pending indictment. Heller had argued that the exception relief barred application of the Part 212 regulations to his case; the district court held, however, that the administrative order did not automatically invalidate the criminal indictment charging Heller with violation of those regulations. <em>United States v. Heller, </em>542 F.Supp. 157, 161 (D.Mass.1982). Heller has not appealed from this ruling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The district court then turned to Heller\u2019s argument that his station and the Citgo station were not comparable as a matter of law, because the Citgo station was operated by an oil refiner (Cities Service), whereas he was an independent retailer. The court, after noting that this court had characterized the issue of comparability as a question of fact for the jury, found it \u201cnecessary ... to review the relevant regulatory scheme to determine whether it [would be] appropriate for the [district court] to address the factual arguments and evidence\u201d presented at the hearing. <em>Id. </em>The district court believed that the Part 212 regulations treated refiners and retailers differently in at least three ways.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, the court stated that the regulations governing refiners\u2019 base prices, in Part 212, Subpart E, allowed refiners to pass through to gasoline purchasers all increased costs, both those incurred in obtaining the product and those \u201cnon-product costs\u201d attributable to the sale of the product, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(c)(1); retailers, on the other hand, were governed by Part 212, Subpart F, which allowed them to pass along their increased product costs but restricted the pass-through of increased non-product costs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.93(a), (b). Second, the district court believed that the regulations gave refiners, but not retailers, \u201cthe flexibility to apportion increased cost of production or marketing <em>between </em>different products.\u201d <em>United States v. Heller, supra, </em>542 F.Supp. at 162 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, the court pointed out that a refiner could charge a different price to each \u201cclass of purchaser\u201d to whom it sold; thus, the court believed, a refiner could charge a wholly-owned dealership less than it would charge an independent retailer. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Taking all of these perceived differences into account, the court found that the regulatory scheme \u201cestablished a fundamental conceptual and practical distinction between independent retail outlets and refiner-operated outlets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. It concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">[i]n view of the significant practical effects that the differences in regulatory price treatment inevitably must have on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the operations of \u201cretailers\u201d and \u201crefiners\u201d, ... the question of whether a refiner\u2019s outlet may be considered \u201ccomparable\u201d to a station like Heller\u2019s for purposes of applying the Part 212 regulations is a legal issue to be determined by the court. In making that determination, however, it is appropriate for the court to consider the factual evidence and arguments that the parties presented concerning the \u201ccomparability\u201d issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The evidence adduced at the hearing<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> showed that the two stations were similar in many respects. The Citgo station was the outlet \u201cphysically nearest to Beacon Hill Gulf at the time Heller began his retail gasoline sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64. Heller leased his station from Gulf; Cities Service leased the Citgo station from the Jenney Manufacturing Co. <em>Id. </em>Heller\u2019s station covered an area of approximately 1,771 square feet; the Citgo station occupied approximately 3,876 square feet. <em>Id. </em>Each station contained one \u201cisland\u201d of hoses and pumps, which could accommodate up to four vehicles at a time. <em>Id. </em>Neither had the capacity to \u201cstack\u201d a significant number of cars; neither performed any repair work. <em>Id. </em>Neither sold tires, batteries, or accessories; the sale of branded gasoline was the chief source of income for both stations. <em>Id. </em>Both were intended to operate on a twenty-four-hour a day basis, but neither was operating around the clock in August, 1976.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rents paid by the two stations were approximately the same, and their expense patterns were similar. <em>Id. </em>at 164-65. Heller sold approximately 45,000 gallons per month; between July and September, 1976, the Citgo station\u2019s sales ranged from 30,000 to 52,000 gallons per month. <em>Id. </em>at 165. The major difference between the stations, and the one that proved crucial to the district court\u2019s decision, was the one already mentioned: the Citgo station was operated by a refiner, while Heller was an independent retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Two principal consequences of this distinction emerged from the testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> First, independent retailers generally paid higher prices for their gasoline than refiner-operated outlets did. Suppliers calculated their prices according to different for-mulae for different types of purchasers. Under the terms of his lease, Heller purchased his gasoline from Gulf; the district court found that, as an independent retailer, Heller paid a price known in the industry as the \u201cdealer tank-wagon price,\u201d computed by adding transportation and marketing costs to the costs of producing refined gasoline. <em>Id. </em>at 163. The Citgo station, on the other hand, obtained all of its gasoline from the parent refining company, Cities Service. The court found that the price that would be attributed to that gasoline on the books of the station and of the parent company would be set according to the \u201ctransfer replacement cost value,\u201d which included the costs of raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation of the finished product to a distribution point in Braintree, Massachusetts. <em>Id. </em>at 164. The transfer replacement cost value was generally lower than the dealer tank-wagon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>price. <em>Id. </em>Because the Citgo station paid less than Heller-did for its gasoline, the district court reasoned, it could sell its gasoline at lower prices than he could. <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The second consequence of the refiner-retailer distinction found by the district court was that Cities Service, as a vertically integrated company, could absorb retail losses for a much longer period than an independent retailer, such as Heller, could. The court relied on the testimony of Heller\u2019s expert, Maurice Langelier,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> who stated that a parent refining company, such as Cities Service, could operate a retail outlet at a loss almost indefinitely, as long as the company as a whole earned net profits. <em>Id. </em>at 165-66. The testimony of Cities Service employees Robert Clingan and Louis Chris-toudoulou<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> showed that, although retail prices were set with the goal of maximizing profits, the Citgo station at 326 Cambridge Street had in fact operated at a net loss during 1976 and 1977. An independent retailer, on the other hand, could not absorb losses for more than a month, according to Mr. Langelier. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court believed, the parent company could in effect subsidize the Citgo station, allowing it to charge lower prices than could Heller, who enjoyed no such subsidy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The district court concluded that, although the two stations were \u201csuperficially similar in some respects,\u201d they are not comparable as a matter of law because \u201cCitgo, as a refiner-operated outlet, had the opportunity to sell gasoline at lower prices than did Heller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165. Whether Citgo actually employed this advantage was \u201cirrelevant\"; what mattered was that the \u201cdisparate impact of the regulatory scheme afforded Citgo the unique opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that this disparity was so great that no reasonable jury could find the two stations \u201ccomparable,\u201d within the meaning of the new item rule. <em>Id. </em>The motion to suppress was granted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Our task is to ascertain the meaning of \u201ccomparable,\u201d under the \u201cnew item\u201d rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In construing regulations, as with statutes, we look first-to the plain meaning of the language used. <em>E.g., KCMC, Inc. v. FCC, </em>600 F.2d 546, 549 (5th Cir.1979). If that is ambiguous, we turn to the administrative interpretation of the regulation, \u201c \u2018which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Larionoff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 872, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2155, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977) (quoting <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945)), or inconsistent with the statute under which it is promulgated. <em>Id. </em>431 U.S. at 873, 97 S.Ct. at 2156. In the absence of an administrative interpretation, a court applies the normal principles of statutory construction, considering such factors as the overall purpose of the governing statute, the overall purpose of the regulation, its history, and the practical consequences of suggested interpretations in order to determine the intent of the enacting body. <em>See, e.g., New York State Commission of Cable Television </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>571 F.2d 95, 98 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>439 U.S. 820, 99 S.Ct. 85, 58 L.Ed.2d 112 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>In this case, the language of the \u201cnew item\u201d rule is not determinative. The subsection that applies to retailers, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(b)(3), states that a retailer shall use as its base price \u201cthe price at which th[e new] item is priced in transactions at the nearest comparable outlet on the day when the item is first offered for sale.\u201d Nowhere in Subpart 212 are the words \u201ccomparable\u201d or \u201cnearest comparable outlet\u201d defined. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.31 (definitions). Looked at in isolation, the term \u201ccomparable\u201d is broad enough to support either the government\u2019s or Heller\u2019s interpretation. It is worth noting, however, that the rule on its face does not limit the retailer to using the price at the nearest comparable outlet operated by a retailer. This is significant because the subsection of the rule that applies to refiners, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.111(b)(1), specifically provides that a refiner offering a new item shall use as its base price \u201cthe price at which that item is priced in transactions <em>by other refiners </em>selling the same or most nearly comparable item in the same marketing area on the day when the item is first offered for sale\u201d (emphasis added). The DOE\u2019s use of such a specific limitation in a related portion of the \u201cnew item\u201d rule reflects that the agency knew how to restrict \u201ccomparability\u201d to a particular market level when it intended to do so, and weighs in favor of the conclusion that the agency, in promulgating subsection 3 of the rule, did not intend to limit the \u201cnearest comparable outlet\u201d to one operated by a retailer. <em>See FTC v. Sun Oil Co., </em>371 U.S. 505, 514-15, 83 S.Ct. 358, 364, 9 L.Ed.2d 466 (1963); <em>Heller I, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 855 n. 12 (\u201cWhere particular language is used in one section but not another, the term or its equivalent should not be implied where excluded\u201d); <em>KCMC, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, supra, </em>600 F.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The parties have not cited, nor has our research disclosed, any administrative interpretation of the term \u201cnearest comparable outlet.\u201d Heller attempts to argue that the FERC, in granting him retroactive exception relief, recognized that his service station was unique; thus, Heller asserts, his outlet could not be \u201ccomparable\u201d to the Citgo station (or to any other station, if the argument is taken to its logical extreme). This argument is not supported by the agency\u2019s decision, however. The administrative proceedings dealt only with Heller\u2019s allowable mark-up, which was governed by 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.93. It is true that the allowable mark-up is calculated with reference to the base price; but the DOE (despite its recognition that the new item rule applied to Heller) used the price charged by the previous operator of Beacon Hill Gulf on May 15, 1973 as Heller\u2019s base price. App. at 225 &amp; n. 1. Thus, the agency did not even consider the issue of Comparability-</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Finding the rule\u2019s language ambiguous, and receiving no administrative guidance, we turn to the regulation\u2019s history and purpose. The history of the \u201cnew item\u201d rule, like its language, is inconclusive. The \u201cnearest comparable outlet\u201d language can be traced through the rule\u2019s predecessor regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 150.36(b)(3) (effective November 2, 1973, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 150.-359(b) (promulgated August 22,1973), all of which use the phrase. The mere repetition of the phrase, however, sheds no light on its meaning. The August 22, 1973 regulation is ultimately traceable to one of the Cost of Living Council\u2019s Phase II regulations, 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.509, which required a new market entrant (in any sector of the economy) to use as his initial price \u201cthe average prices received in a substantial number of arm\u2019s length transactions by persons selling or leasing a comparable property or services in the same market area.\u201d This language, with its emphasis on the nature of the property or service sold, rather than the nature of the seller, provides only slight support for the government\u2019s argument; the connection between this regulation and the new item rule is attenuated since 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.509 did not refer specifically to petroleum sellers and almost certainly was not drafted with the refiner-retailer distinction in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The district court\u2019s opinion was based on the overall structure of the regulatory scheme, and in particular on the different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>pricing rules for refiners and retailers. It is true that refiners calculated their allowable price increases in accordance with Part 212, Subpart E, whereas retailers were governed by Subpart F. The differences between the two sets of rules are not as great, however, as the district court believed. It is not true, for example, that refiners could allocate increased costs of gasoline to any product other than gasoline. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.83(d)(4).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor were refiners required to distinguish between dealers who leased their stations and those who did not', in setting their prices. Federal Energy Agency Ruling 75-2, on which the district court relied in part, merely provides that where price differentials existed on May 15, 1973, the \u201cclass of purchaser\u201d concept, 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.31, requires a seller to perpetuate those differences, in passing through increased products costs. Retailers, as well as refiners, were governed by this ruling. <em>See </em>10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.93(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Moreover, the regulatory scheme\u2019s differing provisions for sellers at different levels of the marketing and distribution chain were all intended to serve the same purposes. The Act requires that the pricing regulations shall provide, <em>inter alia, </em>for \u201cpreservation of an economically sound and competitive petroleum industry\u201d at all levels, including \u201cthe producing, refining, distribution, marketing, and petrochemical sectors of [the] industry,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b)(1)(D); for \u201cequitable distribution of crude oil, residual fuel oil, and refined petroleum products at equitable prices among all ... sectors of the petroleum industry,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 753(b)(1)(F); for \u201ceconomic efficiency,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 753(b)(1)(H); and for \u201cminimization of economic distortion, inflexibility, and unnecessary interference with market mechanisms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 753(b)(1)(I). In order to achieve these goals, prices were frozen as of May 15,1973 and sellers were allowed to increase their prices only to reflect increased costs. The statute makes clear that the basic framework of the price control system was to be the same for all types of sellers. <em>See </em>id. \u00a7 753(b)(2)(A), (C). Although the details of Subpart E and F varied in order to take account of the different cost structures at two different levels within the petroleum industry, the overall effect was to be the same. So, too, the \u201cnew item\u201d rule, which provides a substitute for a seller\u2019s own' May 15, 1973 price where none is available, contains separate provisions for refiners and resellers, but intends to achieve the same result for members of both groups: i.e., to place the seller in the position it would have occupied if it had been selling the item in question on May 15, 1973. The fact that the drafters of the regulation explicitly limited refiners to consideration of other refiners\u2019 prices but did not limit resellers to prices charged by other resellers strongly suggests that the drafters of the regulation did not intend to remove a refiner-operated outlet from the consideration of the reseller, the DOE, or (in this case) the jury. <em>See supra </em>p. 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">We conclude that the identity of the seller is only one factor to be considered, along with other factors, including the outlet\u2019s location, its size, and the services it offers. This result is consistent with the statute\u2019s purposes. A corner gas station sells at the retail level, whether it is operated by a refiner or a retailer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Since the market level is the same, there is no reason why a refiner-operated station cannot be \u201ccomparable\u201d to a retailer-operated one, for the limited purpose of determining what the retailer\u2019s price would most likely have been if the retailer had been selling the item on May 15, 1973. The practical consequences of this interpretation also appear preferable: a new retailer can readily determine his reference price from stations nearby; the nature of the ownership is not so easily ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that the comparability issue is a question of fact, to be determined by the jury, under appropriate instructions from the trial court. For example, if Heller should prove that the Citgo station by reason of its status, actually enjoyed and used an opportunity to sell gasoline at lower prices than Heller could, and if the jury believes that this evidence outweighs other evidence which may tend to prove that the two stations are comparable, then the jury would be entitled to find that the Citgo station is not the \u201cnearest comparable outlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The order of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">.
