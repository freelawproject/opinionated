Ultimately deportation proceedings were commenced, and petitioner conceded deport-ability. He was granted the privilege of voluntary departure, but failed to depart. Passing over various other matters, petitioner later filed a motion to reopen and suspend deportation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d primarily because in Colombia he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>would be subject to political persecution. This was denied by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In July, 1983, petitioner filed a second motion to reopen and suspend deportation, this, time concentrating on hardship because of his wife\u2019s health. She, unlawfully in this country since coming here in 1978, is deportable, has not been here the requisite seven years under section 1254(a)(1), and is not herself a petitioner. The children, likewise, do not qualify for relief. The Board correctly noted, \u201cAny hardship on them is therefore relevant only insofar as it intensifies the hardship to [petitioner.]\u201d Much argument in petitioner\u2019s brief that his deportation would effect a family separation is misplaced. His motion was denied without a hearing, and petitioner seeks review.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The basis of the second motion to reopen was a letter from a psychologist who had interviewed petitioner and his wife and who had found that petitioner \u201cevidences no signs of major mental illness,\u201d but who had formed the opinion that Mrs. Mesa\u2019s being forced to return to Colombia had the \u201cpotential\u201d for serious consequences for her mental and emotional health, and might result in similar problems for the children, and that \u201cthe clinical literature does suggest that the Mesas are prime candidates for adverse reaction.\u201d In a memorandum extensively reviewing the claims, the Board concluded that petitioner \u201chas failed to set forth additional or new facts, which individually or in the aggregate establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief under section 244(a)(1) of the Act. See <em>INS v. Wang </em>[450 U.S. 139, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981)]....\u201d It denied the motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Petitioner\u2019s principal contention here is that the letter established a prima facie case of extreme hardship; that he therefore was entitled to a hearing, and that the Board committed error by judging the allegations without one. The INS responds that none of the asserted evidence was newly discovered, as it was required to be, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, in any event, the Board was warranted in denying the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">With respect to section 3.2, even the psychologist acknowledged that Mrs. Mesa had been under treatment for twenty years. Petitioner states that he did not present the medical testimony before because he had a \u201cfirm conviction that favorable action would be taken on their [first] appeal.\u201d Rather than an answer, this is a confession of violation. In addition, petitioner, for the first time, asserts that the loss of the first reopening \u201cprecipitated\u201d his wife\u2019s condition. Passing the fact that this claim goes beyond the doctor\u2019s letter and was not argued to the Board, petitioner has seemingly invented perpetual motion, or, more exactly, perpetual immobility. If he wins the case, well and good. If he loses, the pain of losing furnishes a hardship ground for winning the next time. There would be no end to this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Even if petitioner cleared the \u201cnew facts\u201d hurdle, however, we find no error in the Board\u2019s denial. The pertinent regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.8,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires for reopening a recitation of \u201cparticular facts\u201d which the Court in <em>Wang </em>construed to mean \u201creliably indicating the specific recent events that would render deportation a matter of extreme hardship.\u201d 450 U.S., ante, at 143,101 S.Ct. at 1030. In footnote 5, pp. 143-144, 101 S.Ct. pp. 1030-1031, the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">\u201c.... The present regulation is framed negatively; it directs the Board not to reopen unless certain showings are made. It does not affirmatively require the Board to reopen the proceedings under any particular condition. Thus, the regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>lations may be construed to provide the Board with, discretion in determining under what circumstances proceedings should be reopened. See <em>Villena v. INS, </em>622 F.2d 1352 (CA9 1980) (en banc) (Wallace, J., dissenting). In his dissent, <em>Judge Wallace stated that INS had discretion beyond requiring proof of a prima facie case:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\"><em>\u2018If </em>INS discretion is to mean anything, it must be that the INS has' some latitude in deciding when to reopen a case. The INS should have the right to be restrictive. Granting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case. It will also waste the time and efforts of immigration judges called upon to preside at hearings automatically required by the. prima facie allegations.\u2019 Id., at 1362.\u201d (Emphasis suppl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">More recently, in <em>INS v. </em>Phinpathya,U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 584, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984) the Court referred to <em>Wang </em>as \u201crejecting] a relaxed standard for evaluating the \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 as impermissibly shifting discretionary authority from INS to the courts,\u201d-U.S. ante at-, 104 S.Ct. at 592, and, further, in footnote 6 stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201c.... Although respondent has filed a motion with BIA asking that her deportation proceeding be reopened, granting of the motion is entirely within BIA\u2019s discretion. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 (1983); <em>INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 143-144, 144, and n. 5 [101 S.Ct. 1027, 1030-1031, 1031, and n. 5, 67 L.Ed.2d 123] (1981).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">We read this to mean that the court must accept the Board\u2019s decision to reject even a prima facie case without a hearing unless we find its action to be arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">Petition denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-16\">. \u00a7 1254. <em>Suspension of deportation </em>\u2014 adjust<em>ment of status for permanent residence; con- tents.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">(a) As hereinafter prescribed in this section, the Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation and adjust the status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, in the case of an alien who applies to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-18\">(1) is deportable under any law of the United States except the provisions specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection; has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application, and proves that during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character; and is a person who deportation would, in the opinion of the Attorney General, <em>result in extreme hardship to the alien or tp his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States </em>or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence; .... \u201d (Emphasis suppl.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. \u00a7 3.2 <em>Reopening or reconsideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\"><em>\u201c.... </em>Motions to reopen in deportation proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.... \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-13\">.
