He appealed. In response to trial counsel\u2019s motion, this court appointed a different attorney to represent Bentley on appeal and instructed that \u201cappellant\u2019s brief [include] a discussion addressing [1] whether the defendant\u2019s oral confession was properly admitted when it was apparently given in the absence of counsel after the defendant had already exercised his right to have counsel present; [2] whether any objection to the admission of the oral confession was waived by the defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to [its] admission...; and [3] whether .the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel particularly as his assistance related to the taking and admission of defendant\u2019s oral confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-18\">The only evidence of the circumstances surrounding -defendant\u2019s oral confession is the trial testimony of FBI Special Agent Williams. Agent Williams described a series of conversations he had with Bentley at the Hamilton County Jail in Cincinnati where Bentley was being held on a state bank robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-19\">Prior to the first of these interviews, Williams testified he contacted Bentley\u2019s state court attorney \u2014 later his federal court trial attorney \u2014 Mr. Osborne, explained that he wanted to talk to Bentley about \u201chis involvement in several bank robberies,\u201d and arranged a time when they could both meet with Bentley. On March 31, 1980, Williams and Osborne sat down with the defendant at the jail. Agent Williams advised Bentley of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), and Bentley signed a waiver of rights form. Williams then informed Bent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>ley of the robberies he was suspected of committing. After conferring privately with his attorney, Bentley stated that he \u201cdid not have anything to say.\u201d The interview ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">The following day Williams called Osborne and informed him that he intended to interview Bentley again on the second of April at ten o\u2019clock. Osborne stated that \u201cif it was possible he would try to be there.\u201d Williams arrived at the county jail on time, Osborne did not, and the interview proceeded. Williams again advised Bentley of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and obtained a signed waiver. The record does not disclose what, if anything, was said about Osborne\u2019s absence. Williams asked Bentley if \u201che was ready to tell me the story regarding the robberies that I suspected him of committing.\u201d After indicating hesitancy to testify against his partner, Bentley confessed that he participated in both robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">The next day, April 3, 1980, Williams returned to the jail \u2014 again after notifying Osborne of his intent to interview Bentley \u2014 advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and obtained a signed waiver. Williams explained that he was \u201cinterested in getting a signed confession.\u201d Bentley agreed to sign a statement confessing involvement in the two robberies. Williams then began to write a statement for Bentley to sign. As Williams was finishing, Osborne arrived and said he wanted to talk to his client. A private conversation between Osborne and Bentley followed, after which the defendant stated \u201cthat he did not wish to sign that statement nor did he wish to testify against his partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">The defense made no pretrial motion to suppress Agent Williams\u2019 testimony concerning Bentley\u2019s oral confession, nor did Osborne object to Williams\u2019 testimony at trial. The only question as to the admission of the agent\u2019s testimony was raised by the trial court <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">Declaring a recess in the middle of Williams\u2019 testimony, Judge Spiegel called counsel into chambers and expressed doubt as to the authority of an agent \u201cto go back and continue seeking to question the defendant after the defendant has indicated he doesn\u2019t want to be questioned.\u201d In response, government counsel argued that Agent Williams acted properly, stressing that before each session he notified defendant\u2019s attorney of his intent to interview Bentley and obtained a signed waiver of rights from Bentley before proceeding with questioning. Counsel also emphasized the distinction between the present case where Bentley had benefit of counsel at an earlier interrogation and the case where a defendant requests an attorney at the first interrogation but is not given one. Judge Spiegel asked Bentley\u2019s counsel if he had \u201canything to offer.\u201d Osborne then conferred with Bentley and responded \u201cthat what\u2019s been told to the Court is accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">At issue are three interviews, the third being divided into two phases. At the first interview counsel was present at the instance of the Agent. Bentley consulted with counsel and chose to remain silent. At the second interview counsel was absent, although he had been notified of the proposed interview. Bentley signed a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and then made incriminating statements. At the first phase of the third interview Bentley (with counsel absent) again signed a waiver and agreed to sign a confession. After counsel arrived and conferred, Bentley refused to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">There is no indication that Bentley initiated the second interview and Bentley argues that the so-called <em>\u201cEdwards </em>rule\u201d' therefore establishes that the Agent\u2019s testimony as to his oral confession at the second interview was inadmissible. <em>See Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">We do not agree that the <em>\u201cEdwards </em>rule\u201d applies to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-13\">In <em>Edwards, </em>police stopped questioning the accused after he asked for an attorney but returned the following day and told Edwards \u201che had\u201d to talk. Police then read Edwards his rights and he agreed to make a statement. The Supreme Court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>Edwards\u2019 confession was taken in violation of his right to counsel under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-4\">when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. We further hold that <em>an accused </em>such as Edwards, <em>having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges or conversations with the police.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\"><em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. at 1884-1885 (emphasis added). This latter holding \u2014 italicized\u2014has come to be known as the <em>\u201cEdwards </em>rule.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw, </em>\u2014- U.S.-,-, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 2834, 77 L.Ed.2d 405 (1983). <em>See also Wyr-ick v. Fields, </em>459 U.S. 42, 103 S.Ct. 394, 74 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). <em>Cf. Maglio v. Jago, </em>580 F.2d 202, 205 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">Given the <em>Edwards </em>facts \u2014 an initial request for counsel followed, before provision of counsel, by an interview somewhat insistently initiated by the police \u2014 the Supreme Court decided that the prosecution would not be permitted to support admissibility by demonstrating knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel and right to remain silent unless it first proved that the accused had himself initiated further communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">The Court has characterized the <em>Edwards </em>rule as \u201ca prophylactic rule, designed to protect an accused in police custody from being badgered by police officers in the manner in which the defendant in <em>Edwards </em>was.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>- U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 2834.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">The manner in which Agent Williams conducted himself was markedly different. He arranged for counsel\u2019s presence at the first interview.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He notified counsel of his intention to hold the second and third interviews, receiving a vague response concerning counsel\u2019s intentions to be present. Although the record does not show what the agent and Bentley said about counsel\u2019s absence, there is nothing to indicate that the agent made any misleading statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-14\">We view the impact of <em>Edwards </em>(as explained in <em>Bradshaw) </em>on this case as no more than emphasizing the need that Bentley be shown to have made a knowing and intelligent waiver before his responses become admissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-15\">The present record does not permit a determination of the knowing and intelligent nature of Bentley\u2019s waiver. Bentley\u2019s signed waivers were in evidence and Agent Williams testified to having advised Bentley of his rights. Williams did not testify what either he or Bentley said about Mr. Osborne\u2019s absence, or whether Bentley indicated any preference to have him present. No testimony was offered as to Bentley\u2019s education or experience. The record does, however, show that on the two occasions when Bentley had the benefit of consultation with counsel, he decided to remain silent. The inference readily drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>the counseled choices to remain silent makes it disquieting to rely solely on the signed waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The government bears a \u201cheavy burden of establishing that Bentley voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to silence and to counsel.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628 (citing <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 490 &amp; n. 14, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1765 &amp; n. 14, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964)). <em>See also Tague v. Louisiana, </em>444 U.S. 469, 470-71, 100 S.Ct. 652, 653, 62 L.Ed.2d 622 (1980); <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755,1757, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). Where the accused has \u201cexpressed his own view that he is not competent to deal with the authorities without legal advice, a later decision at the authorities\u2019 insistence to make a statement without counsel\u2019s presence may properly be viewed with skepticism.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96,110 n. 2, 96 S.Ct. 321, 329 n. 2, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975) (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">The government asserts that \u201c[i]t is obvious ... that [Bentley\u2019s] confession was an intelligent choice of his own free will.\u201d It is emphasized that Bentley had the benefit of counsel during state court proceedings and during the first of his interviews with Agent Williams, and that Bentley signed a waiver of rights form at each of his three interviews. Neither of these facts requires the finding of a valid waiver, however. As to the signed waivers, the Supreme Court stated in <em>North Carolina v. Butler:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-7\">An express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver. The question is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">441 U.S. at 373, 99 S.Ct. at 1757. We cannot say in light of the other doubts raised in this case that Bentley\u2019s signature of a waiver form is determinative. We decline also to find the defendant\u2019s past representation by counsel indicative of the intelligent nature of his waiver of the right to counsel and to silence at subsequent interviews. Indeed, as already indicated, his decisions to remain silent when counsel was present would support the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">On the record before us we are unable to determine that Bentley voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to have counsel present during questioning and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-13\">The government contends that even if the present record does not demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel \u2022 and to silence, the defendant waived any defect by failing to object at trial. Bentley contends that the district court erred in not making a further inquiry <em>sua sponte, </em>and that his attorney\u2019s failure to object amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">In <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), the Supreme Court recognized that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a fair hearing and a reliable determination of the voluntariness of a confession. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 (1976). Failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to admission of a confession, however, ordinarily results in waiver of the right to a voluntariness inquiry. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 86, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977); <em>United States v. Renteria, </em>625 F.2d 1279, 1283 (5th Cir.1980). The trial court may be found to have a duty to raise the issue of voluntariness on its own only when the evidence \u201cclearly reflects a question\u201d about the voluntary nature of a confession. <em>See Renteria, </em>625 F.2d at 1283. <em>See also United States v. Powe, </em>591 F.2d 833, 842-43 (D.C.Cir.1978) (certain \u201calerting circumstances\u201d may impose duty to investigate voluntariness of confession).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>this duty typically has been found where evidence indicated a confession may have been given under circumstances amounting to overt coercion, we think the same rule should apply where, as here, serious doubts are raised as to defendant\u2019s knowing and intelligent relinquishment of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Even in the absence of a defense objection, the questions raised by defendant\u2019s refusal to waive when he had the benefit of counsel should have alerted the court to the need to inquire further into the circumstances. Counsel\u2019s inexplicable failure to object should have emphasized that need.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Powe, </em>591 F.2d at 845. <em>See also United States v. Renteria, </em>625 F.2d at 1283; <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>610 F.2d 888, 892-95 (D.C.Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The disquieting facts surrounding the alleged waiver resulted in the district court ultimately raising the issue of the admissibility of Bentley\u2019s confession on its own. In chambers the court pressed the government for a discussion of the propriety of Agent William\u2019s conduct. The court also asked defense counsel if he had anything to offer. Defense counsel\u2019s response, that he agreed with everything the prosecution had said, at least suggests a lack of preparation on the issue of admitting defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">When no other argument was forthcoming the court admitted the testimony. The court did not examine the underlying question: whether the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The great importance to the defendant of keeping the confession out of the record if not properly present was obvious. Accordingly, we deem it plain error for the court not to have inquired further into the issue of defendant\u2019s waiver. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(b). <em>Cf. Clark v. Jago, </em>676 F.2d 1099, 1110-13 (6th Cir.1982) (remanding case for suppression hearing where trial court failed to engage in sufficient factfind-ing or inquire whether waiver was knowing or intelligent in determining sufficiency of defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel during custodial interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">The government also argues that if the admission of Bentley\u2019s confession was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972), this Circuit has held that \u201cwhere a confession, otherwise voluntary, is inadmissible for failure to comply with the strict procedural requirements of <em>Miranda, </em>reversal is not required if, upon the facts, the court can find beyond a reasonable doubt that its use at trial was harmless and could not have affected the outcome.\u201d <em>United States v. Charlton, </em>565 F.2d 86, 92 (6th Cir.1977), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 U.S. 1070, 98 S.Ct. 1253, 55 L.Ed.2d 773 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">In the case of an improperly admitted confession independently establishing guilt, the focus must be on whether other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>\u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>Charlton, </em>565 F.2d at 93. The other evidence presented by the government at trial does not meet this tough standard. Aside from Bentley\u2019s confession two pieces of testimony appear central. The first was the testimony of a loan officer at First Federal Savings who identified Bentley as the man who came to see about a car loan, returned two hours later and robbed the bank. \u201c[EJyewitness .identification by strangers based upon fleeting observations made in stressful circumstances are frequently inaccurate.\u201d <em>Eberhardt v. Bordenkircher, </em>605 F.2d 275, 279 (6th Cir. 1979) (quoting <em>United States v. Barker, </em>553 F.2d 1013,1017 (6th Cir.1977)). While more credence might be given an eyewitness who observes a person during a nonstressful moment, the loan-officer\u2019s testimony is subject to question because he admitted that he chose the picture of another man when asked to identify the bank robber. (The group of photographs did not include the defendant.) The other central piece of evidence was the testimony of Bentley\u2019s alleged accomplice Zachary Kitchens. A jury could, however, entertain reasonable doubts about the testimony of an alleged accomplice who is testifying against the defendant in keeping with a plea agreement. <em>Cf. United States v. Brown, </em>699 F.2d 585, 590 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cjury could have reasonable doubts about ... [testimony of] a co-defendant with prior convictions and a history of drug addiction\u201d). The other evidence presented to the jury was circumstantial in nature. Missing from the government\u2019s case, though not determinative, is the kind of physical evidence establishing defendant\u2019s guilt that has persuaded this court in the past that the admission of an illegally obtained confession was harmless. <em>See, e.g., Young v. Rees, </em>707 F.2d 935 (6th Cir. 1983) (ballistic tests established gun seized from defendant\u2019s house matched shell casing found at murder scene); <em>Charlton, </em>565 F.2d at 93 (defendant\u2019s fingerprints found on counterfeiting equipment seized in premises controlled by defendant). Taken as a whole, the other evidence offered at trial cannot be said to be so overwhelming as to make admission of Bentley\u2019s confession harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">The error here was failure to make a sufficient inquiry to determine whether defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel and right to silence. We remand for such inquiry. If the district court finds there was an adequate waiver, the judgment will stand affirmed. If the contrary be found, the judgment must be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">. Past precedent in this Circuit at least suggests that Williams was not required in the first instance to notify Bentley\u2019s state court attorney of his intent to ask the defendant questions about possible involvement in federal crimes. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>496 F.2d 158 (6th Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Dority, </em>487 F.2d 846 (6th Cir.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">. The question whether <em>Edwards </em>should apply retroactively under the principles enunciated in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982), is presently under study in this Circuit. <em>Rose v. Engle, </em>722 F.2d 1277 (1983). The Supreme Court has this issue before it. <em>See Stumes v. Solem, </em>671 F.2d 1150 (8th Cir.1982), <em>cert, granted, </em>- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 3568, 77 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1983). We do not wait for direction from these cases because (1) we find the <em>Edwards </em>rule is otherwise not applicable to this case and (2) the question of retroactivity would not appear raised, assuming the <em>Johnson </em>standard may be used in a Fifth Amendment case, where, as here, the case was not yet final at the time <em>Edwards </em>was decided. <em>See Johnson, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2594.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">. An exception to this general rule can be found in the Fourth Circuit where a trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>has an obligation, even where no objection is raised, to take evidence outside the jury\u2019s presence on the voluntariness of any proffered confession. <em>See United States v. Inman, </em>352 F.2d 954, 956 (4th Cir.1965). <em>See also United States v. Owens, </em>528 F.2d 1176, 1179 (4th Cir.1975). <em>But see United States v. Yamashita, </em>527 F.2d 954 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">. Nothing in the facts of this case suggest that .defense counsel declined to object to the admission of defendant\u2019s confession as a matter of strategy. On the contrary, to the extent a defense strategy can be discerned, it would appear defense counsel hoped to show that the defendant was the victim of misidentification and of a felon who hoped to protect the actual guilty party by naming Bentley as his accomplice. The admission of Bentley\u2019s oral statements admitting culpability torpedoed that strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">It is possible, though not discernible on this record, that counsel failed to raise the issue of admissibility because Bentley privately conceded that he knowingly and intelligently waived his rights at the second interview. This might have been the substance of Bentley\u2019s private conversation with his attorney in chambers pri- or to the attorney\u2019s statement \u201cthat what\u2019s been told the Court is accurate.\u201d If this was the basis for counsel\u2019s decision not to object, then a waiver of the issue occurred and counsel was not' at fault. As to this question, we leave it to the district judge to make such inquiries as are appropriate on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1202-5\">WELLFORD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACg\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">I agree with Judge Fairchild\u2019s opinion in its dealing with the non-applicability of <em>Edwards v.

I would, however, find that Bentley made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to have-counsel present under the circumstances when he executed a written waiver, did not request his attorney\u2019s presence, and voluntarily made a statement to the FBI agent investigating the robbery on the occasions of subsequent meetings, especially when his attorney knew of the interviews and consented to. them. No objection was made to the agent\u2019s testimony about Bentley\u2019s statements, furthermore, by defendant-appellant\u2019s counsel at trial. <em>See Michigan v.

I would therefore find that appellant could not raise the issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Finally, in view of the clear and convincing nature of the proof in this case presented by the prosecution, and no contrary evidence presented by the appellant, I would hold that any error made in admission of Bentley\u2019s statements against his interest was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824,17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>Milton v. Wainwright, </em>407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); <em>United States v. Charlton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>565 F.2d 86, 92 (6th Cir.1977). In my view, the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. The accomplice in the robbery identified appellant, and his testimony about the circumstances was corroborated by several witnesses. Appellant wore no mask; he had long, flowing hair, and the two used a distinctive, easily recognizable care in effectuating the robbery and the get-away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">The accomplice and appellant were fellow employees and appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that appellant cooperated and pleaded guilty to a prior similar charge, involving robbery of a savings and loan, in which the accomplice was also apparently involved. Appellant had changed his appearance substantially when he was at trial with a \u201cclose-cut haircut,\u201d (Jt.App. at 84) in contrast to his long hair<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at the time of the robbery. Yet appellant at trial was unequi-vocably identified by an eyewitness, despite the changed appearance, after he had on the day of the robbery a face-to-face confrontation of about ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Accordingly, I would affirm the conviction in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1203-15\">. One witness described the suspect as having hair \u201ca little longer than shoulder length.\u201d (Jt. App. at 71).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
