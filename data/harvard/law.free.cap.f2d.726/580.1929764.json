WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b653-28\">The Secretary of Health and Human Services appeals an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), Pub.L. No. 96-481, Title II, 94 Stat, 2325 (1980). The issues are (1) whether a Social Security Act fees provision precludes application of the EAJA, (2) whether fees generated before the EAJA\u2019s effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>date are compensable, and (3) whether the Secretary\u2019s position in this case has been substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Wolverton, a 57-year-old construction electrician, contends that because of an automobile accident he was totally disabled as of December 31, 1976. His disability claim filed with the Social Security Administration was denied by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The agency Appeals Council upheld that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Wolverton challenged the administrative decision in district court and it was reversed and remanded for rehearing. The district court held that the ALJ applied incorrect legal standards or the decision was not based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">On remand, the ALJ requested that Wol-verton undergo further medical and psychological examinations, at government expense. He refused. The ALJ denied the claim for benefits, finding that Wolverton could not resume his former employment but had the residual capacity to perform other light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The district court reversed again. Without mentioning Wolverton\u2019s refusal to submit to further examinations, the court held that no evidence in the record supported the finding of residual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Wolverton petitioned the court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and ex--penses pursuant to the EAJA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp. IV 1980). The court refused to award fees and expenses incurred in the administrative proceedings. It did award costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the two proceedings before the court, finding that the Secretary\u2019s position was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">I. THE EAJA AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CASES</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The Social Security Act, section 406(b), provides that a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees in a civil action brought to recover past-due benefits under Title II of that Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1). The stated purpose of the provision is to protect Social Security claimants from \u201cinordinately large fees\u201d demanded by attorneys. S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1943, 2062. The maximum amount awardable is 25 percent of the total past-due benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1). The fees are payable \u201cout of, and not in addition to\u201d the award of benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">The EAJA was enacted to reduce the chance that \u201cthe expense involved in securing the vindication of ... rights\u201d would deter \u201cdefen[se] against unreasonable governmental action.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1418, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 5, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4984, 4984. To do so it shifts the burden of the prevailing party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses onto the government under some circumstances. The EAJA provides that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise specifically provided by statute,\u201d a court may award fees and expenses to a party prevailing against the United States in a civil action. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp. IV 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The Secretary contends that section 406(b) of the Social Security Act is a statute that \u201cotherwise specifically provides\u201d for attorneys\u2019 fees, precluding any award under the EAJA. We disagree. The EAJA provides for shifting the burden of attorneys\u2019 fees from the private litigant to the government. The Social Security Act does not provide for fee shifting. It specifies only a limitation on the amount that a claimant must pay toward lawyers\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">Section 406(b) of the Social Security Act does not \u201cspecifically provide\u201d for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid by the United States to a party prevailing against it. Section 406(b) does not preclude application of the EAJA\u2019s fee shifting provisions in Social Security Act cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">II. WORK PERFORMED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE EAJA</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">The Secretary contends that the waiver of sovereign immunity in the EAJA does not apply to fees that accrued before the effective date of the Act, October 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>1981. Pub.L. No. 96-481, \u00a7 208, 94 Stat. 2330 (1980). This circuit has concluded that the plain meaning of the EAJA allows recovery of fees incurred prior to October 1, 1981, as long as the action was pending on that date. <em>Rawlings v. Heckler, 725 </em>F.2d 1192,1194 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">III. SUBSTANTIAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE SECRETARY\u2019S POSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The EAJA provides for awards of fees and expenses to parties prevailing against the United States unless the Government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d or \u201cspecial circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (Supp. IV 1980). An adverse decision on the merits does not foreclose a finding of substantial justification. <em>Foster v. Tourtellotte, </em>704 F.2d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.1983). The essential issue is the reasonableness of the government\u2019s position. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The position evaluated is not the litigation position only, but the \u201ctotality of the circumstances prelitigation and during trial.\u201d <em>Rawlings, </em>at 1196. The justification for the Secretary\u2019s position here has changed, perhaps significantly, during the course of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">This fee award is for services provided in the course of two proceedings before the district court. It found that the Secretary\u2019s position was without substantial justification because there was <em>\u201cno evidence in the record </em>supporting [the ALJ\u2019s] finding of residual capacity.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">With respect to the first district court proceeding, the finding of no substantial justification was not an abuse of discretion. As the dissent points out, all objective medical <em>tests </em>supported the ALJ\u2019s decision. However, \u201cthe same reports of the examining physicians unanimously acknowledge the existence of pain, vertigo, dizziness, and headaches.\u201d E/R at 24. The ALJ was not reversed for improper balancing, but because there was no evidence contradicting the medical experts\u2019 unanimous finding of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">After the case was remanded to the Secretary for rehearing, the ALJ sought additional evidence concerning Wolverton\u2019s residual capacity to work. The judge asked that Wolverton submit to further medical and psychological examinations, at government expense. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1517-1518. He refused. The lack of evidence of residual capacity at the second administrative hearing may be, at least partially, Wolverton\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">We cannot determine from the record before us whether the Secretary\u2019s position was substantially justified at the time of the second district court proceeding. To establish substantial justification, the Government \u201cmust show its case had a reasonable basis both in law and in fact.\u201d <em>Hoang Ha v. Schweiker, </em>707 F.2d 1104,1106 (9th Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">The Secretary\u2019s position throughout the long course of this dispute must be considered. To decide whether Wolverton\u2019s refusal to submit to the additional examinations transformed the government\u2019s position into a reasonable one, the court should consider all surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">It was the ALJ\u2019s dissatisfaction with the record, not the government\u2019s, that prompted the request for further examinations. What were the purposes and importance of the examinations? Would they have duplicated information already available, or produced additional information material to the residual capacity issue? Was the information sought reasonably available from other sources?</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">We reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses and remand. Fees, costs, and expenses attributable to the first district court proceeding should be awarded. Some costs attributable to administrative proceedings may have been awarded inadvertently. The parties agree that those should be excluded. The court should award fees for the second district court proceeding only if it finds that, in light of Wolverton\u2019s refusal to submit to further examinations, the Secretary\u2019s position still was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Wolverton\u2019s petition for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on appeal is denied. The appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>presented questions of first impression in this circuit. The Secretary\u2019s position here was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The judgment is reversed in part and remanded. The parties will bear their own costs on this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b656-5\">POOLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQQe\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s holding that the Equal Access to Justice Act applies to Social Security appeals, but disagree with its application of the Act to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In particular, I do not believe that the district court properly awarded attorney\u2019s fees for either of Wolverton\u2019s two appeals to the district court. As the district court and the majority here acknowledge, all available objective medical tests supported the ALJ\u2019s initial decision to deny disability payments to Wolverton. The ALJ found that testimony concerning the severity and frequency of Wolverton\u2019s headaches and dizziness was \u201cnot convincing,\u201d and concluded that his impairments were not \u201cof such severity as to preclude his engaging in substantial gainful activity.\u201d The district court\u2019s decision that objective medical evidence alone was insufficient to support the ALJ\u2019s decision has not been appealed and is not subject to review here. Regardless of the correctness of that decision, however, the Government\u2019s conduct was reasonable. I believe that the district court abused its discretion by finding that the Government\u2019s defense of the initial appeal to the district court, where the ALJ\u2019s decision in favor of the Government was supported by objective medical evidence, lacked substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">As for the fees for the second appeal, the majority opinion delicately suggests that the absence of additional evidence \u201cmay be, at least partially, Wolverton\u2019s responsibility.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>at 583. This understates the case. Wolverton\u2019s refusal to submit to additional tests, to be provided at government expense, was directly responsible for the lack of new evidence. Having refused these tests, Wolverton should not be allowed to take advantage of the uncertainty created by his own non-cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">I believe it unnecessary to remand this case to the district court for determination whether that additional information sought by the ALJ was material to the residual capacity issue. Appellee Wolverton has never suggested that the tests were immaterial, nor has he offered any legitimate reason why he refused to take them. Moreover, the reason for the ALJ\u2019s request for additional medical tests is plain from the record before us, and requires no remand. Finally, remand is unnecessary because, in the peculiar procedural position of this case, we are not directly concerned with the correctness of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Rather, we need only determine whether the Government was substantially justified in defending the decision on appeal to the district court. Where a party refuses to provide information requested by an administrative law judge, the Government should be able to assume that the information was requested in good faith and for a purpose material to the issues before the agency, absent some showing to the contrary. In a case such as the present, the Government should be considered substantially justified in defending a decision in its favor against the party withholding information.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
