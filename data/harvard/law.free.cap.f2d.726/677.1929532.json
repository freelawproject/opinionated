At his direction an employee signed, as transferee, one hundred blank firearm transfer forms. One of the forms, signed on July 1, 1978, purported to cov\u00e9r sale of a M-l carbine bearing serial number 366728. A second form, dated July 5,1978, purported to cover the sale of another M-l carbine bearing serial number 356561. The appellant signed both forms as transferor on July 5, 1978, and made entries in the store\u2019s permanent firearms transfer record or \u201cbound book\u201d on the same date. One count of the indictment charged that the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-22\">On or about July 1, and July 5, 1978, ... did unlawfully and knowingly make false entries as to a material fact in each ATF [alcohol, tobacco, and firearm] form 4473 Firearms Transaction Records and the Federal Firearms \u201cBound Book\u201d .... [in that] he did enter the name of .... [an employee] as the transferee (buyer/purchaser) of firearms ... knowing full well that said .... [employee] was not the transferee ... In violation of Title 18 United States Code Sections 2, 922(m), 923 and 924 and Title 27 C.F.R. 178.124 and 178.125.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-23\">The appellant pled guilty to making false entries on two ATF forms, in the \u201cbound book\u201d, and in entering the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>an employee as transferee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court imposed two five year consecutive sentences and a ten thousand dollar fine. The second five year sentence was later reduced to two years. The appellant filed a motion to correct or reduce the sentence, pursuant to Rule 35, F.R.Crim.P., asserting that the consecutive sentences were illegal because he had been convicted of making false entries simultaneously. From this, appellant argued that he could be convicted and sentenced only for a single offense. The district court denied the motion and noted that \u201cexamination of the exhibits [copies of the two ATF forms] indicates that purchases of the firearms occurred on two different days in July, 1978.\u201d The appellant challenges this ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The primary claim of the appellant relates to the propriety of trial court\u2019s imposition of two consecutive sentences was error for the reason that appellant committed only one crime although he provided false information on two separate forms on separate dates of the sale of two firearms. It has been held that simultaneous possession of multiple weapons constituted only one offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court is urged to follow those decisions which hold that Congress never declared an intention to punish indistinguishable multiple firearms violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">This case is different. The appellant, a licensed firearms dealer, provided false information on two separate ATF forms, on two separate days, for the sale of two firearms. Separate instances of providing false information, separate receipt, or separate storage of multiple weapons establishes separate offenses under federal firearm statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>This is not a case where the defendant was sentenced for two separate offenses when he made two distinct false statements on a single form in purchasing a single firearm. See, <em>Brown v. United States, </em>623 F.2d 54 (9th Cir.1980). This is not a case where the defendant was convicted and sentenced for interstate transportation of firearms by a convicted felon, as well as, possession of firearms by a convicted felon. See, <em>United States v. Frankenberry, </em>696 F.2d 239 (3rd Cir.1982), cert, den.,-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 3544, 77 L.Ed.2d 1392 (1983). Here, the appellant, a licensed firearms dealer, avoided review of his firearm sales records by conducting a closed sale in which he transferred fifteen carbines to his employee using fifteen ATF forms. Although such a transfer was possible with one ATF form, the appellant directed that false statements be made on fifteen ATF forms. Cf., <em>United States v. Mason, </em>611 F.2d 49 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">If the appellant had provided false information on separate ATF forms at the same time and place, separate prosecution would be permitted. Successive acts, no matter how close in time, constitute separate offenses. <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333,101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981). When false statements were twice but separately made on two ATF forms in the acquisition of two weapons bought at one time, there were two offenses. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>685 F.2d 319 (9th Cir.1982). In <em>United States v. Long, </em>524 F.2d 660, 662 (9th Cir.1975), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in upholding two counts of supplying false information in the acquisition of two firearms, noted that the unit of prosecution proscribed by Congress was the giving of false information. Since the appellant directed that false information be provided on two occasions on two ATF forms in connection with the sale of two guns, two separate violations of the law occurred and each was a proper unit of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Here the court correctly decided that the entries were not simultaneous and could be the subject of separate prosecutions resulting in consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The district court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s Rule 35 motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\">. The appellant entered a guilty plea to count one which alleged falsification of the transfer records of carbine # 356561, and count two, which alleged falsification of the transfer records of carbine # 366728, in exchange for the government\u2019s agreement to dismiss the other charges. The appellant was charged with causing his employee to make the entries and was liable for her acts under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and is responsible for her acts as if he had committed them. <em>Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 613, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). See also, <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>595 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. The appellant contends that counts one and two of the indictment are multiplicious and in violation of the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause. Rule 12(b)(2), Fed.R.Crim.P., requires that a complaint that the multiplicity of an indictment, and its inherent double jeopardy problems, be raised before trial. Appellant\u2019s failure to object to the multiplicity of the indictment before trial acts as a waiver of the multiplicity objection where the defendant had time to object but chose not to challenge the indictment and pled guilty in return for an agreed sentence. <em>U.S. v. Busard, </em>524 F.2d 72 (5th Cir.1975), cert, den., 426 U.S. 948, 96 S.Ct. 3168, 49 L.Ed.2d 1185 (1982), <em>U.S. v.
