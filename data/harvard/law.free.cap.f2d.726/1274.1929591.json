GIBSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1348-16\">The issue before us is the constitutionality of two Arkansas drug paraphernalia statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-18\">In February, 1981, Arkansas enacted Act 78 which criminalized the possession, use, sale and manufacture of drug paraphernalia. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 82-2601(y), 2619(c), 2629(i) (1981). Retailers selling smoking devices and other objects potentially embraced by Act 78 brought a pre-enforcement facial challenge principally alleging that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted a preliminary injunction in anticipation of this court\u2019s decision in <em>The Casbah, Inc. v. Thone, </em>651 F.2d 551 (8th Cir.1981), <em>cert denied, </em>455 U.S. 1005, 102 S.Ct. 1642, 71 L.Ed.2d 874 (1982), a case presenting a similar challenge to Nebraska\u2019s drug paraphernalia statute. In June, 1981, a second Arkansas statute, Act 946, became effective. Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 82-2644 (1981). It established criminal penalties for operating a drug paraphernalia business. Appellants filed an amended complaint alleging that Act 946 was also vague and overbroad. The district court expanded the preliminary injunction to include Act 946. Following our decision upholding the constitutionality of the Nebraska statute in <em>The Casbah, supra, </em>and the similar result reached by the Supreme Court with respect to a village drug paraphernalia ordinance in <em>Village of Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982), the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dissolved the preliminary injunction. On appeal, appellants reassert their claim that both Acts are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-20\">Before examining the specific provisions of Acts 78 and 946, we outline the guiding principles of the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>The overbreadth doctrine permits litigants to challenge a law\u2019s facial validity on the ground that it unconstitutionally restricts the first amendment rights of third parties not before the court. <em>Schaumburg v. Citizens for Better Environment, </em>444 U.S. 620,100 S.Ct. 826, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980). The justification for this exception to the \u201ctraditional rules governing constitutional adjudication\u201d is a \u201cjudicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610-12, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-16, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). The applicability of the overbreadth doctrine depends in part on whether commercial or noncommercial speech is involved. A statute is unconstitutionally overbroad only if it reaches a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of noncommercial speech. <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 494, 102 S.Ct. at 1191. The overbreadth doctrine is inapplicable to commercial speech\u2014 speech which does \u201cno more than propose a commercial transaction,\u201d <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>413 U.S. 376, 385, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2558, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), or that \u201crelate[s] solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience,\u201d <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>447 U.S. 557, 561, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). The over-breadth doctrine does not extend to commercial speech because the profit motive is thought to be sufficiently compelling to enable such speech to withstand the chilling effect of an overbroad statute. <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U.S. 748, 771 n. 24, 96 S.Ct. 1817,1830 n. 24, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">A law is void for vagueness if it lacks \u201cascertainable standards of guilt,\u201d <em>Winters v. New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 515, 68 S.Ct. 665, 670,92 L.Ed. 840 (1948), such that \u201cmen of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,\u201d <em>Connally v. General Construction Col., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). Vague laws offend due process because they violate the two essential values of fair warning and nondiscriminatory enforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1349-9\">First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\"><em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-99, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (footnotes omitted). A person whose actions are clearly proscribed by a statute cannot assert its potential vagueness as applied to other persons or circumstances unless the law restricts constitutionally protected conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 495, 102 S.Ct. at 1192; <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>534 F.2d 1262 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert, denied, </em>433 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2971, 53 L.Ed.2d 1091 (1977) (citing <em>United States v. Mazurie, </em>419 U.S. 544, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975)). The law must be such that <em>\u201cno </em>standard of conduct is specified at all,\u201d <em>Coates v. City of Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686,1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (emphasis added), and is therefore \u201cimpermissibly vague in all of its applications,\u201d <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 497,102 S.Ct. at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>In a vagueness challenge, both the degree of clarity required and the relative importance of fair warning and discriminatory enforcement depend on the nature of the law in question. Laws regulating business behavior are held to a lesser standard of definiteness because businesses \u201ccan be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action.\u201d <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 498, 102 S.Ct. at 1193 (footnote omitted). Consequently, the prospect of discriminatory enforcement of such a law is especially speculative in a pre-enforcement challenge, and therefore \u201cthe principle inquiry is whether the law affords fair warning of what is proscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503,102 S.Ct. at 1196. Greater specificity is required of laws imposing criminal penalties and those infringing on constitutionally protected rights. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 102 S.Ct. at 1193-94. In addition, a mens rea element may mitigate vagueness by insuring that those acting in good faith are not swept within a law\u2019s broad or ambiguous language. <em>Id.; Boyce Motor Lines v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 342, 72 S.Ct. 329, 331, 96 L.Ed. 367 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">These principles must be applied to Acts 78 and 946 to determine the required degree of specificity. Both Acts regulate business behavior and impose criminal sanctions and, as determined in section II, <em>infra, </em>neither implicates constitutionally protected conduct. The <em>Flipside </em>ordinance was similarly situated; it applied to retail drug paraphernalia businesses and, although violations were punishable with civil fines, was labeled \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d due to the stigma of being branded a drug paraphernalia seller. <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 499 &amp; n. 16, 102 S.Ct. at 1194 &amp; n. 16. One crucial difference, however, is that violations of Acts 78 and 946 are felonies punishable by imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For this reason, we conclude that both Acts must satisfy a stricter test of specificity than that applied in <em>Flipside. </em>At the same time, we recognize that regardless of the severity of a law\u2019s criminal sanctions, a law regulating business behavior which does not restrict constitutionally protected conduct is not void for vagueness if it is sufficiently clear as applied to the conduct of the complaining party. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 102 S.Ct. at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">Act 78<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> defines drug paraphernalia as \u201call equipment, products and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, or designed for use\u201d with controlled substances. Following this definition is a list of twelve examples. The last example in the list is the all-inclusive \u201cobjects used, intended for use, or designed for use\u201d with marijuana, hashish or cocaine, followed by thirteen examples of such objects. The Act then lists fourteen relevant factors which should be considered in determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia. A violation of Act 78 occurs when a person (1) uses drug paraphernalia with controlled substances or (2) possesses drug paraphernalia with the intent to use it with controlled substances. Act 78 can also be violated when a person, knowing or under circumstances where one reasonably should know that it will be used with controlled substances, (3) delivers drug paraphernalia; (4) possesses drug paraphernalia with the intent to deliver; or (5) manufactures drug paraphernalia with the intent to deliver. The Act prohibits a person from placing advertisements in a publication which that person knows or should know are designed to promote .the sale of drug paraphernalia. The Act also provides for the seizure and forfeiture of all drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">Act 78 is virtually identical to the Model Drug Paraphernalia Act, which has now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>been upheld by this circuit in <em>The Casbah, Inc., supra, </em>and in every other circuit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> considering its constitutionality. First amendment challenges to the Model Act were based on its general prohibition of drug paraphernalia and drug paraphernalia advertising, the use of speech-related factors to determine if a particular object was drug paraphernalia, and the provisions allowing for the seizure and forfeiture of drug-related books and literature. These claims were rejected on the grounds that only lesser-protected commercial speech was involved, <em>e.g., Camille Corp. v. Phares, </em>705 F.2d 223 (7th Cir.1983), because the only speech implicated was that proposing an illegal activity which could be regulated or banned entirely, <em>e.g., Stoianoff </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>695 F.2d 1214, 1219 (9th Cir.1983), and because any noncommercial speech was only incidentally restricted, <em>e.g., Weiler v. Carpenter, </em>695 F.2d 1348 (10th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The Model Act was challenged as unconstitutionally vague because it was alleged to encompass both multi-purpose items with drug-related and legitimate uses and innocent items adaptable to drug use. So interpreted, violations could be established by transferring a purchaser\u2019s intent to use an innocent object with prohibited drugs to an unknowing seller. It was also alleged that this lack of fair notice would lead to discriminatory enforcement against those practicing alternative lifestyles. Courts rejected these claims by interpreting the Model Act\u2019s definition of drug paraphernalia to be limited to those items which the <em>accused intended </em>for use with illegal drugs. This interpretation insured that the seller had fair notice of what objects were prohibited and thereby eliminated the possibility of prosecutions based on transferred intent. <em>E.g., Florida Businessmen for Free Enterprise v. City of Hollywood, </em>673 F.2d 1213 (11th Cir.1982). Discriminatory enforcement claims were rejected on the ground that the examples and relevant factors included in the Model Act as useful in identifying drug paraphernalia provided sufficient guidance for authorities to apply the Act in a nonarbitrary fashion, <em>e.g., General Stores v. Bingaman, </em>695 F.2d 502 (10th Cir.1982), and because speculation as to discriminatory enforcement is insufficient to facially void a law which regulates business behavior, <em>e.g., Kansas Retail Trade Coop. v. Stephan, </em>695 F.2d 1343 (10th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">Recognizing that the facial validity of the Model Act has been established, appellants raise two arguments in an attempt to distinguish Act 78 from prior decisions. Their first claim is that Act 78 is over-broad<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because it prevents persons from utilizing the expressions imprinted on, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>the symbolic speech represented by the use of, drug paraphernalia. Appellants claim that these expressions and symbolic speech, distinct from statements or logos used for marketing purposes, are constitutionally protected noncommercial speech because they represent the owner\u2019s views on the draft, materialism, obscenity, war and other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\"><em>Flipside </em>addressed the appellants\u2019 argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-5\">Flipside also argues that because the presence of drug-related designs, logos or slogans on paraphernalia may trigger enforcement, the ordinance infringes \u201cprotected symbolic speech.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-6\">These arguments do not long detain us.... Although drug-related designs or names on cigarette papers may subject those items to regulation, the village does not restrict speech as such, but simply regulates the commercial marketing of items that the labels reveal may be used for an illicit purpose. The scope of the ordinance therefore does not embrace noncommercial speech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\"><em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 496, 102 S.Ct. at 1192 (citations omitted). <em>See also Pennsylvania Accessories Trade Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Thornburgh, </em>565 F.Supp. 1568, 1572 (M.D.Pa. 1983). Even if appellants succeed in drawing a distinction between the expressions concerning contemporary issues and the commercial marketing of items, Act 78 only incidentally affects such expressions and thus falls well short of the requisite \u201csubstantial\u201d restriction. <em>Broadrick, supra. </em>Finally, to the extent that the use of drug paraphernalia represents symbolic speech\u2014 conduct designed to communicate an idea which includes nonspeech elements \u2014 Arkansas\u2019s interest in combatting drug abuse and related evils justifies regulation of that conduct even if protected speech is incidentally restricted. <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">Appellant\u2019s second claim is that discriminatory enforcement of Act 78 is a certainty, rather than simply the hypothetical possibility presented in other drug paraphernalia cases. As evidence, appellants cite the record of a previous Arkansas case enjoining the operation of a Jacksonville drug paraphernalia ordinance. <em>Back Door Records v. City of Jacksonville, </em>515 F.Supp. 857 (E.D.Ark.1981). In that case, local law enforcement authorities testified that they were unable to distinguish drug paraphernalia from innocent objects, and would therefore consider where the items were sold and whether the vendor conformed to a drug-users profile when enforcing the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">We cannot accept appellants\u2019 argument. First, past testimony in a case decided when drug paraphernalia legislation benefitted from little enforcement experience or judicial guidance does not guarantee discriminatory enforcement of Act 78 two years later. Second, the court in <em>Back Door Records </em>relied on what was described as the \u201cpre-eminent authority\u201d of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Record Revolution No. 6, supra, </em>which held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Model Act was susceptible to discriminatory enforcement because it failed to adequately distinguish drug paraphernalia from innocent items adaptable to drug use. Every circuit considering the issue has since interpreted the Model Act not to embrace innocent items, and therefore this basis for discriminatory enforcement no longer exists. In addition, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision has since been reversed on remand. Third, the <em>Flipside </em>decision makes it clear that, absent a law totally lacking in enforcement standards, the possibility that a law which regulates business behavior will be arbitrarily enforced \u201cis of no due process significance unless the possibility ripens into a prosecution.\u201d <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 503-04 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. at 1195-96 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">We therefore find unconvincing both claims raised by appellants in their attempt to distinguish this case from <em>The Casbah, Inc., supra, </em>and other decisions upholding the constitutionality of the Model Act. Consequently, Act 78 is sufficiently clear to provide appellants with fair notice that at least some items sold in their stores are prohibited. We thus follow our previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>decision in <em>The Casbah, Inc., supra, </em>and hold that Act 78 is not unconstitutionally over-broad and that it satisfies the more stringent vagueness test mandated by its criminal sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">Act 946<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> prohibits the operation of an illegal drug paraphernalia business. Such a business is one that deals in \u201cdrug devices,\u201d which are defined as objects \u201cusable for smoking marijuana, for smoking controlled substances defined as tetrahydrocannabi-nols, or for injecting or inhaling cocaine.\u201d This definition is then expanded by the same thirteen examples contained in Act 78 to define the all-inclusive \u201cobjects used, intended for use, or designed for use\u201d with controlled substances. A violation of Act 946 occurs when a person conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs or owns all or part of a business which regularly manufactures or sells objects which he knows, or has reason to know, are designed to be primarily useful as drug devices. The Act declares such businesses to be public nuisances, and authorizes county prosecutors or private citizens to bring <em>ex parte </em>actions to enjoin their operation. If supported by probable cause, the Act authorizes the search of any place where drug devices are \u201cin any manner used, held or concealed\u201d with the intent to engage in illegal drug paraphernalia business. The Act provides for the forfeiture of all drug devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">Appellants assert that Act 946 is unconstitutionally overbroad and will be discriminatorily enforced for the same reasons asserted in relation to Act 78. For the reasons discussed in section II, <em>supra, </em>we reject these claims. Consequently, the only remaining issue is whether Act 946 provides fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">Act 946 defines a drug device as \u201can object usable for [consuming illegal drugs].\u201d This definition is virtually identical to the one held unconstitutional in <em>Geiger v. City of Eagan, </em>618 F.2d 26 (8th Cir. 1980). That ordinance defined a drug-related device as \u201cany pipe or other object suitable to be used for smoking.\u201d Act 946 is, however, distinguishable from Eagan\u2019s ordinance. To violate Act 946, the object not only must be \u201cusable\u201d with illegal drugs, but the person must (1) \u201cknow or have reason to know\u201d that the object is (2) \u201cdesigned to be primarily useful\u201d as a drug device. The issue is whether these two phrases provide the additional degree of exactitude sufficient to satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">The phrase \u201cdesigned to be primarily useful\u201d clearly narrows the scope of the Act. \u201cPrimarily useful\u201d excludes from the definition of drug device both innocent items adaptable for drug use and multi-purpose items equally employable for legal and prohibited uses. <em>See Nova Records, </em>706 F.2d at 789 (phrase \u201cintends to be used primarily for\u201d drug use construed to require illegal intent to predominate). <em>See also High 01\u2019 Times, supra; Hejira Corp., supra. </em>\u201cDesigned\u201d further limits the objects embraced by Act 946. \u201cDesigned for use,\u201d included in the Model Act and therefore extensively analyzed, was defined by the Supreme Court in <em>Flipside </em>as referring to the intent of the manufacturer or designer as embodied in the objective, structural characteristics of the object. <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 501, 102 S.Ct. at 1194. So defined, the object must not only be predominantly useful with illegal drugs, but that purpose must be apparent to the accused through the physical characteristics of the object. This excludes from the scope of Act 946 innocuous objects covertly intended for drug use by the designer or manufacturer. Examined in the context of this limiting language, the record reveals that at least some items sold in appellants\u2019 businesses are covered by Act 946\u2019s definition of drug device.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">The second phrase distinguishing Act 946 from Eagan\u2019s ordinance is that persons cannot be prosecuted unless they \u201cknow or have reason to know\u201d .that an object\u2019s design reveals it to be primarily useful with illegal drugs. A similar \u201creason to know\u201d standard contained in the Model Act was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>challenged as unconstitutionally vague. This challenge was based on the interpretation of the Model Act to proscribe all objects adaptable for drug use. Under this interpretation, a retailer could be convicted based on the purchaser\u2019s intent to use an innocent or multi-purpose object with illegal drugs, and therefore left \u201cinnocent sellers in the untenable posture of trying to divine the intentions of their buyer.\u201d <em>The Casbah, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 561. It was thus alleged that such a standard permitted sellers to be prosecuted based on the constructive knowledge of what they should have known given the attendant circumstances of the purchaser\u2019s age, dress and mannerisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">This reasoning does not apply to the \u201creason to know\u201d standard contained in Act 946. First, Act 946 does not define drug device in terms of the purchaser\u2019s intent; the object must possess objective, structural characteristics which reveal that it is \u201cdesigned to be primarily useful\u201d with illegal drugs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, defining drug devices in terms of what a person should have been aware of<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is not unconstitutionally vague. Numerous criminal statutes incorporating such standards have withstood constitutional attack.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See The Casbah, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 561 n. 13. Finally, Act 946 only prohibits the distribution of drug devices \u201cin the regular course of business or as a continuing course of conduct.\u201d This requirem\u00e9nt prevents Act 946 from being-enforced against those committing isolated violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">Support for our conclusion that Act 946 is sufficiently definite can be drawn by comparing it with the ordinance upheld in <em>Flip-side. </em>The <em>Flipside </em>ordinance made unlawful the sale of objects \u201cdesigned or marketed for use with illegal cannabis.\u201d The Supreme Court stated that this definition satisfied fair notice even \u201cunder the test appropriate to ... a criminal law.\u201d <em>Flipside, </em>455 U.S. at 500, 102 S.Ct. at 1194. Act 946 prohibits the distribution of objects \u201cdesigned to be primarily useful\u201d as an object usable with illegal drugs, with the additional requirement that the accused \u201cknow or have reason to know\u201d that the object is so designed. If the <em>Flipside </em>definition would satisfy fair notice under the stringent test applied to criminal statutes, then Act 946, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>by virtu\u00e9 of its additional specificity, must also be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Act 946 thus satisfies fair notice requirements. The \u201cdesigned to be primarily useful\u201d language excludes innocent objects and those equally adaptable for legal and prohibited uses, and Act 946 thereby embraces at least some of the items sold by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">Consistent with our power to interpret statutes in ways which support a finding of constitutionality, <em>The Casbah, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 557, we conclude that neither Act 78 nor Act 946 are unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">ACT 78</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 82-2601(y): The term \u201cDrug Paraphernalia\u201d means all equipment, products and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use, or designed for use, in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this Act (meaning the Controlled Substances Act of this State).

City of Eagan, </em>618 F.2d 26 (8th Cir.1980) (ordinance lacked mens rea element, applied equally to tobacco smoking accessories, and contained vague characteristics purporting but failing to distinguish legal from illegal pipes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">. Appellants assert only an overbreadth challenge to Act 78. They do not claim that the Act violates their personal first amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">. The text of Act 946 is set forth in the Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">. Convicting persons based on what they should have known about the manufacturer\u2019s or designer\u2019s intent as revealed by the structural characteristics of a particular object does not present a problem of transferred intent. The intent of the manufacturer or designer is embodied in the object itself and is apparent to all who perceive it. All that is required is for persons to open their eyes to the \u201cobjective realities\u201d of the items sold in their businesses. <em>The Casbah, Inc., </em>651 F.2d at 561. In contrast, a purchaser\u2019s intent is typically unascertaina-ble, and therefore presents a true transferred intent problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">. Under Arkansas law, a person has reason to know about attendant circumstances when he or she \u201cshould be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist....\u201d Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 41-203(4) (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">. Distinct from the issue of whether \u201creason to know\u201d is an unconstitutionally vague standard, we recognize, as indicated previously, that the mens rea element of knowledge, and perhaps to a lesser degree the element of reason to know, mitigates statutory vagueness by excluding from the law\u2019s scope those acting in good faith. <em>Boyce Motor Lines, supra; United States v. Ragen, </em>314 U.S. 513, 524, 62 S.Ct. 374, 378, 86 L.Ed. 383 (1942). Furthermore, the \u201cknow or have reason to know\u201d element is not a \u201ccircular\u201d mens rea standard which simply requires that the accuse.d willfully, purposefully or intentionally engage in conduct or cause a result \u201cthat is itself ambiguous.\u201d <em>Nova Records, </em>706 F.2d at 789-90; <em>Levas and Levas, </em>684 F.2d at 451; <em>Pennsylvania Accessories Trade Ass\u2019n, </em>565 F.Supp. at 1577. See W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 II, 86-87 (1972) (\u201ca person can willfully bring about certain results and yet be without fair warning that such conduct is proscribed.\u201d) See <em>also Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 149-57, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1058-61, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945) (plurality opinion) (Roberts, Frankfurter and Jackson, JJ., dissenting). This element requires the prosecution to prove that the accused knew or should have known of the very circumstance which appellants argue is unconstitutionally vague \u2014 whether or not a particular object is a drug device. In light of this requirement, appellants\u2019 claim is reduced to the assertion that Act 946 traps those acting in good faith by inadequately defining \u201cdrug device,\u201d even though persons cannot be convicted unless they were aware or should have been aware that an object\u2019s design revealed it to be such a device. This is reasoning to which we cannot subscribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
