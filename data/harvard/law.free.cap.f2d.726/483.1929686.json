On appellees\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, the district court invalidated this Alaska statute. The court ruled that the statute is preempted by Coast Guard regulations promulgated under Title II of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, as <em>amended by </em>the Ports and Tanker Safety Act of 1978 (PWSA/PTSA), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a (Supp. V 1981). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Unloaded oil tankers must take on seawater for ballast to ensure proper submergence and vessel stability. Upon arrival in port, the tankers must then discharge this ballast \u2014 i.e., \u201cdeballast\u201d \u2014 before loading their cargo tanks with oil. Ballast held in empty oil tanks will contain oil residue. Both the state and federal governments have been concerned about'the danger to the marine environment caused by regular pumping of large quantities of oil-polluted ballast into the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">During the past three decades, the federal government has sought to minimize environmental harm from oil tankers through a series of increasingly stringent statutes and international conventions. These measures cover many aspects of tanker safety, design, and traffic control. They also encompass measures designed to prevent accidental oil spills and authorize the Coast Guard to regulate deballasting. Pursuant to this authority, Coast Guard regulations prohibit deballasting from oil cargo tanks within fifty miles of shore. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 157.29, 157.37(a)(1) (1982). An exception is made, however, for the carefully monitored discharge of so-called \u201cclean\u201d ballast. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.43(a). \u201cClean\u201d ballast is that which \u201cif discharged from a vessel that is stationary into clean, calm water on a clear day would not produce visible traces of oil on the surface of the water or on adjoining shore lines ....\u201d 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.03(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">This deballasting prohibition and exception promulgated by the Coast Guard were first conceived by an international body in 1969, as part of amendments made that year to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two subsequent major international agreements also considered tanker pollution problems, including those caused by deballasting. They are the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Protocol of the 1978 International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention (the MARPOL Protocol). <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1911 (Supp. V 1981) (the enabling legislation to the MARPOL Protocol). The PWSA/PTSA and attendant Coast Guard regulations \u2014 including the de-ballasting standard at issue in this case\u2014 are based in large part upon MARPOL and the MARPOL Protocol. Although MAR-POL, the MARPOL Protocol, and the PWSA/PTSA made significant advances in a number of other areas of pollution control, no changes were made to the \u201cclean\u201d deballasting exception originally adopted by the 1969 convention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The PWSA/PTSA and the international conventions also addressed environmental problems posed by deballasting by requiring increasingly stricter design features and operational equipment on tankers. For example, new tankers of a certain size are required to have separate tanks to be used for ballast only and to have crude oil washing systems to clean the cargo tanks. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(7); 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 157.09(2), 157.35. In some respects, the PWSA/PTSA and Coast Guard regulations are even more stringent than international standards. For example, the PWSA/PTSA imposes design requirements on ships smaller than those covered by the MARPOL Protocol. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(7)(A). The Coast Guard, however, has never adopted a more restrictive definition of \u201cclean ballast\u201d and continues to enforce the same standards originally introduced by an international convention in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Meanwhile, the Alaska legislature has determined that even the small amount of oil contained in ballast meeting the federal definition of \u201cclean\u201d causes harm to the Alaskan marine environment. Thus, Alaska Stat. \u00a7 46.03.750(e) provides that absolutely no ballast water that has been held in oil cargo tanks may be discharged into the waters of the state. Absent an emergency, all tankers must use on-shore facilities to process ballast water containing oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">In addressing the issue of federal preemption presented by this case, we divide our discussion into two major inquiries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of express preemption language, we first address the. threshold question whether Congress in passing the PWSA/PTSA implicitly intended to occupy the field of regulating pollution from oil tankers within a state\u2019s territorial waters. In determining congressional intent, relevant subjects include the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151, 98 S.Ct. 988, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978); comprehensiveness of federal regulations; consideration of state police power; congressional intent that there be collaborative federal/state efforts to protect the marine environment; need for uniform regulation; history of regulation of the subject matter; and available legislative history. After addressing the threshold question, we conclude that Congress in passing the PWSA/PTSA did not intend to occupy the field of regulating pollution from oil tankers within a state\u2019s territorial waters. Having concluded that Congress did not intend to foreclose all state legislation in this field, we then address the second major question whether the Alaska statute is nonetheless void because it actually conflicts with the PWSA/PTSA and implementing Coast Guard regulations. On this critical issue, after considering the need to find actual conflict, the importance of reconciling the statutory schemes, and the objectives of the federal and state legislation, we conclude that no such conflict exists.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>I. <em>In Passing the PWSA/PTSA, Did Congress Implicitly Intend to Occupy the Field of Regulating Oil Tanker Pollution Within a State\u2019s Territorial Waters?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The PWSA/PTSA contains no explicit expression of congressional intent to preempt state law regulating oil tanker pollution within a state\u2019s territorial waters. Therefore, we must apply principles of preemption analysis to the challenged state statutory provision to determine implicit legislative intent. In this task, we are assisted by the fact that ours is not the first case to examine the preemptive effect of the PWSA/PTSA on state law. In <em>Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>435 U.S. 151, 98 S.Ct. 988, 55 L.Ed.2d 179 (1978), the Supreme Court examined the effect of the PWSA on a number of Washington statutes, including provisions requiring certain design safety features for tankers operating in Puget Sound. The Court held that these \u201cdesign requirements, standing alone, are invalid in light of the PWSA and its regulatory implementation.\u201d 435 U.S. at 160-61, 98 S.Ct. at 996. After examining the PWSA\u2019s comprehensive scheme for regulating tankers, the Court found that Congress had entirely occupied the field as to tanker design requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">This statutory pattern shows that Congress, insofar as <em>design characteristics </em>are concerned, has entrusted to the Secretary the duty of determining which oil tankers are sufficiently safe to be allowed to proceed in the navigable waters of the United States. This indicates to us that Congress intended uniform national standards for design and construction of tankers that would foreclose the imposition of different or more stringent state requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">435 U.S. at 163, 98 S.Ct. at 997 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The Court\u2019s finding of preemption is specifically limited to the regulation of vessel \u201cdesign characteristics\u201d and thus does not control the outcome of the present case involving ocean pollutant discharges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a matter of fact, the court specifically explained that tankers must meet \u201cotherwise valid state or federal rules or regulations that do not constitute design or construction specifications.\u201d 435 U.S. at 168-69, 98 S.Ct. at 999-1000. Even though <em>Ray </em>does not control the outcome of the present case, in addressing the preemption issue, we nonetheless are guided by the analytical approach followed in <em>Ray. </em>This approach recognizes the significance of the subject matter regulated. As we stressed in <em>Morseburg v. Balyon, </em>621 F.2d 972 (9th Cir.1980), the subject matter of regulation is critical in preemption analysis. Therefore, in making a preemption analysis, a court should examine those concerns emphasized by Congress in enacting the subject legislation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACK\">When the emphasis is to protect and strengthen national power, \u201coccupation\u201d and \u201cconflict\u201d are easily found while not so. easily found when the emphasis is to promote federalism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">. .. [T]he choice of emphasis is heavily influenced by the area of the law in which the issue arises. Thus, when the area concerns foreign affairs, as in <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941), or labor relations, as in <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959), the emphasis, not sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>prisingly, is on the national interest, while when the area is protection of consumers of commodities, as in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 83 S.Ct. 1210,10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), the emphasis understandably is upon the state\u2019s interest particularly and the imperatives of federalism generally. \u2022\u2022\u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">621 F.2d at 976-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">There are significant differences between the subject matter regulated in <em>Ray </em>\u2014 vessel design features \u2014 and that regulated here \u2014 ocean pollutant discharges. <em>Ray </em>recognizes these differences. As to design features, the Court noted that it \u201c[had] previously observed that ship design and construction standards are matters for national attention.\u201d 435 U.S. at 166 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. at 998 n. 15. The subject matter of environmental regulation, on the other hand, has long been regarded by the Court as particularly suited to local regulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ray </em>confirms this distinction: \u201cWe do not question in the slightest the prior cases holding that enrolled [those engaged in domestic or coastwise trade] and registered [those engaged in foreign trade] vessels must conform to \u2018reasonable, nondiscriminatory <em>conservation and environmental protection measures\u2019 ... imposed by a State.\u201d </em>435 U.S. at 164, 98 S.Ct. at 997 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">As the foregoing discussion makes clear, the holding of <em>Ray, </em>which involved a subject matter different from that involved here, cannot be applied mechanically to control the disposition of the present case. Thus, because <em>Ray </em>is not dispositive of the preemption issues presented by this case, we must now specifically inquire, as a threshold matter, whether Congress, when it passed the PWSA/PTSA, implicitly intended to occupy the field of regulating the discharge of pollutants from tankers within a state\u2019s territorial waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947), cautions that \u201cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by [federal legislation] unless that was the <em>clear and manifest </em>purpose of Congress.\u201d 331 U.S. at 230, 67 S.Ct. at 1152 (emphasis added). We must also keep, in mind that \u201c[t]he exercise of federal supremacy is not lightly to be presumed.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Texas, </em>344 U.S. 199, 203, 73 S.Ct. 232, 235, 97 L.Ed. 231 (1952).- The justification for such caution is that Congress certainly has the power to \u201cact so unequivocably as to make it clear that it intends no regulation but its own.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>331 U.S. at 236, 67 S.Ct. at 1155. Furthermore, if we are left with a doubt as to congressional purpose, we should be slow to find preemption, \u201c[f]or the state is powerless to remove the ill effects of our decision, while the national government, which has the ultimate power, remains free to remove the burden.\u201d <em>Penn Dairies v. Milk Control Comm\u2019n, </em>318 U.S. 261, 275, 63 S.Ct. 617, 624, 87 L.Ed. 748 (1943). Quoting <em>Rice, </em>331 U.S. at 230, 67 S.Ct. at 1152, the Court in <em>Ray </em>noted ways in which congressional intent may manifest itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">[The congressional] purpose may be evidenced in several ways. The scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it.... Or the Act of Congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">435 U.S. at 157, 98 S.Ct. at 994 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In our quest to determine whether Congress implicitly intended to occupy the field of regulating pollution caused by tanker deballasting within a state\u2019s territorial waters, we first note that on this subject the legislative history of the PWSA/PTSA is silent. But numerous other federal statutes provide convincing evidence of Congress\u2019 intent that, within three miles of shore, the protection of the marine environment should be a collaborative federal/state effort rather than an exclusively federal one. The PWSA/PTSA, which deals with a limited category of vessels and pollutants, is of course only a small part of the overall federal marine environmental protection scheme. The heart of the protection scheme is the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251-1376 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) (CWA) (also known as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the FWPCA). Enacted contemporaneously with the PWSA, the CWA was designed to regulate the discharge of any pollutant into the nation\u2019s navigable waters. Its goal is eventually to eliminate all pollution. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1). The method of regulation chosen was a permit system known as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES permit system), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342, to be governed by minimum federal standards (effluent limitations), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311. Under this system, the states maintain primary responsibility for abating pollution in their jurisdictions; they have authority to establish and administer their own permit systems and to set standards stricter than the federal ones. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1342(b), 1370. The role of the states is made clear by section 1251(b), which says: \u201cIt is the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution .. .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In <em>Pacific Legal Foundation v. Costle, </em>586 F.2d 650 (9th Cir.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>445 U.S. 198, 100 S.Ct. 1095, 63 L.Ed.2d 329 (1980), this court commented that \u201cthere is strong support in the legislative history [of the CWA] for a conclusion that Congress wanted to encourage a federal-state partnership for the control of water pollution. Leg. History at 1279 (comments of Senator Montoya).\u201d 586 F.2d at 657. Thus in the CWA Congress has clearly expressed its intent to allow the states to take an active role in abating water pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">This federal/state partnership in pollution regulation applies only to waters within the states\u2019 jurisdiction. Generally, the federal marine environmental protection scheme establishes a three-mile demarcation for states\u2019 authority over ocean pollution, and for most purposes \u2014 including pollution from vessels \u2014 the CWA applies only to the ocean within three miles of shore. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(7) \u2014 (8), (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Pollution beyond the three-mile limit is covered under a number of statutes, the central one being the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1444 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981) (MPRSA). This law also employs a permit system for ocean dumping but <em>expressly </em>preempts state regulation of such dumping while allowing states to propose criteria to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1402(b), 1416(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The above authorities demonstrate a congressional intent that there be joint federal/state regulation of ocean waters within three miles of shore. Such joint regulation undermines the argument that Congress in enacting the PWSA/PTSA implicitly intended to occupy the field of regulat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ing tanker pollution in a state\u2019s territorial waters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Indeed, Congress has shown its high regard for the states\u2019 environmental concerns by providing that the CWA, through the NPDES permit system, will enforce state water quality standards stricter than the minimums required by the CWA. The CWA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311(b)(1)(C), requires that \u201cthere shall be achieved [within the three-mile limit] ... any more stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality standards ... established pursuant to any state law or regulation ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Under another provision of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a)(1), a NPDES permit cannot be issued unless the requirements of section 1311 have been met. Further, the regulations implementing section 1342 provide that applicable state water quality standards shall be incorporated into the permit conditions along with other relevant effluent limitations. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.62; <em>see also </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.53(a), (e). Thus, absent preemption by another federal statute, such as the PWSA/PTSA, the Alaska statute at issue in this case is converted by the CWA into a federal standard which the EPA is required to enforce.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The CWA\u2019s non-preemption of Alaska\u2019s deballasting prohibition and the CWA\u2019s conversion of the prohibition into a federal CWA standard cannot insulate that prohibition against a challenge that it is preempted by the PWSA/PTSA. Nonetheless, the status of such state law under the CWA does provide convincing evidence of a well-settled congressional policy to promote a state\u2019s more stringent regulation of the local marine environment. The Supreme Court in <em>Ray </em>found that the regulation of the design or size of oil tankers was a subject matter in which there is an \u201cevident congressional intention to establish a uniform federal regime controlling the design of oil tankers.\u201d 435 U.S. at 165, 98 S.Ct. at 998. In contrast, our preceding discussion of the CWA demonstrates that Congress has indicated emphatically that there is no compelling need for uniformity in the regulation of pollutant discharges \u2014 and that there is a positive value in encouraging the development of local pollution control standards stricter than the federal minimums.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Appellees contend that the comprehensiveness of the PWSA/PTSA provides evidence of preemptive federal intent. But comprehensiveness alone is not enough to demonstrate a federal intent to occupy the entire field. The CWA \u2014 which allows concurrent state regulation \u2014 is as comprehensive in its regulation of pollution as the PWSA/PTSA is in its regulation of tankers.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">As the Court stated in <em>New York State Dep\u2019t of Social Serrs. v. Dublino, </em>413 U.S. 405, 415, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 2514, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>We reject ... the contention that preemption is to be inferred merely from the comprehensive character of the federal ... provisions .... The subjects of modern social and regulatory legislation often by their very nature require intricate and complex responses from the Congress, but without Congress necessarily intending its enactment as the exclusive means of meeting the problem ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIF\">As with the work incentive program considered in <em>Dublino, </em>the prevention of harm to the marine environment from oil tanker operations is a complex subject matter in which \u201ca detailed statutory scheme was both likely and appropriate, completely apart from any questions of pre-emptive intent.\u201d 413 U.S. at 415, 93 S.Ct. at 2514. Appellees stress that the legislative history of the PWSA/PTSA is clear about the necessity for a \u201csystems\u201d approach to tanker-caused oil pollution, based on a \u201cmix and match\u201d method of balancing and choosing among various regulatory options \u2014 some aimed at design, some at traffic control, others at vessel operation. That legislative history, however, may stand equally for the proposition that the problem of tanker-caused pollution is complex, must be approached from many angles, and requires a diversity of solutions. S.Rep. No. 724, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 13-14, <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2766, 2773-74. The complexity and comprehensiveness of federal marine environmental regulation are particularly appropriate without regard to the question of preemption because these regulations must \u201cbe sufficiently comprehensive to authorize and govern programs in States which had no ... requirements of their own as well as cooperatively in States with such requirements.\u201d <em>Dublino, </em>413 U.S. at 415, 93 S.Ct. at 2514.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Appellees further argue that only \u201cone single decisionmaker\u201d can perform the necessary balancing and choosing in this \u201cmix and match\u201d system of regulation. They rely on that portion of the PWSA/PTSA, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(1)(D), which directs the Coast Guard to perform a cost-benefit analysis by applying \u201cthe best available technology ... unless clearly shown to create an undue economic impact which is not outweighed by the benefits .... <em>\u201d </em>The weighing and balancing required in the CWA is, if anything, even more delicate and complex than in the PWSA/PTSA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Yet, in the CWA Congress determined that such decision-making could co-exist with the opportunity for states to set stricter standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">While design standards need to be uniform nationwide so that vessels do not confront conflicting requirements in different ports and so that the Coast Guard can promote international consensus on design standards, there is no corresponding dominant national interest in uniformity in the area of coastal environmental regulation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Here, in fact, the local community is more likely competent than the federal government to tailor environmental regulation to the ecological sensitivities of a particular area.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In preemption analysis, we should also consider whether the potential effect of the challenged state statute on international matters gives rise to a preemptive federal interest. In this case, the potential effect of Alaska\u2019s deballasting statute on international trade is easily distinguished from the effect of the state tanker design provisions invalidated in <em>Ray. </em>Although national uniformity and international consensus are critical concerns in the establishment of tanker design standards, those concerns are not essential in the regulation of pollutant discharges into coastal waters. Once a ship is constructed, it cannot meet new or different design requirements in various ports. A ship\u2019s discharge of pollutants can, however, be varied according to environmental standards and conditions in different jurisdictions. Hypothetically, state regulation regarding the discharge of pollutants could possibly interfere with the establishment of nationally uniform design requirements. But, for the most part local environmental regulations can co-exist \u2014 as they do here \u2014 -with federal regulations without impinging on the exclusively federal concerns of vessel design and traffic safety.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Moreover, the PWSA/PTSA does not mandate strict international uniformity. Although the legislative history of the PWSA/PTSA refers to congressional intent to abide by international agreements regarding the regulation of tankers, S.Rep. No. 724, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 23, <em>reprinted in </em>[1972] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2788-89, the statute nonetheless gives the Coast Guard specific authority to establish stricter standards than those set by international agreements, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(6). This indicates Congress\u2019 view that the international agreements set only minimum standards, that strict international uniformity was unnecessary, and that standards stricter than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the international m\u00ednimums could be desirable in waters subject to federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">More important to the question at hand, the following legislative history of the Oil Pollution Act Amendments of 1973, Pub.L. No. 93-119, 87 Stat. 424 (OPAA),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> approving the 1969 amendments to the 1954 International Convention for Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, expressly refers to the possibility of stricter standards to be set under the CWA. The OPAA announced standards for deballasting near shore identical to the standards subsequently promulgated by the Coast Guard in 1975 \u2014 the very same standards at issue here. Representative Clausen and Representative Dingell, floor manager of the legislation, specifically discussed the applicability of stricter standards within the three-mile limit of the territorial seas and the exclusivity of Coast Guard regulation beyond three miles.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">MR. CLAUSEN. Mr. Speaker, the next question will relate to enforcement proceedings beyond the territorial sea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">Will this come under the Environmental Protection Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">MR. DINGELL. No, this will be administered under the statute. We are considering that it will be administered by the Coast Guard, and it will be handled in that fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">MR. CLAUSEN. Well, what about on the Continental Shelf itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">MR. DINGELL. This is within the territorial sea. The Federal Water Pollution Act [CWA] will apply, and they will apply the more stringent standards, so that we could well have application as to vessels, tank and dry cargo and other vessels, both under international agreement and also under this particular statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">MR. CLAUSEN. So for the territorial sea the Environmental Protection Act would control it pretty much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">MR. DINGELL. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act [CWA], as amended would apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">119 Cong.Rec. 14,588 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">And again in the same debate Representative Clausen stated that the CWA is to apply in conjunction with the federal adoption of international standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-16\">Last year, we went as far as we could go by including in the Water Pollution Control Act [CWA] stringent controls prohibiting the discharge of oil in our territorial waters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-17\">This bill complements our efforts to control oil pollution within the 3-mile territorial sea by implementing the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-18\">Through the adoption of this measure we will be prohibiting the discharge of any oil up to 50 miles at sea and more stringently regulating any discharges beyond that distance. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-19\">Mr. Speaker, this legislation continues the long string of efforts we have made to make certain our water pollution control programs are both continuously updated and responsive to changing needs. In conjunction with the Water Pollution Control Act [CWA] it will help reduce and control pollution and I urge the House to give it overwhelming support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">119 Cong.Rec. 14,590 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the CWA incorporates stricter state standards, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>this legislative history demonstrates a congressional intent that state regulation of discharges proceed in conjunction with Coast Guard regulation of deballasting within the territorial seas. As the PWSA/PTSA covers subject matter parallel to that covered by the international agreement and amendments that were the focus of the OPAA, the legislative intent expressed by Representatives Clausen and Dingell should be equally applicable to the PWSA/PTSA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude Congress intended that stricter state standards for oil pollution within three miles of shore be enforced in addition to Coast Guard regulations issued under the PWSA/PTSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The above discussion shows that, unlike tanker design features controlled by <em>Ray, </em>there is no need for strict uniformity in regulating pollutant discharges into the territorial waters. To the contrary, Congress has repeatedly recognized the need for collaborative federal/state regulation of the marine environment within three miles of shore. Thus, we find that the federal marine environmental protection scheme as a whole does not prohibit stricter state standards regulating water pollution in a state\u2019s territorial waters, but in fact, through the CWA, would enforce those standards. Moreover, nothing inherent in the comprehensiveness or complexity of the regulations under the PWSA/PTSA implies a preemptive intent on the part of Congress as to the regulation of deballasting within three miles of shore. Finally, the legislative history of the OPAA, the statute which embodied congressional approval of the 1969 amendments to the 1954 International Convention for Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, contains express floor debate remarks that stricter standards under the CWA are to apply within three miles of shore. We therefore hold that, in enacting the PWSA/PTSA, Congress did not implicitly intend to occupy the field of regulating discharges of pollutants from tankers into a state\u2019s territorial waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">II. <em>Is the Alaska Statute Void Because it Actually Conflicts with the PWSA/PTSA and Implementing Coast Guard Regulations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Having found that Congress did not intend complete occupation of the field of regulating pollution from oil tankers within a state\u2019s territorial waters, we now address the question whether Alaska Stat. \u00a7 46.03.750(e) is void because it actually conflicts with the PWSA/PTSA and implementing Coast Guard regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\">Even if Congress has not completely foreclosed state legislation in a particular area, a state statute is void to the extent that it <em>actually conflicts </em>with a valid federal statute.

The purpose of both the Alaska de-ballasting prohibition and the CWA is the same: to eliminate damage to the marine environment from the discharge of pollutants into the nation\u2019s waters.

As discussed <em>supra </em>at pp. 581, and 590-592, the Coast Guard\u2019s deballasting regulations are based on those adopted by a 1969 international convention. The terms of these deballasting rules as adopted by Congress in the 1973 OPAA establish clearly that the goal was to eliminate deballast-ing from cargo tanks within fifty miles of shore, with an exception carved out only for ballast that had been stored in a cleaned tank.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The history of regulation under the PWSA/PTSA and the adoption of new international standards show a continuing effort to reduce the discharge of ballast from cargo tanks. The 1973 MARPOL and regulations under the PWSA required all new vessels over 70,000 DWT (deadweight tons) to have segregated ballast tanks, and the vessels were prohibited from storing ballast in cargo tanks unless required by emergency weather conditions. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 .157.-09(a), 157.35. The 1978 MARPOL Protocol extended the requirements to all new tankers over 20,000 DWT. Existing tankers over 40,000 DWT were required either to retrofit with segregated ballast tanks or to install a crude oil washing system. The PTSA increased the requirements as to existing tankers by imposing them on all tankers over 20,000 DWT. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(7)(A). In enacting the PTSA, Congress specifically ordered the Coast Guard to undertake \u201cthe reduction or elimination of discharges during deballasting .... \u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(6)(A)(vii). In the context of the general prohibition against cargo tank discharges within fifty miles of shore and the repeated changes in design requirements aimed at eliminating cargo-tank ballasting, it is difficult to argue convincingly that the Congress or the. Coast Guard intended to create a federal right to discharge ballast containing oil into a state\u2019s coastal waters. <em>See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, </em>437 U.S. at 132, 98 S.Ct. at 2217.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Although we conclude that the objectives of the Alaska statute do not conflict with those of the Coast Guard regulations under the PWSA/PTSA, we must nevertheless determine whether the facts of this case as alleged or conceded by appellees reveal an irreconcilable conflict when the Alaska statute and Coast Guard regulations are applied concurrently in Alaska territorial waters. Here again we must be guided by the Court\u2019s reluctance to entertain hypothetical conflicts because \u201c[i]n this as in other areas of coincident federal and state regulation, the \u2018teaching of this Court\u2019s decisions .. . enjoin[s] seeking out conflicts between state and federal regulation where none clearly exists.\u2019 \u201d 437 U.S. at 130, 98 S.Ct. at 2216, <em>quoting Seagram &amp; Sons v. Hostetter, </em>384 U.S. 35, 45, 86 S.Ct. 1254, 1261, 16 L.Ed.2d 336 (1966) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">No party asserts that it is physically impossible to comply with both the Alaska statute and the relevant Coast Guard regulations. Furthermore, the Alaska statute was amended in 1980 to make clear that it would not apply in cases where safety reasons dictated non-compliance. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 46.03.750(a)-(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellees argue that the Alaska regulation nevertheless conflicts with the PWSA/PTSA because it interferes with the delicate, cost-effective balance the Coast Guard has achieved among design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and operational features by rendering some of the most expensive equipment, such as crude oil washing systems, superfluous. According to the affidavits submitted to the district court, the typical practice of tankers is to discharge dirty ballast beyond fifty miles, clean the tanks, take on new ballast and then discharge this \u201cclean\u201d ballast in port. If on-shore treatment is required then arguably this two-step operation could be avoided and thus such design features as tank-washing equipment may be unnecessary. There appears to be room, however, for both the PWSA/PTSA and Alaska\u2019s de-ballasting regulations to operate purposefully. The tank-washing equipment would still be necessary for vessels entering ports in other states which do not have a cargo-tank deballasting prohibition. <em>See Dublino, </em>413 U.S. at 415, 93 S.Ct. at 2514. Furthermore, the legislative history of the bill enacting the 1978 MARPOL Protocol establishes the importance of crude oil washing systems even where there are segregated ballast tanks, because sludge builds up in the cargo tanks and reduces the amount of deliverable cargo. H.R.Rep. No. 1224, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6, <em>reprinted in </em>[1980] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4849, 4852. The tank-cleaning features could serve the further purpose of protecting the waters within fifty miles of shore from environmental damage that might be caused if ballast were released from a cargo tank during an emergency or accident. Finally, the tankers calling on Alaska\u2019s ports also may apply to the Coast Guard under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a(7)(N) for exemptions from the required design features on the basis that adequate on-shore facilities exist to process all ballast water.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Appellees further argue that the Alaska statute conflicts with the PWSA/PTSA because it is an indirect design feature. Unlike the Washington State statute considered in <em>Ray, </em>Alaska has neither set out any required design features, nor has it even sought to impose different conditions on vessels not meeting preferred design cri-t\u00e9ria (as was held permissible under Title I of the PWSA by the Court in <em>Ray, </em>435 U.S. at 173, 98 S.Ct. at 1002). Similar to the division of regulatory authority in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322, discussed <em>supra </em>at note 13, Alaska has left all designing of vessels and equipment to the Coast Guard and has only prohibited the discharge of polluted ballast. While this requirement may impose some financial burden on the regulated vessels and require their owners to make some economic choices in order to comply, such a burden neither converts the discharge prohibition into a design feature nor justifies a finding of federal preemption.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Finally, appellees and amicus argue that Alaska is unique in its ability to process ballast because of the existence of a huge, expensive processing facility at Valdez, built as part of the legislative compromise which allowed the Trans-Alaska pipeline to be constructed. They argue that other states do not have such large on-shore treatment capacity and that the Coast Guard has adopted its regulation allowing deballasting from cargo tanks because an across-the-board on-shore processing requirement would severely overload facilities in many areas of the country. 42 Fed.Reg. 32,671 (1977).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although these considerations might lead to a different analysis in a future case dealing with another state\u2019s regulations, they are inapplicable here because Alaska has expansive on-shore processing facilities and no party has complained that enforcement of Alaska\u2019s debal-lasting regulation would cause the facilities to be overloaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">We are guided here by the principles set forth in <em>Pacific Legal Foundation v. State Energy Resources, Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>659 F.2d 903 (9th Cir.1981), <em>aff'd sub nom. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.

Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed insofar as it holds that the prohibition of discharge of ballast from cargo tanks into state territorial waters under Alaska Stat. \u00a7 46.03.750(e) is preempted by federal regulation and void under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">This case is REVERSED and REMANDED to the district court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of appellants on the preemption issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\">.

Although the PWSA/PTSA is based in large part on the international agreements discussed in our opinion, the specific deballasting standard promulgated internationally in 1969 is not spelled out in the PWSA/PTSA.

In <em>Ray, </em>the Court addressed a number of preemption issues under both Titles I and II of the PWSA. As <em>Ray </em>explains, \u201c[t]he focus of Title I, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1227, is traffic control at local ports; Title II\u2019s principal concern is tanker design and construction.\u201d 435 U.S. at 161, 98 S.Ct. at 996. For purposes of our preemption analysis, Title II is the relevant portion of the PWSA/PTSA because the Act\u2019s deballasting provisions are found there. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 391a. Ray found several parts of Washington State\u2019s tanker provisions preempted by the PWSA, but did so primarily in the area of traffic control governed by Title I.

In another preemption case, albeit one in which the federal legislation contains express nonpreemption language, the Supreme Court specifically acknowledged the importance and appropriateness of state regulation of oil pollution. In <em>Askew v. American Waterways Operators, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 325, 93 S.Ct. 1590, 36 L.Ed.2d 280 (1973), the Court indicated that it disfavored \u201callowpng] federal admiralty jurisdiction to swallow most of the police power of the states over oil spillage \u2014 an insidious form of pollution of vast concern to every coastal city or port and to all the estuaries on which the life of the ocean and the lives of the coastal people are greatly dependent.\u201d 411 U.S. at 328-29, 93 S.Ct. at 1594.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\">.

Appellees argue against reference to the CWA in determining intent under the PWSA/PTSA on the grounds that the CWA is a statute of general applicability only peripherally related to deballasting while the PWSA/PTSA is a more specific and more recent enactment. It is open to debate whether the more specific versus general principle applies when the \u201cgeneral\u201d statute, the CWA, is actually one intended to subject all polluters to a comprehensive, detailed permit process directed at the pollutants sought to be discharged. In any event, principles of construction requiring the more recent and specific statute to prevail over the earlier and more general only apply when there is an irreconcilable conflict between statutes. <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 266, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1677-1678, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981); <em>In re Pacific Far East Line, Inc., </em>644 F.2d 1290, 1294 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Furthermore, the court must seek to harmonize two potentially conflicting statutes: \u201cWe must read the statutes to give effect to each if we can do so while preserving their sense and purpose.\u201d <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. at 267, 101 S.Ct. at 1678. This principle has been recently invoked in two of our decisions involving overlapping federal statutes in the areas of environmental regulation and management of marine resources. In <em>Get Oil Out! Inc. v. Exxon Corp., </em>586 F.2d 726 (9th Cir.1978), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">It is our obligation to so construe federal statutes so that they are consistent with each other, as by this means congressional intent can be given its fullest expression. \u201c[W]hen two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts ... to regard each as effective.\u201d <em>Radzanower v.

Another decision presenting a question of statutory construction similar to the present case is <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>545 F.2d 1281 (10th Cir.1976). There the court construed two federal sentencing provisions, one incorporating state law as the CWA does, and the other providing additional federal sentencing authority. In harmonizing the provisions the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">The problem is one of construing two statutes, neither enacted in any obvious contemplation of the other but each bearing upon the other when both are involved in the factual situation presented. In such circumstances we should seek a solution which avoids violence to the terms of either but which brings both into correlation, since to construe either in isolation from the other would thwart the intention of Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">545 F.2d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">In the present case, as our opinion demonstrates, the PWSA/PTSA can coexist with the CWA, which adopts Alaska\u2019s deballasting statute through the NPDES permit system. Accordingly, we need not turn to those'principles of statutory construction allowing one statute to supplant the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b562-15\">. In dealing with the CWA the district court and the appellees focused their attention on the oil spill provisions of the statute. The CWA, however, regulates oil pollution under two separate schemes. The first is found in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321, a statute specifically aimed at oil spills and their clean-up. The second is the NPDES permit system, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311, 1342. The permit system more clearly demonstrates Congress\u2019 intent that there be federal/state collaboration in the regulation of pollutant discharges within the territorial waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">Although both the oil spill provisions and the permit provisions of the CWA contain language explicitly stating that state laws are not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>preempted, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321(o)(2), 1370, as discussed in the text of our opinion, the permit system goes further by providing that any permit granted for discharges within the three-mile limit must incorporate more stringent state water quality requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Moreover, the general NPDES permit requirements apply in addition to any provisions, such as section 1321, governing a specific subject matter \u2014 oil discharges. <em>See United States v. Hamel, </em>551 F.2d 107, 109-12 (6th Cir.1977) (general permit provisions of section 1311 apply in addition to specific prohibitions concerning oil discharges contained in section 1321); <em>cf. Pacific Legal Foundation v. Quarles, </em>440 F.Supp. 316 (C.D.Cal.1977) (general permit provisions of section 1311 apply in addition to specific provisions of section 1343 pertaining to ocean pollution), <em>aff'd sub nom.

Ordinarily, courts seeking to determine implicit legislative intent confine themselves to . the language and legislative history of the statute in question \u2014 here, the PWSA/PTSA. Authority exists, however, for looking at the entire federal statutory scheme relative to a particular subject matter, especially when that subject matter is dealt with under a number of separate enactments, some of which were enacted contemporaneously \u2014 as were the CWA and the PWSA. For example, in <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974), the Supreme Court construed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and examined congressional intent regarding the continuation of Indian hiring preferences in the Bureau of Indian Affairs by reference to two other laws dealing with the same subject matter, but which were contained in different statutes and titles of the United States Code. Another example is <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee </em>Corp.,-U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984) where the Supreme Court looked to the legislative history and regulations of the Price-Anderson Act to determine congressional preemptive, intent in the earlier enactment of the Atomic Energy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">Particularly where two federal statutes have overlapping areas of regulation, as do the CWA and PWSA/PTSA, it is permissible and helpful to examine the history and context under which they were enacted. This history and context may include other statutes, executive orders, hearings of legislative committees dealing with the subject matters of regulation, and, as in this case, pertinent international agreements and statutes adopting them. For other examples of the use of such materials in construing ambiguous statutes, see Silkwood,-U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 622-26; <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. at 270-73, 101 S.Ct. at 1680-1681; <em>Morton, </em>417 U.S. at 550-55, 94 S.Ct. at 2482-2485; and <em>City of Burbank v.

Unlike <em>Ray, </em>this case involves subject matter squarely within the ambit of the CWA and is therefore clearly and properly distinguishable. The <em>Ray </em>footnote does not control this case for the same reason that Ray\u2019s holding does not control this <em>case </em>\u2014 Ray is specifically and narrowly confined to a different subject matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b564-4\">. Under the CWA, the EPA must balance costs and benefits, with reference to the following factors set forth in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1314(b)(1)(B):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">Factors relating to the assessment of best practicable control technology currently available to comply with ... Section 1311 of this title [on effluent limitations] shall include consideration of the total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved from such application, and shall also take into account the age of equipment and facilities involved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques, process changes, non-water quality environmental impact (including energy requirements), and such other factors as the Administrator deems appropriate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">. Of course, as to environmental regulation of deep ocean waters, the federal interest in uniformity is paramount. Such regulation in most cases needs to be exclusive because the only hope of achieving protection of the environment beyond our nation\u2019s jurisdiction is through international cooperation. These considerations do not, however, apply to the waters of the territorial seas which lie within three miles of shore and which can be subject to both federal and state enforcement. The distinguishing factors here are analogous to those considered in the first Supreme Court opinion on preemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Now the power to regulate commerce embraces a vast field, containing not only many, but exceedingly various subjects, quite unlike in their nature; some imperatively demanding a single uniform rule, operating equally on the commerce of the United States in every port; and some, like the subject now in question, as imperatively demanding that diversity, which alone can meet the local necessities of navigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Cooley v.

Consider, for example, the regulation of marine sanitation devices and their discharges under the CWA. Sewage from vessels is one of two specific exemptions from the permit system of the CWA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(6). Sewage from vessels is exclusively regulated under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322. Under this section of the CWA, the EPA, after consulting the Coast Guard, sets standards for the performance of marine sanitation devices. The Coast Guard then promulgates consistent regulations covering design, construction, and operation of such devices. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(b)(1). The Coast Guard has the exclusive authority to regulate these devices, but states \u00e1re free to determine that their waters require greater protection and may prohibit discharge of any sewage from vessels if the EPA determines that adequate facilities are reasonably available for removal and treatment. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(f)(3). Local prohibition of the discharge of sewage from vessels as allowed by section 1322 has been applied to foreign vessels without adverse results on international trade and has been held not to intrude on the constitutional treaty-making powers of the United States. <em>Lake Carriers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Kelley, </em>527 F.Supp. 1114, 1130-31 (E.D.Mich.1981), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>456 U.S. 985, 102 S.Ct. 2264, 73 L.Ed.2d 1280 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">We note in passing that in section 1322 Congress carved out an area of regulation otherwise covered by the NPDES permit system, including applicable state standards, and placed part of it within the exclusive domain of the Coast Guard. The fact that Congress did not do the same for the discharge of pollutants from tankers demonstrates its intent to regulate deballasting under both the effluent limitations and permit sections of the CWA (and the state standards incorporated therein) as well as under the PWSA/PTSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">We repeat that we are not holding that state standards under the CWA could never imper-missibly interfere with the Coast Guard\u2019s exclusive domain. Even the language of the CWA itself recognizes this possibility by requiring NPDES permits to incorporate Coast Guard regulations regarding the \u201csafe transportation, handling, carriage, storage,-and stowage of pollutants.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(g). The general regulatory picture, however, is one of congres-sionally intended cooperation and collaboration between the Coast Guard and the combined federal/state regulatory authorities under the CWA. <em>See, e.g., </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(b)(2)(A), (b)(3), (b)(6)(A) &amp; (b)(6)(B) (allocating division of labor among the various regulatory bodies specified in the CWA provisions on hazardous substances and oil spills).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\">.

Certainly the Alaska deballasting prohibition and the CWA provide a more absolute prohibition on pollutants than the PWSA/PTSA. But we must bear in mind that the Alaska prohibition and CWA are limited to the narrow three-mile band of coastal waters, and that the PWSA/PTSA must also deal with the high seas where the United States acts as a party to international agreements, rather than as a sovereign setting its own standards. <em>See supra </em>note 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Appellees argue at length that the Alaska deballasting law has the same purpose as the PWSA/PTSA and that such coincidence leads inevitably to the conclusion of preemption. Similarity of purpose is listed as a test of preemption in <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). Coincidence of purpose, however, does not necessarily determine the preemption issue. As the Court stated in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">[I]t is suggested that the coexistence of federal and state regulatory legislation should depend upon whether the <em>purposes </em>of the two laws are parallel or divergent. This Court has, on the one hand, sustained state statutes having objectives virtually identical to those of federal regulations, <em>California v. Zook, </em>336 U.S. 725, 730-731 [69 S.Ct. 841, 843-844, 93 L.Ed. 1005]; <em>cf. De Veau v. Braisted, </em>363 U.S. 144, 156-157 [80 S.Ct. 1146, 1152-1153, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109]; <em>Parker v.

Similarly, in <em>City of Burbank v.

As the <em>Exxon </em>and <em>Inglis </em>cases teach, in an area of collaborative federal and state regulation, coincidence of purpose actually militates against, rather than in favor of, preemption. \u201cWhere the Government has provided for collaboration the courts should not find conflict.\u201d <em>Union Brokerage Co. v.

While state prohibition of conduct allowed by federal regulation may sometimes be preempted, such a conclusion requires greater evidence of preemptive intent than that present in this case. In <em>Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. de la Cuesta, </em>458 U.S. 141, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664 (1982), the Court held that a California prohibition against due-on-sale mortgage clauses was preempted because federal regulations allowed federally chartered savings associations to use those clauses. There the federal agency had \u201cunequivocally expresse[d] the ... determination to displace state law,\u201d based on its finding that the use of due-on-sale clauses was \u201ccritical to \u2018the financial stability of \u201d the regulated institutions. 458 U.S. at 156, 102 S.Ct. at 3024 (citations omitted). By contrast, in the present case, while the Coast Guard apparently considered but chose not to impose a total prohibition on deballasting from cargo tanks, it did not make any specific findings that as to Alaskan waters such prohibition would seriously affect vital concerns for the safety of vessels or the environment. Here also, unlike <em>de la Cuesta, </em>the state is merely eliminating one exception to a general federal prohibition, rather than asserting authority over an area in direct conflict with overriding federal policy. In short, the state\u2019s deballasting prohibition coincides with the general federal policy that prohibits debal-lasting from cargo tanks except under very limited conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002 and 1004 were amended in 1973 by the OPAA to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">Sec. 1002.

The CWA imposes two sets of criteria on ocean pollution: the first is the general effluent limitations and NPDES permit system; the second is a section specially referring to ocean pollution that prohibits any discharges that would \u201cunreasonably degrad[e] the ocean environment.\u201d 440 F.Supp. at 324; <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1976). In <em>Pacific Legal Foundation, </em>the plaintiffs argued that only the latter section should be applied since the strict \u201csecondary treatment\u201d standard required under the general effluent limitations and permit sections would render the looser specialized ocean pollution criteria \u201ccomparatively useless\u201d in most cases. 440 F.Supp. at 324. As in this case, Congress neglected to specify how these two environmental laws were to relate to each other. The court found that a limited role for the latter section could still exist and, after examining the legislative history, ruled that, considering the strength of congressional intent to eliminate pollution and the absolutist nature of the permit system\u2019s coverage, Congress intended both sets of criteria to apply concurrently. 440 F.Supp. at 322-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">. Currently all tankers, except the <em>Alaska Standard, </em>using Alaskan ports are discharging cargo-tank ballast into on-shore processing facilities. Appellees attempt to convince us that the Alaska law effectively excludes the <em>Alaska Standard </em>from the state\u2019s waters because of a disfavored design feature that makes it difficult for the vessel to comply with the state\u2019s debal-lasting provision. The district court never reached this issue because it found that the PWSA/PTSA had preempted the field. Although there was some factual dispute at the district court over the relative merits and costs of alternative methods of compliance with the Alaska deballasting prohibition, even appellees concede that a range of alternatives exists, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>more than one of which would allow the Alaska Standard to continue to make all of its ports of call in Alaska. For example, its owner could build an on-shore processing facility at each port it visits, or could pump ballast onto a barge for transportation and later processing at an existing facility, or could retrofit the <em>Standard </em>with segregated ballast tanks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b573-16\">. The only other evidence of this potential conflict that appellees present is an assertion by the Coast Guard in an Environmental Impact Statement, not made available to this court, voicing a similar concern regarding the adequacy and availability of on-shore processing facilities in some jurisdictions,-but apparently lacking specific reference or findings as to Alaska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
