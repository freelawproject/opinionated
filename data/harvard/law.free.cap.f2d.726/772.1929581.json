A total of eight petitions for review were generated. The first three, which we refer to as Group I, were filed by Gallup in this circuit several days before the Commission actually issued its order. The next three, comprising Group II, were two filed by PNM in the Tenth Circuit and one by Gallup in this circuit. All Group II petitions were file-stamped between 2:59:25 p.m. and 2:59:57.3 p.m., E.S.T., on the day the Commission issued its order. A few days later, the last two petitions, Group III, were one filed by PNM in the Tenth and another by Gallup in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-24\">We dismissed Gallup\u2019s remaining Group I petitions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as premature, transferred Gallup\u2019s Group II petition to the Tenth Circuit, in which one of PNM\u2019s Group II petitions had been filed a split-second sooner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>dismissed Gallup\u2019s Group III petition <em>sua </em>sponte.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our decision to transfer the Group II petition derived from our interpretation of the statutory directive that, \u201c[i]f proceedings have been instituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same order[,] the ... commission ... shall file the record in that one of such courts in which a proceeding with respect to such order was first instituted.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a procedure which we previously had utilized,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and which had received apparent approval by the Third Circuit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we deferred to the Tenth Circuit<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for determination of the validity of the earlier but arguably premature Group II petition filed by PNM in that court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We dismissed Gallup\u2019s Group III petition \u201c[i]n the interest of administrative ease.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We viewed that petition as \u201cdupli-cative,\u201d noting that \u201cthere [was] no assertion that Gallup\u2019s [Group II] petition [was] premature.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Subsequently, however, the Tenth Circuit dismissed all three Group II petitions as indeed premature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court established 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., when the Commission officially issues its orders, as moments critical to timely filing of review petitions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the petitioners had not asserted that their respective petitions \u2014 all timestamped earlier than 3:00 p.m. \u2014 had actually been filed at or after 3:00 p.m., the Tenth Circuit held all of the Group II petitions invalid.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court also found that PNM\u2019s Group III petition was the first to be timely filed, and directed the Commission to file the administrative record in that court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-19\">Gallup then returned to this court with a motion for leave to petition for rehearing out of time and a tendered petition seeking rehearing of our order and recall of our mandate insofar as the order dismissed Gallup\u2019s Group III review petition. Gallup alleges that it will effectively be deprived of its right of review unless that petition is reinstated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-20\">Because of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s unanticipated action, our dismissal of Gallup\u2019s Group III petition has had an unintended effect. The assumption upon which we based our action \u2014 that Gallup\u2019s Group II petition would not be held premature by the Tenth Circuit \u2014 has proven to be erroneous. Since the statutory time period for filing a new petition has now expired,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Gallup will be unable to obtain judicial review unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>this court responds favorably to the present request.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">These circumstances clearly necessitate a reopening of the matter. Just as clearly, they could not have been foreseen by Gallup during the normal time period for presentation of a petition for rehearing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We thus will allow Gallup to file its petition for rehearing, and will reinstate Gallup\u2019s Group III petition for review. We will, however, transfer that petition to the Tenth Circuit, wherein the remainder of the litigation is now pending,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the administrative record has been ordered filed,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and exclusive jurisdiction to review will reside.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">\n<em>Order accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-15\">.
