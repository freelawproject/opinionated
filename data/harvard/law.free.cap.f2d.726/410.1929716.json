Tatum appeals from a final order entered in the District Court for the Northern District of Iowa dismissing his case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>failure to comply with a magistrate\u2019s order to attend the final pretrial conference. Tatum explained that he did not attend the conference because he believed that the same counsel appointed to represent him on a prior appeal, <em>see Tatum v. Liberty Housing Co., </em>701 F.2d 744 (8th Cir.1983), would continue to represent him on remand and would notify him if his presence were required. Because h\u00e9 was not so notified, he did not attend the pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We believe the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Tatum\u2019s complaint. \u201cWe do not consider a dismissal with prejudice under [Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) ] lightly, for the effect of such an order is to forever deny a plaintiff access to the courts for the impartial resolution of potentially meritorious claims.\u201d <em>Darms v. McCulloch Oil Corp., </em>720 F.2d 490, 494 (8th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). The record contains nothing from Tatum\u2019s appointed counsel on appeal notifying him that counsel\u2019s representation would end with the appe\u00e1l. In light of this fact and the district court\u2019s certification of Tatum as a pauper, Tatum might very well have believed that he was represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
