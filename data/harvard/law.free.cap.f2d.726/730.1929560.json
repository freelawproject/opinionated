Kerr from his position at NEA. We vacate and remand the Board\u2019s determination of January 11, 1983, that the agency had complied with the April 9, 1981 order which had cancelled petitioner\u2019s termination, and we affirm the Board\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for attorney fees for the litigation leading to the April 9, 1981 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Kerr was involuntarily terminated by the NEA, effective August 31, 1979, from his position as Director of Education Programs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following petitioner\u2019s appeal of his dismissal to the MSPB\u2019s Boston Field Office, the presiding official issued an initial decision on September 2, 1980 in which he ordered that the termination action be cancelled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its opinion and order dated April 9, 1981, the Board denied NEA\u2019s petition for review of this decision, and ordered the agency \u201cto furnish evidence of compliance with the initial decision to the Field Office within ten (10) days of the date of this order\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">A lengthy struggle ensued during the next several months over the agency\u2019s compliance with that order \u2014 involving petitioner, the agency, and the Boston Regional Office. After the Regional Director of the MSPB\u2019s Boston Office on October 6, 1981, set a November 5, 1981 hearing date on compliance issues, the agency (on October 8, 1981) sent petitioner a letter ordering his return to active duty on November 16,1981. The letter indicated that petitioner was to be returned to his former position, Director of Education Programs, at the same grade and pay as he had held previously. Petitioner responded with the assertion that, between the dates of his removal and the Board\u2019s reinstatement order, NEA had shifted all the duties and responsibilities of his previously held position to another posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>tion entitled Director, Artists-In-Schools Program. He claimed that, because no new duties had been assigned to the Director of Education Programs position, it had become a \u201csham\u201d position to which the agency wished to reinstate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">A compliance hearing was held on November 6, 1981, and an initial decision issued on February 22, 1982, in which the Regional Director found that (1) the agency had improperly denied Mr. Kerr a timely return to active duty by at least eight months, and (2) the position to which the agency returned petitioner existed only on paper and was a sham. He recommended that Kerr be transferred to the position which now embodied his former duties and responsibilities, i.e., Director, Artists-In-Schools Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Both parties appealed the Regional Director\u2019s initial decision. NEA maintained that it had reinstated petitioner to his former position with duties comparable to his former duties; petitioner argued that the Regional Director had failed to examine whether the .agency\u2019s actions had resulted from retaliation by the agency\u2019s then chairman based on personal animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In the January 11, 1983 opinion and order \u2014 the order now on review \u2014 the MSPB (1) sustained the presiding official\u2019s refusal to consider petitioner\u2019s retaliation claim, (2) held that the agency had complied with the Board\u2019s April 9,1981, order (cancelling petitioner\u2019s termination) \u201cwhen it returned [petitioner] to active duty in his former position ...\u201d because \u201c[a]bsent a reduction in grade or pay, a reassignment of positions or duties is not an action appealable to the Board\u201d, and (3) agreed that the agency\u2019s failure to return Kerr to active duty within a reasonable time constituted substantial noncompliance with the Board\u2019s April 9, 1981 order, but declined to adopt several admonishments of the agency recommended by the Regional Director. Petitioner maintains that the Board erred in holding that simply reinstating him to his former title, grade and pay was sufficient to constitute compliance, and also in failing to make factual findings concerning the claim that the adverse personnel actions taken against him resulted from personal animus by NEA officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Before us, also, is the government\u2019s motion to dismiss this aspect of the case as moot; it is said that, even if petitioner \u201chad very few duties upon his return to the Endowment\u201d, he now \u201chas substantial current responsibilities\u201d. Petitioner opposes the motion, asserting that his allegation is \u201cas accurate today as it was prior to the initiation of this appeal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We hold that the MSPB erred as a matter of law in ruling that its authority over the matter of compliance ended when petitioner resumed active duty in his former position at the same grade and pay. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Contrary to the Board\u2019s characterization (in its January 11, 1983 opinion) of Kerr\u2019s current complaint, the compliance issue is not an original \u201cpersonnel action\u201d concerning a reassignment of duties without change of grade or pay, actions which are generally not appealable to the Board. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a). Rather, the real question here is that of the Board\u2019s enforcement powers over the agency\u2019s compliance with the Board\u2019s prior order of April 9, 1981. Congress expressly granted the Board special power to enforce compliance with its orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">\n<em>Powers and Functions of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Special Counsel</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-12\">(a) The Merit Systems Protection Board shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">(1) hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, section 2023 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-14\">(2) order any Federal Agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection <em>and enforce compliance with any such order....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a)(1)(2) (emphasis added). That the inclusion of this provision (a)(2) was meant to be a broad grant of enforcement power is indicated by the legislative history to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">The committee included a provision ... making explicit the Board\u2019s enforcement authority. The Board is authorized to order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board pursuant to any matter within its jurisdiction, <em>and to take appropriate steps to enforce compliance with its order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 29, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. News 2723, 2751 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 2728.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The original MSPB order of April 9, 1981 directed the agency to comply with the initial (presiding official\u2019s) decision that petitioner\u2019s termination be cancelled. The purpose of such a cancellation order is to place the employee as nearly as possible in the <em>status quo ante.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In our view, appropriate steps to enforce compliance must include more than the formal determination that an individual was reinstated to a position bearing the same title, grade and pay\u2014 no matter what the actual content of that position may be at the time of reinstatement. Rather, the Board should, where appropriate, also make a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge. Further, the Board should order corrective action in eases of non-compliance, authority for which resides in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a)(2), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We cannot distinguish, in this regard, the MSPB\u2019s remedial powers from those of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). As the Supreme Court stated in one NLRB case, the basic purpose of a reinstatement or back pay order is \u201crestoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination\u201d. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). The NLRB has held that reinstatement offers (1) must be made in good faith, <em>see Earl I. Sifers, </em>92 NLRB 1280 (1951), (2) must be unequivocal, <em>see Leeding Sales Co., </em>155 NLRB 753 (1965), and (3) must encompass employment which is substantially the same as that previously held before discharge, see <em>Thomas J. Aycock, Jr., </em>154 NLRB 1716 (1965), enforced as modified 377 F.2d 81 (5th Cir.1967). Despite a good faith claim by petitioner, and a specific finding by the Regional Director, that those conditions were not fulfilled here (particularly the last), the MSPB wholly failed to consider whether the Director\u2019s initial findings were correct or sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">The Board erred in this determination that petitioner\u2019s mere reinstatement to his former title at the same grade and pay ended any further consideration by the MSPB concerning actual compliance. The matter of compliance did not end with that formal reinstatement, and the Board had and has jurisdiction to consider the particulars of petitioner\u2019s claim under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1205(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">We therefore vacate that portion of the January 11, 1983 order and remand the compliance issue to the Board for a substantive evaluation of petitioner\u2019s allegations and a determination concerning the correctness of the Regional Director\u2019s compliance decision in light of the discussion <em>supra. </em>The Board may, if it wishes, open the record to further evidence, and if it does so may, of course, return the case to the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>gional Director (or other appropriate official). In light of this remand to the Board, we also leave open to the Board a re-assessment of its evaluation of petitioner\u2019s \u201cpersonal animus\u201d claims, should it find a reevaluation necessary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Furthermore, because it could only be a finding that there has been full compliance that could render this case moot, and we can make no such finding at this time, we deny without prejudice the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. On remand, the Board may take account of the facts set forth in the government\u2019s motion, to the extent those facts are proved. Finally, the government argues that petitioner\u2019s proper channel of remedy was the filing of a complaint with the Special Counsel concerning a prohibited personnel action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9). Because we hold that the MSPB does have the compliance power for which petitioner contends, we need not reach the question whether he could alternatively have pursued his complaint with the Special Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The other issue concerns the Board\u2019s January 11, 1983, denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for attorney fees from the litigation which resulted in the April 9,1981, order in his favor. Petitioner requested attorney fees by motion filed May 27, 1981, well beyond the 10-day time period prescribed by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.37(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The presiding official denied the motion after affording petitioner an opportunity to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for the untimely request, and the Board denied the subsequent petition for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Petitioner\u2019s factual support for his contention that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay was thoroughly considered by the presiding official and the full Board, and we cannot say that the Board was arbitrary or capricious, or that it made any error of law, in reaching its decision. In sum, petitioner\u2019s prior attorney failed to inquire into the time limit and simply claims to have been too busy to file his motion on time, or to have sought an extension. Petitioner has presented no evidence or arguments to us requiring us to reconsider that reasoned decision regarding those fees. This does not prevent petitioner from seeking attorney fees, under an appropriate provision, for the litigation, past and future, involving the matter of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">For these reasons, the decision of the MSPB in Appeal No. 83-866 is vacated and remanded, and its decision in Appeal No. 83-865 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">No. <em>83-866 </em>\u2014 Vacated <em>and Remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">No. <em>83-865 </em>\u2014 Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. The position of Director of Education Programs is a Schedule A excepted service position, GS-15. Soon after petitioner\u2019s appointment to that position in 1969, he initiated the \u201cArtists-In-Schools\u201d program in which artists are placed in primary and secondary schools around the country. The 1969 pilot program placed artists in six states\u2019 schools; by 1974-75 the program included 50 states and 2,327 artists in over 5,000 schools. It is apparently not disputed that most, if not all, of petitioner\u2019s duties and responsibilities, prior to his wrongful removal, had to do with the administration of this program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-16\">. The ground of this decision was that the agency had not pursued proper procedures in terminating petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"acm-dedup-0\">.

Furthermore, although evidence of such animus may have been relevant in determining whether the agency\u2019s delay in returning appellant to active duty was justified, the fact that the Regional Director failed to make such a determination did not substantially affect the rights of appellant in light of his finding that the agency, indeed, improperly delayed appellant\u2019s return to active duty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-23\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.37(a)(2) requires, in part, that a request for fees \u201cshall be made by motion within 10 days of the final date of a decision. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
