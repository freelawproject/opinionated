We have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The Department hired Poorsina on September 6, 1981 for a position as Medical Officer at the Indian Health Service in Aberdeen, South Dakota, subject to a one-year probationary period. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.-801 (1982). He was fired three weeks later pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804 (when an agency fires a probationary employee because of unsatisfactory work or conduct, it shall give written notice and include conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance). The Department said that Poorsina failed to maintain effective working relationships with supervisors and other staff members and that his disruptive behavior undermined management and impeded Department operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Poorsina claims he observed numerous instances of mismanagement, waste of public funds, and dispensing of life-endangering health care, and was fired for reporting these observations. He appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the Board, arguing that his reports and complaints were politically motivated. The Board\u2019s field office granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Poorsi-na failed to carry his burden of proving that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2) (1982); <em>Stern v. Department of the Army, </em>699 F.2d 1312, 1314 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert, </em>denied,-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 3095, 77 L.Ed.2d 1354 (1983). Poorsina appealed the field office ruling and the Board affirmed. It held that because Poorsina was a probationary employee, he had no statutory, but only <em>a </em>regulatory, right of appeal to the Board. Poorsina argues that the Board had jurisdiction and wrongly dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">Our standard of review of the Board\u2019s decision is set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_E\">[T]he court shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-19\">(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-20\">(2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-21\">(3) unsupported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-22\"><em>See, e.g., McClaskey </em>v. <em>United States Department of Energy, </em>720 F.2d 583, 586 (9th Cir.1983) (McClaskey); <em>Gipson v. Veterans Administration, </em>682 F.2d 1004, 1008 (D.C. Cir.1982). Under section 7703(c), our review of Board action is generally deferential. <em>E.g., McClaskey, </em>720 F.2d at 586 (review of the Board\u2019s choice of sanctions is extremely limited).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-23\">The Board committed no error. The statutory right of appeal in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) only applies to \u201cemployees,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A) (an individual \u201cnot serving a probationary or trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>period under an initial appointment ... \u201d). Probationers may appeal only under regulation. <em>See Piskadlo v. Veterans\u2019 Administration, </em>668 F.2d 82, 83-84 (1st Cir.1982); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.3(a)(8) (1982); <em>accord Stern v. Department of the Army, </em>699 F.2d at 1314; <em>Budnick v. MSPB, </em>643 F.2d 278, 279 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">By regulation, probationary employees terminated for unsatisfactory performance may appeal if they can show their discharge was based on partisan politics. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b) (1982). <em>See Piskadlo v. Veterans\u2019 Administration, </em>668 F.2d at 84; <em>Budnick v. MSPB, </em>643 F.2d at 279. The Board concluded that Poorsina raised no valid issues of partisan discharge sufficient to invoke regulatory jurisdiction. Poorsina attempts to bring himself under this very limited right to review. He contends that his discharge was based on partisan political reasons because he held \u201cdeeply felt political views that all persons, regardless of ethnic origin, should have a right to optimal patient care.\u201d He argues that his charges of waste and mismanagement stemmed from this political conviction, and that his whistle-blowing activities were \u201cpartisan\u201d because he \u201cfervently believed in the justness of reporting political mismanagement and abuse.\u201d Poorsina would construe the word \u201cpartisan\u201d in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b)(2) (1982) as \u201cstrongly devoted.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Poorsina relies on <em>Peale v. United States, </em>325 F.Supp. 193 (N.D.Ill.1971), which involved the discharge of a postal worker who claimed he was fired for \u201cpolitical\u201d activity because he wore a black armband at work to protest the Vietnam War. The Post Office said it discharged him for inefficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 194. Not only is <em>Peale </em>distinguishable on its facts, but after <em>Peale </em>was decided the government amended its regulations to narrow the scope of activity properly considered \u201cpolitical\u201d by adding the word \u201cpartisan.\u201d <em>See 37 </em>Fed.Reg. 26575 (1972). This is best interpreted in a common-sense way as relating to recognized political parties, candidates for public office, or political campaign activities. <em>See, e.g., Sweeting v. Department of Justice, </em>6 M.S.P.B. 598, 601 (1981) (\u201caffiliation with any political party or candidate\u201d); <em>cf. </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 733.101(e), (f) (1980) (defining \u201cpartisan\u201d for the purpose of regulations on the political activities of federal employees). Poorsina does not claim that this case involves partisan politics as so defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Poorsina finally contends that the Board had a duty to hear the appeal under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 because he alleged that his termination was a reprisal for whistle-blowing and thus a prohibited personnel practice, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). Poorsina\u2019s own description of his activities tracks the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii), prohibiting adverse personnel actions as reprisal for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">(A) a disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which ... [he] ... reasonably believes evidences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">(ii) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">He asserts that his acts were exactly the sort Congress intended to protect by passing this portion of the Civil Service Reform Act, and cites <em>Wren v. MSPB, </em>681 F.2d 867 (D.C.Cir.1982) <em>(Wren), </em>as support for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">We conclude, however, that <em>Wren </em>supports the proposition that the Board lacked jurisdiction! <em>Wren </em>held that a terminated probationary employee, who alleged reprisal for whistle-blowing could only obtain relief by filing with the Office of Special Counsel of the Board. 681 F.2d at 873 (\u201conly route to MSPB review open\u201d was \u201ca section 1206(c)(1)(B) petition for \u2018corrective action\u2019 by the OSC\u201d). <em>See also Cutts v. Fowler, </em>692 F.2d 138, 140 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Borrell v. U.S. International Communications Agency, </em>682 F.2d 981, 988 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\u201cWe think Congress meant to establish the OSC as an exclusive avenue of relief to probationary employees alleging prohibited personnel practices under the CSRA.\u201d); <em>Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Markup </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Session on S. 2460, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 </em>at 85-86 (unpublished, May 22, 1978) (remarks of Senators Percy and Chiles). We adopt that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\">. Pub.L. 97-164, tit.
