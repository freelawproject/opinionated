App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">This is an appeal by Defendants American Electric Power Service Corporation, Indiana and Michigan Electric Company, and Franklin Real Estate Company (collectively referred to as AEP)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of an order of partial summary judgment on a crossclaim for indemnification granted against them and in favor of Defendant McCulloch Oil Corporation (McCulloch). This cause was initiated by Ralph Gomez, a coal miner, for injuries he sustained on October 3, 1978, when the wall of a coal mine in which he worked collapsed on top of him. Gomez sued all defendants (AEP and McCulloch) on a theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Braztah Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of McCulloch, was the operator of the mine and, therefore, Gomez\u2019s employer. Braztah was immune from suit by Gomez pursuant to the Utah Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. After Gomez filed his complaint; AEP brought a crossclaim against McCulloch, alleging that if it were found liable to Gomez, AEP was entitled to indemnity and contribution from McCulloch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are concerned only with the indemnity issues on this appeal. Jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">In 1971, McCulloch purchased some coal mines in Carbon County, Utah. Braztah became the operator of these mines, known as the Braztah Mines. In 1974, McCulloch, Braztah and AEP entered into a contract in which AEP was to pay Braztah for conducting the mining operation and AEP would also purchase the mined coal. However, the 1974 Contract was superseded in 1975 by a new contract which transferred ownership of the mines to AEP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1975 Contract provided that Braztah, as operator of the mine, agreed to mine, produce and deliver a specified quality and quantity of coal to AEP, the owner of the mine. AEP agreed to accept and pay for any coal delivered under the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">The Contract provided further that Braz-tah was solely responsible for the control and direction of the mines\u2019 employees. Braztah also agreed to use its best efforts to comply with all applicable governmental laws and regulations regarding mine operations, including those concerning mine safety. Article XXX of the 1975 Contract, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-15\">Operator hereby agrees to indemnify, protect and save harmless I <em>&amp; </em>M [AEP] from and against any and all losses, damages, injuries, claims, demands of whatsoever kind and nature asserted by third parties against I &amp; M [AEP] and all expenses, legal or otherwise arising out of or in any way resulting from Operator\u2019s operations under or in performance of this Contract....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">R., Supp. Vol. XVI at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-17\">In Article XXIII(a) of the 1975 Contract, McCulloch covenanted to \u201ccause Operator to perform its agreements and obligations under this Contract.\u201d R., Supp. Vol. XVI at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-18\">On November 30,1979, subsequent to Gomez\u2019 accident but prior to the time he filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>suit, a \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d was entered into between McCulloch, Braztah and AEP. This Agreement expressly superseded the 1975 Contract and transferred the entire operations of the Braztah Mines to AEP. In the Agreement, the parties also sought to clarify the obligations remaining between them. The parties dispute the extent that the Agreement released McCul-loch and Braztah from their obligations under the 1975 Contract. Since the 1979 Agreement was entered into, Braztah has been dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">On appeal, we must determine whether the district court erred by granting summary judgment in McCulloch\u2019s favor on the grounds that as a matter of law, AEP is not entitled to indemnity under the 1975 Contract nor under a common law theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">At the outset, it is necessary to describe the standard of review we ar\u00e9 to follow. Because the sole issue before us is the propriety of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we must view the case in the same manner as did that court. <em>See Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>677 F.2d 789, 791 n. 1 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Luckett v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>618 F.2d 1373, 1377 (10th Cir.1980). Thus, we must determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and, if not, whether the substantive law was correctly applied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Western Casualty, supra. </em>In doing so, we must view the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. 10 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: </em>Civil 2d \u00a7 2716, at 643 (2d ed. 1983) [quoting <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962)]. <em>See also Lindley v. Amoco Production Co., </em>639 F.2d 671, 672 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT IN CONTRACT ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"Az2\">After carefully reviewing the entire record, we hold that the district court did not err by granting summary judgment in McCulloch\u2019s favor on the indemnity issue. First, we agree that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding this proposition. Certainly, the question concerning the <em>interpretation </em>of a written agreement is one of <em>fact. See Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 545-554 (1952). Thus, in an ambiguous contract, if the intent of the parties is disputed, a genuine issue of material fact exists which cannot be determined summarily by the court. <em>See </em>10A Wright, Miller &amp; <em>Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: </em>Civil 2d \u00a7 2730.1, at 273-75 (2d ed. 1983) [quoting <em>Oil Trading Assoc\u2019s., Inc. v. Texas City Refining, Inc., </em>201 F.Supp. 846, 849 (S.D.N. Y.1962)]. The initial question, however, concerning the existence of an ambiguity is one of <em>law </em>that may be decided summarily by the court. 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2730.1, at 275-79. If the language is clear, the parties\u2019 intentions are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Although AEP and McCulloch dispute the meaning of the language in Article XXIII, the district court could have<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> determined it to be unambiguous. Thus, because we hold that the language of Article XXIII is clear, no factual question arises concerning the parties\u2019 intentions. Summary judgment is, therefore, the proper procedure to follow in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">Second, we hold as a matter of law, that the language of the 1975 Contract does not require McCulloch to indemnify AEP. The obligation to indemnify AEP was solely that of the operator, Braztah. Under Utah law, the interpretation of a contractual provision requires the determination of the intentions of the parties at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>time it was made. <em>DuBois v. Nye, </em>584 P.2d 823, 824-25 (Utah 1978); <em>Barrus </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>16 Utah 2d 204, 398 P.2d 207, 208 (1965). Those intentions may be found from the instrument itself if it is sufficiently clear. <em>Oberhansly v. Earle, </em>572 P.2d 1384, 1386 (Utah 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Article XXIII(a) clearly states that McCulloch merely covenanted to \u201ccause\u201d or to encourage <em>Braztah </em>to perform its agreements and obligations under the Contract, i.e., indemnification of AEP pursuant to Article XXX. The language does not require McCulloch to \u201cperform\u201d Braztah\u2019s obligations. To bolster this reading of Article XXIII(a), it is noteworthy that the language of part (b) of the same Article does in fact require McCulloch to actively perform under the Contract in the event its subsidiaries fail to perform.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the parties had intended McCulloch to actually \u201cperform\u201d Braztah\u2019s indemnification obligations, they could have expressly said so, as they did in part (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We understand that, because Braztah no longer exists, AEP will not be entitled to a contractual right of indemnity from <em>any </em>party under the language of the Contract. However, absent some unconscionability at the time of a contract\u2019s formation, courts will not be concerned with how the parties fare thereunder. <em>Holley v. Federal-American Partners, </em>29 Utah 2d 212, 507 P.2d 381, 383 (1973). We hold, therefore, that the district court did not err by finding no contractual right of indemnity in AEP against McCulloch.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"abg-dedup-0\">Finally, we hold as a matter of law, that AEP is not entitled to common law indemnity from McCulloch. AEP contends that the Utah Supreme Court has recognized a right of common law indemnity in a party who is secondarily (passively) liable and who has sustained a.loss to the injured party. <em>See Salt Lake City v. Schubach, </em>108 Utah 266,159 P.2d 149 (1945). AEP argues that it was passively liable and McCulloch was actively liable for Gomez\u2019 injuries;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thus, it should be allowed a claim of common law indemnity against McCulloch as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The only Utah decision dealing with this indemnity issue is <em>Salt Lake City v. Schu-bach, supra, </em>written in 1945. Since that opinion was rendered, however, the Utah Legislature has enacted a comparative negligence statute. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78-27-37 to -43 (1953). McCulloch contends that by adopting a comparative negligence doctrine, the Utah Legislature has abrogated any theory of common law indemnity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">Initially, we note that because this is a diversity case and because there are no Utah state judicial decisions on this question since the comparative negligence statute was enacted, we must determine this issue as we believe the Utah Supreme Court would. <em>See </em>19 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: </em>Jurisdiction \u00a7 4507, at 89 (1982); <em>City of Aurora, Colorado v. Bechtel Corp., </em>599 F.2d 382, 386 (10th Cir.1979). A review of the decisions from comparative negligence jurisdictions reveals that a clear majority have held that the statutory adoption of a comparative negligence scheme effectively abrogates the theory of indemnity based on the active/passive negligence dichotomy. <em>See, e.g., Turcon Construction, Inc. v. Norton-Villiers, Ltd., </em>139 Cal.App.3d 280, 188 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Rptr. 580, 583 (1983) [citing <em>Li v. Yellow Cab Co., </em>13 Cal.3d 804, 532 P.2d 1226, 119 Cal.Rptr. 858 (1975) ]; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>City of Sawyer, </em>228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788, 798 (1980); <em>Tolbert v. Gerber Industries, Inc., </em>255 N.W.2d 362, 367-68 (Minn.1977); <em>Consolidated Utility Equipment Services, Inc. v. Emhart Manufacturing Corp., </em>123 N.H. 258, 459 A.2d 287, 289 (1983); <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>30 N.Y.2d 143, 153, 282 N.E.2d 288, 295, 331 N.Y.S.2d 382, 391-92 (1972); <em>Pachowitz v. Milwaukee &amp; Suburban Transport Corp., </em>56 Wis.2d 383, 202 N.W.2d 268, 270-72 (1972).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we believe that the Utah Supreme Court might follow this contemporary analysis, the Utah statute differs from the statutes of those jurisdictions because it expressly retains certain rights of indemnity. Section 78-27 \u2014 41 (1953) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNothing in this act shall affect: .... (2) Any right of indemnity which may <em>exist </em>under <em>present </em>law.\u201d (emphasis added). Because of this express exception to the comparative negligence act, we hold that there is no abrogation of any existing right to common law indemnity in Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">We must now decide whether the <em>Schubach </em>court established a right to common law indemnity based on the active/passive negligence dichotomy. We hold that, regarding private parties, it did not. In <em>Schubach, </em>Salt Lake City sought indemnity from the owner and one tenant of a store building abutting a city sidewalk upon which a pedestrian had tripped and injured herself. The pedestrian had previously recovered a judgment from the city. Thus, the <em>Schubach </em>case involved only a dispute between a municipal corporation and two parties who had a responsibility to maintain a public sidewalk in a safe condition. We conclude the court held only that under those circumstances a <em>municipal corporation </em>may seek indemnity because, as a matter of law, it is passively negligent and the owner and tenant are actively negligent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Salt Lake City v. Schubach, supra </em>159 P.2d at 155 (quoting <em>City of Spokane v. Crane Co., </em>98 Wash. 49, 167 P. 63, 64 (1917)), 157-58. It would be reckless speculation for a federal court to read the <em>Schubach </em>decision so expansively as to establish a right to common law indemnity in Utah for private parties. We prefer to limit the <em>Schubach </em>decision to the facts before that court, particularly because no other Utah decision has addressed this specific question. We hold, therefore, that no right to common law indemnity for <em>private </em>parties based on the active/passive negligence dichotomy was established by <em>Schubach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"apu-dedup-0\">The question remains whether we believe the Utah Supreme Court would <em>now establish </em>a right to common law indemnity for private parties based on the active/passive negligence dichotomy. We decline to pre-diet what position the Utah court would take in light of the particular circumstances involved here. In view of the language in section 78-27-41, supra, it would be at best a speculative gesture for a federal court to adopt this common law right as part of Utah tort law. As previously noted, that section expressly excepts from the comparative negligence act a right t\u00f3 indemnity which <em>\u201cexist[s] </em>under <em>present </em>law.\u201d We do not find any such right, based on the active/passive negligence dichotomy, to be presently existing under Utah tort law. Accordingly, we decline to establish one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that would apply retroactively to these par-' ties.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Thus, we hold as a matter of law, that AEP cannot obtain common law indemnity from McCulloch. The district court could have<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applied this substantive law when, it granted McCulloch\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, because our view of current Utah law supports the district court\u2019s determination, we hold that summary judgment was properly granted in McCulloch\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. These defendants were affiliated in the ownership of the mine at issue in this case \u2014 the Braztah No. 3 Mine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-10\">. The district court dismissed without prejudice the claim for contribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-19\">. The 1975 Contract was necessary because governmental regulations required AEP, a public utility, to own the Braztah Mines before it could make expenditures for them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. It is unclear what the district court specifically determined when ruling on this motion for summary judgment; the court merely entered a minute order granting the motion. Although Rule 52(a) makes specific findings of fact and conclusions of law unnecessary on summary judgment motions, they would be helpful in our review. <em>See </em>10 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: </em>Civil 2d \u00a7 2716, at 647-50 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\">. Article XXIII(b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cMcCulloch agrees to give or cause its subsidiaries to give I &amp; M [AEP] a right of first refusal .... \u201d R., Supp.Vol. XVI at 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\">. McCulloch also argues on appeal that by entering into the 1979 Settlement Agreement, AEP abandoned its alleged contractual right of indemnity against McCulloch under the 1975 Contract. <em>See Brief of Appellee </em>at 9-13; R., Vol. II at 448-49. Because we have held that AEP possessed no contractual right of indemnity against McCulloch, we need not determine the question of an abandonment of that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b724-14\">. AEP contends that McCulloch, through Braz-tah, actually controlled both the site of the injury and the instrumentality which caused the injury; AEP merely failed to observe and correct the hazards created by McCulloch\u2019s negligence. <em>See Brief of Appellants </em>at 14 \u2014 16; <em>Reply Brief of Appellants </em>at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\">. The rationale applied by these various state decisions is sound. The language of the Kansas Supreme Court is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">In actions where comparative negligence is in issue the court deals in percentages of causal responsibility, and distinctions between primary, secondary, active and passive negligence lose their previous identities. The nature of misconduct in such cases is to be expressed on the basis of degrees of comparative fault or causation, and the all or nothing concepts are swept aside. <em>Kennedy v. City of Sawyer, </em>228 Kan. 439, 618 P.2d 788, 798 (1980).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\">. At the time of the <em>Schubach. </em>decision, there was a Utah statute which authorized a city to require owners or occupants of abutting property to keep sidewalks free from obstructions. <em>See </em>Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 10-8-23 (1953). Although the <em>Schubach </em>court cited this statute, it relied primarily upon judicial decisions from other jurisdictions \u2014 particularly <em>City of Spokane v. Crane Co., </em>98 Wash. 49, 167 P. 63 (1917).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b726-15\">. As we explained in note 4, <em>supra, </em>we are not provided with the district court\u2019s specific determinations. This is of more concern to us regarding one of the questions with which we are now dealing: what effect, if any, the Utah Comparative Negligence Act has on common law indemnity actions. In reviewing a summary judgment proceeding, an appellate court must consider only those papers that were before the district court, and the parties cannot propose new arguments on appeal. 10 Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2716, at 650-52. A review of the record that was before the district court did not reveal any presentation by McCulloch of this theory. However, because AEP\u2019s Reply Brief on appeal failed to challenge this as a \u201cnew\u201d argument, we will consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
