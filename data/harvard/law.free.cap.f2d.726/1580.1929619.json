Int\u2019l Trade 1983). After a thorough consideration of appellant\u2019s arguments, we fully agree with the opinion of the Court of International Trade, filed by Judge Newman, and we affirm on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-23\">Appellant\u2019s position is that the items in question should be classified as an entirety which would be eligible for duty-free treatment. The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that the chassis/tape combination is an entirety because the tariff description is for a machine n.s.p.f., and all the parts necessary to constitute a machine n.s.p.f. are present upon entry. Appellant\u2019s position cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-24\">Judge Newman correctly summarized the law of the doctrine of entireties as set forth in <em>Stella D\u2019Oro Biscuit Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>65 CCPA 52, C.A.D. 1205, 570 F.2d 945 (1978), <em>aff\u2019g, Stella D\u2019Oro Biscuit Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>79 Cust.Ct. 28, C.D. 4709, 436 F.Supp. 398 (1977) and <em>United States v. Baldt Anchor, Chain and Forge Div. of Boston Metals Co., </em>59 CCPA 122, C.A.D. 1051, 459 F.2d 1403 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1652-25\">It is now well settled that separate components covered by the same entry, although designed and intended to be used together, are not properly classifiable as an entirety where the components do not comprise a complete commercial entity, but instead must be assembled with additional components to form a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>complete article of commerce. [565 F.Supp. at 151.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">Judge Newman found that the imported chassis and tape players were not sold by appellant in combination as complete commercial articles. Instead, the chassis and tape players were separately inventoried and used solely as parts along with other components in the production of various models of appellant\u2019s consoles and compacts. We find no clear error in these findings of fact. <em>Daw Industries, Inc. v. The United States, </em>714 F.2d 1140 (Fed.Cir. 1983). We therefore agree with Judge Newman\u2019s conclusion that the chassis and tape players were separate tariff entities rather than entireties. We also agree that appellant\u2019s argument that the classification was inconsistent with prior administrative practice was not supported by the proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of International Trade is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1653-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
