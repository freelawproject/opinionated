Pursuant thereto, the state officials properly were authorized to remove from an apartment personal property belonging to appellant Reynolds and place same on the public street. In the course thereof, the officials discovered, in the pocket of appellant\u2019s sports jacket, several treasury checks later determined to be stolen. We find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the checks. It was eminently reasonable for the state officials to conduct such an inventory-type search. <em>See Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. -2605, 2608, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983) (\u201cthe inventory search constitutes a well-defined exception to the warrant requirement\u201d); <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). The procedure followed here to remove weapons, drugs, or other items that might endanger the public from Reynolds\u2019 personal property before placing it on the public street was reasonable. <em>Cf. Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 447-48, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2530-31, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973) (\u201cconcern for the safety of the general public\u201d justified search without warrant or probable cause of car towed by police to garage following accident and \u201cvulnerable to intrusion by vandals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
