Appellants alleged that the federal agency, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), was arbitrary and capricious in deciding that their pension plan was not eligible for federal insurance coverage under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461(b)(2) (Supp. Y 1981). They also alleged that their former employers, Brown Company (Brown) and Georgia-Pacific Corporation (Georgia-Pacific), breached contractual promises by reducing appellants\u2019 pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-23\">United States District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson entered judgments in favor of PBGC, Brown, and Georgia-Pacific. <em>Bel-land v. PBGC, </em>No. 79-1248 (D.D.C. June 30, 1981 &amp; Dec. 30,1982). Appellants challenge those judgments on appeal. For reasons expressed herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-24\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b912-25\">A. <em>The Reduction of Pension Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-26\">Appellants comprise about 253 individuals who, until the summer of 1971, were employees of Brown at a paper products man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ufacturing plant in Portage, Michigan. Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 911. In June 1971, Brown sold the Portage plant to Georgia-Pacific. Appellants remained at the Portage plant and became Georgia-Pacific employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">While working for Brown, appellants had participated in the Brown Company Pension Plan No. 1 (Brown Pension Plan). Because appellants, upon becoming Georgia-Pacific employees, would no longer accrue benefits under the Brown Pension Plan, the two companies provided for appellants\u2019 pensions in the purchase and sale agreement for the Portage plant. In article 7(b)(i) of the agreement, Georgia-Pacific agreed to enter into collective bargaining with appellants\u2019 representatives to substitute for the Brown Pension Plan either a new or an existing Georgia-Pacific plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In article 7(b)(ii), Georgia-Pacific promised to strive during collective. bargaining to obtain retirement benefits for appellants comparable to benefits provided by the Brown Pension Plan. In article 7(b)(iii), Brown agreed to transfer to Georgia-Pacific appellants\u2019 pro rata share of money in the Brown Pension Plan, and Georgia-Pacific agreed to apply this transferred money to appellants\u2019 new pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Georgia-Pacific entered into a collective bargaining agreement with appellants in June 1971. J.A. at 1088-89. The agreement provided that appellants would participate in the Georgia-Pacific Midwestern Joint Pension Trust (Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan), which provided benefits comparable to the Brown Pension Plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 926 n. *. In February 1972, the parties amended the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan to make benefit reductions mandatory when fund assets became insufficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">In March 1974, Georgia-Pacific announced that the Portage plant would be closed by June 30, 1974. J.A. at 593. By June 30, 1974, all production at the plant had ceased, and only two employees remained. <em>Id. </em>These two employees were terminated after completing plant closure between July 1 and July 3, 1974. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 593..</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">With plant closure came the cessation of contributions to the Georgia-Pacific Pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Plan. The pension plan trustees determined that existing pension plan assets would not be sufficient to pay appellants the amount provided by the plan. Accordingly, in compliance with the plan, <em>supra </em>note 3, the trustees in March 1975 reduced appellants\u2019 pension benefits from six dollars per month per year of service to one dollar and fifty cents per month per year of service. J.A. at 912. Appellants received immediate written notification of the pension benefit reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">B. <em>Appellants Apply to PBGC for Pension Plan Insurance Coverage Under ERISA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Congress established PBGC on September 2,1974 to administer the pension plan insurance provisions of ERISA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302 (1976). ERISA provides a comprehensive insurance program for certain pension plans that terminated on or after September 2,1974. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1461(a). ERISA also provides retroactive insurance coverage for certain pension plans that terminated between July 1 and September 1, 1974. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1461(b). This retroactive coverage period commonly is called the \u201cwindow period.\u201d Congress expressly tasked PBGC with determining whether a plan seeking window period coverage terminated during the window period. <em>Id. </em>Congress established two tests for making this determination: PBGC \u201cshall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue [the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test] or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection [the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">On September 13, 1974, appellants applied to PBGC for pension plan insurance coverage under the window period provision of ERISA. J.A. at 593. PBGC applied the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test and, based upon the <em>de minimis </em>participation by appellants in the plan after June 30, 1974, concluded that the plan terminated before July 1, 1974. Accordingly, in June 1975, PBGC notified appellants that the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan was not eligible for window period coverage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">In December 1975 and June 1976, PBGC reviewed its decision that appellants\u2019 pension plan terminated before July 1, 1974. J.A. at 593. Appellants, assisted by their union and by Georgia-Pacific, submitted additional factual materials to PBGC. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 65, 68. PBGC nevertheless affirmed its earlier decision. <em>Id. </em>at 593. In October 1977, PBGC determined the case should not be reopened. <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">C. <em>The District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">On May 7, 1979, appellants filed the instant action against PBGC, Brown, and Georgia-Pacific. Appellants alleged that PBGC improperly denied window period pension coverage under ERISA. Appellants argued that PBGC was arbitrary and capricious in its interpretation and application of section 1461(b). J.A. at 593-94. Alternatively, appellants argued that-PBGC violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-559 (1982), because it failed to promulgate rules governing the eligibility of pension plans seeking window period coverage. J.A. at 594. On June 30, 1981, the district court entered summary judgment for PBGC. <em>Belland </em>v. <em>PBGC, </em>Civ. No. 79-1248 (D.D.C. June 30, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">In their complaint against Brown and Georgia-Pacific, appellants alleged that both companies breached oral promises that appellants would receive pension benefits of six dollars per month per year of service. J.A. at 914. Appellants also argued that Brown and Georgia-Pacific breached the purchase and sale agreement for the Portage plant by allowing the substantial reduction of pension benefits. <em>Id. </em>On December 30, 1982, the district court entered summary judgment for Brown and Georgia-Pacific. <em>Belland v. PBGC, </em>Civ. No. 79-1248 (D.D.C. Dec. 30, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">A. <em>Appellants\u2019 Claims Against PBGC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">1. PBGC\u2019s Interpretation of Section 1461(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">Appellants contend that PBGC\u2019s decision to deny insurance coverage based exclusive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>ly on its application of the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Appellants stress that the purpose of ERISA is to provide relief for employees who otherwise would lose their pension benefits. In light of the remedial purpose underlying ERISA, appellants argue that section 1461(b) must be construed to provide expansive relief. Appellants therefore contend that section 1461(b) requires PBGC to apply the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test and allow window period coverage when, as here, <em>any </em>pension benefits accrued during the window period. If no pension benefits accrued during the window period, appellants contend that PBGC still has discretion to extend coverage pursuant to the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test. Because PBGC allegedly ignored the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test and relied exclusively on the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test, appellants argue that PBGC was arbitrary and capricious in its interpretation of section 1461(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 argument. PBGC\u2019s interpretation of ERISA is entitled to great deference. <em>See United Steelworkers of America v. Harris &amp; Sons Steel Co., </em>706 F.2d 1289, 1296 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Concord Control, Inc. v. International Union, UAW, </em>647 F.2d 701, 704 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 U.S. 1054, 102 S.Ct. 599, 70 L.Ed.2d 590 (1981); <em>Connolly v. PBGC, </em>581 F.2d 729,730 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>440 U.S. 935, 99 S.Ct. 1278, 59 L.Ed.2d 492 (1979). We do not rely solely on great deference here, however, because PBGC\u2019s interpretation of section 1461(b) was consistent with the plain language of ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Our starting point for determining whether PBGC properly interpreted section 1461(b) is, of course, the language of the statute itself. <em>See March v. United States, </em>506 F.2d 1306, 1313 &amp; n. 26 (D.C.Cir.1974). If the statutory language \u201cis plain and admits of no more than one meaning, the duty of interpretation does not arise, and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313 (quoting <em>Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 485, 37 S.Ct. 192, 194, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)). Section 1461(b) is phrased unambiguously in the disjunctive. PBGC is authorized to determine whether the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan terminated during the window period \u201con the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue <em>or </em>on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461(b) (emphasis added). The statute clearly accords to PBGC the discretion to use the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test so long as the test is consistent with the purposes of section 1461(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">PBGC\u2019s use of the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test here was consistent with the purposes of section 1461(b). An obvious purpose of this section is to provide insurance coverage retroactively for eligible pension plans. Another purpose, however, is to promote low insurance premiums.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Congress was concerned in ERISA with protecting employees\u2019 expectations of pension benefits, Congress also realized that employers would neither create nor maintain pension plans if ERISA imposed too much cost. \u201cConsequently, the entire statute is a finely tuned balance between protecting pension benefits for employees while limiting the cost to employers.\u201d <em>A-T-O, Inc. v. PBGC, </em>634 F.2d 1013,1021 (6th Cir.1980). Because PBGC\u2019s use of the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test here was. consistent with maintaining insurance premium rates at the lowest practicable level, PBGC complied with the plain meaning of section 1461(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>We are mindful of the principle that remedial statutes are to be liberally construed to, effectuate their purpose. <em>See International Union, UAW v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 390, 396 (D.C.Cir.1978). That principle, however, \u201cdoes not give the judiciary license, in interpreting a provision, to disregard entirely the plain meaning of the words used by Congress.\u201d <em>Symons v. Chrysler Corp. Loan Guarantee Board, </em>670 F.2d 238, 241 (D.C.Cir.1981). If Congress had intended that PBGC always use the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test in making window period coverage decisions, that intention would be manifest in the statutory language.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no evidence that section 1461(b) requires PBGC to use the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test when deciding the eligibility of pension plans seeking window period coverage. Instead, section 1461(b) gives PBGC discretion to use the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test so long as PBGC adheres to the purposes of section 1461(b). Here, PBGC adhered to an express statutory purpose and complied with the statute\u2019s plain language. We therefore reject appellants\u2019 argument that PBGC\u2019s decision to use the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">2. PBGC\u2019s Decision that the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan Terminated Before July 1, 1974</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">PBGC decided, pursuant to its application of the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test, that the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan terminated before July 1, 1974. Appellants contend that this decision was arbitrary and capricious. Appellants emphasize that two Portage plant employees worked in the plant and accrued pension benefits from July 1 to July 4, 1974. Twelve employees received vacation pay after July 1, 1974 for vacation time earned before that date. Nine employees received \u201cshortage accrued vacation pay\u201d after July 1, 1974.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants argue that these events demonstrate that the plan did not terminate before July 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">Our standard of review is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires us</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">to strike \u201cagency action, findings and conclusions\u201d that we find to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law . ... \u201d This standard of review ... presumes agency action to be valid. Moreover, it forbids the court\u2019s substituting its judgment for that of the agency, and requires affirmance if a rational basis exists for the agency\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-13\"><em>Ethyl Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>541 F.2d 1, 34 (D.C.Cir.1976) (en banc) (quoting Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (citations and footnotes omitted). In applying this standard, we must consider whether PBGC\u2019s determination that the pension plan termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>nated before the window period \u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 441, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974) (quoting <em>Citizens to Preserve Ov-erton Park </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">PBGC considered the following factors in determining that the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan terminated before July 1, 1974: (1) the date of termination set by the Plan Administrator, (2) the number of participants for whom benefits continued to accrue and the length of time over which those benefits accrued, (3) the date work terminated for the participants, (4) the date employer contributions ceased,* (5) the type of work performed for which pension benefits accrued, and (6) the accrual of holiday or vacation benefits. J.A. at 596-97. We find these factors are eminently relevant to a determination of when the pension plan terminated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">In applying these factors,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> PBGC found that the pension plan terminated before the window period based on the <em>de minimis </em>participation by appellants in the plan after June 30, 1974. The facts revealed that Georgia-Pacific announced in March 1974 that the Portage plant would close by June 30,1974; the plant ceased production operations in June 1974; all but two employees were terminated by June 30, 1974; these two employees worked only three days in July, and their work consisted entirely of plant shutdown operations; except for these two employees, Georgia-Pacific made neither contributions to the pension plan nor vacation payments to appellants for work performed after June 30, 1974. J.A. at 29, 106, 593. In light of these facts, we cannot say that PBGC committed a clear error of judgment in deciding that the plan terminated before the window period. Accordingly, we find that PBGC was not arbitrary and capricious in deciding that the plan terminated before July 1, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">3. PBGC\u2019s Case-by-Case Method for Determining Period Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Appellants contend that PBGC abused its discretion in failing to promulgate rules governing the eligibility of pension plans seeking window period coverage. Relying on <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 202-03, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947), appellants aver that agencies are restricted in their ability to make case-by-case determinations to one of three situations: (1) where the agency must solve a problem that it could not reasonably foresee; (2) where the agency has insufficient experience with a problem to warrant rigid-ifying its tentative judgment into a rule; and (3) where the problem is so specialized that it cannot be captured within the boundaries of a rule. Brief for Appellants at 49-50. Appellants assert that the instant case fits none of these situations, and therefore PBGC was arbitrary and capricious in its failure to promulgate rules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Although an agency is not unfettered in its choice of whether to proceed by general rule or by case-by-case determination, that \u201cchoice ... is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Chenery, </em>332 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>at 203, 67 S.Ct. at 1580. We believe that PBGC was justified in choosing a case-by-case approach for window period determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">PBGC came into existence on September 2,1974 charged with the responsibility of administering a complex and novel pension plan insurance program. One of PBGC\u2019s challenges was the task of processing window period claims. Because the filing of window period claims was limited to the two-month period between September 2 and October 31, 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461(b)(4), only about 200 claims were filed. PBGC chose to process this finite number of claims on a case-by-case basis. In view of the limited utility of a window period regulation, the demand for immediate disposition of window period claims, and the fact that appellants were afforded ample opportunity to present information to PBGC concerning their claim, we find that PBGC did not abuse its discretion in choosing to make window period decisions on a case-by-case basis. <em>See generally A-T-O, Inc. v. PBGC, </em>634 F.2d 1013, 1023-24 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">B. <em>Appellants\u2019 Claims Against Brown and Georgia-Pacific</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">1. The Companies\u2019 Alleged Oral Promises</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in finding that their cause of action against Brown and Georgia-Pacific for breach of oral promises was barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellants argue that the complaint they filed in May 1979 was timely because the cause of action accrued on one of three dates: 1) in October 1977, when PBGC conclusively denied appellants\u2019 window period claim; 2) in July 1977, when the trustees of the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan purchased the annuity which would pay reduced pension benefits; or 3) in July 1978, when the litigation between Georgia-Pacific and Brown for appellants\u2019 pro rata share from the Brown Pension Plan was resolved.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">It is well established that the statute of limitations for breach of an oral promise begins to run from the time of the breach. <em>See Hoffa v. Fitzsimmons, </em>499 F.Supp. 357, 366 n. 39 (D.D.C.1980), <em>remanded on other grounds, </em>673 F.2d 1345 (D.C.Cir.1982). Contrary to appellants\u2019 assertion, the companies\u2019 oral promises, if they exist at all, were breached no later than April 1975. By April 1975, the trustees of the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan had notified appellants of the decision to reduce appellants\u2019 pension benefits. Appellants could then have sued the companies for breach of oral promise. Because appellants waited until May 1979 to file their complaint, they are barred by the three-year statute of limitations. <em>See Oppenheim v. Campbell, </em>571. F.2d 660, 662 (D.C.Cir. 1978) (litigant\u2019s action accrues when his right to resort to court is perfected).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">The alternative dates asserted by appellants must be rejected. As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-14\">[Appellants] advance the untenable legal position that a statute of limitations on one claim does not run until [appellants] exhaust all other potential claims that could eliminate their alleged loss. That argument must be rejected because it would allow plaintiffs to determine when various statutes of limitations commence dependent upon the legal theories they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>choose to advance at a particular time. Statutes of limitations must remain objective standards that are triggered as soon as litigants\u2019 rights have been breached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">J.A. at 918-A to 919 (footnote omitted). Appellants\u2019 alleged rights were breached no later than April 1975. Accordingly, appellants are barred by the statute of limitations in their claim against the companies for breach of oral promises.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">2. Alleged Contractual Guarantees Arising Prom the Purchase and Sale Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Appellants contend that the district court erred in finding they have no contractual rights under the purchase and sale agreement. Appellants argue that they are third party beneficiaries of the agreement, and that both companies guaranteed in article 7(b) that the benefits under the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan would be equal to or better than those under the Brown Pension Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Assuming, but not holding, that appellants are third party beneficiaries,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we agree with the district court that article 7(b) of \u201cthe agreement provides no support for an express or implied promise by either Brown or [Georgia-Pacific] to guarantee [appellants\u2019] pension funds.\u201d J.A. at 916.

This argument ignores that section 1461(b) on its face gives PBGC discretion to use either test. Moreover, PBGC did not ignore the \u201cceased to accrue\u201d test. PBGC used several \u201cceased to \u00e1ccrue\u201d criteria in its application of the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test. <em>See infra </em>p. 845.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\">.

Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the Portage plant, Brown was obligated to deliver to Georgia-Pacific appellants\u2019 pro rata share of the money in the Brown Pension Plan. See <em>supra </em>note 1. In 1972, Georgia-Pacific brought suit alleging that Brown had failed to deliver appellants\u2019 pro rata share of the money. The court found Brown liable for approximately $60,000. <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Brown Co., </em>No. K 18-72 (W.D. Mich., Mar. 21, 1978), <em>aff'd, </em>636 F.2d 1217 (6th Cir.1980).

The district court held that appellants\u2019 claim for breach of oral promises also is barred both by the Georgia-Pacific collective bargaining agreement and by appellants\u2019 failure to present a sufficient claim for promissory estoppel or unjust enrichment to withstand summary judgment. Because we hold that appellants\u2019 claim is barred by the statute of limitations, we need not address the merits of these other independent bars to appellants\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">With regard to appellants\u2019 assertion that the companies should be estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense, we find no support in the record that the companies made any statement or engaged in any conduct that tended to lull appellants into inaction. <em>See Emersons Ltd. v.

Georgia-Pacific\u2019s suit against Brown to recover appellants\u2019 pro rata share of the Brown Pension Plan was no indication that appellants should wait to file suit on an entirely unrelated claim. Similarly, Georgia-Pacific\u2019s efforts on appellants\u2019 behalf to obtain window period coverage for the Georgia-Pacific Pension Plan should not have lulled appellants into inaction, but should have alerted them to Georgia-Pacific\u2019s position that it had no legal obligation to guarantee appellants\u2019 pension benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b919-14\">.

They brought, a claim under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a statute that was passed in order to avoid precisely the kind of tragedy recounted here. Although there is no question that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was statutorily authorized to extend coverage to the appellants, it rejected their claims. The majority upholds the PBGC\u2019s decision as a reasonable exercise of its discretion under the statute. Because I believe that the PBGC did not, as it was required to do, construe the statute in light of its resounding remedial purpose, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision upholding the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the PBGC. I would remand to the district court to require the PBGC to give a persuasive explanation as to why its stingy construction of the statute comports with Congress\u2019 explicitly generous purpose in making ERISA\u2019s federal guarantees retroactively apply to plans terminated within the two months before the Act was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">As the Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c[o]ne of Congress\u2019 central purposes in enacting this complex legislation was to prevent the \u2018great personal tragedy\u2019 suffered by employees whose vested benefits are not paid when pension plans are terminated.\u201d <em>Nachman Corp. v. PBGC, </em>446 U.S. 359, 374-375, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1732-1733, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The most telling expression of ERISA\u2019s broad remedial purpose was the extraordinary provision before us, retroactively guaranteeing the pension benefits of employees whose pension plans terminated as early as July 1, 1974, over two months before ERISA was enacted. \u201cIn order to provide prompt and effective protection for the employees concerned,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress decided \u201cto afford the [PBGC] emergency authority to institute insurance protection on a \u2018crash\u2019 basis,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> well before it could put into effect ERISA\u2019s provisions for employer liability, reporting and other measures aimed at protecting the PBGC's financial integrity. As Senator Williams, chairman of the conference committee, explained to his colleagues, \u201c[t]his was done in recognition of the fact that depressed economic conditions in certain regions created the possibility that a number of plans were in critical straits and were terminating or were likely to do so imminently.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The addition of such \u201cwindow period\u201d coverage demonstrates an inclination to come down on the side of generosity toward workers whose expectation of adequate retirement income has been devastated, casting a long and threatening shadow over their later years.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">The statute provides that the PBGC <em>shall </em>pay benefits for certain plans that termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>nated after June 30, 1974, and before September 2, 1974, the date of enactment, and that the PBGC shall determine whether a plan has terminated within the two month period \u201con the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461(b). One member of the conference committee, which drafted the \u201cwindow period\u201d provision, explained that it would extend coverage to a plan much like that of these appellants. Representative Thompson thus recommended the bill to his colleagues in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">In my own district, the Roebling plant of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Co. was closed June 30 thereby thrusting almost 1,400 men and women into the ranks of the unemployed. Many of these employees had 30 to 35 years of service in the plant .... Although the plant ceased operation June 30, the pension plan for those employees continues in existence. The conference substitute covers all pension plant [sic] terminations of single employer plans occurring after July 1, 1974. Inasmuch as the Roebling pension plan was not terminated prior to July 1,1974, within the meaning of the term as used in the conference report, the plant and its employees are covered [by section 1461(b) ].<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"arr-dedup-0\">Congress thus appears to have contemplated coverage under section 1461(b) of a plan for a plant in which <em>no </em>employees worked during the window period.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Even if one were to discount the significance of such remarks, however, the interpretation of ERISA \u201cmust be guided by the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation must be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.\u201d <em>Tcher-epnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 553, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967). <em>Accord Peyton v. Rowe, </em>391 U.S. 54, 65, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1555, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968); <em>International Union, UAW v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d 390, 396 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>National Automatic Laundry &amp; Cleaning Council v. Schultz, </em>443 F.2d 689, 706 (D.C.Cir.1971). This court has gone even further and articulated \u201cas a reasonable corollary\u201d of this basic doctrine the principle \u201cthat when a petitioner under a government benefits program puts forward an interpretation of a legislative provision that is arguably consonant with the statutory language, he is at least entitled to a reasoned statement why the administrator will not adopt that interpretation.\u201d <em>UAW v. Marshall, </em>584 F.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">In the <em>UAW </em>case we were required to determine whether the Secretary of Labor had properly construed a provision in the Trade Act of 1974, a primary purpose of which was to expand eligibility for \u201cworker adjustment assistance\u201d for employees displaced by increased competition from imports in their industry. Eligibility under the 1974 Act turned in part on whether increased competition from imports contributed importantly to the separation of a significant number of workers \u201cin a firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof.\u201d In the absence of any specific legislative history behind this clause, the Secretary had determined that the largest \u201cappropriate subdivision\u201d for the purposes of this provision was the individual plant. The UAW had argued for larger subunits, such as all the plants involved in production of a particular car model which would have expanded eligibility. It contended that the use of \u201can\u201d before \u201cappropriate subdivision\u201d supported its interpretation that several subdivisions were possible and that \u201can appropriate subdivision\u201d need not be the most appropriate subdivision. Finding the UAW\u2019s interpretation plausible, this court remanded to the Secretary for an explanation of the circumstances that he believed <em>mandated </em>the choice of the plant as the appropriate subdivision in light of this duty \u201cto choose a subdivision that best effectuates the purposes of the Trade Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">The <em>UAW </em>case is an application of the familiar principle that an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutory language, which we or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>dinarily will uphold as long as it is reasonable, must be consistent with the purpose of the legislation. Where the language at issue is part of a novel and comprehensive remedial scheme like ERISA, the <em>UAW </em>case teaches that this principle has a sharper edge to it: If a putative beneficiary advances a plausible interpretation of the statute, the agency must at least give a rational explanation why its own more restrictive interpretation is nevertheless reasonable in light of the purpose of the legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I do not believe we have been given any satisfactory explanation by PBGC here as to why it rejected the appellants\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The PBGC, now backed by the majority, asserts that a countervailing legislative purpose \u2014 that of ensuring the financial integrity of the insurance fund and of keeping premiums low \u2014 justifies its niggardly construction of eligibility under section 1461. I find such a generalized economic justification wholly inadequate. First, every piece of remedial legislation that involves the disbursement of money has a secondary \u201cpurpose\u201d of not disbursing <em>too much </em>money and thus endangering the program. In the <em>UAW </em>case itself, there was surely a legislative purpose to conserve funds for those whose jobs were most clearly affected by imports. But until the agency could demonstrate that this secondary purpose was actually undermined by the petitioner\u2019s construction of the statute, it was governed instead by the overriding remedial purpose of affording coverage in cases that reasonably came within the statutory eligibility definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">In this case, the PBGC has not attempted to demonstrate that the financial integrity of its insurance fund would be threatened or the employers\u2019 premiums affected by a decision to cover the appellants\u2019 pension benefits. Because of the unusual finite nature of \u201cwindow period\u201d claims, the PBGC concedes that a decision in favor of the appellants here would probably not affect a single other case. There are no floodgates; the window has already been closed for several years, precluding any substantial drain on ERISA\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">The PBGC also concedes it has the statutory authority to extend coverage to these claimants under section 1461(b), since it is undisputed that benefits ceased to \u201caccrue\u201d during the window period. However, enveloping itself in the comfortable cloak of agency discretion, the PBGC has decided not to apply the simple and objective test of when benefits no longer accrue but rather to determine the eligibility of all \u201cwindow period\u201d claimants solely under the second statutory criterion, \u201cany other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.\u201d According to the PBGC, the statute\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d grants it the discretion to read out <em>of the </em>statute the \u201caccrual of benefits\u201d test and to apply the \u201cany reasonable basis\u201d test in every case. The majority agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">I disagree. The PBGC\u2019s (and now the majority\u2019s) interpretation of the statute renders meaningless the first and more objective \u201caccrual of benefits\u201d test. This, of course, violates \u201c[t]he cardinal principle of statutory construction [which is] to save and not to destroy .. . [and] to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 519-20, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955). To avoid this result, appellants read the statute as granting the PBGC the discretion under the second test to expand coverage to some who would not qualify under the \u201caccrual of benefits\u201d test, but not the discretion to deny coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>where it would be authorized under the first test. Such an interpretation would give effect to every clause in the statute and would be far more consistent with the remedial purpose of ERISA and section 1461(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This construction would also avoid the counterintuitive result reached by the PBGC in this case, where it concluded that a plan had terminated before benefits under the plan had \u201cceased to accrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The PBGC achieves this result by deciding that section 1461(b) coverage does not extend to plans that, according to a balancing of all the factors under the \u201cother reasonable basis\u201d test, have \u201ceffectively\u201d or \u201csubstantially\u201d terminated before the \u201cwindow period.\u201d The PBGC thus appears to have read into section 1461(b) an additional stumbling block for claimants that would be unwarranted even if one accepted the PBGC\u2019s argument that it has absolute discretion to choose the \u201cany other reasonable basis\u201d test for deciding when a plan \u201cterminated.\u201d Counsel for the PBGC at oral argument had difficulty saying that this plan had actually terminated before July 1,1974, but could say only that the <em>process </em>of plan termination had gone far enough to justify its conclusion that the plan had terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">In support thereof the majority and the PBGC emphasize the marginal nature of the accrual of benefits within the \u201cwindow period.\u201d Of course, anytime a statute sets out a clear bright line and objective criteria for placing cases on one side or another, it is almost inevitable that some cases will fall very close to the line. But it is an important virtue of clear and objective criteria that they provide a ready way to resolve those close cases. The PBGC would abandon the clear line suggested by Congress for a balancing of all the relevant factors, a method of decisionmaking that maximizes its own discretion. It would further expand its discretion by permitting exclusion of plans that have substantially terminated (but not yet actually terminated). I do not believe that the \u201cplain language\u201d of section 1461(b) vests so much discretion in the PBGC.</p>\n<p id=\"AmEB\">In my view, the PBGC has squeezed every last drop of agency discretion it could extract \u2014 and some it rightly couldn\u2019t \u2014 from a few words of a statutory scheme intended to remedy the disastrous consequences of pension plan collapse, and thus drowned the only hope these 250 individuals had of restoring a measure of retirement security. I cannot approve this result as a reasonable one based on a reasonable construction of section 1461(b) of ERISA. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b920-9\">.

The <em>UAW </em>case means simply that the reasonableness of an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation, and of its rejection of another more generous and fully plausible interpretation, must be evaluated in light of the statute\u2019s broad remedial purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. Such an interpretation would also be consistent with Representative Thompson\u2019s expectation that the Roebling plan would be covered by section 1461(b). <em>See supra </em>p. 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
