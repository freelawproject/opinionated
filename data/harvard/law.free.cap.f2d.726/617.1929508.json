In May 1980, a federal grand jury indicted defendant on six counts of bank embezzlement, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656, and on six counts of making false entries in bank accounts, violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005. On June 23, 1980, the day the trial was to commence, the government moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to Fed.R. Crim.P. 48(a). The government offered no reasons for its motion to dismiss other than that dismissal would \u201cbest meet the ends of justice.\u201d Defendant objected, asserting that she was ready for trial and that the government had not alleged any legitimate or compelling reason for dismissing the indictment without prejudice. Without further inquiry, the district court dismissed the indictment without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">On November 1, 1982, a federal grand jury returned another indictment charging the defendant with the same criminal conduct, six counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 and six counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005. Before the same trial judge who had dismissed the first indictment, defendant moved to dismiss the second indictment. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in dismissing the original indictment without prejudice because the government did not submit any reasons for dismissal. Agreeing with defendant\u2019s reasoning, the trial court concluded it had abused its discretion, declaring, \u201cClearly, if a court cannot exercise its sound discretion without the facts, it must be an abuse of discretion for the court to grant a motion to dismiss without receiving the factual basis therefor.\u201d It thereupon dismissed the second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-19\">Except \u201cduring\u201d trial, the prosecutor may dismiss an indictment \u201cby leave of court.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As originally pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>posed by the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, Rule 48(a) allowed a prosecutor to dismiss without leave of court but required that the prosecutor state reasons for seeking dismissal. However, in promulgating the rule, the Supreme Court deleted this requirement and added the requirement that the prosecutor obtain leave of court. <em>See United States v. Ammidown, </em>497 F.2d 615, 620 (D.C.Cir.1973); 3A C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 812 (2d ed. 1982). The government contends that the text of Rule 48(a) and the history of its enactment indicate that the prosecutor need not state reasons for seeking the dismissal of an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We disagree. The primary purpose of the requirement that the prosecutor obtain leave of court is to prevent harassment of a defendant by a prosecutor\u2019s charging, dismissing, and recharging the defendant with a crime. <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 29 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. 81, 85 n. 15, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Ammidown, </em>497 F.2d at 620; <em>United States v. Cox, </em>342 F.2d 167,171 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Cox v. Hauberg, </em>381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767, 14 L.Ed.2d 700 (1965); <em>Woodring v. United States, </em>311 F.2d 417, 424 (8th Cir.), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Felice v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 913, 83 S.Ct. 1304, 10 L.Ed.2d 414 (1963). Thus, to honor the purpose of the rule, the trial court at the very least must know the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for seeking to dismiss the indictment and the facts underlying the prosecutor\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>693 F.2d 348, 352 (5th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Ammidown, </em>497 F.2d at 620. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s order granting or denying a motion to dismiss an indictment is reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Salinas, </em>701 F.2d 41, 42 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Cowan, </em>524 F.2d 504, 513 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Woodruff v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 971, 96 S.Ct. 2168, 48 L.Ed.2d 795 (1976). A decision granting a motion to dismiss an indictment without prejudice is no less reviewable after the government secures a second indictment against the defendant. <em>Cf. United States v. Salinas, </em>693 F.2d 348 (5th Cir.1982) (conviction on second indictment reversed because district court had erroneously dismissed original indictment). If the record contains no reasons or facts explaining the trial court\u2019s decision, the trial court\u2019s decision is effectively unreviewable. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly determined that it abused its discretion when it did not require that the government state reasons for its desire to dismiss the original indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Finally, we address the question of whether the court\u2019s remedy \u2014 dismissing the second indictment, in effect altering the first dismissal to one with prejudice \u2014 was appropriate. We conclude that this remedy was proper under the circumstances of this case. In the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the second indictment, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ringer explained his position at the time of the earlier motion: \u201cI was dissatisfied with the state of the investigation and the state the charges were in. So, we moved to dismiss for the purpose of continuing the further investigation into the matter.\u201d Unless the government could articulate a better reason for dismissal than this, we think that the trial judge would have had to deny the motion considering that it was made over defendant\u2019s objection and on the day trial was scheduled to begin. Hence, remanding the case for a determination whether the government had valid reasons for dismissing the original indictment would be fruitless. Moreover, if the trial court had initially ruled correctly and refused to dismiss the original indictment, the government\u2019s only alternatives would have been to try a case in which it was obviously unprepared to proceed or to move to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Thus, we do not regard the trial court\u2019s remedy as unduly harsh. Under the circumstances, dismissing the second indictment was the only sanction that would effectuate the primary purpose of Rule 48(a). <em>See United States v. Fields, </em>475 F.Supp. 903, 907 (D.D.C.1979). Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\">. Rule 48(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-15\"><em>\u201cBy Attorney for Government. </em>The Attorney General or the United States attorney may by leave of court file a dismissal of an indictment, information or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate.
