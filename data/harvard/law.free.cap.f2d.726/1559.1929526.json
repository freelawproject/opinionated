All three debtors have subsequently become bankrupt. The lender got a detailed financial statement and credit check on the debtors and on one David J. Harris, who as a matter of friendship became guarantor on the loan. He refused, however, to sign ITT\u2019s standard printed lengthy \u201cboiler-plate\u201d guaranty form, but had a law partner negotiate on his behalf with ITT\u2019s lawyer a typewritten addition or non obstante clause limiting his liability to- the liability of the borrowers under a note of even date, and requiring any sums paid by them to ITT to be applied against the note. Harris\u2019s guarantee was to be unsecured and enforceable only to the extent that the liability of the borrowers under the note was valid and enforceable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harris also took an indemnification agreement, and has foreclosed on Cooley\u2019s house to protect himself on this and another bank loan of which he was guarantor. He also formed a corporation known as DJH, Inc. to monitor proper application of the funds from the ITT loan to the conduct of Cooley\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-16\">In addition to the Harris, guarantee which was the real security upon which ITT based the loan (his net worth was more than the amount lent) ITT unilaterally, as an afterthought, and without negotiating with anyone, prepared a guaranty on their standard form to be signed by Cooley\u2019s wife Virginia (a student nurse) and his mother (a retired telephone operator). One Shela Baird, of ITT\u2019s credit department, procured presentation of the guaranty document to the Cooley women by one Leslie Taylor, an employee of Alex Cooley. This document was not accompanied by any of the cognate papers setting forth the terms of the loan which the ladies were being asked to guarantee. It was \u201copen-ended\u201d and did not specify any dollar amount of liability under the loan. (Mr. Harris, in the additional typewritten paragraph which he insisted upon including in the guaranty which he signed, specified that he was to be liable only for the note of even date in the amount of $200,545.92).</p>\n<p id=\"b1632-17\">Virginia and Frances Cooley did sign (without reading it) the document brought to them by Leslie Taylor, who had from time to time brought papers which Alex Cooley wanted them to sign. They supposed this was another such document coming from their husband or son, and it was their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>practice to sign such papers routinely, relying upon Alex\u2019s business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-4\">They did not know, when Leslie Taylor brought this particular guaranty document, that she was ITT in sheep\u2019s clothing. They did not know that ITT\u2019s Baird, rather than Alex Cooley, wanted them to sign, and was \u201cshort-circuiting\u201d normal channels by taking it directly to the women rather than leaving it at Cooley\u2019s office for his scrutiny and approval before it was sent on to them for signature. Had they known it was ITT who wanted them to sign, they would not only have read it but would have withheld action until after consulting Alex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-5\">On April 30, 1979, an extension agreement was executed. On this occasion the same deceptive procedure was again employed of having Leslie Taylor, as ITT in sheep\u2019s clothing, bring the document to Virginia Cooley and Frances Cooley to procure their signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-6\">On these facts the District Court correctly found that the ladies had been \u201cmisled and overreached to such an extent that the contract is unconscionable.\u201d He properly concluded, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, that \u201cenforcement of the guaranty agreements against the Cooley women would lead to an unconscionable result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-7\">In vain does able counsel for ITT contend that \u201cunconscionability\u201d is a term of art coined by the framers of the Uniform Commercial Code and is there confined to sales contracts and consumer purchases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Courts of equity have long been wont to relieve against every form of fraud and artifice and sharp practice or deception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1633-8\">As well stated in appellee\u2019s brief (p. 8): ITT induced them through chicanery into providing their signature and ITT did not have Leslie Taylor deliver to the Appel-lees the documents describing the loan they were guaranteeing .... The doctrine of unconscionability applies to circumstances such as these where it would be grossly inequitable to allow ITT to benefit from its own misleading conduct. ... It is undisputed that the Ap-pellees\u2019 (sic) did not read the agreements because of the artifice of the appellant. .. . The Supreme Court defined an unconscionable contract in <em>Hume v. United States, </em>132 U.S. 406 [10 S.Ct. 134, 33 L.Ed. 393] (1889) by restating the common law of England from the previous century. <em>Shell Oil Company v. Kapler, </em>235 Minn. 292, 50 N.W.2d 707 (1951), the decision cited by the District Court in granting Appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, is based upon general contract principles of inequity and unconscionability, not the Uniform. Commercial Code. Because \u00a7 2-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code evolved from a widely accepted doctrine, the trend has been to expand the scope of its application rather than to limit it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1633-13\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1632-14\">. By virtue of this language Harris claimed discharge because the debtors had been discharged by bankruptcy; and also because the actual note signed by the borrowers was not prepared and executed until the next day, February 16, 1979, rather than being of even date as described in the guaranty. ITT\u2019s suit against Harris required resolution of disputed fact questions and went over for trial when the motion for summary judgment on behalf of Cooley\u2019s wife and mother was granted by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1633-9\">.
