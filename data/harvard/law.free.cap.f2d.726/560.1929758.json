The district court dismissed the entire action as untimely. In this appeal, we must decide whether to apply retroactively the statute of limitations required by either <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981), or <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of </em>Teamsters,U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). We conclude that neither <em>Mitchell </em>nor <em>DelCostello </em>should be applied retroactively. We therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">Gulf Trading and Transportation Company (Gulf) discharged Barina on October 22, 1979. Barina protested to his union, the National Maritime Union (NMU). NMU obtained a settlement of the grievance which afforded Barina reinstatement, but not payment of full back wages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> NMU notified Barina of the settlement by letter on June 11, 1980. Barina disapproved of the settlement and brought suit on June 24, 1981, against Gulf under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and against NMU for violation of its duty of fair representation. Following the pattern in hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation actions, the complaint alleged that the union violated its duty of fair representation during the grievance proceeding and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the terms of the settlement violated the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Barina\u2019s cause of action accrued on July 12, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the then prevailing law, Barina\u2019s action against Gulf and NMU was timely. Because California law would have been the source of the applicable limitations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Barina had four years to file his suit against his employer, <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Flying Tiger Line, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1349,1353 (9th Cir.1981) (applying the four-year limitation for suits on written contracts provided by Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 337), and three years to file his suit against the union, <em>id. </em>(applying the three-year limitation for suits \u201cupon liability created by statute\u201d provided by Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 338(1)); <em>accord Edwards v. Teamsters Local Union No. 36, </em>719 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir.1983). As Barina filed his action less than a year after it accrued, his suit fell well within the then prevailing time limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The district court, however, applied <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981), retroactively.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It accordingly dismissed Barina\u2019s action as time barred. <em>Mitchell </em>held that the state limitation on challenges to commercial arbitration applied to suits brought by an employee against his employer to set aside a labor arbitration decision. The district court interpreted <em>Mitchell </em>as applying both to Barina\u2019s claim against Gulf and to his fair representation claim against NMU. Because California law provides a 100-day limitation period for challenges to commercial arbitration, Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 1288.2, the district court concluded that Barina\u2019s claims against Gulf and NMU were time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">After the district court\u2019s decision dismissing Barina\u2019s action, the Supreme Court decided <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of </em>Teamsters,-U.S.-, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). <em>DelCostello </em>holds that the applicable statute of limitations in hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation actions brought against the employer and the union is the six-month limitation period contained in \u00a7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). Gulf and NMU argue that, if we decline to uphold the district court\u2019s retroactive application of <em>Mitchell, </em>we should nevertheless affirm the district court by giving retrospective operation to <em>DelCostello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">I. Barina\u2019s suit against NMU.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">The district court erred in applying <em>Mitchell </em>retroactively to Barina\u2019s claim against NMU. We have held that <em>Mitchell </em>applies only to the employee\u2019s claim against his <em>employer </em>and that it does not affect the limitation applicable to the employee\u2019s claim against his union. <em>McNaughton v. Dillingham Corporation, </em>707 F.2d 1042, 1047-48 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cMcNaughton I\"), reh\u2019g denied, </em>722 F.2d 1459 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(\u201cMcNaughton II\"); Edwards v. Teamsters Local Union No. 36, </em>719 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 (9th Cir.1983). Those holdings control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">Nor can <em>DelCostello </em>be applied retroactively to bar Barina\u2019s claim against NMU. We squarely confronted that question in <em>Edwards v. Teamsters Local No. 36, </em>719 F.2d 1036, 1040-41 (9th Cir.1983). There we decided that <em>DelCostello </em>was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>to be applied retroactively. <em>Accord McNaughton II.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Because <em>Mitchell </em>is inapplicable and <em>Del-Costello </em>does not apply retroactively, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bari-na\u2019s action against NMU.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">II. Barina\u2019s claim against Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">A. Retroactive application of <em>Mitchell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In <em>Singer v. Flying Tiger Line Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir.1981), we held that <em>Mitchell </em>was not to be applied retroactively to an action brought by an employee' against his employer to set aside an arbitration decision. That ruling controls here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Gulf argues that <em>Singer </em>should not be followed because it was effectively overruled by <em>Local 1020 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>v. <em>FMC Corporation, </em>658 F.2d 1285 (9th Cir.1981), and <em>San Diego County District Council of Carpenters v. Cory, </em>685 F.2d 1137 (9th Cir.1982). In those cases, we did apply the short state limitations applicable to actions to set aside commercial arbitration to claims arising prior to <em>Mitchell. </em>Neither case, however, discussed the retroactivity issue. More important, both cases involved a <em>union </em>suing an employer to have an arbitration decision set aside on the ground that the decision did not draw it essence from the collective bargaining agreements. That cause of action lacks a fair representation element and thus differs from the cause of action here and at issue in <em>Mitchell. United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. FMC Corporation, </em>724 F.2d 815, 816 \u2014 17 (9th Cir.1984). Therefore, those cases do not effectively overrule <em>Singer.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">B. Retroactive application of <em>DeiCostello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">We lack controlling precedent concerning DeiCostello\u2019s retroactive application in suits brought by an employee against his employer to set aside arbitration. Therefore, we must resolve the retro-activity question by weighing the three factors specified in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97,106-07, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355-56, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971). Those factors are (1) whether the decision establishes a new principle of law, (2) whether retroactive application will further or retard the purposes of the rule in question, and (3) whether applying the new decision will produce substantial inequitable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">The first and the third factors militate against retroactivity here. <em>DeiCostello </em>establishes a new principle of law because it imposes a limitation on the employee that is eight times shorter than the limitation that applied when his claim arose. Moreover, <em>DeiCostello </em>deviated from the Supreme Court\u2019s prior direction in <em>UAW v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 704-05, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>S.Ct. 1107, 1112-13, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966), that the applicable statute of limitations be drawn from state law. <em>See Pitts v. Frito Lay, Inc., </em>700 F.2d 330, 333 n. 3 (6th Cir. 1983). As for the third factor, \u201cit would ... produce the most \u2018substantial inequitable results\u2019 to hold that the respondent \u2018slept on his rights\u2019 at a time when he could not have known the time limitation that the law imposed on him.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Chevron Oil, </em>404 U.S. at 108, 92 S.Ct. at 356 (quoting <em>Cipri-ano v. City of Houma, </em>395 U.S. 701, 706, 89 S.Ct. 1897, 1900, 23 L.Ed.2d 647 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The second <em>Chevron Oil </em>factor does favor retroactivity in this case. A substantial purpose behind the six-month limitation developed in <em>DelCostello </em>is to give finality to labor disputes. 103 S.Ct. at 2294. Affording Barina four years in which to sue the employer detracts from the principle of finality. In our view, however, the strength of the considerations relating to the first and third factors outweigh that relating to the second factor in this case. <em>See Singer, </em>652 F.2d at 1353. We conclude that <em>DelCos-tello </em>should not be applied retroactively to bar Barina\u2019s claim against Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><em>Singer, Edwards, </em>and <em>McNaughton II </em>confirm our decision not to apply <em>DelCostello </em>retroactively to Barina\u2019s suit against Gulf. Those cases presented issues analogous to the one we now decide. In <em>Singer, </em>we confronted the question whether a 100-day limitation mandated by <em>Mitchell </em>should be applied retroactively to an employee\u2019s suit against his employer; in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>McNaughton II, </em>the issue was whether <em>Del-</em>Costello\u2019s six-month limitation should be applied retroactively to an employee\u2019s fair representation suit against his union. All three cases resolved their analogous issues as we do here: they decided against retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Because neither <em>Mitchell </em>nor <em>DelCostello </em>may be applied retroactively to Barina\u2019s suit against Gulf, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Barina\u2019s action against Gulf, like its dismissal of Barina\u2019s action against NMU, was erroneous. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\">. The settlement resulted from an informal grievance proceeding. Although the settlements involved in <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>DelCostello </em>resulted from arbitration, not an informal grievance proceeding, nothing turns on this distinction. The same limitation periods apply whether an employee\u2019s grievance is resolved with or without going to arbitration. <em>McNaughton v. Dillingham Corp., </em>707 F.2d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 1983), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>722 F.2d 1459 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\">. The district court selected July 12, 1980, as the date of accrual because the collective bargaining agreement afforded NMU 30 days to take a grievance decision to arbitration. Therefore Barina knew, or should have known, by July 12 that his dispute with Gulf had been finally resolved. Barina contends that accrual occurred later. Our disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to determine which of the dates urged by the parties is the correct one; all are within the limitation period that we apply. We therefore need not resolve whether accrual occurs when the employee learns, or should have learned, that his dispute was finally resolved, as the district court held, or whether accrual occurs when the employee learns, or should have learned, that the union may have violated its duty of fair representation. For simplicity, we accept the district court\u2019s determination of accrual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-16\">. The parties agree that California is the appropriate source for all relevant state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-17\">. <em>Mitchell </em>was decided on April 20, 1981, slightly more than nine months after Barina\u2019s cause of action accrued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\">. We recognize that the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits reached conclusions contrary to <em>Edwards </em>and applied <em>DelCostello </em>retroactively. <em>Perez v. Dana Corporation, </em>718 F.2d 581 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Murray v. Branch Motor Express Co., </em>723 F.2d 1146 (4th Cir. 1983); Edwards v. <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>720 F.2d 857 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Lincoln v. District 9 of the International Association of Machinists, </em>723 F.2d 627 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Rogers v. Lockheed-Georgia Co., </em>720 F.2d 1247 (11th Cir. 1983). The Seventh Circuit has also applied <em>DeiCostello </em>retroactively without discussing the issue. <em>Metz v. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc., </em>715 F.2d 299, 301-303 (7th Cir.1983). <em>Edwards v. Teamsters Local Union No. 36 </em>and <em>McNaughton II, </em>however, establish the law of this circuit and binds us. We also happen to agree with their analyses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\">. Because the plaintiff was an airline employee in <em>Singer, </em>the action against the employer was brought under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>rather than under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. This distinction, which the court in <em>Singer </em>ignored, is without import and does not provide a basis for distinguishing <em>Singer.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-15\">. In <em>McNaughton I, </em>we did apply <em>Mitchell </em>retroactively to a hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim brought by an employee against his employer. In that case, however, we expressly declined to entertain plaintiffs contention that <em>Mitchell </em>should not be applied retroactively because the contention had not been raised in the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1047 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">We reject Gulfs contention th\u00e1t <em>McNaughton I\u2019s </em>reasoning requires application of California\u2019s 100-day limitation apart from its reliance on <em>Mitchell. Mitchell </em>is fundamental to <em>McNaughton </em>J\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. The inequity of retroactive application of <em>Del-Costello </em>is greatly diminished, of course, if the six-month limitation of <em>DelCostello </em>is applied to a claim arising <em>before DelCostello </em>but after <em>Mitchell. </em>The effect then is to <em>lengthen </em>the limitation from the customarily short (20-100 day) period applicable to actions to set aside commercial arbitrations. While prejudice to the defendant might occasionally result from the resurrection of a claim once thought dead, it is not likely to equal the prejudice to the plaintiff resulting from the unexpected death of a claim thought to be alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">In this case, retroactive application of <em>Del-Costello </em>would drastically shorten the limitation otherwise applicable to Barina\u2019s claim under the law of this circuit. The same was true in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>McNaughton II, </em>where we held <em>DelCostello </em>was not to be applied retroactively to unfair representation claims against a union.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
