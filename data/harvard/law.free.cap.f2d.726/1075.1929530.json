JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1149-25\">Objecting stockholders of General Tire and Rubber Company (General Tire) John J. Pearl, Curtis R. Pearl and George B. Schreiber (objectors) appeal from an order of the district court approving the settlement of derivative claims arising from General Tire\u2019s extensive corporate misfeasance. Schreiber additionally contends that the district court erred in denying his petition to intervene, while the Pearls additionally claim that the district court erred in failing to provide adequate notice of and an adequate hearing on the proposed settlement. The principal issue before this Court, however, is whether the district court\u2019s approval of the settlement of eight shareholder derivative suits pending against General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>Tire constituted an abuse of discretion. After careful consideration of the law and policy in this complex area, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">The lengthy and convoluted history, from which the present appeal derives, begins in the 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s. During that period, General Tire engaged in ubiquitous corporate improprieties and apparent illegalities. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uncovered these activities and instituted civil proceedings against General Tire. On May 10, 1976, the SEC\u2019s investigation culminated in the filing of a complaint, consent decree and judgment. <em>SEC v. The General Tire and Rubber Co., </em>[1975-76] Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCN) \u00b695,542 (D.D.C.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">This consent decree permanently enjoined General Tire from committing similar violations in the future. The decree also required General Tire to establish a Special Review Committee of its Board of Directors for the purpose of investigating and reporting the suspect activities cited in the SEC\u2019s complaint. The SEC approved the director chosen to head the committee, the independent counsel selected to inform the inquiry and the independent accountant procured to aid in the investigation. The committee conducted an extensive investigation, and filed a thorough report in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The report details General Tire\u2019s prior offensive and illegal practices, and suggests remedial action to prevent future improprieties. The Committee recommended that General Tire overhaul internal auditing procedures, enlarge the scope of independent accountant review, revise the procedures of General Tire\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, RKO General, and return misappropriated corporate funds. The Committee also determined that because board members Henkel, Henry, Mansfield, Morley, O\u2019Neil and Walsh were not involved in any of the cited suspect activities, they were qualified to implement the proposed changes. In addition, the Committee found that the law and accounting firms chosen to investigate General Tire had no previous contact with the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">While the Special Committee conducted its investigation, four separate derivative suits were filed on behalf of General Tire against certain officers and directors alleging damages and seeking remedial relief from the \u201cquestionable payments\u201d cited in the SEC complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 18, 1977, the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation consolidated the suits in the Northern District of Ohio. <em>In Re: General Tire &amp; Rubber Company Securities Litigation, </em>429 F.Supp. 1032 (J.P.M.D.L.1977). A Committee of the General Tire Board of Directors then retained the independent law firm of Bricker, Evatt, Barton <em>&amp; </em>Eckler of Columbus, Ohio (presently Bricker &amp; Eckler) to aid them in determining whether the continuation of the derivative suits was in General Tire\u2019s best interests. The Bricker firm concluded that independent members of the Board had the power to discontinue the suits, that Henkel, Henry, Mansfield, Morley and Walsh were such \u201cindependent members\u201d and that they should instruct their counsel to \u201cseek dismissal of the four shareholders derivative suits now pending against the company.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following Brick-er\u2019s recommendations, these directors decided not to pursue the derivative suits. General Tire and various individual defendants thereafter moved for summary dismissal of the suits. Those motions and further discovery were stayed, pending approval of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">On January 24, 1980, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) refused to renew broadcast licenses held by RKO General, a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Tire. These licenses are worth over ten million dollars. The FCC based its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>to deny renewal on the fact that (1) General Tire and RKO General had engaged in reciprocal trade practices in contravention of the anti-trust laws, (2) RKO had filed inaccurate financial records, and (3) RKO had deliberately withheld information from the SEC in its investigation of General Tire. <em>In Re: Application of RKO General, Inc., </em>78 FCC 2d 1 (1980). RKO appealed the FCC\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Court reversed the loss of two licenses, but affirmed the loss of a third license because RKO wrongfully withheld information during the renewal proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">After the FCC decided to deny the licenses, derivative suits were filed on behalf of both RKO and General Tire. These suits were calculated to recover damages incurred by General Tire and RKO as a result of the loss of the licenses. On March 27, 1980, two new directors, Lester Garvin and R.B. Tull\u00eds, were appointed by General Tire to another special litigation committee. They recommended that the Company invoke the business judgment rule and dismiss the derivative actions. That recommendation was supported by additional conclusions reached by Bricker. Seven \u201cindependent\u201d directors adopted the recommendation, whereupon the defendants filed motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The suit was then transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and joined for settlement purposes with the four previous 1977 derivative suits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">On March 3, 1981, the district court ordered discovery on the issue of the independence of directors and requested supplemental briefing on the effect of the termination of RKO\u2019s licenses. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits were persuaded by discovery that the directors were indeed independent. After discovery, the parties entered into settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">On June 25,1981, the parties in the several derivative actions presented for the district court\u2019s approval a Stipulation of Settlement. The terms of that Settlement are the subject of this appeal. Those terms reflect the parties\u2019 belief that General Tire\u2019s independent directors were empowered, as a matter of law, to determine whether these actions should be maintained, that those directors were duly chosen to dismiss the actions and that the continuation of the litigation would create a great business hardship for General Tire. The settlement also acknowledges the plaintiffs\u2019 role in implementing remedial action to prevent future improprieties and provides for the appointment for three years of two \u201coutside\u201d directors on the RKO Board. Although the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys did receive a fee award, neither General Tire nor RKO recovered monetary damages. The settlement\u2019s terms finally require the dismissal of all claims relating to the complaints and the waiver of all rights to recover losses incurred by General Tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">On July 20, 1981, notice of a settlement hearing was sent to all 50,000 of General Tire\u2019s shareholders. The notice described the nature of the case, the terms of the proposed settlement, the independent directors\u2019 conclusion that the continuation of the derivative suits was not in the corporation\u2019s best interest and the shareholders\u2019 right to appear at the hearing and object to the terms of the agreement. The Pearls and Sehreiber were among the five stockholders who objected to the settlement\u2019s terms. They appeared at the hearing and objected to the settlement based upon arguments similar to the ones that they raised before the district court and to ones that they now raise before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">After consideration of those arguments, the district court entered an order on December 15, 1981 approving the settlement agreement as \u201cfair, reasonable and ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>quate.\u201d The Court stated that the \u201cOhio formulation of the business judgment doctrine\u201d placed upon the independent directors the responsibility to decide whether derivative suits should be dismissed. The Court concluded, therefore, that the suits would \u201cvery likely\u201d be dismissed on summary judgment. The factors noted by the Court in support of the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the settlement included (1) the fashioning of remedial measures, (2) the appointment of outside directors to RKO\u2019s board, (3) the difficulty of proving damages to and recovering damages for the corporation, (4) the complexity and expense of further litigation and (5) the relatively small number of objectors to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In this \u201creasonableness\u201d calculus, the district court referred generally to the pending FCC and IRS proceedings. After the district court determined that the settlement was \u201cfair, reasonable and adequate,\u201d the Supreme Court denied certiorari in the case of <em>RKO General v. FCC, </em>670 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1981). RKO thereby exhausted its appellate remedies and forfeited all rights to one of its major television licenses. In May, 1982, the station terminated its operations at an estimated loss of over $100,000,-000.00. The district court did not consider the effect of that specific dollar loss in concluding that the settlement agreement was \u201cfair, reasonable and adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">By separate order, the district court also denied Schreiber the right to intervene as a party to this litigation. The Court stated that, as a shareholder, .Schreiber had been adequately represented. Furthermore, the district court stressed that Schreiber has the right to appeal, a right which he now exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Although these factual circumstances which give rise to the present appeal are quite complex, our task as a reviewing court is clearly defined. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1, which governs derivative suits, provides that \u201c[t]he action should not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court.\u201d This Court will set aside the district court\u2019s approval of a settlement agreement only if the discretion afforded that court has been abused. <em>Masterson v. Pergament, </em>203 F.2d 315 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>346 U.S. 832, 74 S.Ct. 33, 98 L.Ed. 355 (1953); <em>Cohen v. Young, </em>127 F.2d 721 (6th Cir.1942); <em>Young v. Katz, </em>447 F.2d 431 (5th Cir.1971). The discretion afforded by Rule 23.1 permits the district court to act as a third party to the compromise and a guardian of the corporation\u2019s interest. <em>Masterson, </em>203 F.2d at 315. The proponents of the settlement, however, have the burden of persuading the court that their compromise is fair, reasonable and adequate. <em>Cotton v. Hinton, </em>559 F.2d 1326 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">A. Approval of the Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">The objectors now principally assert that the district court abused its discretion in approving the settlement. They contend that (1) the court erred in its assessment of the Ohio business judgment doctrine\u2019s effect on the success of the pending litigation, (2) erred in its determination that the outside directors acted independently, impartially and in good faith, and (3) erred in its conclusion that the settlement was \u201cfair, reasonable and adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">(1) The Ohio Business Judgment Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">In the context of shareholder derivative suits, the interpretation and application of the business judgment rule is a question of state law. <em>Burks v. Lasker, </em>441 U.S. 471, 99 S.Ct. 1831, 60 L.Ed.2d 404 (1979). Because General Tire is incorporated in Ohio, the law of that state clearly applies to this action. Ohio, as a general matter, has adopted the business judgment rule. <em>Sims v. Street Railroad Co., </em>37 Ohio St. 556 (1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">In <em>Wadsworth v. Davis, </em>13 Ohio St. 123 (1862), the Ohio Court first held that the board of directors is empowered to decide whether to bring a suit on behalf of the corporation. Courts may not challenge the directors\u2019 decision where that decision is unbiased and made in good faith. <em>Rice v. Wheeling Dollar Savings &amp; Trust Co., </em>71 Ohio L.Abs. 205, 130 N.E.2d 442 (1954); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number><em>Roderick v. Canton Hog Ranch Co., </em>46 Ohio App. 475,189 N.E. 669 (1933). A stockholder has no independent right to bring a suit to void a contract unless the directors\u2019 refusal to bring the suit is \u201cwrongful, fraudulent and arbitrary.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Central Alloy Steel Corp., </em>43 Ohio App. 455, 183 N.E. 439 (1931). The district court concluded from this line of cases that the Ohio formulation of the business judgment doctrine is \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and predicted that Ohio courts would apply that general doctrine to the particular circumstances of a shareholder\u2019s derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\">Although we do not find the impact of the Ohio business judgment rule upon this case to be \u201ccrystal clear,\u201d we do agree with the district court\u2019s assessment of that impact. In <em>Cooper, </em>wherein individual directors were named as defendants, the Court rejected a summary dismissal and addressed the merits of the underlying controversy. 183 N.E. at 442. The Court, in ruling for the directors, stated that they had met the \u201cseverest\u201d test of showing that the transactions were \u201cfair and free of taint of fraud.\u201d <em>Cooper </em>declined however to hold that this \u201cseverest\u201d test of director disinterestedness is the \u201crule\u201d in Ohio. 183 N.E. at 445. In <em>Roderick, </em>the Court refused to excuse the shareholder\u2019s lack of \u201cdemand\u201d on non-party and unbiased directors. But in view of the fact that the plaintiff had only alleged the directors\u2019 \u201csupine acquiescence\u201d in waste and mismanagement, and the fact \u201cthat they would not be called upon to order the corporation to sue themselves,\u201d the Court held that the \u201cdemand\u201d would not have been futile. The Second Circuit, in <em>Galef v. Alexander, </em>615 F.2d 51, 61 (2nd Cir.1980), interpreted the Ohio business judgment rule and inferred from this portion of the <em>Roderick </em>opinion that Ohio Courts might \u201cconsider a summary dismissal of a suit against [the directors in a derivative suit] to be unavailable.\u201d Finally in <em>Rice, </em>the Court validated a resolution opposing a lawsuit passed by directors who were not named as parties to the lawsuit and who were not involved in any wrongdoing. In approving the resolution, <em>Rice </em>relied upon the fact that there was <em>\u201cno </em>show-726 F.2d \u2014 25 ing\u201d that the directors\u2019 decision was biased. 130 N.E.2d 448. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">Our analysis of <em>Rice, Roderick </em>and <em>Cooper </em>coincides with the Second Circuit\u2019s review of those cases in <em>Galef. </em>The <em>Galef </em>court found that a liberal application of the Ohio business judgment rule to shareholder derivative actions is \u201chardly trumpeted\u201d by this line of cases. 615 F.2d at 61. We concur with the Second Circuit that these cases alone do not provide any \u201cclear\u201d guidance on the application of the Ohio business judgment rule to the case at bar. 615 F.2d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">The objectors contend that this Court should look to the federal policy underpinning \u00a7 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act for guidance on the application of the business judgment rule. Their contention is supported by language in <em>Galef. </em>In that case, the Second Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aru-dedup-1\">Even if Ohio law had been found generally to permit directors who have been sued to initiate a business judgment summary dismissal of the suit against them, serious questions would persist with respect to the ... directors\u2019 attempt to cause such a dismissal of the \u00a7 14(a) claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\"><em>Galef, </em>615 F.2d at 62. The <em>Galef </em>Court concluded that well-pleaded \u00a7 14(a) claims against directors are not the proper subject of summary dismissal. To the extent that the purposes underlying \u00a7 14(a) clash with th\u00e9 Ohio business judgment rule, that rule must give way to the overriding federal policy. In <em>Burks v. Lasker, </em>441 U.S. at 479, 99 S.Ct. at 1837, the Supreme Court agreed that state law should be applied to the business judgment issue \u201cunless the state laws permit action prohibited by the [federal statute], or unless \u2018their application would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">Were we to find, therefore, that the application of the Ohio business judgment rule to this case would run afoul of the policies of \u00a7 14(a), we would be unable to apply that rule, in any form, to this action. Thus we must decide whether the application of the Ohio business judgment rule would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>inconsistent with the prohibition in \u00a7 14(a). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-4\">It shall be unlawful for any person by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of any facility of a national securities exchange or otherwise, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, to solicit or to permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any security (other than an exempted security) registered pursuant to section 781 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a) (1976). The Congressional purpose of \u00a7 14(a) is to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate disclosure in proxy solicitation. <em>J.J. Case Co. v. Borak, </em>377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). The provision, more specifically, was intended to \u201ccontrol the conditions under which proxies may be solicited with a view to preventing the recurrence of abuses which ... [had] frustrated the free exercise of the voting rights of stockholders.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 13, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">We take profound note of the reality that, this federal policy is often frustrated by the application of a state\u2019s business judgment rule. In many instances, derivative actions are the only means of private redress for a \u00a7 14(a) violation. Summary dismissal of those cases \u201cwould be tantamount to denying a type of enforcement that is essential to the accomplishment of the goals of \u00a7 14(a).\u201d <em>Borak, </em>377 U.S. at 432, 84 S.Ct. at 1559. Indeed \u00a7 14(a) would become a nullity if a defendant-director in a derivative action alleging failure to supply adequate information in a proxy solicitation were permitted to dismiss the action on the basis of his own business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">The policies of \u00a7 14(a) do not clash with the business judgment rule, however, where a connection between the underlying allegations and the <em>proxy process </em>is absent. Where there is no \u201ccausal link between\u201d the challenged nondisclosures in the proxy statements and an influenced election, the conflict between a state\u2019s business judgment rule and the policies of \u00a7 14(a) is diluted. <em>See Galef, </em>615 F.2d at 66; <em>Gaines v. Haughton, </em>645 F.2d at 761, 773-76 (9th Cir.1981). In the case at bar, the objectors\u2019 proxy claims merely restate allegations relating to the underlying improprieties. Those claims are not connected with transactions authorized by the shareholders through the proxy process. The objectors in this case can not demonstrate a causal link between the challenged activity and the proxy process. The purposes of \u00a7 14(a), for that reason, do not apply to, and are not thwarted by, this particular derivative suit. We are unable to conclude, on these specific facts, that the existence of proxy statement claims under \u00a7 14(a) precludes dismissal of these suits or that Ohio law is preempted by any overriding federal policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">The inapplicability of federal law and the paucity of controlling Ohio law on the scope of the business judgment rule, therefore, requires that we search to other states for guidance on how the Ohio courts would apply that rule to the facts before us. \u00a7 1701.59 of the Ohio Code explicitly permits the board of directors to delegate to a special committee the power to decide whether litigation is in its best interests. Ohio law allows the directors to act in good faith reliance upon a special litigation committee\u2019s recommendations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>law of most states favors the extension of the business judgment rule to encompass decisions formulated by such an \u201cauthorized board committee comprised of disinterested directors as to the availability of asserting a cause of action possessed by the nominal corporation against some members of the board of directors for alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Watts v. <em>Des Moines Register and Tribune, </em>525 F.Supp. 1311, 1325 (S.D.Iowa 1981). <em>See Burks, </em>441 U.S. at 480, 99 S.Ct. at 1838; <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>615 F.2d 778, 782-83 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 869, 101 S.Ct. 206, 66 L.Ed.2d 89 (1980) (California law); <em>Abbey v.

Johnson, </em>89 F.R.D. 656, 662-663 (D.Mass.1981) (Maryland law); <em>Abramowitz v. Posner, </em>513 F.Supp. 120, 125-26 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (Delaware law). In view of this weight of authority and of \u00a7 1701.59, we join the district court\u2019s prediction that the Ohio courts would apply to these facts the business judgment rule, precluding unnecessary judicial interference with the decision of an independent disinterested corporate committee to forgo litigation of derivative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\">Objectors contend that if the business judgment rule extends at all to the actions of a special litigation committee, it must do so in the stringent form articulated in <em>Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado, </em>430 A.2d 779 (Del.S. Ct.1981). That decision seeks to balance the independent judgment of a board committee against unbridled plaintiff stockholder control of a derivative action. In an effort to achieve that balance, <em>Zapata </em>inquired into the independence and good faith of the committee and then applied its own business judgment to determine the propriety of summary dismissal. The Court fashioned four criteria for judicial review of an independent litigation committee\u2019s conclusion: (1) the procedural propriety \u2022 of an objector\u2019s suit, (2) the committee\u2019s corporate power to seek dismissal of the suit, (3) the disinterest, independence and good faith of committee members, the bases for the conclusion of such members and the appropriateness and sufficiency of their investigative techniques and (4) the Court\u2019s own independent business judgment. <em>Zapata, </em>430 A.2d at 784-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">The question before this Court, therefore, is whether the Ohio courts would adopt a more deferential review of a special litigation committee\u2019s findings or would question those findings in light of their own independent business judgment. We find much to commend both the conventional deferential view and the more novel <em>Zapata </em>view. Because we conclude that the district judge\u2019s review of the settlement decision complied with the more severe <em>Zapata </em>standard, however, we need not decide in this case which view the Ohio courts would adopt. The objectors clearly complied with Rule 23.1\u2019s \u201cdemand\u201d requirement and thus the district court found no procedural defect in initiating the derivative suit. The district judge, consistently with the <em>Zapata </em>standard, also clearly reviewed the committee\u2019s corporate power to seek dismissal under Ohio\u2019s business judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">(2) The Independence of the Outside Directors</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">The objectors contend that the district court did not adequately review the independence of the outside directors who decided to abandon the derivative suits. We find to the contrary that the district court did indeed carefully consider the disinterestedness of the outside directors. Generally, assertions of the director\u2019s lack of good faith must be supported by facts rather than by invective and conclusory allegations. <em>Gaines, </em>645 F.2d at 765. In circumstances in which the directors are <em>directly </em>liable, however, a well-pleaded complaint may suffice to place the burden upon the director to prove independence. See <em>e.g. Abramowitz v. Posner, </em>672 F.2d 1025 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Stein v. Bailey, </em>531 F.Supp. 684 (S.D.N.Y.1982). In the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>however, the, board members are not charged in the derivative actions with direct liability. The mere fact that a director has been named as a party or implicated in the litigation does not, without more, demonstrate bad faith. <em>Galef, </em>615 F.2d at 60 n. 17; <em>Lewis v. Anderson, </em>615 F.2d 778, 781-83 (9th Cir.1979); <em>Abbey v. Control Data Corp., </em>603 F.2d 724, 727 (8th Cir.1979), <em>cert, denied, </em>444 U.S. 1017, 100 S.Ct. 670, 62 L.Ed.2d 647 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">The Court properly found that the objectors had not demonstrated that the directors were biased. The Court examined the extensive record \u201cfor indications of suspicious relationships between these outside directors and the inside management of General Tire\u201d and \u201cfound none.\u201d The Special Review Committee, independent counsel and the Bricker &amp; Eckler firm each found that outside directors Walsh, Mansfield, Henkel, Morley, Tull\u00eds and Garvin were \u201cindependent.\u201d The district court concluded generally that these outside directors were \u201cindependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">The objectors challenge specifically the independence of. Henkel, a partner of the law firm retained by General Tire, and Gar-vin, who helped General Tire investigate its conduct in Chile. The district court reviewed the disinterestedness of Henkel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1156-6\">Mr. Henkel provided legal assistance to the Company as outside counsel for Securities-related matters for many years. These relationships in themselves would seem insufficient to establish bias in the outside directors, or control of them by inside management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">The district court properly concluded that Henkel\u2019s mere legal association with General Tire does not alone disqualify him from exercising independent business judgment. We cannot fashion a flat rule which allows only those individuals with absolutely <em>no </em>contact with the Company to exercise independent business judgment. Such a rule would preclude virtually every outside director from involvement in the business judgment by virtue of having been nominated or selected by the corporation. The district court did not abuse its discretion in analyzing Henkel\u2019s disinterestedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">The district court was similarly within its discretion when it determined that Garvin was capable of exercising independent business judgment. Garvin served General Tire as an \u201cindependent consultant\u201d to investigate its questionable corporate practices in Chile. As a former Citicorp officer with responsibility for Latin American business, Garvin was particularly well qualified for that investigation. Garvin did not participate in General Tire\u2019s Chilean affairs, he only participated in the corporation\u2019s attempt to scrutinize those affairs after they had occurred. The independence of Garvin is borne out by the Bricker firm\u2019s conclusion that he was \u201cabsolutely and totally unassociated\u201d with the events compiled in the Special Report or with the events surrounding the 1980 litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">Our review of the record indicates that the district judge conducted a careful examination into the independence of Garvin, Henkel and all of the outside directors. That examination revealed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMC\">little, if any, evidence to temper their appearance of being upright, responsible leaders in the business and civic communities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">The district judge properly found insufficient evidence of the outside director\u2019s fraud or bad faith to warrant the conclusion of the lack of independence. We find that the district judge\u2019s analysis of the \u201cdisinterest, independence and good faith\u201d of the committee members was consistent with the <em>Zapata </em>standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>(3) The Fairness, Reasonableness and Adequacy of the Settlement</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\">Moreover, the Objectors do not really question, nor could they succeed in questioning, the \u201cadequacy of the investigatory procedures\u201d and the \u201cbases for the Committee\u2019s conclusion.\u201d Aided by its counsel and accountants, an initial Special Review Committee conducted a thorough investigation into the history of General Tire\u2019s past practices. The Committee distributed questionnaires, conducted personal interviews, telephoned contacts, examined expense reports and reviewed all billings for sales in excess of $50,000. The Committee\u2019s work culminated in a 233 page report which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. General Tire used the Committee\u2019s findings and recommendations to help them determine whether the continuation of the derivative suits was in its best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">In addition, General Tire retained the Bricker firm to assess the independence of board members and the merits of the pending litigation. The firm recommended that the independent board members seek dismissal of the pending suits. Those members acted on the Bricker firm\u2019s advice. The process by which that recommendation was constructed and implemented was not only \u201cadequate,\u201d it was superior. The compilation of facts which formed the \u201cbases\u201d for the Committee\u2019s recommendations clearly satisfied the <em>Zapata </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-10\">The district court, perhaps most crucially, satisfied the final <em>Zapata </em>requirement by exercising its own independent business judgment to determine whether dismissal of the derivative suits was warranted. After reviewing the terms of the proposed settlement, the district judge independently concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1157-11\">It is the opinion of this Court, based upon the considerations just enunciated, that the proposed settlement is a reasonable one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1157-12\">The district court was not unmindful of the \u201cobvious\u201d shortcomings of the settlement, but felt that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court judged that the shareholders, all but five of whom accepted the agreement, \u201cwould have faced considerable difficulties had they brought this litigation to trial.\u201d The addition of outside directors to the board of RKO General and the small number of objectors to the settlement were also factors which the district court weighed in finding that the settlement was in the best business interests of the corporation. Thus the district court, in keeping with <em>Zapata, </em>gave \u201cspecial consideration to matters of law and public policy in addition to the corporation\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>See Zapata, </em>430 A.2d at 788. We conclude, therefore, that even under the more stringent version of the business judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>ment rule expressed in <em>Zapata, </em>the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the directors \u201cvery likely\u201d had the power to dismiss the derivative suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">The exercise of that power, of course,, precludes success on the merits. The most important of the factors to be considered in reviewing a settlement is the probability of success on the merits. <em>Newman v. Stein, </em>464 F.2d 689, 692 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert, denied, 409 </em>U.S. 1039, 93 S.Ct. 521, 34 L.Ed.2d 488 (1972). The likelihood of success, in turn, provides a gauge from which the benefits of the settlement must be measured. <em>See Cotton v. Hinton, </em>559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir.1977). The district court, in view of the slight possibility of successful litigation, was well within its discretion when it determined that the settlement was \u201creasonable, fair and adequate.\u201d The arguments against the reasonableness, fairness and adequacy of that settlement before this Court are no different from those raised below. The objectors, in effect, would have this Court reject the independent business judgment arrived at by a Special Committee of lawyers, accountants and businessmen after a thorough investigation. The objectors would also have this Court reject the additional independent business judgment of the district court after his careful review of the record. Even if we were to agree with the business judgment of the five objectors, we are not pre-. pared to substitute that judgment for the judgment of the district court, the Special Committee and the outside directors. Absent any finding that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the settlement was \u201creasonable, fair and adequate,\u201d we will not reverse that judgment merely because of a business \u201cdisagreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">(B) Additional Claims Surrounding the Settlement Approval</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">(1) Pending FCC and IRS proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">The objectors also contend that the district court abused its discretion in approving the terms of the settlement without considering pending FCC and IRS proceedings. The \u201cnotice of hearing,\u201d they argue, failed to address the potential losses resulting from the FCC and the IRS actions. Notice under Rule 23, however, need only be \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>See Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657,94 L.Ed. 865 (1956); <em>Mendoza v. United States, </em>623 F.2d 1338, 1350-51 .(9th Cir. 1980). Rule 23 \u201caccords a wide discretion to the District Court as to the form and content of the notice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-9\">The district court\u2019s notice was not an abuse of discretion in this case. The notice described the terms of the settlement, the reasons for the independent director\u2019s determination to seek dismissal of the suits, the legal effect of the settlement and the rights of the shareholders to voice their objections. The \u201cnotice\u201d clearly referred to the potential loss of broadcast licenses. Although it did not predict the dollar amount of the loss, the notice did conform to proper disclosure practice. <em>Kohn v. American Metal Climax, Inc., </em>458 F.2d 255, 264 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>409 U.S. 874, 93 S.Ct. 120,34 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972). The district court\u2019s approval of the notice, therefore, was within its wide discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">Furthermore, the district court quite properly rejected the .objectors\u2019 argument that a true balancing of the settlement terms must await the outcome of pending FCC and IRS proceedings. \u25a0 The Court placed itself in the position of an independent director of the corporation and determined that any delay in approval of the settlement would be counter to General Tire\u2019s business interest. The district court correctly noted that \u201cpending\u201d FCC proceedings could remain \u201cpending\u201d for \u201cmany years.\u201d The district court, exercising its independent business judgment as \u201ca representative of the interests of the Company,\u201d could not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-11\">permit such a sword of Damocles to be suspended above the directors and management of General Tire. To rule other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>wise would establish a longterm, destructive impediment to the exercise of their business judgment in the day-to-day operations of the firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-4\">While the monetary losses surrounding the FCC and IRS proceedings may be unfortunate, they counteract neither the independence of the Committee\u2019s business judgment, nor the independence of the district court\u2019s additional business judgment. The wide discretion afforded the district court was hardly abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">We find therefore that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its penetrating review of the propriety of the delegation of the board\u2019s authority, the propriety of the application of the Business Judgment Rule, the propriety of the Special Committee\u2019s members and techniques and the propriety of the terms of the settlement agreement. Moreover, the district judge astutely assessed the merits of the settlement agreement in accord with its own business judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">(2) Intervention</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Objector Schreiber finally argues that the district court erred in denying his petition to intervene. Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs a proposed intervention of right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1159-8\">\u201cUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless <em>the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">A shareholder has no greater rights in a derivative action than does an objector. Any relief obtained belongs to the corporation only; a shareholder has no individual rights to protect through litigation. Hence Schreiber\u2019s interests are not only \u201cadequately protected\u201d by the shareholders, they are identical to those of the shareholders. Intervention will be denied where, as in this case, \u201cthe applicants\u2019 interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d <em>Blanchard v. Johnson, </em>532 F.2d 1074, 1077 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>429 U.S. 834, 97 S.Ct. 100, 50 L.Ed.2d 100 (1976); <em>Afro American Patrolmen\u2019s League v. Duck, </em>503 F.2d 294, 298 (6th Cir.1974). Before the district court, objector Schreiber only questioned the fairness of the settlement. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Schreiber\u2019s petition for intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">Upon consideration of the complex issues in this case, we conclude that the district judge\u2019s findings and conclusions were not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the orders of the district court approving the settlement and denying intervention are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">.

I further agree that the Ohio application of the business judgment rule, although unclear, does not contradict the policies of \u00a7 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act under the circumstances of this case. I concur also that the district court made an adequate analysis of, and granted sufficient discovery, with respect to the independence of the outside directors in this case, although the prior association of Henkel with General Tire rendered his position doubtful at best. I agree also with Judge Jones\u2019 conclusion that denial of objector Schreiber\u2019s motion to intervene was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">I part company, however, on the question of the fairness of the settlement in this case. In the majority opinion, it is fully recognized that actions taken by RKO General, for which all the defendants may share some responsibility, and who certainly faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>very serious exposure by reason thereof, had cost the company a valuable television license. The decision in <em>RKO General v. F.C.C., </em>670 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1981), cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1119, 102 S.Ct. 2931, 73 L.Ed.2d 1331 (1982) had already virtually determined this ultimate estimated loss of $100,000,000, and \u201c[T]he district court did <em>not </em>consider the effect of that specific dollar loss in concluding that the settlement agreement was \u2018fair, reasonable and adequate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Majority opinion at 1080 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The consideration of the reasonableness of the settlement did not take fully into account alleged \u201ccover up\u201d activities after 1975 with respect to administrative investigations and the effect of additional IRS actions pending against defendant General Tire and RKO General due to irregularities, and shareholders were not alerted to this' additional potential loss, for which defendant directors may have had some responsibility. The alleged benefits to the corporation arising out of the settlement, apart from what was already recommended by the special investigative committee to avoid such future financial disasters, were negligible in my view. $500,000 would be paid by General Tire to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys; the only benefit was that two members of the RKO Board for three years would be non-officers and non-employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Even if settlement were deemed advantageous because plaintiffs \u201cwould have faced considerable difficulties had they brought this litigation to trial,\u201d <em>Pearl v. The General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>MDL No. 265, slip op. at 12 (D.Ohio, Dec. 15, 1981), the miniscule benefits to the corporations and their shareholders do not sufficiently take into account the risks that defendants faced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are satisfied because they were to receive substantial fees without objection from defendants renders the fairness of such settlement even more dubious. <em>See Jamison v.

Whether or not the settlement terminated the present and any future class action challenges,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the Miberg action it seems clear that the district court intended its order to do just that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-12\">The complaints in these actions are dismissed on the merits and with prejudice and without costs.
