Perrell, brought this action pursuant to the provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter ADEA). Suing his employer FinanceAmerica Corporation (hereinafter FinanceAmerica), Mr. Perrell alleged that he was subjected to age discrimination that resulted in an employment alternative of accepting a demotion or being discharged by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">Upon trial to a jury a verdict was returned for Mr. Perrell awarding damages for lost wages, pain and suffering, incidental expenses and liquidated damages in the total amount of $268,069.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">FinanceAmerica appeals. Although the appellant raises numerous allegations of error, only two address fundamental error given the facts of this case. First, Finan-ceAmerica claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the standard of proof to be used in determining liability under the ADEA; and second, it is claimed that the district court erred in allowing the awarding of \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d (i.e. pain and suffering) in an ADEA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-18\">I. <em>Standard of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-19\">In charging the jury on the standard of proof required of the plaintiff to prevail in an ADEA action, the trial court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-20\">\u201cWhen I say that the plaintiff must prove that he was demoted or discharged because of his age, I do not mean that the Plaintiff has to establish that his age was the only reason for his demotion or discharge. There may have been many reasons for his demotion or discharge. However, if you find that his age was one reason and that in fact his age <em>made a difference </em>in determining whether or not he was to be demoted or discharged, then you should find for the Plaintiff and determine the amount of damages, if any, Carroll- Perrell has sustained. On the other hand, if you find that his age was <em>not a reason </em>for his demotion or discharge and that -it <em>made no difference </em>in determining whether or not he was to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>demoted or discharged, then you should find for the Defendant.\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">This \u201cmade a difference\u201d language has been addressed by other courts, and some have found it to be lacking in its statement of the applicable law. In <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003 (1st Cir.1979) the court made the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s brief apparently concedes that he was required to prove that age was the determining factor, but argues that this was conveyed by instructing that age had to have \u2018made a difference.\u2019 We agree with defendants, however, that the court\u2019s statement was inadequate to convey to the jury the legal standard it should follow. To find that age was a factor that affected the decision is not equivalent to finding that age was a determinative factor, yet proof that it was a determinative factor is, as both parties recognize, essential to recovery under the ADEA. (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">We do not quarrel with the court\u2019s statement that age did not have to be the sole factor motivating defendants to act; we do think, however, that the court should have instructed the jury that for plaintiff to prevail he had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his age was the \u2018determining factor\u2019 in his discharge in the sense that, \u2018but for\u2019 his employer\u2019s motive to discriminate against him because of age, he would not have been discharged.\u201d (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">600 F.2d at 1019.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also Golomb v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>688 F.2d 547 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">However, other courts have found the \u201cmade a difference\u201d formulation to constitute a satisfactory explanation of the applicable law. <em>See Kelly v. American Standard, Inc., </em>640 F.2d 974, 984 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Laugesen v. Anaconda Co., </em>510 F.2d 307, 317 (6th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Upon examination of the language, we would generally agree with the court in <em>Bentley v. Stromberg-Carlson Corp., </em>638 F.2d 9, 11 (2nd Cir.1981) that we see \u201cno significant difference between the ... [made a difference] formulation and the \u2018determining factor\u2019 charge enunciated in <em>Loeb </em>.... \u201d As we have stated before, no particular form of words is essential if the instruction as a whole conveys the correct statement of the applicable law. <em>Brandt v. French, </em>638 F.2d 209 (10th Cir.1981). While the <em>Loeb </em>formulation is to be strongly preferred due to its lack of ambiguity, the \u201cmade a difference\u201d formulation is not inherently infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">The essence of the correct formulation of the standard of proof is that it requires the jury to focus on the effect of the factor of age. The jury must understand that it is not enough that age discrimination figure in the decision to demote or discharge; age must \u201cmake a difference\u201d between termination and retention of the employee in the sense that, \u201cbut for\u201d the factor of age discrimination, the employee would not have been adversely affected. <em>Cancellier v. Federated Dept. Stores, </em>672 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">However, the instruction used in this case did not clearly articulate the essence of the law. To find for the defendant-employer under the instruction given in this case, the jury was required to determine that age was not a reason <em>and </em>that it made no difference. This formulation was more than ambiguous in that a jury member might infer that if age were <em>any </em>factor the defendant could not prevail. This, as noted above, is erroneous and could communicate the particular impression that must be specifically dispelled when charging the jury as to the ADEA standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">The standard of proof formulation is key to the understanding of liability under the ADEA. Thus, the erroneous instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>given in this case relates to the substantial rights of the defendant below. This error requires reversal unless this court can determine that the error was not prejudicial. <em>McCandless v. United States, </em>298 U.S. 342, 56 S.Ct. 764, 80 L.Ed. 1205 (1936); <em>see also Fillippon </em>v. <em>Albion View State Co., </em>250 U.S. 76, 39 S.Ct. 435, 63 L.Ed. 853 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In the trial below, the employer Finan-ceAmerica offered extensive evidence, if believed by the jury, that age was not the determining factor in the employment decisions relating to Mr. Perrell. The evidence is not so overwhelmingly weighted in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of age discrimination that this court can conclusively determine that the effect of the erroneous instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">\n<em>II. Compensatory Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The second allegation of the appellant which constitutes fundamental error concerns the instructions given regarding \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d In charging the jury on the proper method of calculating damages, the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cIn addition, plaintiff may recover damages to compensate him for losses, other than lost employment benefits, caused by the alleged discrimination. Such damages are called compensatory damages. The items of compensatory damages claimed by plaintiff are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(1) incidental expenses caused by the curtailment of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">(2) damages for pain and suffering and humiliation which resulted from plaintiff\u2019s termination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">While this definition of \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d might well be challenged, the error claimed by the defendant regarding this charge is the allowance of elements of damage other than those specifically set out in the ADEA. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b), (c). To date, eight of our sister circuits have been presented this issue in varying nuances. However, every time the issue of permissible scope of damages has been addressed, each circuit court has held that the ADEA is limited to the damages specifically enumerated. <em>See Hill v. Spiegel, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 233 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Pfeiffer v. Essex Wire Corp., </em>682 F.2d 684 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Fiedler v. Indianhead Truck Line, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 806 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Naton v. Bank of California, </em>649 F.2d 691 (9th Cir.1981); Sla<em>tin v. Stanford Research Inst., </em>590 F.2d 1292 (4th Cir.1979); <em>Vazquez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., </em>579 F.2d 107 (1st Cir.1978); <em>Dean v. American Security Ins. Co., </em>559 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1977); <em>Rogers v. Exxon Research and Engineering Co., </em>550 F.2d 834 (3rd Cir.1977). We find the collective reasoning as set forth in these opinions exhaustive and persuasive. We can but conclude that the trial court erred in allowing jury consideration of any items of damage except those specifically provided within the enforcement scheme of the.ADEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">Therefore, considering the instructional errors committed by the trial court, the judgment must accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\">. We have previously articulated our approval of the <em>Loeb </em>decision although we did not address this specific issue. In <em>Mistretta v. Sandia Corp., </em>639 F.2d 588, 597 (10th Cir.1980) we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-14\">\u201cThe <em>Loeb </em>decision is overall well reasoned and we do not disagree with its reasoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
