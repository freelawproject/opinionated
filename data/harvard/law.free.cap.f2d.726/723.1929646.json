Department of the Army, </em>715 F.2d 1485 (Fed.Cir.1983). Respondent\u2019s position appears correct. However, this court will retain jurisdiction if an express written statement is made by counsel that the issue of racial discrimination has not been and will not be pursued by a suit in a U.S. District Court and has been abandoned. If the issue of racial discrimination is not abandoned, the case may be transferred to a U.S. District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Petitioners file with the court within 15 days of the date hereof either (1) a request for this court to proceed which must be accompanied by the required statement, or (2) a request for transfer to a particular U.S. District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">In the absence of a timely response, the appeal is subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
