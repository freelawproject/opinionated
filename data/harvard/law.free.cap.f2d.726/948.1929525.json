Appellant further maintains that life insurance premium payments made by Sperling were constructively received by his former wife and constitute alimony based on an economic benefit theory, even though his former wife did not own the policies and she and her children were not absolute beneficiaries thereof. The Commissioner disagreed and determined deficiencies in appellants\u2019 federal income taxes of $19,973.32<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the tax years 1974-76. The tax court found for the Commissioner; 45 T.C.M. (CCH) 193 (1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">When Herbert and Phyllis Sperling\u2019s marital problems became insoluble they retained attorneys to negotiate the terms of a separation and divorce agreement. In open court on March 20,1967 they announced an agreement (separation stipulation) which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-8\">1. The wife shall have full custody and control of the three infant issue ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-9\">9. The husband agrees to pay to the wife as <em>alimony </em>for her support and for the support, maintenance and <em>education </em>of the children, <em>except as hereinafter set forth, </em>the sum of $33,500 per annum, payable $644.23 per week ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-12\">10. <em>In addition to the foregoing payment </em>the ... husband is to pay for the following items:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-13\">(c) tuition, laboratory fees, books and residence fees for each child for four years at college, on condition that the college be selected jointly by the child and by the husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">12. ... The husband shall pay the premiums necessary to keep [several enumerated whole life insurance policies on the life of the husband] in full force and effect, and shall not borrow against the cash value of any of them except against the cash value of Policy No. 43359 in order to have the proceeds of the loan applied against the premium of the said policy. So long as the wife remains unmarried and any of the children is under the age of twenty-one years or has not completed his education, the wife shall be the beneficiary of the skid policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">If the wife should remarry, the children, or such of them as shall be under the age of twenty-one years or shallnot [sic] have completed their education, shall be the beneficiaries, in equal shares, of the said policies. If the wife should remarry and if all of the children shall be over the age of twenty-one years and shall have completed their education, the said policies shall be transferred and delivered to the husband who shall thereafter have complete control thereover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-17\">In order to assure the parties hereto that the provisions of this paragraph are carried out, ownership of said policies shall be transferred to David Coral and Milton Kail, who shall hold such policies as trustees in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"AMm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Exhibit 13-M (emphasis added). This stipulation was incorporated into a judgment of separation (separation judgment) dated March 30, 1967. It provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-4\">[T]hat the [wife] is entitled to the general custody of the three children ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\">... that the [husband] pay to the [wife], during the life of the [wife], or until the further order of this court, the sum of $644.23 per week ... for the support and maintenance of the [wife] and the support, maintenance and education of the infant children of the parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-6\">... that the [husband] shall maintain each of his children who qualifies for entrance at a college to be selected jointly by the [husband] and the child who is to attend such college for a period of four years.

[and] shall pay the premiums necessary to keep these policies in full force and effect, and shall not borrow against the cash value of any of them except against the cash value of Policy No. 43359, in order to have the proceeds of the loan applied against the premium of the said policy. So long as the [wife] remains unmarried and any of the children is under the age of twenty-one years, or has not completed his or her education, the [wife] shall be the beneficiary of the said policies. If the [wife] should remarry, the children, or such of them as shall be under the age of twenty-one years, or shall not have completed their education, shall be the beneficiaries, in equal shares, of the said policies. If the [wife] should remarry and if all of the children shall be over the age of twenty-one years and shall have completed their education, the said policies shall be transferred and delivered to the [husband] who shall thereafter have complete control thereover, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-9\">Ordered and Adjudged, that for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this decretal paragraph, ownership of said policies shall be transferred to David Coral, Esq. and Milton Kail, Esq., who shall hold such policies as trustees, in accordance with the terms hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Exhibit 4 \u2014 D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Sperling and Phyllis were divorced in Mexico on August 30, 1967. Phyllis remarried on June 6, 1975. On July 28, 1975 Phyllis was removed as the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and was replaced by the three Sperling children as co-beneficiaries. Ownership of the policies was transferred to Sperling on September 30, 1981 after all three of the children reached the age of 21 and completed their educations. He subsequently cashed in the policies and received the cash surrender value of $19,008.73 as proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">The present controversy centers on the following alimony deductions taken by Sperling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-13\">\n<em>Year and Nature Amount</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAWM\">\n<em>1974</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-15\">Tuition and Expenses (Robin) .....$ 5,190.33</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-16\">Life Insurance Premiums ......... 3,384.43</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-17\">\n<em>1975</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-18\">Tuition and Expenses (Robin and Cindy) .............14,582.41</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-20\">Life Insurance Premiums ......... 4,734.37</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-21\">\n<em>1976</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-22\">Tuition and Expenses (Robin and Cindy) .............12,965.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-24\">Life Insurance Premiums ......... 3,433.10</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-25\">Tuition payments were made directly to Northwestern University. The premiums paid were for the policies held in trust under the separation stipulation and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">I. <em>College Expenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 215(a) (1976)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> permits a husband <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to deduct from his gross income payments made to his former wife which are includable in her gross income as alimony pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(a) (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A husband is not entitled to deduct from his gross income child support payments as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 71(b) (1976)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the wife is not required to include such payments in her gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Section 71(b) dictates that the college expense payments were child support. They were made under the express provisions of the separation stipulation and judgment,' which required Sperling to pay for his children\u2019s college tuition and expenses. Such payments were made \u201cfor and in behalf of the children,\u201d <em>Mandel v. Commissioner, </em>229 F.2d 382, 388 (7th Cir.1956), and thus do not constitute alimony. <em>See Em-mons v. Commissioner, </em>36 T.C. 728, 738 (1961), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>311 F.2d 223 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Sperling relies on <em>Commissioner v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961), for the argument that section 71(b) does not control because the parties did not \u201cspecifically designate\u201d or \u201cfix\u201d a sum certain to be paid on behalf of the children. In <em>Lester </em>the Supreme Court stated that where alimony payments are made \u201c[t]he agreement must <em>expressly specify or \u2018fix\u2019 a sum certain or percentage </em>of the payment for child support before any of the payment is excluded from the wife\u2019s income.\u201d 366 U.S. at 303, 81 S.Ct. at 1346 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">There, the husband agreed to supply a periodic, fixed payment which would be reduced by a percentage upon the death, marriage or emancipation of minor children. The Court, interpreting the predecessor to section 71(b), specified the strict rule quoted above. Here, however, the issue is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>whether a portion of a static payment should be deemed child support. The judgment of separation provides for fixed periodic payments \u201cfor the support and maintenance of the [wife] and the support, maintenance and education of the infant children\u201d and <em>additionally and separately </em>requires Sperling to pay for his children\u2019s college expenses. The dispute centers around <em>not </em>the general payment for the support and maintenance of wife and children (and education of children) but the nature of the college expense payments. The tax court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\">Resort to the rule of <em>Lester </em>... is not necessary when an amount is payable in its entirety (or 100 percent) on behalf of the child, and totally bypasses any right of participation or control by the nonpaying parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">45 T.C.M. (CCH) at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">The rationale of <em>Lester </em>is that the wife must declare income where she in her discretion may use the money she receives. Such is not the case here. The payments in question here were made directly to Northwestern University.- Even if they had been made to the former wife, she would not have had indiscriminate use of the money. <em>Cf. Helvering v. Horst, </em>311 U.S. 112,118, 61 S. Ct. 144, 147, 85 L.Ed. 75 (1940) (\u201cThe power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it.\u201d); <em>Corliss v. Bowers, </em>281 U.S. 376, 378, 50 S.Ct. 336, 74 L.Ed. 916 (1930) (\u201cThe income that is subject to a man\u2019s unfettered command and that he is free to enjoy at his own option may be taxed to him as his income, whether he sees fit to enjoy it or not.\u201d). She would have been required to turn the money over to the University and would have acted as a \u201cmere conduit\u201d for the transfer of the funds. <em>Christiansen v. Commissioner, </em>60 T.C. 456, 461 (1973); <em>Emmons, </em>36 T.C. at 738. Therefore, because the tuition and expense money was to be used for the exclusive benefit and support of the children, the fact that a precise sum or percentage was not specified in the agreement is not crucial. As noted in <em>Abramo v. Commissioner, </em>78 T. C. 154, 161 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-9\">When the Supreme Court stated [in <em>Les</em>ter] \u201ca sum certain or percentage of the payment\u201d made to the wife sufficiently fixes the amount excludable from the wife\u2019s income as child support, it meant that the total payment which the husband must make is to be allocated precisely between wife and children, not that the total payment be numerically fixed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">Similarly, Sperling\u2019s reliance on <em>Van Oss v. Commissioner, </em>25 T.C.M. (CCH) 403 (1966), <em>aff\u2019d, 311 </em>F.2d 812 (2d Cir.1967), is misplaced. In <em>Van Oss, </em>the separation agreement provided that the husband would reimburse his former wife for tuition costs in excess of $1,000 per child per year. Since she had three children, the wife argued that $3,000 of the total fixed annual payment of $24,000 made by the husband to her constituted child support. The tax court rejected this contention since the wife had complete and unfettered control of the money received from her former husband and was not obligated to spend the money on behalf of her children. As such, the wife was not a conduit for the payments. 25 T.C.M. (CCH) at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">This case factually is closer to <em>Marshall v. Commissioner, </em>35 T.C.M. (CCH) 138 (1976), than to either <em>Lester or Van Oss. </em>In <em>Marshall, </em>the order of support required the husband to pay a fixed sum for the support of the wife and children and required him \u201cto pay in addition ... all college expenses.\u201d 35 T.C.M. (CCH) at 139. The court held that the husband\u2019s obligation to pay the college expenses of his children above and beyond the fixed payment was \u201csufficiently designated as child support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141. In so doing, the court considered and distinguished both <em>Lester </em>and <em>Van Oss, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-13\">Both <em>Lester ... </em>and <em>Van Oss ... </em>focus on a wife\u2019s receipt of an aggregate sum which she was free to apply to whatever purposes she so chose. In other words, mere contractual or judicial suggestion that a portion of a payment should be applied to the children\u2019s benefit does not detract from the wife\u2019s freedom to spend it as she sees fit. This freedom does not inhere in payments to cover expenses incurred on behalf of the ... children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Sperling contends that an affirmance here will \u201cerode the <em>Lester </em>Court\u2019s rejection of any loose standard that can only lend itself to numerous inconsistent court determinations in similar factual patterns.\u201d <em>Lester </em>is not implicated in this decision and it applies, as ever, in situations where a general payment is made between spouses. The instant decision applies to cases where a separate payment is called for by the parties\u2019 agreement or by court order and is earmarked for specific, support-related purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">Sperling also contends that the college expense payments constitute alimony because they conferred an economic benefit on Phyllis by relieving her of her share of the legal obligation to provide a college education for her children. The point is meritless. It is not clear whether New York law at the time of the Sperlings\u2019 separation and divorce required parents to pay for the college education of their children. However, whether or not this obligation existed is irrelevant to the resolution of this issue. On the one hand, if New York law did not give rise to such a duty on Phyllis\u2019 part, then it cannot be said that Sperling\u2019s payments relieved her of a legal obligation. On the other hand, even if Phyllis were required to provide for her children\u2019s college education, section 71(b) precludes Sperling\u2019s payments in satisfaction of this obligation from being included in Phyllis\u2019 gross income. Payments by the husband to the custodial wife to relieve her of her obligation to support her children generally confer an economic benefit on the wife since they obviate the need for her to expend a like amount. However, the purpose of section 71(b) is to <em>exclude </em>these otherwise includable payments from the custodial wife\u2019s income. Therefore, it makes no difference whether Phyllis received an economic benefit from Sperling\u2019s tuition payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Sperling also argues that the tax court improperly excluded evidence offered by him to show that Phyllis affirmatively assumed the obligation of sending her children to college, thus rendering his payments thereto a form of economic benefit to her. The court excluded this evidence on the basis of the \u201crule\u201d in <em>Lester, </em>as interpreted, that extrinsic evidence will not be permitted to alter the language of a divorce decree or separation agreement specifying payments as alimony or child support where the decree or agreement specifically and unambiguously fixes the character of the payments. <em>See Estate of Craft v. Commissioner, </em>68 T.C. 249, 263-64 (1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>608 F.2d 240 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>Gior-dano v. Commissioner, </em>63 T.C. 462, 465-67 .(1975); <em>Grummer v. Commissioner, </em>46 T.C. 674, 678-80 (1966). The rule is grounded on the statutory interpretation in <em>Lester </em>that the instrument or decree itself must express a clear intent to designate payments or portions thereof as child support. Sperling seeks to evade the rule by arguing that the evidence was offered not to establish the intent of the parties .to designate the payments as child support but rather to show that Phyllis received an economic benefit as a result of these payments, <em>i.e., </em>that Phyllis acknowledged her responsibility to educate her children and sought payments from Sperling in order to satisfy this obligation. Because economic benefit analysis is inappropriate to the proper characterization of the payments in question any evidence that Phyllis acknowledged her obligation to provide her children with a college education is irrelevant.'</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Furthermore, the language in the separation stipulation and judgment of separation is clear and unambiguous. The separation stipulation states in section 9 that \u201chusband agrees to pay to the wife <em>as alimony </em>for her support and for the support, maintenance and <em>education </em>of the children, <em>except as hereinafter set forth, </em>the sum of ... $644.23 per week.\u201d (emphasis added). The agreement then adds that <em>\u201c[i]n addition to the foregoing payment </em>the ... husband is to pay for the following items ... tuition, laboratory fees, books and residence fees for each child for four years at college.\u201d (emphasis added). The judgment of separation also calls for payment of college expenses by Sperling separately from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>general obligation to pay a weekly lump sum for the support and maintenance of Phyllis and the support, maintenance and education of the children. This language specifically excludes college expenses from the general payment of alimony. We believe that both the stipulation and the judgment specifically and unambiguously fix the character of the college expense payments. Extrinsic evidence, therefore, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">II. <em>Life Insurance Premiums</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The separation stipulation and judgment provided that Phyllis would transfer in trust to two attorneys several life insurance policies on the life of Sperling which she owned. Sperling agreed to pay the premiums on these policies and was prohibited from borrowing against the cash value' of all of the policies except one. The stipulation and judgment provided that Phyllis would remain the beneficiary as long as she remained unmarried and any of the children remained under 21 years of age or had not completed their educations; if she did remarry, those children under 21 or those who had not completed their educations would become the beneficiaries in equal parts. Finally, the stipulation and judgment called for complete ownership to vest in Sperling if Phyllis remarried and all of the children attained the age of 21 and completed their educations. With the exception of the .limited borrowing privilege noted above, neither Sperling nor Phyllis had any right to control the policies while they remained in trust. Phyllis remarried in June 1975 and was replaced as beneficiary of the policies by the children as co-beneficiaries on July 28, 1975.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sperling became the owner of the policies on September 30, 1981 when all of the children reached the age of 21 and completed their educations and when Sperling\u2019s alimony obligations terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">Sperling\u2019s claim that he was entitled to deductions for premiums paid on the policies was rejected by the tax court on the basis of <em>Stevens v. Commissioner, </em>439 F.2d 69 (2d Cir.1971). He maintains that the tax court\u2019s reliance on <em>Stevens </em>was misplaced and that <em>Stevens </em>actually supports his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\"><em>Stevens </em>held that in order for premium payments on a straight life policy to be income to the wife (and therefore deductible from gross income by the husband) there must be (a) absolute ownership of the policy by the wife; and (b) an irrevocable designation of the wife as beneficiary. <em>Stevens, </em>439 F.2d at 71-72. <em>See Piel v. Commissioner, </em>340 F.2d 887, 890 (2d Cir.1965) (\u201cownership of the policies is necessary to support a deduction\u201d); <em>Hyde v. Commissioner, </em>301 F.2d 279 (2d Cir.1962); <em>Weil v. Commissioner, </em>240 F.2d 584 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>353 U.S. 958, 77 S.Ct. 864,1 L.Ed.2d 909 (1957). <em>See also </em>Rev.Rul. 70-218, 1970-1 C.B. 19; J. Chommie, Federal Income Taxation 492 (2d ed. 1973) (\u201cit is now settled that the statute does not embrace premiums paid on life insurance policies unless the policy is assigned to the wife and she is the irrevocable beneficiary\u201d). This latter condition is fulfilled where the wife\u2019s interest in the policy terminates if she predeceases the husband and the children are designated as irrevocable contingent beneficiaries. <em>Stevens, </em>439 F.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Constructive receipt by the wife of the premium payments, the theory on which such payments by the husband are included in the wife\u2019s gross income, demands exacting standards. <em>Id. </em>at 71. Any lesser guideposts would require the wife to include her former husband\u2019s premium payments on her behalf in her gross income even though she is not the \u201cowner\u201d of the insurance policy in the traditional sense. The policy in this area is to preclude alimony income to the wife where the benefit conferred upon her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>is insubstantial. Conversely, the husband should be allowed an alimony deduction for premiums paid where he retains no interest in the policy and the wife receives substantial benefits from the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Neither prong of the two-point test enumerated in <em>Stevens </em>was satisfied here. First, Phyllis was not the absolute owner of the policies. Rather, the policies were transferred by her to the trustees pursuant to the separation stipulation and judgment. Sperling eventually became the owner of the policies. Phyllis enjoyed none of the normal rights associated with ownership of a whole life policy, such as the power to change the beneficiary, to borrow against the policy or to surrender it for cash. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Second, there was no irrevocable designation of Phyllis as beneficiary and the children as contingent beneficiaries. The separation stipulation and judgment provided that Sperling would become the owner of the policies if Phyllis remarried and after the children turned 21 and completed their educations. This actually occurred. Furthermore, <em>Stevens </em>indicated that for section 71(a) to be applicable, the wife\u2019s coverage as beneficiary under the policy must be co-extensive with the period that she is to receive alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 72-73. This was not the case here. According to the separation stipulation and judgment, alimony payments were to continue until Phyllis remarried and the children turned 21 or became self-sufficient. Phyllis remarried in 1975 but continued to receive reduced alimony payments because the children had neither completed their educations nor turned 21. Nonetheless, Phyllis was removed as the beneficiary in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Sperling asserts that he conferred an economic benefit on Phyllis in that the premium payments helped guarantee that Phyllis would receive the alimony due her if he died before his obligations to her ended. In other words, he maintains that the policies should be considered term insurance on his obligations. He argues that this security constituted an economic benefit to Phyllis. We note that some courts have found such benefits to be <em>de minimis </em>and have refused to find constructive receipt by the wife of the premium payments for term insurance. <em>See Wright v.

Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 31A.05, at 52 (1975) (\u201cWhere an insurance policy is merely security for alimony payments to the wife no deduction is allowable to the husband for premium payments made by him.\u201d); A. Parker, Stanley &amp; Kilcullen\u2019s Federal Income Tax Law \u00a7 71, at 34 (6th ed. 1974) (\u201cif the policy constitutes, essentially, security for the husband\u2019s obligation and [the wife] is only the contingent beneficiary, ... then premiums are not alimony to her and, therefore, not deductible to the husband\u201d). In <em>Stevens, </em>we indicated that term insurance premiums could be deducted where there were no contingencies \u201cwhich might operate to thwart the wife\u2019s receipt of the economic benefit the premium payments conferred, that is, the protection, during a limited term, of the wife\u2019s right to receive alimony over the full alimony period.\u201d 439 F.2d at 72-73. <em>But see Baker v. Commissioner, </em>205 F.2d 369, 370 (2d Cir.1953) (premiums paid on life insurance policy which was security for alimony payments conferred too remote an interest to the wife and were not constructively received by her). Utilizing this standard, it is clear that this criterion was not met. Phyllis continued to receive alimony payments, albeit reduced, after she remarried. However, she was replaced as the beneficiary of the policies' shortly after her remarriage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The duration of the term policy thus was not co-extensive with the alimony obligation. <em>Stevens </em>precludes deductibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>by the husband where such contingencies exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Finally, Sperling\u2019s argument that he conferred an economic benefit on Phyllis because he made premium payments which she otherwise would have made to keep the policies in force is meritless.

With respect to the college expenses, I concur in the result. The language of the separation stipulation makes it plain that the college expenses were to be \u201cin addition to\u201d the $33,500 annual payments for alimony and child support, all of which, because of failure to meet the test of \u00a7 71(b) as construed in <em>C.I.R. v. Lester, </em>366 U.S. 299, 81 S.Ct. 1343, 6 L.Ed.2d 306 (1961), with respect to child support, payments, were includible in the wife\u2019s income under \u00a7 71(a). It would run counter to the clear intention of the parties to rule that the college expenses were likewise so includible. Since they are thus not includible in the wife\u2019s income, \u00a7 215(a) prohibits their deduction by the husband. Beyond this, if the college expenses were child support payments, they would meet the <em>Lester </em>test and would not be includible in the wife\u2019s income on that account and thus again not deductible by the husband. I would say no more.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
