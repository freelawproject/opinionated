Hillsborough Transit Authority, </em>726 F.2d 664 (11th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While he does not seek reconsideration of the panel opinion, we treat his petition as such in accordance with Eleventh Circuit Rule 26(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule V.C.b. (1) of our Internal Operating Procedures also confers on the panel continuing control of the case although the petition seeks en banc consideration only.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-26\">In his petition Lewis argues for the first time that our prior opinion conflicts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). In <em>Patsy, </em>the Supreme Court held that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to a suit brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Lewis claimed the Hillsborough Transit Authority violated his constitutional right to due process when it concluded he had resigned without notice without first furnishing him a hearing. The collective bargaining agreement between the City of Tampa and the Amalgamated Transit Union, and arguably the Florida Civil Service regulations, provided Lewis with procedural remedies which he failed to pursue. Our opinion, however, did not require Lewis to exhaust these administrative remedies, but instead held that they afforded him all the due process necessary under the fourteenth amendment. The claim was rejected on the merits for failure to state a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The Supreme Court, in a line of procedural due process cases, looked to the available state remedies to determine whether they provided sufficient due process to satisfy the Constitution. <em>See e.g., Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527,101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). These cases involved whether there was a constitutional violation, not whether there was exhaustion. Instead of dismissing for failure to exhaust, the Court held against the claimant on the merits because the available, yet unused, state remedies comported with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In <em>Lewis, </em>the district court held that the available remedies complied with due process requirements. \u201cDue process was at Plaintiff\u2019s disposal; any deprivation of that due process clearly resulted from Plaintiff\u2019s own inaction.\u201d Opinion at 5. The district court then found that Lewis had failed to show a denial of due process under the fourteenth amendment. The panel opinion agreed that Lewis had been afforded sufficient due process. <em>Lewis </em>thereby fits under the <em>Parratt </em>line of cases instead of <em>Patsy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8KD\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit addressed the relationship between <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Patsy </em>in <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>720 F.2d 792 (4th Cir.1983). The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMP\">Exhaustion of state judicial or administrative remedies is not a prerequisite to section 1983 actions, <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183 [81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492] (1961), except for those cases falling under the narrow exhaustion scheme embodied in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997. <em>See Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557 [73 L.Ed.2d 172] (1982). <em>Parratt </em>does not change this rule. An exhaustion requirement would merely require a plaintiff to exhaust his state remedies before bringing a section 1983 action in federal court. <em>Parratt, </em>by contrast, stands for the proposition that a plaintiff may sue only in state court if he fails to state a procedural due process claim under section 1983. Unlike an exhaustion requirement, which is based upon principles of comity, the <em>Parratt </em>analysis is based upon the concept that there is no constitutional violation if a plaintiff has not been deprived of a protected interest without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 794, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Lewis does not contend that the procedures available to him were inadequate or unconstitutional. They provided him with an . effective opportunity to rebut the charges. As such, Lewis\u2019 case was not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for failure to exhaust. He lost on the merits for lack of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Lewis emphasizes one sentence in the panel opinion. \u201cTo accept Lewis\u2019 argument would permit every employee to ignore the elaborate grievance mechanism provided in the agreement and to sue in federal court.\u201d At 667. This statement does not mean, as Lewis maintains, that we required exhaustion. This is not an exhaustion case. We considered the available remedies only to the extent necessary to determine if they satisfied the due process requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the fourteenth amendment. Exhaustion did not enter into the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Lewis raises another argument based on <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1189 (1938). We find this contention also without merit. It is illogical to assert that a choice of remedies, albeit exclusive of one another, furnishes less, rather than more, procedural safeguards than one remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">For the foregoing reasons, a rehearing of the panel opinion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-14\">.

This panel may, on its own, grant rehearing and may do so without action by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-28\">11th Cir. Internal Operating Procedures R.
