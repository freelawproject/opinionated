On December 4, 1972, following hearings, the referee entered a decree of nondischargeability. On December 15 the bankrupt\u2019s petition for review of the referee\u2019s decree was filed in the district court. The petition was dated December 13, and was placed in the mail on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-17\">Appellee moved to dismiss the petition for review on the ground of untimeliness. The district court, applying \u00a7 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67(c), granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-18\">Section 39(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67(c), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-19\">\u201c(c) A person aggrieved by an order of a referee may, within ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time as the court <em>upon petition filed within such ten-day period </em>may for cause shown allow, file with the referee a petition for review of such order by a judge * * *. * * * <em>Unless the person aggrieved shall petition for review of such order within such ten-day period, or any extension thereof, the order of the referee shall become fined.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-20\">The portion in italics was added by amendment in 1960. Act of July 14, 1960, Pub.L.No.86-662, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 74 Stat. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-21\"> It is not disputed that the petition for review in this case was filed eleven days after entry of the referee\u2019s order, as time is computed in applying this section. In terms of the statute, then, the petition was untimely and the referee\u2019s order became final. Nevertheless, it is appellant\u2019s position that the district court \u201chad jurisdiction and discretion to consider the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-22\">Appellant relies mainly on Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., 317 U. S. 144, 153, 63 S.Ct. 133, 87 L.Ed. 146 (1942), and cases following, especially England v. Stanley, 284 F.2d 700, 703 (9th Cir. 1960). However, the purpose of the 1960 amendments to \u00a7 39(c), <em>supra, </em>as shown by the legislative history, was to overrule <em>Pfister </em>and thus to lend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>certainty as to finality of referees\u2019 orders. <em>See, e. g., </em>S.Rep.No.1689, 86th Cong., 2d Sess.; 1960 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, vol. 2, at 3194-3195. <em>See also </em>St. Regis Paper Co. v. Jackson, 369 F.2d 136, 137-138 (5th Cir. 1966) ; 2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 39.20 [3], [4.1] (1974). To the same effect are In re Charmar Investment Co., 475 F.2d 560, 563-564 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 823, 94 S.Ct. 123, 38 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973); Goff v. Pfau, 418 F.2d 649 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 931, 90 S.Ct. 1830, 26 L.Ed.2d 97 (1970) ; In re Imperial \u201c400\u201d National, Inc., 391 F.2d 163, 168-169 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
