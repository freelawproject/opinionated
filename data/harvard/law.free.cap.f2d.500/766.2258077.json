The grievance involved appellant\u2019s allegation that Dayton had violated the terms of a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d between Dayton and local construction unions. This matter is before us on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>quent entry of an order of dismissal under Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Dayton is one of three public utilities which own the J. M. Stuart Electric Generating Station on the Ohio River. Pursuant to agreements among the owners, Dayton has acted for the other two companies in connection with the construction of Stuart Station. The owners further delegated their authority by appointing the Maxon Construction Company as their agent and construction manager on the project. Maxon, in its capacity as agent, executed a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d with the South Central Ohio Building and Construction Trades Council, of which appellant union is a constituent member. The agreement, which covers all construction work at the project site, provides that in return for certain pay rate concessions the building trade unions will not strike. Dispute settlement is governed by the final clause of the agreement which in pertinent part.reads as follows: \u201cIt is agreed that any grievance between local union(s) and contractor(s) shall be settled in accordance with the grievance machinery provided in the craft agreement (s) or, if none is so provided, by arbitration.\u201d It was Dayton\u2019s refusal to process a grievance filed thereunder that led to the filing of this action. On appeal, appellant urges this Court to reverse the decision of the district court and to order that appellant\u2019s grievance be submitted immediately to binding arbitration. For the reasons appearing hereinafter, we decline to so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The sole issue here presented is whether or not the Memorandum obligated Dayton to arbitrate <em>any </em>dispute with the South Central Ohio Building and Construction Trades Council or any of its members. Of course, \u201c[n]o obligation to arbitrate a labor dispute arises solely by operation of law. The law compels a party to submit his grievance to arbitration only if he has contracted to do so.\u201d Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U.S. 368, 94 S.Ct. 629, 635, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (1974). The question of whether a party has contracted to arbitrate is a matter for the courts to decide on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties. Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462 (1962). In the instant case, although clearly a party to the Memorandum, Dayton was a party to it as an owner, not as a contractor. Dayton employed no craft union members at Stuart Station or otherwise and it had no labor-management contract with the appellant. As the district court pointed out, the dispute involved herein is \u201cbetween Dayton and a labor union \u2014 between the owner and the union, as distinguished between [sic] the contractor and a union.\u201d The arbitration clause does not constitute an agreement between the owner and the building trade unions working at Stuart Station to arbitrate disputes arising between these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">It thus appearing that the unambiguous language of the \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d militates against the position asserted by appellant, we hold that the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint was correctly entered, and the judgment in favor of Dayton is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
