App. \u00a7 1202(a) (1). In his previous trial the jury failed to agree, resulting in a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-29\">Fields contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish the elements of commerce and possession required by the statute. The proof was to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>that the shotgun was manufactured in Spain, shipped to a dealer in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and was sold to a company in Lexington, Kentucky. The shotgun was purchased by one, Mitchell, who loaned it to his son. The shotgun was stolen from the son, and it turned up in the possession of Fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Fields was observed by a state police officer, holding the shotgun in his hands while riding as a passenger in an automobile, and he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In our opinion there was sufficient evidence that the weapon had traveled in commerce, and affected commerce. United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971); United States v. Day, 476 F.2d 562 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The District Court did not err in refusing to strike from the indictment language which described the nature of the felonies of which Fields had been previously convicted, nor in admitting evidence relative thereto. At his previous trial Fields had stipulated his felony convictions, but made no offer so to stipulate in his second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We find no error in the appointment of counsel by the Court to represent Fields when he had no funds to employ counsel of his own choosing. In our opinion Fields\u2019 claim that he was not adequately represented is not supported by the evidence. Beasley v. United States, 491 F.2d 687 (6th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b134-9\">McCREE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ag-dedup-0\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">I respectfully dissent from that part of the court\u2019s opinion that upholds the district court\u2019s refusal to strike from the indictment language describing appellant\u2019s previous felony convictions, apparently because a formal stipulation concerning the existence of these convictions was not offered. Although no such offer was made by defense counsel, whose appointment appellant opposed because he had requested a continuance to permit his retained counsel to conduct the trial, the record makes clear that Fields objected to submitting to the jury a description of his previous convictions. He unmistakenly endeavored to have the existence of his convictions stipulated as they had been in the earlier trial of the case before another judge where the jury was unable to agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">THE DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">May I approach the Bench, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">Well, only with your attorney and with the United States Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-16\">All right, come up, Gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-17\">(Reporter\u2019s note: The following proceedings were had at the Bench and out of the hearing of the prospective jury).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-18\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-19\">Let the record show the defendant is present at the Bench with his attorney, and the United States Attorney is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-20\">THE DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-21\">I had a discussion about this when I had another lawyer the last time when we had a hung jury, and I had every intention of appealing, and they never brought that out in court. If it had been appealed I have reason to think I won\u2019t be convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-22\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-23\">I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-24\">MR. MURPHY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-25\">The last time this case was tried Judge Rosenstein tried it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-26\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-27\">Did he put these marks on the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-28\">MR. MURPHY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-29\">Evidently he did. The jury was never allowed to have the indictment read to them and never allowed to see it. The Judge made defense counsel and the United States Attorney agree that the defendant had been convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of a felony. That\u2019s as far as it went. The United States was never allowed to put in what the felony was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">That\u2019s what Judge Rosenstein did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">MR. MURPHY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">Well, if he had been convicted of some of the counts - say, even though he had been convicted and it was on appeal, it would still be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">MR. SILER:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">That\u2019s the Lisle case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">MR. MURPHY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">His reasoning on that also by telling the jury of the offense here would be prejudicial to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">Well, I have taken the contrary view, because you have to introduce the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">Well, you will have to discuss that with your attorney, Mr. Fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">THE DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">Well, I would like to object to my attorney. I hadn\u2019t seen him until I got here a while ago. I had two attorneys hired for this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-21\">Who are they ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-22\">THE DEFENDANT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-23\">I had Reaves and he didn\u2019t show up the other day, and I had Hughes and you wouldn\u2019t give him time to prepare the ease. He wanted you to give him 4 days, and you give this fellow 18 days, and I haven\u2019t seen him any more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-24\">Fields\u2019 attempt to keep the details of his previous felony convictions from the jury preserves for our review the propriety of the district court\u2019s ruling. I would hold, in the exercise of our supervisory powers, that disclosure of information about prior convictions is so unnecessarily prejudicial that it should not be permitted if a defendant is willing to stipulate to their existence. <em>Cf. </em>Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967). In <em>Spencer, </em>where a state procedure for an habitual criminal prosecution was challenged, the Court, in a five to four decision, rejected the contention that the admission of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior convictions in the trial of the pending criminal charge was <em>constitutional </em>error because of its prejudicial effect. Nevertheless, five members of the Court, including Justice Stewart who concurred separately, would have barred the admission of such evidence in a case invoking the exercise of the Court\u2019s <em>supervisory </em>powers over criminal procedures in the federal courts. The rationale for adopting this procedure was articulated by former Chief Justice Warren, in dissent. He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-26\">Evidence of prior convictions has been forbidden because it jeopardizes the presumption of innocence of the crime currently charged. A jury might punish an accused for being guilty of a previous offense, or feel that incarceration is justified because the accused is a \u201cbad man,\u201d without regard to his guilt of the crime currently charged. Of course it flouts human nature to suppose that a jury would not consider a defendant\u2019s previous trouble with the law in deciding whether he has committed the crime currently charged against him. As Mr. Justice Jackson put it in a famous phrase, \u201c[t]he naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.\u201d Krule-witch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 453 [69 S.Ct. 716, 723, 93 L.Ed. 790] (concurring opinion) (1949). United States v. Banmiller, 310 F.2d 720, 725 (C.A. 3d Cir. 1962). Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s assessment has received support from the most ambitious empirical study of jury behavior that has been attempted, see Kalven &amp; Zeisel, The American Jury 127-130, 177-180. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 87 S.Ct. at 659.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-27\">Because the same prejudice arises from informing a jury of an accused\u2019s previous convictions in the manner per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>mitted by the district court in this case, I would prohibit such disclosure when an accused is willing, as was Fields, to stipulate to the existence of his prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Although appellant sought to strike from the indictment reference to his prior convictions, his untutored request should have been treated as an attempt to prevent disclosure to the jury of the offenses described therein. No error was committed by setting forth the prior convictions in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Since I have grave doubts that the erroneous disclosure in this case did not have a substantial effect on the jury, particularly in the light of the jury\u2019s inability to agree in the previous trial where this evidence was excluded, Kot-teakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
