(VFI), a Nevada corporation, which leased and operated the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. VFI was also licensed to conduct gambling at the hotel, which opened in July of 1967. Neither Zerilli nor Polizzi was licensed by the Nevada gaming authorities, nor was either man\u2019s interest in VFI disclosed to those authorities. After extensive negotiations, VFI was sold in November, 1967, to Howard Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">Following a very lengthy and complex trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Zerilli, Polizzi, and the Other appellants were convicted of conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Interstate and Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Enterprises) and of substantive violations of that section. Appellants challenge their convictions on a number of bases. They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-22\">1. That the prosecution failed to show a violation of \u00a7 1952.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-23\">2. That, if a violation were shown, the laws in question would be unconstitutionally vague.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-24\">3. That the court erred in instructing the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-25\">4. That the publicity surrounding their trial deprived them of a fair trial and that there was jury misconduct which the court refused to investigate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-26\">5. That the label \u201cMafia\u201d was applied to them in a public list of Mafia figures made by the Department of Justice and that the list was submitted in the grand jury proceedings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>in the trial in this case and that these actions constitute a deprivation of their rights of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">6. That the trial court committed error in the permission it gave to the prosecution to cross-examine certain of the appellants about their reputations as members of the Mafia when the appellants had not presented evidence of character or reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">7. That they were deprived of a fair trial by misconduct of the prosecutor which the trial court sanctioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-7\">8. That the testimony of a key prosecution witness should have been stricken in that the prosecution\u2019s untimely production of his pretrial statements violated the Jencks Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-8\">9. That error was committed in the admission of the testimony of that witness on the grounds that part of the testimony was conclusively demonstrated to be false, and admitted to be false by the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-9\">10. That promises of leniency made to the witness by the prosecution were not disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-10\">11. That the acts complained of were a unitary crime and that it was not proper for them to be convicted of a conspiracy and substantive violations based upon the same conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-11\">12. That the venue of the trial court was improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-12\">13. That the court below erred in refusing to grant appellant Gi-ordano\u2019s <footnotemark>2a</footnotemark> motion for severance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-13\">14. That the court below erred in failing to instruct the jury that evidence admitted after appellant Gior-dano had rested at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case could not be considered against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-14\">15. That appellant Giordano\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-15\">16. That appellant Emprise is not liable for any criminal acts that its predecessor in interest allegedly committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-16\">17. That the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-17\">18. That the trial was materially tainted by leads from unlawful electronic surveillance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">Having carefully considered each of these contentions, we affirm the convictions below. Although this opinion is longer than we would have preferred, appellants have raised and argued so many points in 534 pages of briefs, exclusive of appendices and exhibits, that we find a lengthy opinion unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-19\">I. <em>Violation of </em>\u00a7 <em>1952</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-20\">Appellants\u2019 threshold contention is that their conduct did not come within the coverage of the federal Travel Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952), raising two issues as to the meaning of the statute. Section 1952 condemns interstate travel or the use of interstate facilities in the furtherance of \u201cany unlawful activity,\u201d defined as including \u201cany business enterprise involving gambling * * * offenses in violation of the laws of the State in which they are committed or of the United States * * A violation of \u00a7 1952 thus must be premised upon another distinct violation of state or federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">Although state law becomes the focus of this inquiry, \u201cthe gravamen of a charge under \u00a7 1952 is the violation of federal law * * United States v. Karigiannis, 430 F.2d 148, 150 (7 Cir. 1970) (Clark, J.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 904, 91 S.Ct. 143, 27 L.Ed.2d 141 (1970). \u201cReference to state law is necessary only to identify the type of unlawful activity in which the defendants intended to engage.\u201d United States of America v. Rizzo, 418 F.2d 71, 74 (7 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 967, 90 S.Ct. 1006, 25 L.Ed.2d 260 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">While the Government\u2019s theory was not succinctly stated, either in its brief or at oral argument, it does emerge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>from a careful reading of the indictment and information<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> together with the court\u2019s instructions to the jury <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that appellants violated the federal Travel Act by conduct which was a \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d that involved \u201cgambling * * * offenses\u201d in violation of Nevada Revised Statutes (N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in that Zer-illi and Polizzi\u2019s interests in the gambling conducted by VFI at the Frontier Hotel were hidden from the Nevada gaming authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Appellants\u2019 first argument is that since VFI had a gambling license as required by Nevada law, their activity could not be unlawful within the meaning of Uhe federal Travel Act. They rely considerably on one instruction, to which the government did not object, that VFI was licensed and that the gambling it conducted could not be found illegal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 counsel stated at oral argument that, even if appellants procured the VFI license fraudulently, there would be no criminal violation of Nevada law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">This instruction meant only that the trial court did not believe that the prosecution could rely upon N.R.S. \u00a7 463.-160(1)(a). The license would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>viewed as void <em>ab initio, </em>and the appellants could not be prosecuted for conducting a gambling enterprise without a license. Nor could the prosecutor \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d to reach appellants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The instruction does not, however, legitimize all the acts of appellants in obtaining the license. N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160(1) (c) covers precisely the charges here against appellants: receiving compensation from gambling conducted without having procured and maintained licenses as required by law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Appellants argue, however, that N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160(1) (c) only requires that the gambling be licensed and does not reach fraud or other violations in obtaining the license. Acceptance of this construction of Nevada law would effectively emasculate the statutory scheme of requiring the disclosure of the identities of the persons who would be involved in the gambling enterprise. This disclosure requirement has as its purpose the prevention of the infiltration of criminal elements into gambling in Nevada.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 463.160(1) (c) requires not only that a license be procured and maintained, but also that it must be procured and maintained in a manner that satisfies the other provisions of the gambling law. The term \u201cas required by statute\u201d must be viewed in light of the strong state policy behind the statutes. The interpretation offered by appellants would give free rein to criminal elements in their attempts to infiltrate Nevada gambling. The most they would risk would be the administrative revocation of their corporation\u2019s license. They would become criminally liable only if they operated a gambling enterprise without procuring a license, and the most dangerous elements could easily avoid such a blatant violation of Nevada law. Given these considerations, the only reasonable construction of N.R. S. \u00a7 463.160(1) (e) is that persons receiving compensation from the gambling operation must fulfill all other state requirements surrounding the granting of a license.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\"> Appellants violated those other provisions by failing to disclose the identities of Zerilli and Polizzi as persons having an interest in VFI. Under N.R.S. \u00a7 463.170(2), applicants for a corporate license had to disclose \u201cpersons having any direct or indirect interest therein of any nature whatsoever, whether financial, administrative, policymaking or supervisory * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>The disclosure requirement must be complete in order to meet the policy of the Nevada gambling laws. Appellants stress that the corporate-license application form supplied by the state required only the listing of the names of corporate officers and shareholders. Since VFI\u2019s application complied with this requirement, they argue, there was no failure to disclose. This argument, if accepted, would turn the detailed statutes governing the control of licensing into a mere formality. Disclosure of nominal officers and shareholders would guarantee legality and shield the very persons as to whom the disclosure requirements are directed. The Attorney General of Nevada in 1960 gave his opinion that N.R.S. \u00a7 463.170(2) gave power to state authorities \u201cto require those persons having administrative, policymaking or supervisory interest in the operation to qualify for licensing.\u201d To utilize that authority effectively, he stressed, the authorities would need to obtain information about those persons. Official Opinions of the Attorney General of Nevada, 1960-1962, pp. 83-84 (1960). There was no hint that formalities suffice or should be exalted over substance. In this ease, the information and indictment emphasized that Zerilli and Polizzi held the real interests in VFI and controlled the nominal shareholders. The trial court, in its instructions on the definition of \u201cowner\u201d as used in the Nevada statutes, stressed the reality of ownership rather than formal titles. (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, Vol. 43, p. 8765.) These statutes require disclosure of the names of all persons with <em>actual </em>control or financial interests in the gambling enterprise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The acts of appellants charged and proven in this case therefore were prohibited by state law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellants, however, raise further objections. They contend that, even if they did violate Nevada law, their violations were not <em>criminal </em>and therefore do not come within the ambit of \u00a7 1952. They characterize their conduct as merely \u201coperating a casino with a state corporate li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>cense but without other required state licenses.\u201d That theory, however, is based upon the government\u2019s contention that all persons with a direct or indirect interest in a gambling casino must be licensed. We find no such requirement in Nevada law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The violations of Nevada law in question here were not by VFI, but rather by those in control of VFI who did not disclose the interests of Zer-illi and Polizzi. The trial court preserved the corporate fiction and the legality of the gambling operations conducted by the corporation. Hence appellants\u2019 argument that N.R.S. \u00a7 463.310 specifically establishes only an administrative penalty available to the authorities in this case \u2014 revocation of VFI\u2019s license \u2014 is in error. That provision does set the procedures for disciplinary action against the licensee, but here the licensee has not been prosecuted for violating Nevada law. Since there is no specific penalty prescribed for a violation of N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160(1) (c), the \u201ccatch-all\u201d section, N.R.S. \u00a7 463.360(2)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> would apply.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That violation, there characterized as a gross misdemeanor, would be a <em>criminal </em>infraction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Appellants\u2019 second argument is that \u00a7 1952 reaches only <em>wholly </em>unlawful business enterprises and, since gaming is legal in Nevada, the federal Travel Act does not apply. They cite United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879 (9 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 883, 27 L.Ed.2d 828 (1971), rehearing denied, 402 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 1366, 28 L.Ed.2d 665 (1971), in support. Their reliance upon <em>Roselli </em>is misplaced.. There the Court accepted only for the purposes of argument the premise that the scope of \u00a7 1952 was limited to illegal business enterprises and even on that basis found such an illegal enterprise (432 F.2d 879 at 887-888). Appellants overlook that earlier in that opinion this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-13\">\u201cIf section 1952 applied only when all business activity was absolutely prohibited in the particular field, the reach of the section would be materially diminished without apparent reason in terms of the statute\u2019s purpose. There is no evidence that Congress intended this result.\u201d 432 F.2d 879 at 887.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">Nor do appellants\u2019 general references to the legislative history of \u00a7 1952 support this contention.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The statutory language is clear. \u201cSection 1952 speaks not of illegal gambling, but of a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>inclusive category: \u2018gambling * * * offenses.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879, 887 (9 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 883, 27 L.Ed.2d 828 (1971), rehearing denied, 402 U.S. 924, 91 S.Ct. 1366, 28 L.Ed.2d 665 (1971) . <em>See also </em>Turf Center, Inc. v. United States, 325 F.2d 793, 795 (9 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">This Court\u2019s construction of the scope of \u00a7 1952 will not open the federal courts to the prosecutorial abuses which appellants have depicted for the Court: prosecutions of minor illegal acts incidental to an otherwise legal business. The legislative history of \u00a7 1952 does demonstrate that its main purposes are to attack organized crime and to aid local authorities in combat-ting it.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Courts would simply not allow it to be used to extend federal prosecutions far from these purposes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 245, 93 S.Ct. 477, 34 L.Ed.2d 446 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">We conclude that appellants engaged in a business enterprise involving gambling offenses in violation of Nevada law and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">II. <em>Vagueness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">Appellants challenge the statutes under which they have been charged and convicted as being unconstitutionally vague. \u201cNo one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.\u201d Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939). Appellants\u2019 attack is directed at the Nevada statutes and not the language of \u00a7 1952, which has been upheld previously against claims of vagueness. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Cozzetti, 441 F.2d 344, 348 (9 Cir. 1971); Turf Center, Inc. v. United States, 325 F.2d 793, 795 (9 Cir. 1963); United States v. Smith, 209 F.Supp. 907, 917-918 (E.D.Ill.1962). We have already held that the Nevada statutes clearly proscribe the conduct charged against appellants.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The construction of those statutes urged by appellants is unreasonable and conflicts with the manifest purpose of the Nevada gambling legislation requiring precise and stringent controls relating to the licensing of gambling. Violation of the statutes in the manner charged against appellants is a criminal offense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In affirming these convictions, we are not enlarging the original legislation by interpretation. <em>Cf. </em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 350-352, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964); Pierce v. United States, 314 U.S. 306, 311, 62 S.Ct. 237, 86 L.Ed. 226 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that specific intent was an element of the offense charged against appellants.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus the jury found that appellants knew that Nevada law had been violated in the procurement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>VFI\u2019s license. \u201cA mind intent upon willful evasion is inconsistent with surprised innocence.\u201d United States v. Ragen, 314 U.S. 513, 524, 62 S.Ct. 374, 379, 86 L.Ed. 383 (1942). <em>See also </em>United States v. National Dairy Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 33, 35, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 103, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945). The record here is clear that appellants were not the helpless victims of an unconstitutionally vague statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">III. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOX\">A. <em>Nevada Statutes and Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJT\">Appellants contend that the court below erred in several respects in its instructions to the jury. Certain of these claims concern specific instructions relating to the Nevada statutes. Appellants\u2019 objections are based upon a misunderstanding of the government\u2019s legal theory of the ease. Viewed as a whole, the court\u2019s instructions constitute a reasonable construction of \u00a7 1952 and the Nevada statutes governing the licensing of gambling operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Appellants also argue that it was error to read to the jury, without explanation, N.R.S. \u00a7 463.130.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But that section is a self-explanatory statement of Nevada legislative policy and is important in understanding the purpose and meaning of the other sections. These Nevada statutes form a unified legislative plan; particular sections cannot be fully understood without relating them to the entire statutory scheme. Therefore, under these circumstances, it was not error to read to the jury sections other than N.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 463.160 and 463.200, the two sections upon which the indictment and information were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">N.R.S. \u00a7 463.300, dealing with voting trust agreements, was also read to the jury. Appellants argue that this was confusing, since the court had earlier instructed the jury that the evidence presented had failed to establish a violation of \u00a7 463.300. The court refused appellants\u2019 instruction which would have directed the jury to disregard all evidence concerning the voting trust agreement. In light of the court\u2019s specific instruction, no further instructions were necessary to prevent the jury from finding a violation of \u00a7 463.300. It is also highly unlikely that reading that section in these circumstances confused the jury. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Lookretis, 422 F.2d 647, 651 (7 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 904, 90 S.Ct. 1693, 26 L.Ed.2d 63 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Although conceding that the court properly charged the jury that violations of the regulations of the Nevada State Gaming Commission could not constitute criminal offenses, appellants nevertheless assert that error was committed in instructing that such a violation could be considered as an act in furtherance of a conspiracy. This instruction was proper and necessary in that without it the jury might have thought that it had to disregard completely a violation of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">B. <em>Sending Statutes and Regulations to the Jury Room</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">Appellants urge that sending the statutes and regulations into the jury room, especially without limiting instructions, was prejudicial error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>This question is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. United States v. Gross, 451 F.2d 1355, 1358-1359 (7 Cir. 1971); United States v. Bearden, 423 F.2d 805, 813 (5 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 836, 91 S.Ct. 73, 27 L.Ed.2d 68 (1970). In this case, the statutes and regulations were extremely complex, and the trial judge may justifiably have believed that it would be better to give the jury the statutes and regulations rather than to have them attempt a reconstruction from notes or from memory. In his effort to avoid confusion, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">C. <em>Reading Indictment and Information to Jury and Sending Copies to Jury Room</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Appellants argue that it was reversible error to read the indictment and information both at the beginning of trial and during the instructions. Given the extraordinary length and complexity of the trial, however, the trial court may properly have judged that a re-reading was required to avoid confusion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The decision to read the indictment to the jury is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we find no abuse of that discretion here.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\"> The court below also sent to the jury room copies of the indictment and information. That decision is also generally within the discretion of the trial judge. United States v. Murray, 492 F.2d 178, 193-194 (9 Cir. 1973); Souza v. United States, 304 F.2d 274, 280 (9 Cir. 1962). Appellants contend that they should have been advised before closing arguments that the court intended to send the information and indictment. <em>See </em>Dallago v. United States, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 276, 427 F.2d 546, 553 (1969). We agree, but the failure to do so here is not prejudicial error.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Under all the circumstances of this ease, especially the court\u2019s cautionary instruction on the use of the indictment and information and the detailed instructions on what could be considered evidence by the jury, we do not find that error prejudicial in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">D. <em>Specific Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">In claiming error in the court\u2019s instructions on specific intent,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> appellants urge us to follow United States v. Stagman, 446 F.2d 489, 492-493 (6 Cir. 1971), and hold that specific intent to violate state law is an element of the.offense under \u00a7 1952. This Court however, has previously approved an instruction similar to the one given in this case. <em>See </em>Turf Center, Inc. v. United States, 325 F.2d 793, 797 and n. 5 (9 Cir. 1963). Moreover, to the extent that <em>Stagman </em>requires proof that an accused under \u00a7 1952 intended to violate state law <em>himself, </em>we find that it conflicts with the clear meaning of the language used in \u00a7 1952. As the court in <em>Stag-man </em>recognized, the intent required in the statute \u201crefers to the entire phrase \u2018to * * * carry on * * * any unlawful activity.\u2019 \u201d 446 F.2d at 492. That phrase does not require specific in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>tent to violate state law, but rather specific intent to facilitate an activity which the accused knew to be unlawful under state law. This interpretation, apart from its consistency with the literal terms of \u00a7 1952, also supports the purposes of that statute in attacking organized crime by furnishing federal help to local authorities in their attempts to control such crime. It would not subject innocent persons to criminal jeopardy in travelling interstate since for a conviction, proof would be required at the least \u201cthat the defendant intended with bad purpose\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to facilitate the violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">Although the instructions on specific intent, viewed alone, could have been more precise, taking the instructions as a whole, they reasonably informed the jury that they had to find that appellants knew that what they were facilitating was an unlawful activity under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">E. <em>Advice of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">As an adjunct to their argument on specific intent, appellants claim that the court should have instructed the jury that reliance on advice of counsel could show a lack of specific intent. Given the evidence in this case, the advice given by counsel was an insignificant factor in the criminal enterprise found by the jury; thus the court below did not err in refusing to give an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d instruction. <em>See </em>United States v. Shewfelt, 455 F.2d 836, 838-839 (9 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 944, 92 S.Ct. 2042, 32 L.Ed.2d 331 (1972); Bisno v. United States, 299 F.2d 711, 719-720 (9 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 370 U.S. 952, 82 S.Ct. 1602, 8 L.Ed.2d 818 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">F. <em>Kotteakos Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Appellants contend that they were entitled to a \u201cmultiple conspiracy\u201d instruction following the principle of Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 767-768, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). <em>See also </em>United States v. Griffin, 464 F.2d 1352, 1355-1357 (9 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1009, 93 S.Ct. 444, 34 L.Ed.2d 302 (1972), Having carefully reviewed the entire reporter\u2019s transcript of trial and all documents in evidence, we find that there is no variance between the allegations of the indictment and information and the evidence presented at trial and that therefore the trial court did not err in not giving a \u201cmultiple conspiracy\u201d instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">G. <em>Suppression of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">A letter from appellant Bellanca to Emprise Corporation was not produced by the defense in response to a grand jury subpoena because of a claim of attorney-client privilege. The court gave a general instruction on suppression of evidence, apparently in part on the basis that failure to produce the letter could be evidence of suppression.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Appellants also complain of the court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Even if the giving of the suppression of evidence instruction were error, we find that the weight of other evidence against appellants is such that the error could not have been prejudicial. The court below, moreover, had instructed the jury on the attorney-client privilege during the tri\u00e1l.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>H. <em>Perjurer\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Appellants also claim error in the court\u2019s failure to give a cautionary instruction on the testimony of a perjurer. Their initial proposed instruction referred to the witness, Maurice Friedman, as an admitted perjuror when in fact he had been convicted of perjury and had not pled guilty. Appellants submitted a revised instruction after the instructions conference substituting \u201cconvicted\u201d for \u201cadmitted\u201d, but it was rejected as untimely. Even if this were error, which we do not find, any prejudice resulting from it was cured by the instructions given on prior inconsistent statements <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and on the weight of the testimony of an informer.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> These instructions sufficiently alerted the jury to the caution necessary in weighing the testimony of a witness like Friedman. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Evanchik, 413 F.2d 950, 954 (2 Cir. 1969); United States v. Ross, 322 F.2d 306, 307 (4 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 970, 84 S.Ct. 490, 11 L.Ed.2d 418 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">I. Skimming<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Appellants argue that the trial court committed error in not admonishing the jury during instructions that the prosecution\u2019s argument about \u201cskimming\u201d should be disregarded as unsupported by evidence and as not appearing in the indictment or information. Whatever prejudice to appellants could have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s argument was cured by the trial court\u2019s painstaking instructions on the elements of the offenses charged. The trial judge read the language of the information and indictment to the jury and sent copies of them to the jury room. The jury was fully apprised of the charges against appellants; \u201cskimming\u201d was not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">IV. <em>Prejudicial Publicity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Appellants claim that they were prejudiced by the publicity given their case both before and during trial and that the trial judge failed to take adequate measures to detect and prevent that prejudice. The pretrial publicity consisted mainly of newspaper articles on the case.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> These articles commented, for instance, upon the alleged ties of appellants to the Mafia, and upon the \u201cskimming\u201d allegations of the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Appellants also point to several incidents during trial which in their view also led to prejudicial publicity. Newspaper articles referred, for example, to evidence which had not been admitted linking appellants Zerilli and Polizzi to James Hof fa, the former Teamster official, in a prior attempt to invest in a Las Vegas casino. On another occasion a witness mentioned in the absence of the jury that during a previous recorded and transcribed conversation, he \u201chad in mind\u201d Zerilli and Polizzi when he used the terms \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nostra.\u201d References to this comment appeared in the newspapers. Later a newspaper disclosed the court\u2019s ruling at a sidebar conference sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection to a question asking Polizzi to explain his testimony on cross-examination that he had been falsely accused by the Department of Justice of being in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the Mafia.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The prosecutor had mentioned at that sidebar conference surveillance logs of Zerilli and Polizzi disclosing \u201cthe whole Mafia organization in Detroit,\u201d and the newspaper article referred to that comment. The motion picture <em>The Godfather </em>was released during the trial, and a local television personality discussed during his program the book and Zerilli and Polizzi and their alleged links to the Mafia. Finally, after the jury had reached its verdicts, one juror allegedly told defense counsel that other jurors had read newspaper articles on the case during trial and that this had been \u201cdevasting to the defendants.\u201d Although this juror had been in the courtroom during a hearing on a motion for a new trial, the court refused appellants\u2019 request to have him testify but permitted defense counsel to file affidavits. The juror was subsequently unwilling to submit an affidavit, but defense counsel did file an affidavit purporting to state what the juror had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">An accused has an unquestioned right to have jurors decide his guilt or innocence who are not biased by what has appeared in the media. In some instances prejudicial publicity before and during trial may be so obvious and overwhelming that an appellate court must overturn a conviction without delving into a detailed analysis of the possibility of prejudice and the judicial action taken to a curb it. <em>See </em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 349-352, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966); Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 542, 544, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965); Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 726, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963); Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 725, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961). After a review of appellants\u2019 evidence and arguments on this question, we do not find that the situation here reached that extreme, and therefore we do not find \u201cbias or preformed opinion\u201d which would require reversal as a matter of law. Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 557, 82 S.Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962); United States v. Silverthorne, 430 F.2d 675, 678 (9 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1022, 91 S.Ct. 585, 27 L.Ed.2d 633 (1971). We must now determine the probability of prejudice in this case and whether the court responded adequately to curtail the chance of an unfair trial. Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310, 312, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">A. <em>Pretrial Publicity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\u201c[T]he trial judge has a large discretion in ruling on the issue of prejudice resulting from the reading by jurors of news articles concerning the trial. * * * [W]hen pretrial publicity is great, the trial judge must exercise correspondingly great care in all aspects of the case relating to publicity which might tend to defeat or impair the rights of an accused. The judge must insure that the voir dire examination of the jurors affords a fair determination that no prejudice has been' fostered.\u201d Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 637-638 (9 Cir. 1968). In a case of <em>substantial </em>pretrial publicity, the voir dire must not simply call for the jurors\u2019 subjective assessment of their own impartiality, and it must not be so general that it does not adequately probe the possibility of prejudice. 400 F.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">If this case were to be considered closely similar to <em>Silverthorne, swpra, </em>in the seriousness of the question of prejudice from pretrial publicity, there is little doubt that the initial voir dire was not sufficiently probing to meet the <em>Sil-verthorne </em>standards. The trial judge\u2019s questions on pretrial publicity were lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ited to two questions addressed to the first prospective panel of jurors<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and later questions addressed to an individual prospective juror.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The answers gave no indication of possible prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">We find, however, that the pretrial publicity in this case was not substantial enough to have required the trial judge to interrogate the prospective jurors at length about it. The judge was aware of the publicity, and clearly it was his judgment that the pretrial publicity was not a significant danger to a fair trial.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> His concern seemed greater about the possible effects of publicity during trial. The pretrial publicity in this case does not resemble the situation in Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 639 (1968). Unless a trial judge clearly has erred in his estimation of the action needed to uncover and prevent prejudice from pretrial publicity, an appellate court should not intervene and impose its estimate. The court closest to the situation can best evaluate the proper way to walk the difficult line between a vigorous voir dire to determine any possible bias and avoidance of creating bias by specific questions which add \u201cfuel to the flames\u201d in suggesting the presence of controversial issues. Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 548, 82 S.Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962). The court below did not abuse its discretion by the way it handled the question of pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">B. <em>Publicity During Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">When the possibility of prejudice from publicity arises during trial, the trial court has \u201cthe affimative duty * * * to take positive action to ascertain the existence of improper influences on the jurors\u2019 deliberative qualifications and to take whatever steps are necessary to diminish or eradicate such improprieties.\u201d Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 643 (9 Cir. 1968). See also Gordon v. United States, 438 F.2d 858, 872-873 (5 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 828, 92 S.Ct. 139, 30 L.Ed.2d 56 (1971), rehearing denied, 404 U.S. 960, 92 S.Ct. 312, 30 L.Ed.2d 279 (1971). The better practice, if there is a clear chance of prejudice, is for the court to interrogate each juror in camera about the possibly prejudicial publicity. Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 644 (9 Cir. 1968); Coppedge v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 272 F.2d 504, 508 (1959). The trial judge carries a difficult burden. He is called upon to question the jurors, but repeated questioning could itself be prejudicial in inciting in the jurors \u201cjoint or individual curiosity and encourage attempts to read the very newspaper articles sought to be kept from their knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>edge.\u201d Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 643 (9 Cir. 1968). His very questions may disclose or accentuate controversial issues. Unless he has clearly abused his discretion, we shall uphold the trial judge\u2019s delicate estimation of the needs of the ease of which he has firsthand experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">During his initial voir dire of prospective jurors, the judge indicated that the jurors would not be sequestered but that they would be expected to avoid hearing or seeing anything about the case.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> One prospective juror was questioned about adherence to that admonition; she indicated that she would find it difficult to follow and was excused. Appellants argue that allowing the jurors to read newspapers with the admonition to avoid stories on the trial after glancing at headlines itself raised enough possibility of prejudice to require reversal. We disagree. The relevant' questions are the nature of the headlines and the actions taken by the court to cure any possibility of prejudice <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-18\">Early in the trial on February 24, 1972, the court again admonished the jury to avoid any publicity about the case.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The very next day, after newspaper stories linking Zerilli and Polizzi to James Hof fa, the court undertook an in camera interrogation of each juror separately, in the absence of all defendants, counsel and other jurors. The judge asked whether they had read the articles and whether they had seen or heard anything about the case in the newspapers, on television, or on the radio. He also gave them another general admonition. Nothing said by any of the jurors during this interrogation revealed a possibility of prejudice from the publicity.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> We agree with appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>that it would have been preferable to ask each juror about the newspaper carrying the Hoffa story which apparently was in the jury room, but each juror\u2019s other answers would have to be willful falsehoods if each had in fact read the article in the jury room. If the jurors had read the story, \u201c[e]ven the most biased argument would be hard put to suggest that all twelve jurors, sworn to try the indictments fairly would deliberately break their oaths by remaining in the box, having read the items, instead of bowing out under the wise protection of the court and saving not only their dignity but their honor.\u201d United States v. Carlucci, 288 F.2d 691, 696 (3 Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 961, 81 S.Ct. 1920, 6 L.Ed.2d 1253 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On March 9, 1972, after newspaper articles were published referring to appellants and their links to organized crime as discovered by United States Senate investigators, the court declined to question the jurors again, in the belief that new questioning could itself undermine the jury\u2019s belief in its own integrity.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> On March 21, 1972, after the leak of the ruling at the sidebar conference, the. court, having the opportunity to observe on a daily basis the demeanor of the jurors and after expressing his confidence in their ability to obey his admonitions, again declined to interrogate the jurors anew.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">On April 3, 1972, the trial court on its own motion conducted an in camera questioning of each juror.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Again defendants, counsel, and the other jurors were not present. He asked them generally whether they had read, seen, or heard anything in the media about the case. The jurors indicated that they had not. Appellants argue that Juror Foss, whose family was keeping a scrapbook of articles concerning the trial, must have been exposed to publicity surrounding the case. Here is the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-14\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Foss, you will recall that some time ago I called the jurors in one at a time to ask them if they had read any newspaper articles about this case and because of the length of the trial I thought it wise to emphasize it again and to call them in to ask if they had read any newspaper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>articles about the case. Have you read any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-5\">\u201cJuror Foss: No. My people cut the articles out of the paper before they give me the paper. Before they bring the paper to me in the morning they cut everything out. They have got it in a scrapbook somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">\u201cThe Court: And you will wait until the case is over before you read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">\u201cJuror Foss: I won\u2019t read anything about the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-24\">\u201cThe Court: That is fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-25\">\u201cJuror Foss: I will decide it on the facts in the courtroom.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Transcript, Yol. 31, pp. 6010-6011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-27\">The argument is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-28\">After the verdicts were reached, the trial judge questioned each juror separately in his chambers. He stressed on this occasion whether the term \u201cMafia\u201d or related terms had been factors in the jury\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> It seems that the terms were discussed briefly at the be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>ginning of the jury\u2019s deliberations and once during a lunchtime, but the jurors agreed that those terms and issues had not been factors in their decisions. The judge also asked them about their exposure to the book and the motion picture <em>The Godfather. </em>Two jurors had read the book, but said that it had not influenced their decisions. He asked all but four jurors general questions about their exposure to newspaper, television, and radio publicity, again without any revelations of possible prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Finally, on June 12, 1972, at a hearing on a motion for a new trial, defense counsel told the court of juror Palmer\u2019s revelation that other jurors had been reading newspaper stories about the case and that it had been \u201cdevastating to the defendants.\u201d The court refused defense counsel\u2019s request for an immediate examination of jurors Palmer and Dewey who were in the courtroom, but stated that counsel could file affidavits on the matter. Palmer subsequently refused to submit an affidavit, although defense counsel did submit two affidavits.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> While it may generally be preferable for the trial court to allow such an examination of jurors in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>to dispel any doubts as to the integrity of the jury\u2019s deliberations, such action was not required here. The trial judge, after having questioned juror Palmer on three separate occasions during and immediately after trial in the privacy of his chambers, could understandably have been skeptical of such a belated attack on the jury\u2019s verdicts. The record is not barren on this point,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>could reasonably have found juror Palmer\u2019s disclosure as reported by defense counsel unworthy of belief. Palmer\u2019s unwillingness to submit an affidavit strongly supports that judgment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In this case the problem of publicity was not insignificant, but it was a problem that was handled by proper judicial supervision. \u201cThe right to publish a prejudicial article does not carry with it the right of an accused to an automatic mistrial. Such an outcome would give to the press a power over judicial proceedings which may not be countenanced.\u201d Mares v. United States, 383 F.2d 805, 808 (10 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 963, 89 S.Ct. 1314, 22 L.Ed.2d 564 (1969). After our detailed review, we cannot say that there is a serious possibility that the jury was influenced by considerations apart from evidence properly admitted at trial. The trial judge admonished the jury on at least four occasions to avoid publicity about the case. He interrogated the jurors individually three times. The fact that the jurors discussed the term \u201cMafia\u201d and related issues does not in itself require reversal. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Lazarus, 425 F.2d 638, 640-641 (9 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 869, 91 S.Ct. 102, 27 L.Ed.2d 108 (1970), rehearing denied, 400 U.S. 954, 91 S.Ct. 233, 27 L.Ed.2d 261 (1970). For appellants\u2019 arguments of prejudice and juror Palmer\u2019s disclosure to be true, the other jurors would in effect have committed perjury on several occasions and have entered into a conspiracy of silence. The trial judge found that incredible. We agree. \u201cAppellate courts should be slow to impute to juries a disregard of their duties, and to trial courts a want of diligence or perspicacity in appraising the jury\u2019s conduct.\u201d Fairmount Glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co., 287 U.S. 474, 485, 53 S.Ct. 252, 255, 77 L.Ed. 439 (1933) (Brand\u00e9is, J.). \u201cIf the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain jury trial under the conditions of the present day.\" Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 251, 31 S.Ct. 2, 6, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910) (Holmes, J.). No reversible error was committed in the trial court\u2019s handling of the question of prejudicial publicity; we do not find \u201cthat the probability of prejudice arose and was not eliminated.\u201d Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 644 (9 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">V. <em>Department of Justice \u201cMafia\u201d List</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The United States Department of Justice in 1969 included appellants Zerilli and Polizzi on a list of known Mafia figures. See 115 Cong.Rec., Part 17, pp. 23440-23441 (August 12, 1969). Appellants contend that the presence of those names on that list was the motivating factor in the prosecution of this case and also that the prosecution made several prejudicial comments, based upon appellants\u2019 alleged Mafia connections, to the grand and petit juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Their first point, that their inclusion on the \u201cMafia list\u201d was the prime motivation for the prosecution, is not supported by anything in the record and is strongly contradicted by the testimony of three government officials prominent in this prosecution.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">The next contention, that the prosecution \u201cpoisoned\u201d the grand jury proceedings by comments referring to the Mafia, is unsupported by the record or by the authorities appellants cite. The portions of the transcript of the proceedings before the grand jury which appellants quote in their opening brief are not evidence of grand jury bias. \u201cMafia\u201d is mentioned by the prosecutor in one question. The possible use of force is the basis of four questions referring to appellant Shapiro. One witness is asked whether he is fearful or apprehensive as a result of his testimony. Appellants allege that the grand jury was \u201crepeatedly told\u201d of a prior arrest of appellant Zerilli; and the prosecutor commented on the alleged association of Zer-illi and Polizzi with \u201ctough guys, Italians, from New York.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Appellants have a difficult burden to satisfy in their challenge to the indictment. \u201cAn indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, like an information drawn by the prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits. The Fifth Amendment requires nothing more.\u201d Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 409, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956). A valid indictment does not require support by \u201cadequate or competent evidence.\u201d 350 U.S. at 364.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> See <em>also </em>United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). Appellants have not demonstrated a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>sonable inference of bias on the part of the grand jury resulting from the comments of the prosecutor.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 545-549, 82 S.Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962). \u201cThe quantum of evidence necessary to indict is not as great as that necessary to convict. If a grand jury is prejudiced by outside sources when in fact there is insufficient evidence to indict, the greatest safeguard to the liberty of the accused is the petit jury and the rules governing its determination of a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. And, if impartiality among the petit jurors is wanting, the cure is reversal by the appellate courts.\u201d Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 634 (9 Cir. 1968) <footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Appellants also argue that the \u201cMafia list\u201d played an impermissible role in the trial. They refer, however, only to the comments of the prosecutor in closing argument that appellants \u201csubstituted the corporate resolution for the pistol.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> There was no express reference to the Mafia in the prosecutor\u2019s statement, nor could such a reference be reasonably implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">VI. <em>Cross-Examination on Reputation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Appellants argue that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine Polizzi and Zerilli on their reputations. The government contends that the cross-examination was permissible as to Polizzi because he had opened the subject of his reputation on direct examination and as to Zerilli in order to impeach his testimony about why he could not be licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">\u201cThe price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him.\u201d Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 479, 69 S.Ct. 213, 220, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948). Throughout the presentation of its case, the prosecution avoided raising the issue of the Mafia links of Zerilli and Polizzi in demonstrating that they' could not themselves obtain licenses from the Nevada authorities. On direct examination Polizzi testified that the reason why he could not be licensed was that he had a \u201cproblem.\u201d He never described the specifics of this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">For all that the jury knew from Polizzi\u2019s direct testimony, his \u201cproblem\u201d could have been one of short duration \u2014e.g., insufficient financing \u2014 which would not have indefinitely precluded licensing. If so, there would have been no motive for furtive investment. Thus, the nature of Polizzi\u2019s \u201cproblem\u201d was clearly relevant. And while the trial judge did order Polizzi to answer the question regarding the \u201cproblem,\u201d he did not order the defendant to use the word \u201cMafia.\u201d Polizzi could have answered the question truthfully and specifically without using the \u201cMafia\u201d term \u2014 for example, he could have said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>that he understood that he would not be considered a suitable person for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Thus, since the general nature of Polizzi\u2019s problem was directly relevant and the prejudicial Mafia connection was volunteered by Polizzi, the trial court\u2019s ruling was well within its wide discretion in controlling cross-examination and in balancing its probative value against possible prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">This result is even clearer as to Zerilli. The reason why Zerilli could not be licensed was not admissible merely to impeach Zerilli or his attorney\u2014 it was directly relevant to Zerilli\u2019s guilt. If the reason Zerilli could not be licensed was, as he testified, his ownership interest in a race track, then his testimony of continuing interest in the enterprise because of an intention to invest later might be credible. The race track regulation was apparently unclear and Zerilli could in any event sell his race track interest. However, if the reason he could not be licensed was his reputation, then any hope of investing later would be doubtful since his reputation was unlikely to change. Zerilli therefore had a strong motive to make his investment surreptitiously. Moreover, there was no mention of the Mafia in connection with Zerilli, only of his \u201creputation,\u201d so that the court did not err in permitting the government to cross-examine Zerilli on the reasons why he could not be licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">VII. <em>Misconduct of the Prosecutor and Trial Judge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Appellants cite many episodes of what they assert <em>to be </em>misconduct by the prosecutor, sanctioned by the trial judge, which deprived them of a fair trial. After having carefully reviewed each of these assertions, we do not find that they amount to a deprivation of appellants\u2019 right to a fair trial. No good would be served by a discussion of each of the points raised, but we shall discuss several representative claims.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">In his closing arguments, the prosecutor did make comments which could have conveyed the impression that appellants were violent individuals.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This question, however, is tied closely to the issue of the influence of the Mafia references on the jury. We have found that the court below carefully handled that issue,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and we find that these comments were not so prejudicial to appellants so as to require reversal of the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Appellants argue that the prosecutor gave his personal opinion of appellants\u2019 guilt to the jury and referred to the indictment in this case as supporting him. The prosecutor did mention the grand jury indictment, but he used it to rebut appellants\u2019 argument to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>the jury that the prosecutor was pursuing in effect a personal vendetta against appellants.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The reference to the indictment in these circumstances does not constitute improper argument. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Cummings, 468 F.2d 274, 277-278 (9 Cir. 1972); Hall v. United States, 419 F.2d 582, 587 (5 Cir. 1969). Moreover, the jury was instructed that the indictment and information were not evidence and were merely methods of accusing a defendant of a crime. Reporter\u2019s Transcript, Vol. 43, pp. 8736-8737.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">On four occasions, in ruling on questions addressed to two government witnesses, the trial judge made comments that appear to vouch for the credibility of the witnesses. However, we cannot accept the appellants' assertions of prejudice. They did not object to any of the judge\u2019s statements, and they certainly knew how to object when they thought it important to do so. The error, if any, could easily have been corrected, had there been objection. For example, in one instance, at the end of the colloquy, the court said \u201c * * * in any instance the jury is to draw no inference from the questions as bringing any truthfulness to us.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Transcript, Vol. 2, p. 244. The court, moreover, instructed the jury not to assume from his comments during trial that he held particular opinions about the issues in question and that they were the sole judges of the credibility of witnesses and of the weight of evidence. <em>See </em>United States v. Jackson, 482 F.2d 1167, 1175-1176 (10 Cir. 1973); United States v. Cunningham, 423 F.2d 1269, 1276 (4 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\"> Appellants contend that the trial court first received evidence, in the presence of the jury, on the question of the applicable Nevada law, rendering the matter one for the jury\u2019s decision, but then at the end of the trial took the issue away from the jury by instructing it as to the state law. The determination of the applicable state law in a case such as this is a question for the court. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. D\u2019Amato, 436 F.2d 52, 54 (3 Cir. 1970); United States v. Lyon, 397 F.2d 505, 513 (7 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 846, 89 S.Ct. 131, 21 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968). To receive testimony on the question of state law in the presence of the jury is unnecessary, but not prejudicial error unless the combination of the testimony and the court\u2019s instructions clearly leave the jury in confusion or in doubt as to the applicable state law. We do not find prejudicial error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Also cited as error is the trial court\u2019s comment that a certain question could be decided if one of the appellants took the stand.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> This was not an infringement of appellant Bellanca\u2019s right against self-incrimination. \u201c[T]he test is whether the language used was mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>festly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d Knowles v. United States, 224 F.2d 168, 170 (10 Cir. 1955).<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> No such finding could be reached here. It was an offhand comment which could have had no influence on the jury. This point is an example of a practice appellants have followed many times on this appeal: quoting out of context remarks of the prosecutor and especially the trial judge and supplying an \u201cargument\u201d for reversal by dramatic and hyperbolic language. Appellants argue that after this incident \u201cappellant Bellanca had to take the stand or suffer the possibility of an untoward inference by the jurors.\u201d The episode in fact was a pedestrian exchange which, if anything, probably left the jury with the impression that appellants would be able to establish the point through other witnesses, including appellant Bellanca if he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">Appellants\u2019 next point is that the prosecution evaded a prior ruling by the court that it could not offer evidence of prior similar acts by appellants. The court, after hearing the proffered evidence in the absence of the jury, instructed the jury that there was no evidence of prior similar acts and that any comments of the prosecutor on the issue were to be disregarded. In addition, each juror was asked whether the comments had prejudiced them, and each juror said that he had not been prejudiced. The prosecution nevertheless subsequently inquired on cross-examination about prior attempts to invest in Las Vegas. This line of inquiry was permitted by the court for the limited purpose of showing Zerilli and Polizzi\u2019s earlier interest in investing in a Las Vegas casino. However, the probative value of that testimony was not great enough to justify its admission in light of the possibility of confusing the jury which in effect was asked to consider the evidence on one issue but not on another, although the issues of motive and prior similar acts, if not identical, were closely related. We do not find, however, that prejudice to appellants actually resulted in light of other and substantial evidence supporting the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The government attempted to use a deposition of Benjamin Reisman, an attorney employed by appellant Emprise, on its redirect examination of Maurice Friedman. The deposition was taken in 1970, before appellants were indicted, during the course of other legal proceedings. Appellant Rooks was later asked on cross-examination by the prosecution whether he had heard the reading of the deposition and whether he knew of the events described in the deposition. On cross-examination of appellant Zerilli, the prosecutor used the deposition again in an attempt to refresh Zerilli\u2019s recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The use of the deposition cannot be justified by Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure since it was not taken at the motion of a defendant, it was taken before the indictment and information here were filed, no order of the court had been obtained, and no notice had been given to the parties. The prosecution argues that it offered the evidence only as to the corporate defendant Emprise. The deposition was taken in connection with legal proceedings against Jeremy Jacobs, the President of Emprise. The court admitted it not on the authority of Rule 15, but rather on the ground that it was a prior statement of a witness in a case where the parties and issues were substantially the same as in the present case. We need not decide whether there was error.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Another deposition of Reisman was taken and read into the record without objection, thereby curing any defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>arising from the admission of the first deposition. Appellants\u2019 counsel had the opportunity to ask Reisman about his prior statements, thus fulfilling appellants\u2019 right to confront adverse witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">If it were error to allow the prosecution to ask appellant Rooks about the first Reisman deposition, there was no possible prejudice.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The same is true of the use of the deposition as possibly refreshing Zerilli\u2019s memory; the incident was insignificant.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The prosecution, as the representative of the government, is expected to follow high standards in conducting its ease. \u201cThe United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). But during an extensive and fiercely contested trial, we cannot realistically expect perfection. <em>Cf. </em>Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 619, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953). Upon hindsight, there were things said by the prosecution which would have been better unsaid. But nothing said or done deprived appellants of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">The main instrument for insuring that the conduct of counsel does not deprive the accused of a fair trial is the trial judge. In this case the trial judge clearly did his best to give appellants a fair trial. <em>Compare </em>United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340, 385-391 (7 Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). Errors were committed, but none so prejudicial, so fatal, either individually or collectively, as to require reversal. \u201c[F]ew, if any judges can altogether avoid words or action, inadvertent or otherwise, which seem inappropriate when later examined in the calm cloisters of the appellate court. But unless such misadventures so persistently pervade the trial or, considered individually or together, are of such magnitude that a courtroom climate unfair to the defendant is discernible from the cold record, the defendant is not sufficiently aggrieved to warrant a new trial.\u201d Smith v. United States, 305 F.2d 197, 205 (9 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 890, 83 S.Ct. 189, 9 L.Ed.2d 124 (1962). Appellants have failed to make a persuasive showing that their constitutional rights were violated, and our careful review of the entire record does not lead to a reasonable inference that the jury\u2019s verdicts were the end result of anything other than an impartial consideration of properly admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">VIII. <em>Production of Jencks Act Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">Appellants claim that the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce four pretrial statements by its witness, Maurice Friedman, in conformance with the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>reversal. Two of the purported statements are interview memoranda prepared by an assistant United States Attorney ; another is a report by an F.B.I. agent of one of the interviews; and the last is the transcript of a tape recording of a conversation between Friedman and one Dr. Victor Lands. The two interview memoranda and the \u201cLands transcript\u201d were disclosed to appellants after Friedman\u2019s cross-examination had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The two interview memoranda and the F.B.I. report are not Jencks Act statements. A written statement falls within that statute only if it is \u201cmade by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e)(1). The record shows that Friedman had not signed, adopted, or approved these three written reports. The government attorney who wrote the memoranda took no notes during the interviews and testified that the memoranda were his summaries, conclusions, and interpretations of what Friedman had said. It does not appear that the F.B.I. report differs in these respects. The rationale of the Jencks Act is to provide the defense with material that could impeach a government witness. \u201cWe think it consistent with this legislative history, and with the generally restrictive terms of the statutory provision, to require that summaries of an oral statement which evidence substantial selection of material, or which were prepared after the interview without the aid of complete notes, and hence rest on the memory of the agent, are not to be produced.\u201d Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 352-353, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 1225, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959). <em>See also </em>Campbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963); Rosenberg v. United States, 360 U.S. 367, 369, 79 S.Ct. 1231, 3 L.Ed.2d 1304 (1959); Wilke v. United States, 422 F.2d 1298, 1299 (9 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">The Lands transcript presents a more difficult question of construing the Jencks Act, a problem which we find unnecessary to resolve in this case.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Assuming for the purposes of argument that it should have been disclosed, we find that the untimely disclosure here was not prejudicial to appellants. Disclosures are required by the Jencks Act only for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 345, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959); United States v. Harris, 458 F.2d 670, 677 (5 Cir. 1972); <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 888, 93 S.Ct. 195, 34 L.Ed.2d 145 (1972). The material in the Lands transcript could not have been used to impeach Friedman\u2019s testimony on direct examination. Though a question of inconsistency perhaps did arise with Friedman\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, appellants did then have the transcript. Indeed Friedman was questioned about it on reeross-examination.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Scaglione, 446 F.2d 182, 184 (5 Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 941, 92 S.Ct. 284, 30 L.Ed.2d 254 (1971). The prosecution is obligated to disclose to the defense statements falling within the Jencks Act regardless of anyone\u2019s perception of the utility of the statements for impeachment. But if, upon review, a failure to disclose appears clearly to be harmless and is not a willful avoidance and egregious dereliction of the prosecutor\u2019s statutory obligation, then a court need not invoke the drastic remedies of striking testimony or calling a mistrial as provided by 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(d). <em>Cf. </em>United States v. American Radiator &amp; Stand. San. Corp., 433 F.2d 174, 203 (3 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 928, 28 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971); Pierce v. United States, 414 F.2d 163, 169 (5 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 435, 24 L.Ed.2d 425 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">IX.. <em>The Lands Transcript</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The Lands transcript is a transciption of a tape-recorded conversation between Maurice Friedman and one Dr. Victor Lands in 1967. During that talk, Friedman said in reference to the attempt to secure a Nevada gambling license for VFI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">\u201cThere are thirty-two people who have invested three and a half million dollars coming before this Commission, all of whom have been approved at least by a majority of this three-man Board. I told you that we feel pretty good except that our lawyer is very, very nervous, and he understands through the grapevine that we are going to have one hell of a time \u2014 the thirty-two of us. The Mafia, Casa [sic] Nostra \u2014 everything\u2019s going to come out. This is a public hearing. The press will know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">On cross-examination Friedman testified that he had stated in 1967 that there were hidden interests in VFI. The court then ordered the prosecution to disclose the Lands transcript. With the jury absent, Friedman verified the accuracy of the transcript. He said that in using the terms \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nos-tra\u201d he was referring to appellants Zer-illi and Polizzi. He also testified that he was referring to hidden interests in VFI when he said to Lands \u201ceverything\u2019s going to come out.\u201d Upon objection by the defense, the transcript was not admitted as evidence, but the court did permit testimony about the Lands conversation. The court, in an understandable effort to avoid any possible prejudice to appellants Zerilli and Poliz-zi, ordered Friedman not to use the terms \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nostra\u201d in his testimony before the jury. On redirect examination, Friedman testified that he had mentioned to Lands that Zerilli and Polizzi held hidden interests in VFI. On recross-examination Friedman admitted that in the Lands conversation he had not used the words \u201chidden interests\u201d nor referred specifically to any of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">Although the trial court clearly had the best of motivations in its handling of the Lands transcript question, preventing prejudice to appellants from the use of the terms \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nostra,\u201d it did commit error. Because of the vagueness of the terms used, the probative value of the Lands transcript in this case was insubstantial and was clearly outweighed by the possible prejudice arising from the terms \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nostra\u201d and, in an attempt to eliminate that possibility, by the danger of allowing testimony deviating from and therefore misrepresenting the actual terms used in the transcript. The court thus should not have admitted any testimony referring to the Lands transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Appellants argue that they were seriously prejudiced by this error. They characterize this episode as a purposeful distortion of the Lands transcript, a falsification of the record, which resulted in the admission of testimony which is conclusively demonstrated to be false by the transcript itself and admitted to be false by the witness. We disagree. The trial court did not order Friedman to substitute \u201cZerilli\u201d and \u201cPolizzi\u201d for \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nostra.\u201d Friedman was instructed only not to use the latter terms. At the most the witness may have misunderstood the court as suggesting such a substitution.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Lands transcript did not contradict Friedman\u2019s testimony, as appellants argue. Nor did it confirm that testimony, as the government urges. The Lands transcript and Friedman\u2019s testimony were simply not expressly inconsistent. Friedman could, as he did in the absence of the jury, have commented on what he meant by some of the terms he had used in talking to Lands. If he had been permitted to say to the jury that, in using \u201cMafia\u201d and \u201cCosa Nos-tra\u201d, he was referring to Zerilli and Pol-izzi, his testimony would clearly have had a strong impact on the jury adverse to appellants. As it was, his testimony was less precise on this point<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and was heavily qualified on recross-examination.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> In light of the substantial evidence in the record supporting appellants\u2019 convictions, we do not find that the error in handling the Lands transcript was so prejudicial as to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-23\">We find that, in light of all of the evidence of record, appellants also did not suffer prejudice from the government\u2019s argument to the jury concerning the Lands transcript, and that the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s request for a reading of the testimony about the Lands conversation was not an abuse of its discretion.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> United States v. Baxter, 492 F.2d 150, 175 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. De Palma, 414 F.2d 394, 396-397 (9 Cir. 1969), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>396 U.S. 1046, 90 S.Ct. 697, 24 L.Ed.2d 690 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">X. <em>Concealment of Prosecution Promises of Leniency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Appellants contend that the prosecution failed to disclose its agreements with or promises of leniency to its key witness, Maurice Friedman, as required by Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Friedman, serving prison sentences concurrently for three federal convictions, had his sentences modified after appellants\u2019 convictions and was released from prison. The prosecution did disclose a promise to Friedman that his testimony in this case would be called to the attention of the Parole Board, but maintained that no other promises were made.

Appellants have contended in their briefs that the revision of this section effective July 1, 1967, should be applied. They did not press this point at oral argument. We find their contention untenable. Although YFI\u2019s license was not issued until July 5, 1967, to be effective July 27, 1967, the Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission during the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>in question testified that VFI had completed all the formal requirements for a license by June 28, 1967, and that it had a right to a license on that date. VFI itself had requested that the license be effective as of July 27, 1967. There is no indication that appellants made any attempt to comply with the new, revised- statute, which included reporting requirements in many ways more stringent than those in the old statute. <em>See </em>N.R.S. \u00a7 463.-520. Nor is there any indication that the Board sought to require appellants to comply with the new statute. Thus the Board necessarily interpreted the statutes to mean that the old statute rather than the new statute governed applications completed before the new statute went into effect. Such an administrative interpretation is entitled to great weight. See footnote 12, <em>infra. </em>Moreover, appellants apparently acquiesced in this interpretation. In these circumstances, the trial court applied the correct statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. The record reveals that the Nevada authorities sought in this case to go \u201cbehind\u201d the nominal officers and shareholders and conducted a vigorous investigation to ascertain who controlled VFI. The Court gives weight to the manner in which the Nevada gaming authorities have construed the statutes under which they operate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\">. Two other theories put forward by the government fail. One involves \u201cpiercing the corporate veil.\u201d The government argues in its brief that the Nevada statutes \u201cprovide the gaming authorities with the necessary authority to go behind the corporate license to <em>determine who in fact </em>is controlling the corporation which was granted the gaming license\u201d (emphasis in original). That argument is foreclosed by the trial court\u2019s instruction, to which the government did not object, quoted in footnote 6, <em>supra. </em>Although that interpretation of N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160(1) (a) was not the only one possible, it is not an unreasonable construction. This Court accepts it as the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">The other theory is that N.R.S. \u00a7 463.160 (1) requires that anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a gambling enterjjrise must be licensed. That statute, however, requires only that licenses must be procured as required by the law. N.R.S. \u00a7 463.170(2) indicates that a corporation can receive and hold a license itself and that those persons with interests in the corporation must only be <em>qualified to he </em>licensed. <em>See also </em>Berman v.

See jj. 8987.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-24\">\u201cThe Court: My purpose here now is to ask you some questions about the case. Do you think that anything happened outside of this courtroom during the trial of this case that in any way influenced the verdict in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-25\">\u201cJuror Palmer: Well, I will put it this way, not that I know of. As far as myself is concerned, no, but as to others I am not too sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-27\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.

Do I make myself clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-8\">\u201cThe Court: Tes, I think so. What you are saying is that during a lunch hour that there was some discussion of the evidence, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-9\">\u201cJuror Palmer: I was told somewhere that that come out in the local papers during the trial, and I think that was discussed during the lunch hour between some of the members.

It was, shall I say, outlawed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-17\">\u201cThe Court:' Do you think that anybody did consider that in the deliberations in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-18\">\u201cJuror Palmer : I don\u2019t believe so, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-19\">\u201cThe Court: Any comment or any discussion about it in the deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-20\">\u201cJuror Palmer: No, sir, nothing.

The recent decision cited by appellants, United States v.

Appellants contend that the federal judges who modified Friedman\u2019s sentences violated Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Appellants\u2019 position is unmeritorious. This Court, in a decision construing Rule 35 in its form prior to amendment in 1966, ruled that it required a motion for reduction to be made within 60 days and not final action on the motion within that time. Leyvas v. United States, 371 F.2d 714, 719 (9 Cir. 1967). The 1966 amendment increased the time limit to 120 days. There is authority for appellants\u2019 position that the 120-day limit also applies to judicial action. <em>Cf. </em>8A J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 35.02 [2], pp. 35-6, n. 10.1 (2d ed. 1973). We do not feel, however, that the amendment necessitates a change in the <em>Leyvas </em>ruling. <em>See </em>Irizzary v. United States, 58 F.R.D. 65, 67 (D.Mass.1972) : \u201cThe 120 day period is technically not the time within which the motion may be made, but is rather the time within which the court may act. * * * However, as a matter of practice, the requirement has been interpreted to permit a court to act upon a motion as long as the motion is made within that period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b960-16\">. The evidence consists of the government\u2019s stipulations in continuing the motions for modification and the modifications after appellants\u2019 convictions, a statement during a post-trial hearing in this case by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nissen that he had told Friedman\u2019s attorney that Friedman\u2019s cooperation would be called to the attention of \u201cthe court or whatever appropriate authority it would be\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript, Vol. 51, p. 10,173), and the affidavit of Friedman\u2019s former custodian that Friedman had told him that the government had said that Friedman would be released after testifying in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b960-17\">.

Neither proposition has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">\u201cThe distinctiveness between a substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it is a postulate of our law. \u2018It has been long and consistently recognized by the Court that the commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct offenses.\u2019 \u201d Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593, 81 S.Ct. 321, 325, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961), <em>quoting </em>Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 643, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Accordingly, unless there is specific language to the contrary, Congress presumably intended to permit punishment as separate offenses of both the substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit it. 364 U.S. at 594-595. There is no such language here, in either the statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or legislative history.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Turning to the second proposition, the language of the statute seems unambiguous. The offense defined is an act of travel or use of an interstate facility, with the requisite intent, plus subsequent performance of another act of the kind specified in the statute. Appellants argue, however, that the legislative history indicates that section 1952 was directed at a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d and therefore various acts of travel in furtherance of a single \u201cunlawful activity,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(b), should be held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>constitute only one crime. But \u201cthe \u2018course of conduct\u2019 referred to in the legislative history of Section 1952 refers to the nature of the business promoted or facilitated \u2014 and not to the essence of the federal offense, which is \u2018travel.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Teemer, 214 F.Supp. 952, 958 (N.D.W.Va.1963),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>quoted with approval </em>in Katz v. United States, 369 F.2d 130, 135 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">No appellate court appears to have discussed the proper unit of prosecution under section 1952,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but similar federal statutes making it a crime to use interstate transportation or communications facilities in aid of illegal purposes have been construed to permit prosecution of each use of such facilities as a separate offense. <em>See, e. g., </em>Sanders v. United States, 415 F.2d 621, 626-627 (5th Cir. 1969); Katz v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Mitchell v. United States, 142 F.2d 480 (10th Cir. 1944). The cases upon which appellants rely (Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 63 S.Ct. 99, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942); United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952); Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955), and Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971)) are inapposite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">In view of the plain import of the language of section 1952, the absence of any contrary indication in the legislative history,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>given comparable statutes over the years, we conclude that each act of travel may be treated as a separate violation of section 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">XII. <em>Venue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Appellants raise two venue-related claims. They contend venue was improperly laid in the Central District of California as to some of the substantive counts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They also contend the trial court abused its discretion by denying motions under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21(b) to transfer the proceedings to Detroit or Las Vegas.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Appellants argue venue was improperly laid as to certain substantive counts for two reasons. First, relying on United States v. Bozza, 365 F.2d 206 (2d Cir. 1966), they argue that the act of carrying on, or distributing the proceeds of, unlawful activity, required to complete an offense under section 1952, did not occur in the Central District of California, though travel with the requisite intent did. Second, they argue that some of the defendants in each count were charged not with themselves traveling but with aiding and abetting the travel of others. Again, appellants rely on Bozza: \u201cCongress seems to have been content with venue where the defendants\u2019 own accessorial acts were committed or where the crime occurred, without providing still another where the acces-sorial acts of agents took place.\u201d 365 F.2d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">But in <em>Bozza, </em>the offense related to the offense of receiving stolen stamps. As the <em>Bozza </em>court pointed out, this is not \u201ca continuing offense which is \u2018held, for venue purposes to have been committed wherever the wrongdoer roamed\u2019 .\u201d, <em>(quoting </em>Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, 634, 81 S.Ct. 358, 5 L.Ed.2d 340 (1961)) but rather is a \u201c \u2018single act which occurs at one time and at one place in which only it may be tried, although preparation for its commission may take place elsewhere\u2019 \u201d <em>(quoting </em>Reass v. United States, 99 F.2d 752, 754 (4th Cir. 1938)). 365 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">In contrast, the offense under section 1952 is one \u201cinvolving . transportation in interstate commerce,\u201d which by express provision of the general venue statute, \u201cis a continuing offense and . . . may be . . . prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce . . . moves.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a). <em>See </em>United States v. Guinn, 454 F.2d 29, 33 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Barnard, 490 F.2d 907, 911 (9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">Thus, a defendant can be prosecuted for traveling in violation of section 1952, or for aiding and abetting such travel, in any district in which the travel occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">Whether the proceedings should have been transferred is an entirely separate question. Rule 21(b), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, permits transfers \u201c[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice.\u201d Since the decision as to whether to grant such a transfer \u201cmust largely rest in the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge,\u201d Wagner v. United States, 416 F.2d 558, 562 (9th Cir. 1969), our review is limited to whether that discretion was abused. We conclude it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Appellants\u2019 first motion requested a transfer to Detroit; Las Vegas was also mentioned as a proper venue for trial, but the motion did not request transfer there. In support of their motion, appellants pointed out that most of the appellants and many of the anticipated defense witnesses lived in the Detroit area, and that much of the conduct relevant to the charges occurred there. But relevant conduct had occurred in many places, including the Los Angeles area and nearby Las Vegas, where the business enterprise that defendants allegedly sought to control was located. Nevada law was important to the case, as appellants argued. The relevance of this circumstance is obscure; in any event, it scarcely favored trial in Detroit as against Los Angeles. Both government and defense witnesses were widely dispersed, but 10 of the 31 persons on the government\u2019s list of anticipated witnesses resided in the Los Angeles area. The criminal calendar in the federal district court in Detroit was seriously delayed; the Los Angeles calendar, on the other hand, would permit the early trial for which appellants had repeatedly called. This consideration, admittedly relevant, <em>see </em>Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company, 376 U.S. 240, 243-244, 84 S.Ct. 769, 11 L.Ed.2d 674 (1964), appears to have swung the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">On the basis of the information before the trial court, the decision on the first motion seems entirely reasonable. Appellants\u2019 residence was a factor to be considered, but was not controlling. Platt v. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company, <em>supra, </em>376 U.S. at 245-246; Jones v. Gasch, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 404 F.2d 1231, 1240 n.43 (1967). The considerations for and against a transfer seemed fairly balanced, or at least not so clearly weighted against Los Angeles as the trial forum as to overcome the substantial interest in avoiding the delay that would have followed transfer to Detroit\u2019s congested calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Appellants\u2019 main argument is not that the court abused its discretion in the balance it struck on the facts before it on the first motion. Rather, appellants assert that \u201cthe prosecution misrepresented to the court that numerous of its witnesses would be Los Angeles area residents, and that Detroit witnesses desired by appellants would be called by the prosecution itself, thereby obviating some of the prejudice to the defense of a distant trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">The trial judge was under no misapprehension regarding the Detroit witnesses when he ruled against the initial motion to transfer; the government had advised the court it did not intend to call more than one or two witnesses from Detroit. It is true that many of the Los Angeles witnesses on the government\u2019s first list disappeared from the second list, filed several months later. But it is hardly surprising that the prosecution\u2019s plans with respect to witnesses changed in the course of preparing this complex case for trial, particularly since government counsel who prepared the first list had been replaced by new government counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 forecasts regarding the number and residence of their witnesses turned out to be no more reliable than the government\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">Several months after denial of the initial transfer motion, both sides filed new witness lists. The prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>dropped most of its Los Angeles witnesses and added a number from Las Vegas. The defense renewed its motion for change of venue, this time pressing for transfer to Las Vegas. It appeared, however, that the condition of the criminal docket in Las Vegas was such that a reasonably speedy trial could not be obtained, whereas trial in Los Angeles was imminent. The trial court denied the renewed motion both on this ground and because the witnesses then expected to be called resided throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">This was not an abuse of discretion. It is proper <em>to </em>require a greater showing of inconvenience when a change of venue is sought late in proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the trial court observed, there was no \u201cideal place for the holding of this trial.\u201d Wherever the trial was held, both sides would bear significant transportation and lodging expenses. Moreover, most of the Las Vegas witnesses were government witnesses; since the government appeared willing to pay the expense of transporting them, it is hard to see how defendants would be more inconvenienced by trial in Los Angeles than in Las Vegas. The improbability of a speedy trial in Las Vegas was a factor entitled to great weight, especially since one defendant had already moved for dismissal on speedy trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">The motion for change of venue was renewed a third time, after yet another set of witness lists was filed. The trial judge reiterated his belief that only compelling reasons could justify transfer when trial was imminent. For the reasons stated, this final denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">XIII. <em>Giordano\u2019s Severance Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Appellant Giordano complains that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motions for severance under Rule 14, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, submitted both before and during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Denial of Giordano\u2019s pretrial severance motion was clearly correct. Although Giordano was indicted on only one count, that count charged conspiracy. For obvious reasons, a joint trial is particularly appropriate where conspiracy is charged. Davenport v. United States, 260 F.2d 591, 594 (9th Cir. 1958). <em>See </em>American Bar Association, Standards Related to Joinder and Severance 39 (Approved Draft 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\"> The government represented that Giordano was among the \u201cleaders\u201d in the unlawful scheme and furnished the court with a summary of the evidence it expected to offer linking Giordano to the eohspiracy. Moreover, the government stated that a separate trial would be substantially as long as a joint one, since a full exposition of the entire scheme was necessary to establish the significance of Giordano\u2019s separate conduct. On this record the advantages and economy of a joint trial clearly outweighed the remote possibility of unwarranted prejudice. <em>See </em>United States v. Donaway, 447 F.2d 940, 943 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">The balance may not have been so clear when Giordano moved for severance during trial. Although there is no suggestion of bad faith, the evidence against Giordano did not entirely justify government counsel\u2019s optimistic forecast. Nonetheless, there was sufficient evidence other than acts and statements of co-conspirators to show that Giordano participated in the conspiracy. Since this is so, it is difficult to understand how Giordano could have benefited from severance, for evidence of the acts and statements of the other defendants pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>suant to and in furtherance of the conspiracy would have been admissible against Giordano if tried alone.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> United States v. Kenny, 462 F.2d 1205, 1218 (3d Cir. 1972); <em>see also </em>United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879, 901 (9th Cir. 1970). Moreover, as the government asserted, all or substantially all such evidence probably would have been introduced in a separate trial. It is possible that the government might have considered the time and effort required for a separate trial too great a price to pay for the conviction of Giordano alone, but loss of that possibility hardly demonstrates that Giordano was \u201cprejudiced by a joinder\u201d within the meaning of Rule 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The trial judge took great pains to protect Giordano\u2019s right to an independent evaluation by the jury of the evidence against him. Twice during voir dire the court admonished the jury that each defendant \u2014 naming them, including Giordano \u2014 was entitled to be judged as an individual. No less than six times during instructions to the jury the court stressed the importance of separate determinations of each defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the basis of the evidence pertaining to the particular defendant. Several times the court warned that association with participants in a eonspiracy does not prove that a defendant was a member of the conspiracy. This jury\u2019s ability and determination to make discriminating judgments is evidenced by the fact that it did not convict one of the most active participants in the conspiracy, defendant Polizzi, on one of the nine substantive counts on which he was charged. Obviously, this jury did not render a mass judgment. United States v. Berlin, 472 F.2d 13, 15 (9th Cir. 1973). There may be cases in which even careful jury instructions cannot cure the possibility of prejudice by association inherent in conspiracy trials,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but this was not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Giving due recognition to the somewhat stricter showing required to justify severance when the trial has been partially or wholly completed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that Giordano\u2019s motions for severance during trial were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">XIV. <em>Giordano\u2019s Requested Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Giordano rested at the close of the government\u2019s case-in-ehief. He asked for a jury instruction that no evidence introduced thereafter could be considered against him. The request was denied. Giordano\u2019s co-defendants then testified in their own defense. In arguing the case to the jury, the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>drew implications from this testimony adverse to Giordano.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Giordano\u2019s decision not to offer evidence in his own behalf preserved his right to a review of the denial of his motion for acquittal on the basis of the government\u2019s evidence alone. <em>See </em>United States v. Figueroa-Paz, 468 F.2d 1055, 1058 (9th Cir. 1972). But this is not to say, if denial of the motion to acquit was proper, that the jury was not entitled to consider <em>all </em>of the evidence, including that presented by Giordano\u2019s co-defendants, in determining Giordano\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\"> Evidence offered in defense in the trial of a single defendant is available for all purposes, and the rule is the same in a joint trial of multiple defendants \u2014 evidence offered by one may support the conviction of the others. <em>See </em>Rickey v. United States, 242 F.2d 583, 586 (5th Cir. 1957); Maupin v. United States, 225 F.2d 680, 682 (10th Cir. 1955). This court has held that the same rule is applicable even to a defendant who has rested at the close of the government\u2019s case, and an instruction of the kind sought by Giordano is therefore properly refused. Brown v. United States, 56 F.2d 997, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 1932).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">There is a substantial reason for the rule. One purpose of a joint trial of defendants allegedly involved in a single scheme is to facilitate evaluation by the jury of the evidence against each defendant in light of the entire course of conduct. \u201cSuch procedure not only increases the speed and efficiency of the administration of justice but also serves to give the jury a complete overall view of the whole scheme and helps them to see how each piece fits into the pattern.\u201d Rakes v. United States, 169 F.2d 739, 744 (4th Cir. 1948). <em>See </em>ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance 39 (Approved Draft 1968). This purpose of joinder would be frustrated as to a particular defendant if he could bar consideration as to him of some of the relevant evidence by resting before that evidence was introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">As we emphasized in <em>Brown, </em>a defendant who rests his case may nonetheless cross-examine or introduce evidence to impeach or contradict a co-defendant who testifies thereafter. <em>See also </em>United States v. Zambrano, 421 F.2d 761, 763 (3d Cir. 1970). In the present case, as in <em>Brown, </em>there was no request to cross-examine the co-defendants or to admit rebuttal evidence. It is even clearer here than in <em>Brown </em>that \u201cif such request had been made, it would have been granted,\u201d 56 F.2d 1000, since the trial judge asked Giordano\u2019s attorney after each defense witness whether he had any questions to ask by way of cross-examination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">XV. <em>Sufficiency of the </em>Evidence\u2014 <em>Giordano</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">We consider Giordano\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient as to him separately from the same contention as to other defendants. \u2022 The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>against Giordano was the weakest; and, unlike other defendants, Giordano did not waive his right to review of the motion to acquit made at the close of the government\u2019s case. For the latter reason, we consider only the evidence produced against Giordano in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\"> As Giordano points out, the government offered no direct evidence of his participation in the conspiracy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But \u201ccircumstantial evidence is not inherently less probative than direct evidence,\u201d United States v. Nelson, 419 F.2d 1237, 1239 (9th Cir. 1969), and, in many conspiracy cases, is the only kind of evidence available. White v. United States, 394 F.2d 49, 51 (9th Cir. 1968). Thus, denial of the motion to acquit is subject to the same standard on review as it would be if there were direct evidence of guilt: whether \u201cjurors reasonably could decide that they would not hesitate to act in their own serious affairs upon factual assumptions as probable as the conclusion\u201d that Giordano participated in the conspiracy. United States v. Nelson, <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">The government\u2019s theory was that at Zerilli\u2019s solicitation Giordano arranged for the investment of $150,000 in VFI when the enterprise was in critical need of funds; that the investment was made through Sansone, a St. Louis real estate investor and bank director, acting as a \u201cfront\u201d; and that following the investment Giordano participated at various critical stages in the illegal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Some of the government\u2019s circumstantial evidence is described briefly in the margin.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Possibly the series of events disclosed by the evidence could be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>plained as coincidence, or as normal contacts among friends. On the other hand, \u201c[t]he jury undoubtedly could have found these events too interlocked to constitute coincidence\u201d (United States v. White, <em>supra, 394 F.2d </em>at <em>53); it </em>could have drawn from the events the inferences suggested by the prosecution \u2014that Giordano was brought into the conspiracy at least as early as June; that he arranged for the investment of $150,000 in VFI through Sansone; and that the purpose of Giordano\u2019s five trips to Las Vegas in 1967 was to watch over this hidden interest in VFI and participate in various key decisions. There comes a point when the innocent explanation is so much less likely than the culpable one that jurors properly could decide that a defendant in fact was acting in furtherance of the conspiracy and shared its illegal purpose. We believe that point was reached here as to Giordano.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Three legal arguments subsidiary to Giordano\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence should be mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">1. The government called Cus-umano and Sansone as witnesses. Both denied that Giordano was involved in a Cusumano loan to Sansone. Giordano argues that the government is bound by this testimony. But the notion that a party is bound by the testimony of every witness it calls is \u201clong discredited,\u201d Rodgers v. United States 402 F.2d 830, 833 (9th Cir. 1968), and is clearly not the law of this circuit. <em>See </em>cases cited in <em>Rodgers, </em>402 F.2d at 833, n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\"> Rodgers does hold that the government cannot rely on an inference when the <em>only </em>evidence presented by the government is inconsistent with the inference the government wishes drawn. However, <em>Rodgers </em>itself acknowledges that this does not \u201cmean that m every case where some of the government\u2019s evidence is arguably contrary to an inference that it wishes to have the jury draw from other evidence, the inference may not be drawn.\u201d 402 F.2d at 834. <em>See also </em>United States v. Payne, 467 F.2d 828, 831 (5th Cir. 1972). Further, in <em>Rodgers </em>the evidence inconsistent with the desired inference was presented by a disinterested witness and was embodied in an uncontested document. Here, Cusumano and Sansone were interested witnesses with motives to dissemble about Giordano\u2019s role, and the prosecution presented a great deal of other evidence, albeit circumstantial, connecting Giordano with the loan. It may be reasonable to require the prosecution to do more than rely on a general inference to counteract its own uneon-tested documentary evidence, but an inference specifically supported by other evidence is not barred simply because it is inconsistent with testimony of witnesses who were called by the government but have every reason to protect the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">2. Giordano argues that telephone company records showing calls between telephone numbers assigned to Giordano and Zerilli were inadmissible because there was no direct evidence as to who participated or what was said, citing Laughlin v. United States, 226 F.Supp. 112, 113 (D.D.C.1964). But this case held only that such records were insufficient corroboration in a perjury case, where \u201cdirect and positive evidence of falsity of defendant's sworn statement\u201d is required, and \u201ccircumstantial evidence thereof is insufficient, no matter how persuasive.\u201d 226 F.Supp. at 114. The Court of Appeals held such records admissible in a conspiracy case, distinguishing the district court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>in the earlier perjury case because of the high degree of corroboration necessary in a perjury case. Laughlin v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 385 F.2d 287, 293 (1967).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Giordano also contends the government cannot rely upon inference to establish the contents of the telephone calls, citing Osborne v. United States 371 F.2d 913, 927-929 (9th Cir. 1967). But in <em>Osborne, </em>each telephone call was the subject of a separate count charging a separate violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, \u201cFraud by wire, radio, or television.\u201d Proof of the contents of the particular telephone call was therefore crucial to conviction on the particular count. In the present case, the exact content of each telephone call is not crucial to conviction; the telephone calls themselves are not the subject of the charge. Proof of their occurrence, especially their timing and frequency, is merely circumstantial evidence tending, with other circumstantial evidence, to show Giordano\u2019s participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">3. Giordano makes the same contention with respect to proof regarding his trips to Las Vegas \u2014 that no inference can be drawn from the fact that they occurred \u2014 and we reject it for the same reasons. He also argues that hotel records evidencing his stays at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas in 1967 should not have been admitted because other contemporaneous hotel records were destroyed \u201cin accordance with routine hotel policy\u201d prior to the return of the indictment in 1971. The argument is that if the indictment had been returned earlier the records might have been in existence and might have contained exculpatory or explanatory evidence demonstrating that Giordano\u2019s visit had an innocent purpose. Giordano cites United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The contention is frivolous. The Sixth Amendment does not apply to pre-indictment delay, 404 U.S. at 313, and Giordano has not shown that the delay involved here violated the Due Process Clause. 404 U.S. at 324-326. We need not consider, therefore, whether suppression of evidence would be a proper remedy if a due process violation had occurred. <em>Cf. </em>Strunk v. United States, 412 U.S. 434, 93 S.Ct. 2260, 37 L.Ed.2d 56 (1973).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\">. The argument does not apply to Emprise Corporation, Rooks, or Giordano, who were each charged and convicted only of conspiracy. The other four defendants were each convicted and sentenced for conspiracy and more than one substantive count. The jail terms were concurrent, but separate fines were imposed on each defendant on the conspiracy count and at least one substantive count. Therefore, each of these defendants was affected adversely by the separate convictions, and the current sentence doctrine is not applicable. <em>See </em>Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); United States v. Tucker, 435 F.2d 1017 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. <em>See </em>pages 869-871 <em>supra </em>for a discussion of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. There is no constitutional bar to separate convictions and sentences for the substantive offenses defined by \u00a7 1952 and for conspiracy to commit that offense. Nolan v. United States, 423 F.2d 1031, 1047-1048 (10th Cir. 1970). \u201cOnly if the substantive offense and the conspiracy are identical does a conviction for both constitute double jeopardy.\u201d Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 11, 74 S.Ct. 358, 364, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954). An agreement or common course of conduct among two or more persons is not an essential element of the substantive offense under \u00a7 1952: The travel required by \u00a7 1952(a) might be accomplished by only one person, and the \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d required by \u00a7 1952(b) (1) also might be conducted by an individual. True, both the legislative history <em>(see </em>United States v. Roselli, 432 F.2d 879, 886 n. 8 (9th Cir. 1970)), and case law <em>(see, e. g., </em>United States v. Donaway, 447 F.2d 940, 944 (9th Cir. 1971)) indicate that \u00a7 1952 is not directed against casual and isolated instances of illegal conduct. But neither suggests that the substantive crime requires the participation of a group of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">Further, the conspiracy alleged here is not merely an agreement to violate state law but an agreement to travel interstate with the intent to promote certain violations of state law. It is distinct from the joint activity that might be involved in running the business enterprise mentioned in \u00a7 1952 even if the \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d language were construed to require more than a sole proprietoiship.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">Nor is there any constitutional bar to conviction for both conspiracy and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, the aiding and abetting statute underlying the conviction of some of the defendants on some of the substantive counts. United States v. Valencia, 492 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1974); Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 11-12, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. Judge Paul continued, 214 F.Supp. at 958: The phrase seems to refer to the fact that the Act was designed to attack an entrenched operation rather than a sporadic poker game or a floating crap grame. No act of travel is to be deemed unlawful unless the enterprise is a continuing one; but once the continuity of the enterprise is established, any act of travel, with the requisite intent and the subsequent participation, would seem to be a separate offense, even if the travel is a daily or regular event, and thus, perhaps, a \u201ccontinuing\u201d activity. If this is the plain and literal meaning of the Act, it is within the power of Congress to make each act of travel a unit of prosecution. See, e. g., Mitchell v. United States, 142 F.2d 480 (10th Cir., 1944); and this, in spite of the distinguishable cases of United States v. Universal CIT Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952), and Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b962-8\">. Separate convictions and sentences for individual acts of travel in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 have been affirmed without discussion of the issue raised here. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. McGowan, 423 F.2d 413, 416 (4th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b962-10\">. The issue in <em>Braverman </em>was whether a single agreement to commit several criminal acts constituted one or several conspiracies. In the present case only one conspiracy was charged. <em>Bell </em>held that a single act of transporting two women interstate at the same time was one violation of the Mann Act. In the instant case, each substantive charge involved a separate act of travel on a different day. There was no attempt to carve several offenses out of a single transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\"><em>Universal C.I.T. </em>is somewhat closer on its facts. As the Court pointed out, however, there was specific evidence in the legislative history of the Fair Labor Standards Act that that Congress did not intend each breach of the statutory duty with respect to minimum wages and overtime owed to each employee during each work week to be treated as a separate crime. 344 U.S. at 222-224. Also, the language of the Act was ambiguous as to the proper unit of prosecution. If not construed to limit prosecution to an entire course of conduct, no limit at all was imposed on the number of crimes that could be charged. Here, the statute is unambiguous; it is explicitly directed at acts of travel and use of interstate facilities, and the prosecution can charge only as many separate crimes as there were separate acts of travel or use of interstate facilities. Where the command of the statute as to the unit of the offense is clear, there is no room for application of the so-called \u201crule of lenity\u201d of the <em>Bell </em>case. <em>See </em>Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961). It is true, as appellants point out, that the Supreme Court applied the \u201crule of lenity\u201d to \u00a7 1952 in support of the ruling in <em>Rewis, </em>401 U.S. at 812, that interstate travel by patrons of a gambling establishment did not violate the Act. But the Court premised this application upon a determination that there was an ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 1952 relating to persons covered. 401 U.S. at 811. There is no such ambiguity with respect to the unit of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b962-15\">. Congress may well have concluded there was a separate social interest in deterring each act of travel in furtherance of an illegal enterprise : each successive trip may increase the success of the illegal activity, and a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>not to make a given trip for fear of additional penal consequences could therefore limit the harm to society \u00a7 1952 is intended to prevent. <em>Cf. </em>Irby v. United States, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 17, 390 F.2d 432, 434 (1967) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\">. Appellants do not attack venue on the conspiracy count. \u201c[A]n overt act committed in the course of a conspiracy which occurs in a district gives rise to jurisdiction to prosecute the conspirators in that district.\u201d United States v. Barnard, 490 F.2d 907, 910 (9th Cir. 1973). Several consequential overt acts are alleged to have occurred in the Central District of California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b964-5\">. A situation could arise where the prosecution\u2019s representations to the judge were so far from the mark that they could only be treated as submitted in bad faith to improperly prevent a change of venue. In such a situation, we would look beyond the information presented to the trial judge in determining whether denial of transfer was within the judge\u2019s discretion, since the trial judge has a responsibility to pierce the prosecution\u2019s representations and assure that they are made in good faith. And, if the transfer were initially denied on the basis of prosecution information later shown to have been submitted in bad faith, the trial judge would be obligated to view a renewed motion as if it were an original one, without requiring the especially strong showing that may be required to support a later motion. <em>See </em>note 10 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\">. Rule 22, Fed.R.Crim.Pr., provides that \u201c[a] <em>motion to </em>transfer under these rules may be made at or before arraignment or at such other times as the court or these rules may prescribe,\u201d suggesting that the court may decline to entertain a late motion. See United States v. Tremont, 351 F.2d 144, 146 (6th Cir. 1965); Cagnina v. United States, 223 F.2d 149, 154 (5th Cir. 1955). Here, there has been a change in the situation since the initial venue decision. Nonetheless, to avoid the obvious opportunity for abuse it was proper to require a greater showing of inconvenience when trial was imminent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b966-5\">. Giordano stresses tlie fact that a very small proportion of the trial transcript relates directly to him; the government engages in elaborate analyses which, it claims, show that Giordano was not as peripheral to the proceedings as he claims. We do not consider, however, that the exact quantity of evidence relat- . ing to a conspiracy defendant personally is important in determining whether severance should have been granted. Although there are some cases which take this factor into account <em>(see </em>United States v. Branker, 395 F.2d 881, 888 (2d Cir. 1968); United States v. Donaway, 447 F.2d 940, 943 (9th Cir. 1971)), they .concern defendants against whom conspiracy charges were dismissed during trial. Dismissal of a conspiracy charge does not mean that severance is required. Schaffer v. United States, 362 U.S. 511, 516, 80 S.Ct. 945, 4 L.Ed.2d 921 (1960). It does, however, shift the balance of factors to be considered, <em>see Schaffer, supra; </em>a separate trial would not entail a replay of the joint conspiracy trial, and much of the evidence admitted in the joint trial could not be considered against the defendant no longer charged with conspiracy. In the instant case, most of the evidence not directed to Giordano personally was nonetheless admissible against him, so that the proportion of personally oriented evidence is not important.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b966-11\">. <em>See </em>Krulewitch v.

Friedman, a co-conspirator who testified for the government, and Feil, another witness who testified directly to the illegal involvement of some defendants, offered no evidence implicating Giordano; none of the four government witnesses who might, on the prosecution\u2019s theory, have known of Giordano\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, directly implicated him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b968-6\">. Giordano and Zerilli were close friends. Giordano lived in St. Louis, Zerilli in Detroit. There were telephone calls between Giordano\u2019s home and office and Zerilli\u2019s, as well as other calls charged to Zerilli\u2019s credit card and placed to Giordano\u2019s numbers, at various key times in the course of events between June and November, 1967. Giordano knew the Cusumanos and the Sansones in St. Louis. The Sansones did not know Zerilli.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The need for additional money, which resulted in the issuance of the Class C debentures Sansone later bought, developed in early June. There were calls between telephones listed to Giordano and Zerilli at that time. Zerilli came to St. Louis for two days on June 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The Sansones began gathering money for their VFI investment after Zerilli visited St. Louis, but before the Glass C debentures in which they invested were officially issued. They could have learned about the investment possibility only from a person having knowledge of the inner operations of VFI.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">In early August, Giordano repaid an overdue loan to the Cusumano family trust. Less than three weeks later, Sansone took out a loan from the same trust. This loan was part of tlie money Sansone eventually invested in VFI. The Sansone loan was the only business transaction ever consummated between Sansone and the Cusumano family. It was unsecured. Although the VFI debentures in which San-sone invested yielded 4% interest, the loan from Cusumano was at <em>7%, </em>an anomaly for which Sansone had no convincing explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">The Sansone investment was withdrawn less than 60 days after it was made, after Sansone was told by the Nevada Gaming Commission that he would have to apply for a gaming license, disclose the source of the invested funds, and provide fingerpints. Sansone testified that he withdrew only because, \u201cI never anticipated that I would have to be classified as a gambler when I bought the debenture.\u201d But from the outset the Sansones admittedly knew they were investing in a gambling casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">Giordano made five trips to Las Vegas between July and November, 1967. The Gior-danos have no business interests or relatives in Las Vegas, and Giordano was not a gambler. Each of these trips was closely preceded, or followed, or both, by telephone contact between Giordano telephones and Zerilli telephones or phone calls charged to Zerilli. Each trip coincided with an important event in the unlawful scheme. For example, trips in September and November coincided with the beginning and end of the $150,000 investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">On September 12 there was a series of phone calls between Zerilli\u2019s home and Gior-dano\u2019s home and business. The next day, San-sone marshaled the entire $150,000. On that same day there was a call from a Zerilli telephone to Giordano\u2019s telephone. On September 14 Sansone flew to Las Vegas with the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>to make the investment. He checked into the Frontier Hotel. Sixteen minutes later, Gior-dano checked into the Dunes Hotel. Four days later, Sansone deposited the $150,000 in VFI\u2019s account, received the debentures, and left Las Vegas. Giordano departed the following day. In November, a telephone call to Giordano was charged to Zerilli on the same day the Nevada Gaming Commission\u2019s letter was sent to Sansone. Giordano went to Las Vegas on November 9; Zerilli arrived and cheeked into the Frontier Hotel under an assumed name on November 10; and Sansone arrived on November 11 to complete the withdrawal of the $150,000 investment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b970-7\">.

The facts are these: Before March 1, 1970, there was a New York corporation called High Park Corporation, which owned all of the shares of another New York corporation, Emprise Corporation (Old Emprise). On March 1, 1970, Old Emprise merged into its parent, High Park Corporation. On March 17, 1970, High Park Corporation amended its corporate name to Emprise Corporation (New Emprise).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">The February 26, 1971, indictment in this case charged \u201cEmprise Corporation\u201d as a defendant. In July, 1971, it became clear that this meant Old Em-prise, and, on September 9, 1971, the district court dismissed as to Old Em-prise for want of personal jurisdiction over it. The government filed an information against New Emprise. New Emprise moved to dismiss, but this motion was denied, and New Emprise was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1952 and was fined $10,000. The charged offense was committed by Old Emprise, before the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>The question is whether the surviving corporation of a merger, here New Em-prise, can be held criminally liable for acts committed by a former subsidiary constituent corporation (Old Emprise) which later merged into the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-3\">Appellants argue that in this federal ease we must apply federal law, regardless of what the state law may be, and that under federal law only the constituent corporation, not the surviving corporation, can be prosecuted. Of course we apply federal law. That, however, does not answer the question. Federal courts, in deciding federal cases, often borrow otherwise applicable state law as the federal law to be applied in a federal case when doing so is reasonable and there is no contrary federal policy. Here, Old Emprise and New Emprise are New York corporations. We can think of no federal policy that would prohibit our borrowing New York law in deciding whether New Emprise is liable for a crime committed by Old Emprise. Neither can appellants, beyond mere assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\"> Under the Constitution, the federal government is not expressly granted the power to form corporations; it may do so only under the necessary and proper clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., </em>McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 4 L.Ed. 579. The result is that nearly all corporations in the United States are creatures of state law. This also means that when Federal statutes refer to \u201ccorporations\u201d they necessarily include within that word corporations created under state law. Some Federal statutes are expressly applicable to state created corporations. <em>See, e. g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7; Melrose Distillers v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 271, 272, 79 S.Ct. 763, 3 L.Ed.2d 800. In this case New Emprise was convicted of violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1952. \u00a7 371 refers to \u201cpersons\u201d and \u00a7 1952 to \u201c [w] hoever.\u201d Under the Federal Rules of Construction, 1, U.S.C. \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">In determining the meaning of any Act \u00f3f Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise\u2014 <em>H</em></p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">* -x- -x- * -x- ti-</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">the words \u2018person\u2019 and \u2018whoever\u2019 include corporations * * * as well as individuals;</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">***** -X- \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">The term \u201ccorporations\u201d as used in 1 U. S.C. \u00a7 1 clearly includes corporations formed under state law. See Alamo Fence Company of Houston v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 179, 181. Nothing in the contexts of \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1952 indicates meanings for the terms \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cwhover\u201d other than those of 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Therefore, the existence and status of corporations charged under \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1952 should be determined by reference to the law of the state of their incorporation, unless the application of that law would conflict with federal policy. <em>Cf. </em>Melrose Distillers v. United States, <em>supra, </em>359 U.S. at 274. In this case, no such conflict exists, and New York law, therefore, will be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Convenience and common sense also point to the adoption of New York law as the federal law in this case, for the purpose of determining whether New Emprise is criminally liable. Both Old and New Emprise are artificial creations, wholly dependent on New York law for their existence. New York law defines their powers, rights and liabilities, prescribes their procedures, governs their continued existence, and defines the terms upon which mergers may occur and the effect to be given to mergers. These corporations were created under New York law by people, however, and any penalty imposed on them is, indirectly, a penalty imposed upon the people who own and control them. If New York law provides for the imposition of such a penalty for acts for which those people bear the ultimate responsibility, there is no good reason for relieving them of the penalty because it arises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>from federal law. See Alamo Fence Company of Houston v. United States, <em>supra, </em>240 F.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Under modern state corporation laws, a corporation once formed, in the absence of a provision limiting its juristic life, exists perpetually unless it is dissolved or its corporate character is annulled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is often said that the merger of a corporation into another is similar to the death of an individual, in that all current or future litigation by or against it is abated except insofar as the state of incorporation may continue its juristic life. Melrose Distillers v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 271, 272, 79 S.Ct. 763, 3 L.Ed.2d 800; Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, 1927, 273 U.S. 257, 259-260, 47 S.Ct. 391, 71 L.Ed. 634; United States v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 10 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 834, 836; United States v. Brakes, Inc., 157 F.Supp. 916, 918-919 (S.D.N.Y.1958); United States v. Cigarette Merchandisers Ass\u2019n, 136 F.Supp. 214, 215 (S.D.N.Y.1955) (and cases cited therein at 215, n. 4). We turn to the New York law to determine the effect of the merger in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">The relevant state statute governing the question here is N.Y.Bus.Corp. Law \u00a7 906(b)(3) (McKinney 1963, Con-sol.Laws, c. 4), which provides that after a certificate of merger or consolidation has been filed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">The surviving or consolidated corporation shall assume and be liable for all of the liabilities, obligations and penalties of each of the constituent corporations. No liability or obligation due or to become due, claim or demand for any cause existing against any such corporation, or any shareholder, officer or director thereof, shall be released or impaired by such merger or consolidation. No action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, then pending by or against any such constituent corporation, or any shareholder, officer or director thereof, shall abate or be discontinued by such merger or consolidation, but may be enforced, prosecuted, settled or compromised as if such merger or consolidation had not occurred, or such surviving or consolidated corporation may be substituted in such action or special proceeding in place of any constituent corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">The first sentence of \u00a7 906(b)(3) states that the surviving corporation is liable for its constituents\u2019 \u201cliabilities, obligations and penalties. .\u201d While no court has decided whether \u201cliabilities\u201d and \u201cobligations\u201d as used in \u00a7 906(b)(3) refer to criminal liabilities and obligations, two courts have held that these words, as used in other provisions of New York\u2019s corporation laws, do refer to criminal liability. United States v. Cigarette Merchandisers Ass\u2019n., <em>supra </em>(construing \u00a7 90 of the New York Stock Corporation Law); People v. Bankers\u2019 Capital Corp., 1930, 137 Misc. 293, 241 N.Y.S. 693 (construing \u00a7 216(1)(e) of the New York General Corporation Law). We note, too, that \u00a7 906(b)(3) also uses the word \u201cpenalties.\u201d We therefore hold that the first sentence of \u00a7 906(b)(3) permits the maintenance of a prosecution against the surviving corporation for crimes allegedly committed by a constituent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">Such a construction of New York\u2019s corporation law is not unique. New York courts have held that civil causes of action arising before a merger or consolidation may be instituted against the surviving or the consolidated corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tion. O\u2019Brien v. New York Edison Co., et al. (two cases). 19 F.Supp. 968 (S.D.N.Y.1937); Cameron v. United Traction Co., 1902, 67 App.Div. 557, 73 N.Y.S. 981; Lee v. Stillwater and Mechanicville St. Ry. Co., 1910, 140 App.Div. 779, 125 N.Y.S. 840. Appellants cite numerous cases which hold that a constituent corporation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or a dissolved corporation <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> remains subject to criminal prosecution. None of these cases, however, holds that a surviving corporation (in the case of a merger or consolidation) may not be prosecuted. These cases therefore do not conflict with our holding. We adopt, as to the liability of New Emprise, the New York law as the federal law in this case. We leave to another day the question whether we would borrow applicable state law if that law were to purport to relieve both the constituent corporation and the surviving corporation of liability for crimes of the constituent corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">XVII. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to sustain their convictions. Except as to appellant Giordano, whose arguments we have discussed above (see part XV, <em>supra), </em>their arguments lack substance. It would serve no useful purpose to set out the evidence in detail. We have examined it,- and we find it more than sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">XVIII. <em>The Taint of Illegal Electronic Surveillance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Appellants claim that the trial was materially tainted by leads from unlawful electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Between 1962 and 1965, the government conducted electronic surveillance against appellants Zerilli, Polizzi and Giordano.\u201d The product of this surveillance is embodied in typewritten transcriptions or \u201clogs\u201d of the intercepted conversations. The government concedes that the electronic surveillance was conducted illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">The prosecutors were initially unaware of this surveillance, but on June . 3, 1971, they were informed of it by the Justice Department. On September 8, 1971, the district court ruled that there would be a post-trial <em>Alderman </em>hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An <em>in camera </em>hearing was held on November 13, 1971, at which the court ruled that pretrial access to the logs would be limited to appellants Zerilli, Polizzi, Giordano, and their respective attorneys. At the post-trial <em>Alderman </em>hearing, which commenced on June 12, 1972, and continued on June 13, June 14, June 15, June 23, and July 7, 1972, the court concluded that \u201cthe evidence in this case came from an independent source and was not tainted by the illegal electronic surveillance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-19\">Appellants argue that the evidence accumulated from the unlawful surveillance was used in their prosecution and fatally contaminated their trial. Alternatively, they ask that we remand for a more complete <em>Alderman </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">a. <em>Standing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-21\">Only Zerilli, Polizzi and Giordano were subjected to electronic surveillance and the court ordered that only these three appellants and their attorneys be given access to the logs. On appeal, appellants Shapiro and Bellanca assert that they, as coconspirators, should also have been given access to these logs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>This same argument was made by petitioners in Alderman v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and was rejected. 394 U.S. at 171-176. See also Mancusi v. DeForte, 1968, 392 U.S. 364, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154; Simmons v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247; Jones v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697; Wong Sun v. United States, 1963, 371 U.S. 471, 491-492, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441; Goldstein v. United States, 1942, 316 U.S. 114, 121, 62 S.Ct. 1000, 86 L.Ed. 1312. The court\u2019s ruling as to standing was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">b. <em>The Existence of Taint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">At an <em>Alderman </em>hearing, the court must determine whether the prosecution used unconstitutionally seized material directly or indirectly to develop the evidence it produced at trial, or obtained its trial evidence from an independent and untainted source. Alderman v. United States, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 183. A defendant who shows that he was the victim of an unconstitutional search \u201cmust go forward with specific evidence demonstrating taint.\u201d 394 U.S. at 183. Then the burden shifts to the government to show that it acquired its evidence from an independent source.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Appellants make numerous arguments to show that their trial was tainted by the use of the logs. We consider them seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">1. <em>The benchside conference of March 28, 19721</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Polizzi testified on direct examination that he was unable to obtain a Nevada gambling license in March, 1966, because he had a \u201cproblem.\u201d [R.T. 5391, 5398, 5402.] On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the nature of Polizzi\u2019s problem. Polizzi then stated that his \u201cproblem\u201d was that in 1963 he had been placed on the Attorney General\u2019s list of Mafia figures. [R.T. 5466.]</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">On redirect examination, Polizzi\u2019s attorney returned to the subject of the Mafia. Polizzi testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-13\">\u201cIt was Mr. George Edwards who was the police commissioner of the City of Detroit that made his testimony before the Senate Committee, and he was the one that was directly responsible for putting my name on this chart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-14\">. I was very disturbed and felt that I was falsely accused. I wrote a letter to the Mayor of Detroit and felt that it was unjust that for no rhyme or reason to just be put on there and be falsely accused of these things . . . .\u201d [R.T. 5576-77.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">At this point, Mr. Kotoske, the prosecutor, approached the bench and, outside of the jury\u2019s hearing, told the court that Polizzi was perjuring himself and threatened to introduce the surveillance logs showing Polizzi\u2019s ties with organized crime in Detroit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-16\">\u201cMr. Kotoske: . . . [I]f [Mr. Murphy, Polizzi\u2019s attorney] read those logs at all he understands that this man on the witness stand [Polizzi] and Tony Zerilli laid out the whole Mafia organization in Detroit, how they cut up black money\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-18\">They laid out the whole organization, who is on this payoff, who is running the rackets, how the money is transferred, all discussion about black money, who it is that they have to eliminate from the organization, who they are going to \u2014 the whole complete thing, the complete structure is laid out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>I have sat by for about six weeks and let this nonsense go on. If he continues to persist in this, I have no alternative but to confront this witness with his own transcription of his voice and make him out a crown liar right in this courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-5\">I don\u2019t want to do that ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-6\">We had better draw the line and abandon the topic or I am telling counsel I will come forward with those logs ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-7\">The Court: Mr. Murphy, let me say this :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-8\">[T]his thing has gone far enough. You have the ability to have your client make the explanation that he has made, but my suggestion to you \u2014 I am not ordering it at all, but my suggestion to you is that you ought not go much further with that, because it may open a wider door than you want to have opened. And I do not want this trial to get into a public accusation of who is or is not a member of the Mafia . . . .\u201d [R.T. 5578-80.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The line of questioning about the Mafia was dropped by Polizzi\u2019s counsel and the government never introduced the logs to impeach Polizzi\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">Appellants contend that the incident was a use of the surveillance logs at the trial and tainted the entire case. We cannot agree although it was indeed a \u201cuse.\u201d First, no evidence from the logs was actually introduced. The prosecutor only threatened to use the logs to impeach Polizzi\u2019s character. Second, the government\u2019s threat came only after Polizzi at least twice testified to his own lack of Mafia connections, once on direct and again on cross. It cannot be said that the prosecutor\u2019s threat hindered the defense from making its point to the jury. Third, the threat to use the tapes did not form part of the government\u2019s case; it related solely to impeachment, after Polizzi had testified to his own lack of Mafia ties. Walder v. United States, 1954, 347 U.S. 62, 65, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503, <em>cf. </em>Harris v. New York, 1971, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1. Such use would not be an unlawful taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">2. <em>The leak to the press.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">On March 29, 1972, the day after the benchside conference, one Gene Blake, a <em>Los Angeles Times </em>reporter, was seen reading the government\u2019s copy of the previous day\u2019s transcript. [R.T. 5786.] Defendants\u2019 counsel accused the prosecutor of deliberately providing Mr. Blake with the transcript; the prosecutor denied this charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the court to order the <em>Times </em>not to report on the March 28 benchside conference, but the court refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">The next day a <em>Times </em>article was headlined \u201cTranscript Shows U. S. Bugged Vegas Defendants\u2019 Mafia Talks.\u201d The article contained direct quotes from the March 28 benchside conference concerning the surveillance logs. Appellants assume that the jury saw this article and took it into account in reaching its verdict, and that therefore the trial was tainted by information from the logs. We cannot agree. There was no evidence that any juror read this article, nor were the logs used by the jury in their deliberations. Thus there was no \u201crelevance to [appellants\u2019 convictions] of any conversations which may have been overheard through . . . surveillance.\u201d Alderman v. United States, <em>supra, </em>394 U.S. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-19\">3. <em>The Friedman sentencing memorandum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-20\">One of the major sources of the prosecutor\u2019s case was the Friedman sentencing memorandum, a document prepared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>in connection with the sentencing of Maurice Friedman on February 3, 1969, in another case. Appellants claim that this document was tainted by information from the surveillance logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the following testimony was produced concerning the sentencing memorandum: U. S. Attorney David Nissen, who wrote this memorandum, relied on three sources for its preparation: (1) information he received from FBI agent Wayne Hill, (2) a tape supplied to him by one Dr. Victor Lands in connection with another trial (the Lands transcript), and (3) information he received from (then) U. S. Attorney William Matthew Byrne, Jr. [R.T. 10,029-31.]</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Appellants do not claim that the Lands transcript or Byrne\u2019s information is tainted; their only objection concerns agent Hill\u2019s information. Hill testified that all the information he received, which he subsequently passed on to Nissen, came from either \u201clive Bureau informants\u201d (civilian informants) or from the Intelligence Division of the Los Angeles Police Department. [R.T. 9421-24.] He was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Tx\">\u201cQ. Now do you know, Mr. Hill, that any of the information you provided Mr. Nissen that found its way into this sentencing memorandum was the result or can in any way be attributed to the surveillance logs in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-6\">A. No, it could not.\u201d [R.T. 9425.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU9C\">On cross-examination, Hill said that these live Bureau informants gave information to various FBI agents around the country, who passed the material on to Hill, who, in turn, passed the information on to Nissen, who wrote the memorandum. [R.T. 9522-23, 9563-65.] Although the names of the informants were not revealed [R.T. 9523], agent Hill did provide the names of two FBI agents who received such information. [R.T. 9524, 9531, 9563-64.] The appellants did not produce any evidence to refute Hill\u2019s testimony. The court properly concluded that the Friedman sentencing memorandum was not tainted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">4. <em>Lack of FBI monitors at the Alderman hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Appellants argue that they did not receive a fair <em>Alderman </em>hearing because only one of the FBI personnel who conducted electronic surveillance was called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\"><em>Alderman </em>provides a flexible standard as to what witnesses must be examined in a taint hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-12\">\u201cArmed with the specified records of overheard conversations and with the right to cross-examine the appropriate officials in regard to the connection between those records and the case made against him, a defendant may need or be entitled to nothing else. Whether this is the case or not must be left to the informed discretion, good sense, and fairness of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Alderman, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">The district court adopted the following procedure to govern the taint hearing: There were numerous government officials throughout the country who had had access to the surveillance logs. The critical issue at the taint hearing, however, was not whether these officials had had access to the logs but whether any knowledge of the contents of the logs was imparted by these officials to the United States prosecutors in Los Ange-les. Thus, instead of bringing all the government officials to the hearing, the court ordered the government to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>the defense with the names of all of them so that the defendants could ask each government prosecutor, on the witness stand, whether he had received any information about the logs from the named officials.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> [Clerk\u2019s Transcript (hereinafter referred to as C.T.) 3321.]</p>\n<p id=\"aey-dedup-0\">At the taint hearing, three members of the prosecution team testified that the source of this case was the Friedman interview and sentencing memorandum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Two members of the team testified that they were not even aware of the existence of the logs when the indictments in this case were handed down on February 26, 1971.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Byrne, who left the United States Attorney\u2019s office in May, 1970, testified that he did not know that the logs existed in February, 1970, when he interviewed Mr. Friedman. [R.T. 9225.] U. S. Attorney Hornbeck knew of the existence of the logs, but had not read them and therefore did not use any information from the logs to assist him before the grand jury. [R.T. 10,262.] In addition, three members of the team testified that they did not contact any government officials who had access to the logs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Two other attorneys did contact one of these officials, James Ritchie,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but none of the information received from Ritchie related to the logs. This information, which consisted of some bank records, audits, and IRS personal interviews, was the result of subpoenas served on banks or of personal interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">The picture which thus emerges from the taint hearing is that no member of the prosecution team had read the logs \u25a0 or had any information derived from them when the indictments were handed down. Only two attorneys had contacted a government official who had access to these logs, and the information received from him was not derived from the logs. Moreover, by the time the indictments were handed down the evidence gathering process was complete, and no other significant evidence was produced at the trial. Counsel for appellants did not produce any witnesses to refute this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">While FBI monitors have testified at some taint hearings,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> there is no rule that they must testify. The issues raised in cases in which the court has ordered FBI personnel to testify<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> are obviated here as a result of the prosecution team\u2019s undisputed testimony that they received no information related to the logs from any government officials who had access to the logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">The district court concluded that the government met its \u201cultimate burden of persuasion to show that its evidence is untainted.\u201d <em>Alderman, supra, </em>394 U.S. at 183. Having carefully examined the evidence produced at the taint hearing, we agree with the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-14\">.
