It would not have obtained those tax advantages were the agreements in question contracts of sale or conditional sales. The issue is essentially a factual one. As the Tax Court pointed out, \u201c[t]he factual issue presented here is an extremely close one, making the decision difficult.\u201d That court resolved the contest in favor of the taxpayer, holding that the agreements were leases. Weighing the same evidence we might well have decided the case differently notwithstanding the decision in Lockhart Leasing Co. v. United States, 446 F.2d 269 (10th Cir. 1971), upon which the Tax Court so heavily relied. But our standard of review requires us to affirm unless the decision is \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960); Brumley-Donaldson Co. v. Commissioner, 443 F.2d 501, 503 n.3 (9th Cir. 1971); Made Rite Investment Co. v. Commissioner, 357 F.2d 647, 648 (9th Cir. 1966); Kessmar Construction Co. v. Commissioner, 336 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir. 1964). We cannot find that the decision of the Tax Court is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
