Ferguson, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b111-3\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b111-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b111-19\">In one respect \u2014 the rereading of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury at the jury\u2019s request and in the absence of the defendants, the facts of this case are almost a carbon copy of those in Busta-mante v. Eyman, 9 Cir., 1972, 456 F.2d 269 <em>(Bustamante I). </em>In <em>Bastamante, </em>after our remand, a hearing was held at which testimony was received as to what happened when a tape recording of the court\u2019s instructions was played back to the jury. On the basis of that evidence, the trial judge concluded that the presumption of prejudice had been overcome. We have now upheld that decision. Bustamante v. Cardwell, 9 Cir., 1974, 497 F.2d 556 (1974). <em>(Busta-mante II) </em>In the case at bar, such a hearing was held before the trial court denied the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The State was unable to produce any record, or any testimony, as to what occurred. Thus, as in <em>Busta-mante I, </em>there is nothing to overcome the presumption that the error was prejudicial. <em>Bustamante II </em>is not in point. Hence, the writ must issue unless the State grants the appellants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">Petitioner Van Akins was 17 years old at the time of the crime. He claims that when the juvenile court relinquished its jurisdiction he did not receive the due process to which he was entitled under Kent v. United States, 1966, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84. In Harris v. Procunier, 9 Cir., 1974, in banc, 498 F.2d 576 (1974), we have held that <em>Kent </em>is not retroactive. Van Akins\u2019 claim is rejected on the authority of <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-21\">Appellants raised four other claims of constitutional error in their petitions before the district court. Because it is unlikely that any of the alleged errors will occur at a new trial, we need not reach these claims. However, we assume that before the appellants\u2019 out-of-court statements made to state law en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>forcement officers are introduced in a new trial, the appellants will be given the constitutionally required voluntariness hearing that the district court found to have been denied to them in their first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The order appealed from is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court, with directions to hold the case for sixty days to enable the State of Arizona to grant appellants a new trial. If a new trial is not granted within that time, the writ shall issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
