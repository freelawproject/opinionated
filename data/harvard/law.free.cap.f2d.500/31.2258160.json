He purported to sue on behalf of all other members similarly situated. The case was removed to the district court. The Unions then moved to dismiss for improper venue. The motion was granted and the action was dismissed. DiMiceli appeals and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">The Unions adopted a resolution reading in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-23\">Be it resolved, that effective January 1, 1971, in addition to the current dues rate, each member shall pay an amount equal to 6% of the gross amount of each vacation benefit payment he shall receive from any jointly-administered MEBA plan, or from the Union, as dues to District No. 1 \u2014Pacific Coast District, MEBA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Such payment shall be due and payable on the date he receives said vacation benefit payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">DiMiceli claims that the 6% applies only to vacation payments earned after January 1, 1971; the Union says that it applies to payments received after that date, regardless of when earned. The parties agree that DiMiceli paid $268.03, under protest, on account of payments earned before January 1, 1971. DiMiceli does not claim that the Union\u2019s procedure in adopting the resolution was in any way improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Dismissal was on the ground that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (a part of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act) places venue either in the Southern District of New York, where the Unions have their principal offices, or perhaps in the District of Texas (Corpus Christi), where DiMiceli paid the $268.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The question is whether the action is for a violation of \u201cthis subchapter\u201d (the Act). The Unions argue, and the trial court agreed, that it is \u2014 that it is for a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nowhere in his complaint does DiMiceli assert a violation of \u00a7 411(a)(3). He concedes that the resolution was adopted in conformity with that subsection. His claim is based only on the construction of the resolution. He urges, first, that his construction of it is correct, and second, that if the Union\u2019s construction is correct, the resolution is invalid because it would deprive him of equal protection. We express no views as to the validity of these arguments. We mention them only to show the nature of DiMiceli\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">The question presented appears to be one of first impression. In every case cited by the Unions, there was an attack on the manner in which the increase in dues was adopted, thus bringing the case squarely within the provisions of \u00a7 411(a)(3). See: Local No. 2, International Brotherhood of Telephone Workers v. International Brotherhood of Telephone Workers, 1 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 891; Ranes v. Office Employees International Union, Local No. 28, 7 Cir., 1963, 317 F.2d 915; Rota v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, E.D.Pa., 1972, 338 F.2d 1176; King v. Randazzo, E.D.N.Y., 1964, 234 F.Supp. 388, aff\u2019d, 2 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 307; Sawyers v. Grand Lodge, International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, E.D.Mo., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>1967, 279 F.Supp. 747; Painters Union Local No. 127 v. District Council of Painters No. 16, N.D.Cal., 1968, 278 F.Supp. 830, aff\u2019d, 9 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In some of these cases the court also had to decide whether there had been an increase in \u201cthe rates of dues and initiation fees,\u201d because, if there were not, \u00a7 411(a)(3) would not apply. But the fact that there is such an increase, standing alone, does not state a claim for relief under the act. Here, no violation of the act is charged, and the special venue provision of \u00a7 412 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. \u00a7 4.12 provides :</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Any person whose rights secured by the provisions of this subchapter have been infringed by any violation of this subchapter may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States for such relief (including injunctions) as may be appropriate.
