On that basis, we directed the District Court to determine and award fees for the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Brewer v. School Board of City of Norfolk, Virginia, 4 Cir., 456 F.2d 943. This the District Court did, limiting its determination of compensable time to the time the attorneys devoted to the free transportation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">After our decision in March 1972, the Congress enacted \u00a7 718 of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, providing, generally, for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in appropriate school desegregation cases upon entry of a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">This appeal was brought by the plaintiffs contending that the fee award was inadequate. After argument we held the case pending the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 718 in the then pending case of Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, Virginia. The Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Bradley </em>on May 15, 1974, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476. As construed in <em>Bradley, </em>it now appears that \u00a7 718 provides a vehicle for an award of fees for the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys for services rendered without limitation to what they did with respect to the issue of free transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">Accordingly, without intimation of any opinion that the District Court\u2019s award was inadequate on the basis of our direction to it in March 1972, the award is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to determine and award to the plaintiffs such reasonable attorneys' fees as may be appropriate under \u00a7 718 as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Bradley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
