The Government has appealed challenging:</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-21\">(1) The district court\u2019s failure to hold the action barred because the claim is based upon the exercise or performance of a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-22\">(2) The district court\u2019s findings on negligence and proximate cause;</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-23\">(3) The district court\u2019s award of allegedly excessive damages; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-24\">(4) The district court\u2019s failure to give effect to a joint tortfeasor release given by the Griffins to Charles Pfizer &amp; Co., the manufacturer of the vaccine Mrs. Griffin ingested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the district court as to liability and computation of damages but reverse its failure to give effect to the joint tortfeasor release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>In the fall of 1963, Mrs. Griffin participated in a program sponsored by the Montgomery County Medical Society to secure immunization against polio through the mass administration of the Sabin oral polio vaccine. The program called for three separate doses of vaccine to be administered on three different dates. Each dose was designed to protect against one of three particular polio virus types. On September 22, 1963, Mrs. Griffin ingested a dose of Sabin Type I vaccine at the Gladwyne School in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. On October 27, 1963, she ingested a dose of Sabin Type III vaccine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>On November 22 she began to feel sick. By the following day her symptoms progressed to the point where hospitalization was required. She tragically emerged from the hospital one month later a permanent quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">In 1965 the Griffins commenced four separate actions. Two were instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County against the Montgomery County Medical Society. Two were instituted in federal court \u2014 one against Charles Pfizer &amp; Co., and the second, the instant action, against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In 1971, the federal court action against Pfizer was settled for $350,000 and the Griffins executed a joint tortfeasor release in favor of Pfizer.\u00ae The plaintiffs obtained final judgment in the instant action on January 18, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-13\">In a thoughtful and thorough opinion, Judge Newcomer found that as a result of ingesting the Type III vaccine on October 27 Mrs. Griffin developed polio. The court found that the dose ingested by Mrs. Griffin was part of Pfizer production Lot 56. The court further found that Lot 56 had been subjected to testing for safety and potency by the Division of Biologic Standards (DBS), a division of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>On the basis of undisputed test results, the court found that Lot 56 was approved for release to the public by DBS in violation of agency regulations. Specifically, the court held that the release of Lot 56 was inconsistent with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.114(b) (1) (iii) in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-14\">40. A comparative analysis of the test results obtained in testing Lot 56 for monkey neurovirulence and the NA-2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>experience did not demonstrate that Lot 56 did not exceed the reference in neurovirulence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-5\">41. A comparison of the test results obtained in testing Lot 56 for monkey neurovirulence and the NA-2 experience demonstrated that Lot 56 probably exceeded the reference in neuro-virulence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">351 F.Supp. at 16. The court concluded that Mrs. Griffin was a member of the class of persons the regulation was designed to protect, and that the hazard and particular harm she suffered were those the regulation was designed to prevent. Accordingly, the court found that the approval of Lot 56 by the officials of DBS constituted negligence per se. The court held that \u201cthe negligence of the United States was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, because but for the negligence the harm would not have occurred.\u201d 351 F.Supp. at 34. Stating that \u201c [i] n this case, the nature of the rules is not attacked, but rather the way the rules were applied,\u201d the court held that this case did not fall within the discretionary function exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">The court awarded damages for Mrs. Griffin\u2019s past and future medical expenses, future earning capacity, and pain and suffering in the amount of $1,759,946.25. Mr. Griffin was also awarded $300,000 for past and future loss of consortium. The court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery should be reduced by 50 percent due to the terms of the joint tortfeasor release. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-13\">I. Discretionary Function</p>\n<p id=\"A0ux\">The threshold question confronting us is whether this action is barred because of the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the Torts Claims Act. Although there is some dispute as to whether the exception is jurisdictional or merely a defense available to the Government, this circuit has treated the exception as jurisdictional. Gibson v. United States, 457 F.2d 1391, 1392 n.1 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-14\">The Government contends that the decision to release Lot 56 involved the exercise of a discretionary function. It argues that the determination called for by the regulation [42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.-114(b) (1)(iii), <em>supra </em>note 8] that the neurovirulence of a particular lot does not exceed that of the \u201creference strain\u201d involves the exercise of judgment. It maintains that Congress intended, by the discretionary function exception, \u00a7 2680(a), to exclude all claims \u201carising from acts of a regulatory nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-15\">We believe that the construction of \u00a7 2680(a) urged upon us by the Government is too broad. Activity of any consequence is rarely without its judgmental component. The effect of accepting the Government\u2019s contention would effectively immunize all Governmental activity from judicial re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>view except the most ministerial acts. In its landmark decision, Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953), the Supreme Court explicitly recognized that not all activity involving judgment is necessarily encompassed within the Act\u2019s exception :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-4\">The \u201cdiscretion\u201d protected by the section is not that of the judge \u2014 a power to decide within the limits of positive rules of law subject to judicial review. It is the discretion of the executive or the administrator to act according to one\u2019s judgment of the best course, a concept of substantial historical ancestry in American law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">346 U.S. at 34, 73 S.Ct. at 967 [footnotes omitted]. The decisions held discretionary in <em>Dalehite </em>involved, at minimum, some consideration as to the feasibility or practicability of Government programs. 346 U.S. at 41, 73 S.Ct. 956. Such decisions involved considerations of public policy, calling for a balance of such factors as cost of Government programs against the potential benefit. The Court stated;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-6\">[The discretionary function] also includes determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans, specifications or schedules of operations. Where there is room for <em>policy </em>judgment and decision, there is discretion. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">346 U.S. at 35, 36, 73 S.Ct. at 968 [footnotes omitted]. Where decisions have not involved policy judgments as to the public interest, the courts have not held the decisions to be immune from judicial review. Eastern Air Lines v. Union Trust Co., 95 U.S.App.D.C. 189, 221 F.2d 62 (1955), aff\u2019d 350 U.S. 907, 76 S. Ct. 192, 100 L.Ed. 796 (1955); Hendry v. United States, 418 F.2d 774 (2d Cir. 1969). <em>See also </em>Ward v. United States, 471 F.2d 667 (3d Cir. 1973); Pigott v. United States, 451 F.2d 574 (5th Cir. 1971). To determine the applicability of the discretionary function exception, therefore, we must analyze not merely whether judgment was exercised but also whether the nature of the judgment called for policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-12\">At the outset, we emphasize what is not being challenged on this appeal. Plaintiffs do not challenge the Surgeon General's determination to approve a live-virus immunization program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither do plaintiffs challenge the regulation which established the standard against which all manufactured lots were to be measured. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra. </em>These were matters involving balancing of policy considerations in advancing the public interest. Plaintiffs, in the instant case, challenge solely the manner by which the regulation was implemented. They contend that in approving a particular lot, Lot 56, for release to the public, DBS failed to comply with the standard established by the Surgeon General.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-13\">The issue before us, therefore, is whether the implementation of regulation 73.114(b) (1) (iii) by DBS involved a \u201cdiscretionary function.\u201d To decide this question we must first determine exactly what the regulation required be done in determining whether to release a particular lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">The crucial action in approving a particular test lot for polio vaccine manufacture was the determination that the neurovirulence<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the test lot \u201c[did] not exceed\u201d that of the NIH \u201creference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>strain.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The regulation required a \u201ccomparative analysis\u201d of the monkey neurovirulenee test results of a particular test lot with the monkey neuroviru-lence test results of the reference strain.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The regulation enumerates five criteria as evidence of neuroviru-lence: the number of animals showing lesions characteristic of poliovirus infection, the number of animals showing lesions other than those characteristic of poliovirus infection, the severity of the lesions, the degree of dissemination of the lesions, and the rate of occurrence of paralysis not attributable to the mechanical injury resulting from inoculation trauma.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the test lot could not be approved if it exceeded the reference strain with respect to any <em>one </em>of the five enumerated criteria. Under this interpretation of the regulation DBS could not approve a lot which minimally exceeded the reference strain with respect to any one criterion, even if DBS considered that criterion the poorest indicia of neurovirulenee of the enumerated criteria, and even though the test lot was far superior to the reference strain with respect to the other four criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">We do not agree with this construction of the regulation. The regulation merely lists five criteria as evidence of neurovirulenee and calls for a \u201ccomparative analysis.\u201d DBS has consistently construed the regulation as permitting it to weight the criteria in accordance with the degree to which it believed each criterion reflected neurovirulenee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">The Supreme Court has stated on another occasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-11\">Since this involves an interpretation of an administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt .... [T]he ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">Bowles v. Seminole Rock and Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945). We find the DBS interpretation of the regulation to allow weighting of the five criteria of neurovirulenee neither \u201cplainly erroneous\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">We acknowledge that under DBS\u2019 construction of the regulation, the implementation called for a judgmental determination as to the degree to which each of the enumerated criteria indicated neurovirulenee in monkeys. The judgment, however, was that of a professional measuring neurovirulenee. It was not that of a policy-maker promulgating regulations by balancing competing policy considerations in determining the public interest. Neither was it a policy planning decision nor a determination of the feasibility or practicability of a government program. At issue was a scientific, but not policy-making, determination as to whether each of the criteria listed in the regulation was met and the extent to which each such factor accurately indicated neurovirulenee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> DBS\u2019 responsibility was limited to merely executing the policy judgments of the Surgeon General.<footnotemark>16A</footnotemark> It had no authority to formulate new policy in the immunization program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">Where the conduct of Government employees in implementing agency regulations requires only performance of scientific evaluation and not the formulation of policy, we do not believe that the conduct is immunized from judicial review as a \u201cdiscretionary function.\u201d As Judge Waterman of the Second Circuit has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-11\">The fact that judgments of government officials occur in areas requiring professional expert evaluation does not necessarily remove those judgments from the examination of courts by classifying them as discretionary functions under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">Hendry v. United States, 418 F.2d 774, 783 (2d Cir. 1969).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-13\">This Court is fully capable of scrutinizing the processes and conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>of the decision-maker by the usual standards applied to cases of professional negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">351 F.Supp. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">Even were we to conclude arguendo, however, that DBS\u2019 approval of vaccine lots for release, had it complied with the regulation, was a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d we would not hold plaintiffs\u2019 action barred by the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception in the instant case. The Government\u2019s release of Lot 56 was predicated upon its reliance on a factor called \u201cbiological variation.\u201d Reliance on this factor, however, was not authorized by the regulations. We therefore conclude, as discussed below, that DBS\u2019 activity was not immunized from judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">The district court found that the undisputed test results showed that Lot 56 \u201cprobably exceeded\u201d the reference strain in neurovirulence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> DBS also apparently believed that if only the raw test results were considered the neurovirulence of the lot was greater than that of the reference. In ultimately approving Lot 56, however, the testimony showed that DBS did not consider the test results to be a conclusive indication of neuroviru-lence. Rather, the testimony indicated that Lot 56 was approved, despite the unfavorable test results, because the DBS officials considered the test results of that lot to be within \u201cbiological variation.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The concept of \u201cbiological variation\u201d is premised on the fact that a group of similar subjects will respond differently to a single stimulus. The variation in response is due not to variations in the stimulus but rather to differences in the subjects. As applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>the neurovirulence tests, DBS reasoned that the unfavorable test results of Lot 56 were not produced by defects in the vaccine sample tested, but rather were a product of unusual characteristics of the particular monkeys inoculated with the lot. The effect of relying on \u201cbiological variation\u201d was to discount, or regard as not significant, what otherwise appeared to be excessive neurovirulence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">We are unaware of any authority conferred by the regulation to permit DBS to discount the results of particular tests because of \u201cbiological variation.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.114(b) (1) (iii) provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-5\">only if . the test results demonstrate that the neurovirulence of the test virus pool does not exceed that of the NIH Reference Attenuated Poliovirus</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">is the test lot satisfactory for vaccine manufacture. On its face the regulation required that DBS consider all test results as a meaningful indication of neurovirulence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, a review of the comments and criticisms submitted to the Surgeon General in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking compels the conclusion that the results of testing were not to be diluted on this basis. The suggestions of several scientists that this language be modified to permit a more flexible standard, including \u201cbiological variation,\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> were apparently rejected. The regulation, both as proposed and as promulgated, contained the strict requirement that the test results demonstrate that the neuroviru-lence of the test lot not exceed that of the reference strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-18\"> Even were we to concede that discretion was otherwise conferred upon DBS by the regulation, no discretion was conferred to disregard the mandatory regulatory command. In discounting test results that were required to be considered significant, DBS acted outside the scope of the authority conferred by the regulation. The violation of a non-discretionary command takes what otherwise might be characterized as a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d outside the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>the statutory exception.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> United Air Lines v. Wiener, 335 F.2d 379, 393-394 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. dismissed, 379 U.S. 951, 85 S.Ct. 452, 13 L.Ed.2d 549 (1964) (Air Force Command\u2019s designation of permissible flying areas, although an unreviewable \u201cdiscretionary\u201d determination had regulations been complied with, held removed from \u00a7 2680(a) exception by Command\u2019s failure to make prior study required by regulation); <em>see </em>Hatahley v. United States, 351 U.S. 173, 76 S.Ct. 745, 100 L.Ed. 1065 (1956). Although Congress has provided that activity within the authority of a Government official, if a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d may not be the basis of Government liability even if negligent or an abuse of discretion, Congress has not immunized such activity if it exceeds the authority conferred. Liability, in such cases, is predicated not on a negligent or unwise policy determination, but on the failure of Government employees to conform to and act consistently with the authority delegated. We do not hold that the Government may be liable for policy determinations made by its officials. Rather, we hold only that the Government may be liable where its employees, in carrying out their duties, fail to conform to pre-existing statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">II. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-10\">Having concluded that this action is not barred by the discretionary function exception to the Tort Claims Act, we turn to the district court\u2019s findings on the merits. The district court held that plaintiffs satisfied their burden of proving that the Government was negligent in releasing Lot 56 and that the Government\u2019s negligence proximately caused Mrs. Griffin\u2019s condition. With respect to the issue of causation the court found first, that Mrs. Griffin had polio; second, that Mrs. Griffin\u2019s polio was of Type III variety; third, that the polio was caused by the vaccine; and fourth, that the vaccine ingested came from Lot 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-11\">We are unable to state that the findings of fact of the district court as to negligence<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> are erroneous.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Government, however, contends that as a matter of law neither the statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(d), nor the regulations promulgated thereunder, create a duty owed to individual members of the public. Citing the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 288(b),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>argues that the statutory language concerning the \u201csafety, purity, and potency\u201d of biological products contemplates at most a duty <em>\u201cvis a vis </em>manufacturers\u201d and the general public, but not running to individual consumers. We are aware of no legislative history, however, to support this narrow construction of the duty imposed by the statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even assuming that Congress intended to provide for the public welfare, only if its intention was <em>exclusively </em>for the public welfare does \u00a7 288(b) of the Restatement apply. We are unable to conclude that Congress did not intend, at least in part, that the protections of \u00a7 262(d) and regulations extend to individuals as well as the public at large.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">On the question of proximate cause, the district court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-5\">20. As a result of taking this vaccine, Mary Jane Griffin developed Type III poliomyelitis, which is responsible for her present paralysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-6\">21. Mary Jane Griffin ingested a dose of Pfizer Lot 56 oral polio vaccine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">On appeal the Government does not contest Finding 20. However, the Govern7 ment forcefully contends that the court erred in finding that Mrs. Griffin ingested a dose of vaccine from Lot 56. We have independently examined the documentary evidence introduced on this issue. We are satisfied that plaintiffs have met their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Mrs. Griffin ingested a dose of vaccine from Lot 56. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence adequately established the presence of Lot 56 in Montgomery County at the time Mrs. Griffin ingested her dose of Sabin Type III vaccine. Although the evidence also shows the presence of vaccine produced from an additional lot, Lot 71, in perhaps greater quantity than Lot 56, we conclude, for the reasons stated by the district court, 351 F.Supp. at 18-23, that the trier of fact could properly find that Mrs. Griffin ingested vaccine from Lot 56 rather than Lot 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court on the question of liability will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-12\">III. Computation of Damages</p>\n<p id=\"aju-dedup-1\">We have reviewed the district court\u2019s assessment of damages and, contrary to the Government\u2019s position, \u201cwe cannot say that the award was in any way shocking, unfair or biased.\u201d The hospital and medical bills as of the time of trial in July 1972 totaled $89,223.25. After considering plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s calculations the court awarded $421,581.-00 as future medical expenses, based on a 25-year life expectancy and a very modest inflation factor of <em>2y2 </em>percent,<footnotemark>27A</footnotemark> and $49,142.40 as Mrs. Griffin\u2019s impairment of future earning capacity. Thus, special damages alone totaled $559,946.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-13\">After finding that Mrs. Griffin\u2019s sensitivity to pain has not been im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>paired by her condition; that she suffers \u201cexcruciating\u201d pain from time to time; that she is mentally alert to her condition; that as a quadriplegic she is completely dependent on other persons, even for her bowel and bladder functions; and realizing that she had a 25-year life expectancy, the district court awarded $1,200,000 for her pain and suffering. In addition the court awarded Mr. Griffin $300,000 for past and future loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">As Judge Hastie stated in Frankel v. Heym, 466 F.2d 1226, 1228 (3d Cir. 1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-6\">The problem here is inherent in any effort to translate . . . catastrophic human loss . . . into money damages.

Joint Tortfeasor Release</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-10\">The Government maintains that the district court erred in refusing to reduce the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery by 50 percent in accordance with the joint tortfeasor release executed by the Griffins in favor of Pfizer.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Noting that the release expressly provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-17\">[s]hould it appear that two or more persons or entities are jointly or severally liable in tort for the alleged injuries to wife-plaintiff, the considerations for this Release shall be received in reduction of the total damages recoverable against all the other tort-feasors to the extent of the pro-rata share of the said Pfizer Inc.,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">the Government contends that under the Uniform Contribution Among Tort-feasors Act,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> enacted in Pennsylvania July 19, 1951, 12 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2082-2089, any judgment obtained by the Griffins against the United States must be reduced by the pro rata share of Pfizer, or 50 percent.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The district court, relying on Pennsylvania case law,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> held that because the Government never joined Pfizer as a third party defendant to determine Pfizer\u2019s joint tortfeasor status, the Griffin-Pfizer agreement was legally ineffective to reduce the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-19\">As the district court points out, Pennsylvania has established the rule that in order to give effect to a \u201cpro rata share\u201d clause in a release, the joint tort-feasor status of the settling party must be judicially determined.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Pennsylvania has apparently adopted this position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>to avoid allowing a defendant who may be the sole tortfeasor to obtain the benefit of the release. Eckels v. Klieger, 205 Pa.Super. 526, 210 A.2d 899 (1965). Thus, absent a determination of joint tortfeasor status, the benefit of the settlement inures to the plaintiff. This court has applied the Pennsylvania rule in Mazer v. Lipshutz, 360 F.2d 275 (3d Cir. 1966), where in a medical malpractice action against a surgeon we reverse the district court\u2019s reduction of plaintiff\u2019s verdict by the amount paid to the plaintiff by a hospital for its release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The release executed in the instant case, however, differs from the releases in <em>Davis, </em>supra note 31, and <em>Mazer </em>in one crucial respect. The Griffin-Pfizer agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">In order to avoid inconvenience and expense to the released party, Pfizer Inc., in any action in which the said Pfizer Inc. is or may be a defendant or third party defendant together with other alleged tortfeasors, it is further agreed by us that any verdict rendered against the other alleged tortfeasors shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the party released herein, Pfizer Inc., and <em>any judgment entered on said verdict shall be in the amount of the verdict reduced by the pro-rata share of the party released herein, whether or not the released party herein was in fact a joint tort-feasor. </em>This provision is intended to obviate the necessity and expense of having the released party herein remain a party on the record and obliged to participate at its expense in a trial merely for the purpose of determining if in fact it was a tort-feasor so as to entitle the other tort-feasors to a pro-rata reduction of any verdict. However, this provision in no way constitutes an admission of liability by the party released herein, Pfizer, Inc. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">This language constitutes an express waiver by plaintiffs of the benefits of the <em>Davis </em>holding. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-8\">To constitute a waiver of a legal right, there must be a clear, unequivocal and decisive act of the party with knowledge of such right and an evident purpose to surrender it. Kahn v. Banc America-Blair Corp., 327 Pa. 209, 193 A. 905 (1937); Cole v. Philadelphia Co., 345 Pa. 315, 26 A.2d 920 (1942).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">Brown v. City of Pittsburgh, 409 Pa. 357, 186 A.2d 399, 401 (1962). That court has also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-10\">While ordinarily the question of waiver is a question of fact for a jury . yet, where the only evidence as to waiver is a writing, its construction and interpretation and whether or not it constitutes a waiver is a question of law for the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">Hanover Construction Co. v. Fehr, 392 Pa. 199, 139 A.2d 656 (1958). The above-cited clause of the. Pfizer-Griffin agreement is unambiguous. The Griffins have conceded the joint tortfeasor status of Pfizer for the purpose of determining damages in the case of a judgment tortfeasor. It is obvious that the release was drafted with <em>Davis </em>specifically in mind. Having waived their right to insist upon a judicial determination of Pfizer\u2019s joint tortfeasor status, the Griffins may not object to a reduction of their judgment against the United States to the extent of Pfizer\u2019s pro rata share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">The district court refused to give effect to the foregoing language in the release because it believed it inoperative until Pfizer was actually made a party to the Griffin v. United States action. The language of the provision on this point is ambiguous.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is unclear whether this language contemplates that Pfizer be in fact made a defendant of record. Even if we construe the language as contemplating a requirement of Pfizer\u2019s joinder, however, had the United States attempted to join Pfizer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>latter, under the terms of the release, could have obtained a dismissal.

As the Government points out in its brief, the regulations promulgated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(d), 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.110-73.118, prescribe various tests which the manufacturer must complete prior to the submission of a lot to DBS for release. The regulations further provide the manufacturer must submit \u201call protocols relating to the history of manufacture of each lot of vaccine, and the results of all tests performed.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.116(g)(1). Although the Director of DBS, Dr. Murray, testified at trial that \u201cthe tests by the manufacturer were considered as the test on which the product should be released,\u201d the regulations provide for the submission of samples of the vaccine to DBS in addition to protocols and test results. The testimony was uneontradicted and the district court'found, 351 F.Supp. at 27, that in the case of Type III test virus, because of the lack of reliability of the manufacturers\u2019 test results, DBS performed its own monkey neurovirulenee tests on every sample of vaccine submitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">. DBS performed all neurovirulenee tests of the reference strain. A sample of the reference strain was inoculated periodically into groups of monkeys, typically in 30-monkey batches. Thus, for example, at the time DBS tested Lot 56 for neurovirulenee, it had a cumulative experience with the reference strain of 305 monkeys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">At the time the neurovirulenee test of any given test lot was to be compared with the neurovirulenee of the reference strain, the neurovirulenee of the latter was determined by the cumulative experience of the reference strain as of that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">. After a prescribed period following inoculation, monkeys were sacrificed and microscopic examinations were made of sections of the monkey\u2019s spinal cord and brain. Lesions that appeared in the slides were graded for \u201cseverity\u201d and \u201cspread.\u201d \u201cSpread\u201d is the grade of lesion that occurred when the virus spread down to the site furthest removed from the inoculation site. \u201cSeverity\u201d is the grade of lesion that occurred in the area closest to the inoculation site. Lesions were graded from grade 1 (minimal) to grade 4 (severe), in accordance with the damage observed to the anterior horn cells. <em>See </em>351 F.Supp. at 16 (finding 33).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">. The Director of DBS testified that</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-15\">[W]e considered the number of monkeys that were involved with lesions of any kind as being the most significant point of comparison . . . . This was a position which had been taken right from the onset of the evaluation of neurovirulenee findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 strict interpretation appears to have been rejected by the district court as well. <em>See </em>351 F.Supp. at 27. The court noted that DBS was required to give enumerated factors \u201creasonable\u201d weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">. Assuming, arguendo, that the regulation authorized DBS to weight the <em>ehronologieal </em>results of the reference strain tests, such weighting would not require the conclusion that approval of lots under regulation, 73.115 (b) (1) (iii) was a \u201cdiscretionary function.\u201d Such weighting would reflect a decision that, for example, later tests, due1 to refinement of test technique, were a more accurate measure of reference strain neurovirulenee. Again, such a decision involves not public policy but a scientific judgment as to the accuracy of test results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16A\">\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">. The function of DBS was not, as stated in the dissent, to determine whether lots were \u201csafe for release to the public.\u201d Its specific duty under the regulation was to ascertain whether the neurovirulenee standard of the regulation had been met. If so, the lot could be released. This function of comparing the test lot with the reference strain did not \u201cconstitute the planning of the method and procedures by which DBS would undertake to perform regulatory duty.\u201d Dis-seating opinion at 7. The method and procedures to be followed by DBS were spelled out specifically and in detail by the regulations promulgated by the Surgeon General with the advice of his committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">. In <em>Hendry </em>the court held that the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception did not bar judicial review of a claim based upon the allegedly negligent suspension of a license. The licensing determination depended upon psychological tests administered by Government psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">Our position is likewise supported by those decisions holding the exception inapplicable to claims based upon allegedly negligent treatment rendered by Government physicians. <em>See, e. g., </em>Costley v.

The majority affirms the district court\u2019s conclusion that the implementation by DBS of the regulations governing the neurovirulence testing of the live, oral poliovirus vaccine, 42 C.F. R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.110-73.118, and decision by DBS to release Lot 56 pursuant to such regulations did not involve a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-15\">Section 2680 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-16\">\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-17\">\u201c(a) any claim . . . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018discretion\u2019 protected by the section is not that of the judge \u2014 a power to decide within the limits of positive rules of law subject to judicial review, It is the discretion of the executive or the administrator to act according to one\u2019s judgment of the best^ course, a concept of substantial historical ancestry in American law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac6-dedup-0\">\u201c. . . the \u2018discretionary function or duty\u2019 that cannot form a basis for suit under the Tort Claims Act includes more than the initiation of programs and activities.

If it were not so, the protection of \u00a7 2680(a) would fail at the time it would be needed, that is, when a subordinate performs or fails to perform a causal step, each action or non-action being directed by the superior, exercising, perhaps abusing discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVOr\">In Dalehite v.

R. \u00a7\u00a7 73.110-73.118, is necessary in order to demonstrate why I believe that a discretionary function was involved in the instant case. The district court found that, after adoption of the regulations governing neurovirulence testing, DBS was in primary charge of administering both testing and evaluation under the regulations and held the power of approval or disapproval. 351 F.Supp. at 25. While the Surgeon General could have changed this power or overridden it, the approvals and disapprovals of production lots such as Lot 56 were issued by DBS in the name of DBS. Moreover, the primary responsibility for evaluating the monkey neurovirulence tests conducted pursuant to the regulations lay in the hands of Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, the chief pathologist at DBS. It was Dr. Kirschstein who signed the review approving Lot 56 for neurovirulenee on July 5, 1961 (P-48), which led to its release on July 9, 1961 (D-96). That Dr. Kirschstein was a central and dominant figure not only in supervision of the monkey neurovirulence testing but also generally in the'overall planning<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and administration of the live polio virus vaccine licensing program is made clear by the district court\u2019s statement that \u201c[ajlthough she was not an official member of the Surgeon General\u2019s Committee, she took [an] active part in most discussions and was extremely influential on the final recommendations of the Committee.\u201d 351 F.Supp. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">The procedures of the neurovirulence tests conducted by Dr. Kirschstein pursuant to the regulations were as follows. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.114(b)(1) provided that each lot of vaccine would be tested in comparison with the NIH Reference Attenuated Poliovirus, commonly referred to as NA-2. Subsection (b)(1) (i) required intrathalamic testing (injection of the vaccine into a specific portion of the brain of the monkey, N.T. 771-73) and \u201ccomparative evaluations\u201d of the test lot with NA-2. Subsection (b) (1) (ii) required intraspinal testing (injection of the vaccine into the lumbar area of the spinal canal, N.T. 798) and \u201ccomparative evaluations\u201d of the results of such tests with the test results of NA-2. Subsection (b)(1) (iii), entitled \u201cdetermination of neurovirulence,\u201d re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>quired that at specified time periods after the monkeys were injected, they would be sacrificed, their brains and spinal cords examined pathologically, and that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1139-5\">\u201ccomparative evaluation shall be made of the evidence of neurovirulence of the virus under test and the NIH Reference Attentuated Poliovirus with respect to (a) the number of animals showing lesions characteristic of po-liovirus infection, (b) the number of animals showing lesions other than those characteristic of poliovirus infection, (c) the severity of the lesions, (d) the degree of dissemination of the lesions, and (e) the rate of occurrence of paralysis not attributable to the mechanical injury resulting from inoculation trauma.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Finally, subsection (b)(1) (iii) provided that the virus pool under test is satisfactory \u201cif a comparative analysis of the test results demonstrate that the neuro-virulence of the test virus pool does not exceed that of the NIH Reference Attenuated Poliovirus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">For purposes of the comparative analysis described above, DBS graded lesions that appeared in the slides for both \u201cspread\u201d and \u201cseverity\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and from grade 1 to grade 4, in accordance with the damage observed to the anterior horn cells.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-14\">In addition to testing a particular vaccine lot for neurovirulence, DBS periodically performed neurovirulence tests of NA-2, the reference strain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such tests, typically performed in 30-monkey batches, often yielded varying results,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pre sumably as a result of biological variation. DBS then compared the test results of a particular test lot of vaccine with the \u201ccumulative experience\u201d of all the test results of the reference strain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-15\">I believe that the above procedures involved the exercise of \u201cplanning\u201d, or policy, discretion in at least two respects. First, in making the comparative analysis of the vaccine lot test results and the reference strain test results, DBS had to determine, as a preliminary matter, how much weight to accord to each of the five factors enumerated in the regulation, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.114(b)(1) (iii), based on the degree to which it believed each factor reflected neurovirulence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, the record indicates the DBS officials considered the number of lesions produced as far more significant in the determination of neuroviru-lence than the severity of lesions produced. See N.T. 930-31; N.T. 798-99. In fact, the decision to release Lot 56 was ultimately predicated on the fact that, while Lot 56 produced more severe lesions than any lesions produced by the reference strain, the number of lesions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>produced by Lot 56 was comparable to the cumulative experience of NA-2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> N.T. 798-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">The second respect in which the above procedures involved planning discretion concerned the determination of exactly what the neurovirulence level of the reference strain was at any given time. As mentioned above, the neurovirulence of the reference strain, against which the neurovirulence of all test lots was to be compared, was a constantly varying standard depending upon the most recent' retest of the reference strain, largely because each retest of the reference strain produced different results. Thus DBS was constantly called upon, as a result of these retests, to determine what weight to give each retest of the reference strain, what level of neurovirulence the reference represented, and what level the other lots could not exceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">The majority opinion, while recognizing that it was necesary for DBS to exercise judgment and discretion in the above two respects, nevertheless concludes that the judgment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-6\">\u201cwas that of a professional measuring neurovirulence . . . not that of a policy-maker promulgating regulations by balancing competing policy considerations in determining the public interest. Neither was it a policy planning decision nor a determination of the feasibility or practicability of a government program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">I believe that the implementation of the regulations by DBS in the above-described way involved the exercise of policy or planning discretion within the meaning of <em>Dalehite, </em>as well as the exercise of professional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">At the heart of DBS\u2019s regulatory function with respect to the live polio virus vaccine licensing program was the responsibility of deciding which production lots of vaccine submitted by the licensed manufacturers were safe for release to the public. The determination of what factors were the best indicators of neurovirulence in assessing whether a vaccine lot was safe for release to the public, as well as the determination of what the safe level of neurovirulence, as represented by the reference strain, was at any given time, appears to be central to the performance by DBS of its regulatory function. Such determinations constitute the planning of the method and procedures by which DBS would undertake to perform regulatory duty.<footnotemark>9a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-13\">In addition to the above, I find it difficult to distinguish the activities performed by DBS in the instant case from the activities challenged by the plaintiffs in <em>Dalehite </em>and held by the Supreme Court in <em>Dalehite </em>to fall within the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception. In <em>Dalehite, </em>the plaintiffs cited, among other grounds for liability, four specific acts of negligence on the part of the Government in the manufacture and shipment of the ammonium nitrate fertilizer: the temperature at which the fertilizer was bagged, the type of bagging used, the type of labeling used, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>the coating used. With respect to these activities, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-5\">\u201cThe acts found to have been negligent were thus performed under the direction of a plan developed at a high level under a direct delegation of plan-making authority from the apex of the Executive Department. The establishment of this Plan, delegated to the Field Director\u2019s Office, . clearly required the exercise of expert judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-6\">\u201cThis is to be seen, for instance, in the matter of the coating. The PRP was added in order to insure against water absorption. At stake was no mere matter of taste; ammonium nitrate when wet cakes and is difficult to spread on fields as a fertilizer. So the considerations that dictated the decisions were crucial ones, involving the feasibility of the program itself, \u25a0 balanced against present knowledge of the effect of such a coating and the general custom of similar private industries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-7\">\u201cAnd, assuming that high bagging temperatures in fact obtained as the District Court found, the decision to bag at the temperature fixed was also within the exception. Maximum bagging temperatures were first established under the TYA specifications. That they were the product of an exercise of judgment, requiring consideration of a vast spectrum of factors, including some which touched directly the feasibility of the fertilizer export program, is clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">These activities held immune from judicial review in <em>Dalehite </em>would appear to involve no more policy or planning components than the activities of DBS in the instant case. It is important to note that the activities in <em>Dalehite, </em>like the activities of DBS, required the exercise of essentially technical or professional judgment \u2014 i. e., the type of bagging used \u2014 but the Supreme Court nevertheless held that such activities fell within the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See also Mahler v. United States, 306 F.2d 713, 723-724 (3d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-18\">I recognize in the instant case that DBS may have improperly relied upon the factor of biological variation in its decision to release Lot 56, but I believe that such reliance constituted at most an abuse of discretion which, unfortunate as the results of such abuse of discretion may be, is nevertheless immunized by the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception. See <em>Dalehite, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 33-34, 73 S.Ct. 956.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-19\">Based on the foregoing reasons and because of the potential for governmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>tal liability which the majority opinion creates, given the ever expanding scope of Government participation in testing, inspection, and certification activities, particularly in the field of food and drug administration,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception does not preclude the instant action. I believe that the congressional language, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, requires a holding that activities performed by DBS in implementing the regulations governing neurovirulence testing occurred at the \u201cplanning,\u201d not the \u201coperational,\u201d level of government activity and, as such, are immunized from suit by the above-quoted language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">I concur in part IV of the majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">. As the majority opinion notes, see note 11 of majority opinion, the regulations prescribed various tests -which the manufacturer had to complete prior to the submission of a lot to DBS for release and provided that DBS was to review the manufacturer\u2019s protocols relating to the history of the manufacture of eacii lot of vaccine and the results of all tests performed, as well as to receive a sample of the vaccine submitted by the manufacturer. The district court found, however, that in the case of the Type III test virus, because of the lack of the reliability of tiie manufacturers\u2019 test results, DBS performed its own monkey neurovirulence tests on every sample of vaccine submitted. 351 F.Supp. at 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">.

The findings of the district court, such as those mentioned on page 1074 above and in notes 1 and 2 above, which were not clearly erroneous, make clear that the procedures in fact followed by DBS were not in accord with the wording of the regulations in several respects (see, for example, finding 30 and note 1 above) and, further, that the Surgeon General and the Committee \u201cgenerally\u201d accepted the recommendations of the DBS staff. The administrative construction and practice under a regulation should be followed unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. See Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Bowles v. Seminole Rock Co., 325 U.S. 410, 413-414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed.2d 1700 (1945). The views of the DBS staff were thus instrumental, as a practical matter, in the formulation of policy by the Committee and ultimately by the Surgeon General. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the contents of note 16A of the majority opinion, particularly the implication that the approved procedure was to follow the regulations as worded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">. Also it is noted that the Court used this language in <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 43, 73 S.Ct. at 971, quoting from another decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av-\">\u201c \u2018The power to adopt regulations or bylaws . . . for the preservation of the public health, ... are generally regarded as discretionary, because, in their nature, they are legislative.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APze\">The Court stated that such functions \u201cwere classically within the exception.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">.
