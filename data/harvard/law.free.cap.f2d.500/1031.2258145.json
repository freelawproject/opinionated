They also sought injunctive relief to prevent ap-pellees from denying appellants the opportunity to apply for such federal employment positions on the basis of alien-age, and a declaratory judgment declaring those portions of the regulations which automatically disqualified aliens from federal competitive civil service positions illegal and void and violative of their constitutional and statutory rights to pursue such jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-19\">On August 31, 1971, the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Mow Sun Wong v. Hampton, 333 F.Supp. 527 (N.D.Cal.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-20\">This appeal is before this court pursuant to rule 4(a) Fed.R.App.P. As held by the district court, jurisdiction is predicated on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) and the $10,000 matter in controversy requirement is met by each of the named class for the reasons concluded by the lower court. <em>Id. </em>at 529.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-21\">The primary issue which confronts us is a constitutional attack by appellants as resident aliens, upon the regulations of the United States Civil Service Commission (hereinafter \u201cCommission\u201d) which, in effect, excludes such aliens from employment in the federal competitive civil service. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.101 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The constitutional question is closely similar to that which the Supreme Court refused to intimate a view on, in its recent decision of Sugarman v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 93 S.Ct. 2842 (1973): whether the federal citizenship requirements of such provisions as 5 U. S.C. \u00a7 3301, Executive Order 10577, 19 Fed.Reg. 7521, \u00a7 2.1 (1954), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.101, and \u00a7 502 of the Public Works Appropriation Act 1971, Pub.Law 91-439, 84 Stat. 902 are or are not susceptible to constitutional challenge. <em>See also </em>In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 L.Ed.2d 910 (1973). <em>Cf. </em>People v. Rodriguez, 35 Cal.App.3d 900, 111 Cal.Rptr. 238 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">In <em>Dougall </em>the Court held that a New York statute, which denied aliens the right to hold positions in New York\u2019s classified competitive civil service, violated the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal protection guarantee. The issue before this Court on appeal is whether the United States Civil Service Commission may, consistent with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process guarantee, exclude appellants and all other resident aliens from obtaining employment in the federal competitive civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">However, before we are able to decide the constitutional issue, it is necessary to determine if the lower court correctly decided the non-constitutional arguments presented by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">I. N\u00d3N-CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">Appellants contend that the Commission regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.-101 (restricting employment to citizens), are invalid since they exceed the authority provided by Congress in \u00a7 502 of the Public Works Appropriation Act, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court rejected this contention and held that the regulations did not exceed or conflict with \u00a7 502.333 F.Supp. at 531<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-10\">\u201c. . . Congress has in broad terms granted to the Executive the authority to establish standards for admission into the civil service. 5 U. S.C. \u00a7 3301. Plaintiffs would have the court, however, read a provision in an Appropriations Act as negating that express grant of authority. The more sensible view of the relationship between \u00a7 502 of the Public Works Appropriations Act and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 is that \u00a7 502 merely sets forth the broad contours within which the Executive (the Commission) is free to use its good judgment and expertise. Thus, on the court\u2019s view of \u00a7 502 and the Commission regulation, no conflict appears. The Commission has acted permissibly in relation to the Appropriations Act in not opening up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>civil service to all those whom Congress has indicated it would be willing to pay for their work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We agree with the district court on this point. The appropriations acts are not the basis for the regulations and the Commission has acted permissibly in enacting its regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">The regulations prohibiting non-citizens from the competitive civil service (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.101), were issued pursuant to an executive order, Executive Order No. 10577,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which itself was issued upon the authority of a federal enabling act, the Civil Service Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-6\">\u201cOstensibly clear-cut, the chain of statutory authority progresses from the enabling act, providing the President with delegatable [sic] powers, to the executive order, granting certain of those powers to the Civil Service Commission, to the specific regulation designed to ascertain the fitness of applicants by establishing standards with respect to citizenship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-17\">Comment, Aliens And The Civil Service: A Closed Door? 61 Geo.L.J. 207, 209 (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-18\">Appellants' second contention of a non-constitutional nature is that the Commission\u2019s regulation contravenes Executive Order No. 11478, 34 Fed.Reg. 12985 (1969),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which declares it to be the policy of the Federal Government to provide equal opportunity in Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>employment for all persons, and to prohibit discrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, sex or <em>national origin. </em>Appellant alleges the key term, \u201cnational origin,\u201d was intended to apply to permanent resident aliens. The district court, however, correctly interpreted the term \u201cnational origin\u201d as being limited to discrimination between United States citizens only and that no distinction should be made on the basis of their respective national origins,</p>\n<p id=\"AMoG\">Despite an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guideline<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> prohibit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>ing citizenship discrimination, the Supreme Court in a recent decision, Espinoza v. Farah Manufacturing Co., Inc., 414 U.S. 86, 94 S.Ct. 334, 38 L.Ed.2d 287 (1973), held that such discrimination does not always constitute \u201cnational origin\u201d discrimination, and thus is not necessarily barred by \u00a7 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). The Court found that nothing in the Act makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of citizenship or alien-age. <em>Id. </em>414 U.S. at 86, 94 S.Ct. 334. <em>Espinoza\u2019s </em>application to this ease is limited in that it involved only private employment, whereas we are concerned with the right to federal employment under the Civil Service.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Appellants with good reason suggest that \u00a7 6 of Executive Order No. 11478, in stating: \u201cThis order does not apply to aliens employed outside the limits of the United States,\u201d is proof that the order was intended to apply to aliens employed inside the limits of the United States. However, assuming such an interpretation is justified and the Executive Order is ambiguous on this point so as to permit an interpretation, we still agree with the lower court that even if we are to assume the regulation contravenes Executive Order 11478, such conflict would not be judicially reviewable (333 F.Supp. at 530), because the Executive Order merely declares a general policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Appellants argue that such a conclusion is directly contra to the holding of Jalil v. Hampton, <em>supra, </em>discussed <em>infra, </em>which specifically states such an order is judicially reviewable. But the executive order referred to in <em>Jalil </em>as being reviewable was not one declaring a general policy, but was the same Executive Order No. 10577 which was the authority upon which the regulations were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">II. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The Commission regulations allow a person to be admitted to competitive examination or given appointment \u201conly if he is a citizen of or owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.101 (a) (b). The district court, relying on immigation cases concerning entry and deportation, concludes that Congress\u2019 plenary power, over aliens lessens the proper standard of judicial scrutiny to be applied to the discrimination and exclusion of aliens from the federal competitive civil service to that of whether the classification has a rational basis. 333 F.Supp. at 532. Appellants contend that the proper burden for the government to meet is that of showing a compelling government interest to justify the discrimination against them and other resident aliens similarly situated by the Commission regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">To state that Congress\u2019 plenary power over aliens enables the federal government to unreasonably discriminate against aliens, neglects to consider the fact that even Congressional plenary power is subject to Constitutional limits. United States v. Thompson, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333, 1338 (1971) (Appellants\u2019 Brief, pp. 18-19).<footnotemark>10a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">The rationales and holdings of Sugarman v. Dougall, <em>supra, </em>and Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), although not squarely controlling (because they deal with the states\u2019 power to discriminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>against aliens <em>vis-a-vis </em>the Fourteenth Amendment) are instructive and significant when applied to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><em>Dougall </em>involved Section 53(1) of the New York Civil Service Law McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 7 which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">\u201cExcept as herein otherwise provided, no person shall be eligible for appointment for any position in the competitive class unless he is a citizen of the United States.\u201d 413 U.S. at 635, 93 S.Ct. at 2844.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">Justice Blackmun, in holding that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection guarantee, stressed the fact that Section 53 is neither narrowly confined nor precise in its application. Its imposed ineligibility may apply to the \u201c \u2018sanitation man, class B\u2019 (citation omitted), to the typist, and to the office worker, as well as to the person who directly participates in the formulation and execution of important state policy. The citizenship restriction sweeps indiscriminately.\u201d <em>Id., </em>93 S.Ct. at 2848.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">The Commission regulation here also sweeps indiscriminately excluding <em>all </em>al-. iens from <em>all </em>positions requiring the competitive Civil Service examination. See Jalil v. Hampton, <em>supra, </em>460 F.2d at 930 (Bazelon, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">The Court in <em>Dougall </em>was careful to point out that it did not hold that on an individual determination an alien could not be refused or discharged from public employment, even on the basis of noncitizenship, but only if a legitimate state interest relating to qualification for a particular position or to the characteristics of the employee were present. Sugarman v. Dougall, <em>supra </em>413 U.S. at 645, 93 S.Ct. 2842. Thus, for instance, in the present case, if national security were involved in a particular position, or requirements of citizenship as qualifications for political office, the government interest would be compelling enough to offset discrimination against aliens. But, a flat prohibition from any level of federal employment as the regulations dictate creates a different situation. The appellants named in the class are a janitor, file clerk, clerk typist, mail clerk, and educational evaluator. (Appellants\u2019 Brief pp. 3-5). Surely these positions and the majority of civil service positions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> do not actually participate either in the making or in the execution of national policy, as contended by ap-pellees. (Appellees\u2019 Brief p. 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">Aliens are a \u201csuspect\u201d class, as stated in Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra </em>403 U.S. at 372, 91 S.Ct. 1852, because aliens \u201care a prime example of a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 minority <em>(see </em>United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-153, n. 4 [58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234] (1938)) . . .\u201d and classifications based on alienage are \u201csubject to close judicial scrutiny.\u201d 403 U.S. at 372, 91 S.Ct. 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">Appellees urge that <em>Graham\u2019s </em>holding be limited to a welfare case. However, <em>Dougall </em>clearly cites <em>Graham </em>as authority for imposing a compelling state interest test in the field of public employment. 413 U.S. at 642, 93 S.Ct. 2842; <em>see also </em>Chapman v. Gerard, 456 F.2d 577 (3d Cir. 1972); Younus v. Shabat, 336 F.Supp. 1137 (N.D.Ill., 1971). (Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief pp. 8-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">In Nielsen v. Secretary of Treasury, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 424 F.2d 833 (1970), the court referred to decisions invalidating state measures discriminating against aliens, and although the holding is inapposite to our situation, the case is relevant in displaying recognition that the federal government, like a state, must show reasonableness of and justification for any measure discriminating against aliens. <em>Id. </em>at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-16\">Although in <em>Dougall </em>and <em>Graham, </em>aliens were protected from discrimination on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, can the equal protection guarantee against alien discrimination be implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment? In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, at 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, at 694, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954) the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-4\">\u201cThe Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the states. But the concepts of equal protection and due process, both stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive. The \u2018equal protection of the laws\u2019 is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than \u2018due process of law,\u2019 and therefore, we do not imply that the two are always interchangeable phrases. But [the] Court has recognized, discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.\u201d <em>See also </em>Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 168, 84 S.Ct. 1187, 12 L.Ed.2d 218 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Bolling v. Sharpe thus makes clear that a federal law may impose such an impermissible discrimination as to be a denial of due process. A number of lower court decisions have recognized this relation between the equal protection guarantee and the Due Process Clause. Morris v. Richardson, 346 F.Supp. 494, 499 (N.D.Ga.1972); <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Faruki v. Rogers, 349 F.Supp. 723 (D.D.C.1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Moritz v. C. I. R., 469 F.2d 466 (10th Cir. 1972); In re Smith, 323 F.Supp. 1082 (D.Colo.1971) stating at 1088:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-6\">\u201cBy characterizing the problem presented in this case as one of equal protection, we do not mean to suggest that fifth amendment due process takes in all of fourteenth amendment equal protection. It is enough to note that fifth amendment due process does include an equal protection principle, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 641-642 [89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600] (1969), and that the two provisions are co-extensive insofar as they prohibit discrimination based upon race, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 [74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884] (1954), and other discriminations which are invidious or deprive persons of constitutional rights. Shapiro v. Thompson, supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">The question becomes whether or not the Commission\u2019s regulations result in such \u201cunjustifiable discrimination as to be violative of due process.\u201d Section 352(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provided that a naturalized citizen, with some exceptions, loses citizenship by continuous residence for three years in the country of origin. Citing Bolling v. Sharpe\u2019s \u201cunjustifiable discrimination\u201d language, the Court held that the statute was discriminatory and violative of due process under the Fifth Amendment, since no restriction against length of foreign residence applied to native-born citizens. Similarly, a flat prohibition against aliens obtaining employment in the civil service is such discrimination to be a denial of due process unless the government can show a compelling interest for maintaining its classification. \u201cWhile there may be no constitutional right to public employment as such, there is a constitutional right to be free from unreasonably discriminatory practices with respect to such employment.\u201d Whitner v. Davis, 410 F.2d 24, 30 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">In Jalil v. Hampton, <em>supra, </em>in what was essentially the same factual pattern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>as the present case (a challenge of the same Commission regulations), the District of Columbia Circuit remanded to the trial court to decide the non-constitutional questions, since there were no findings of fact in the district court\u2019s order. Judge Bazelon\u2019s dissent infers that the remand was based on a desire to \u201cforbear\u201d from ruling on the constitutional question and to dispose of the case on the non-constitutional issues. <em>Id. </em>460 F.2d at 931. Here, findings of fact were made and as determined above in deciding the non-constitutional questions against appellant, a resolution of the constitutional issue is indeed necessary. The court in <em>Jalil </em>recognized that classifications based on alienage are suspect and that the government need justify such discrimination on the ground of a compelling governmental interest. <em>Id. </em>at 929. Judge Bazelon\u2019s dissent cites the extreme injustice involved in excluding all aliens from the federal competitive civil service, and refers to the lower court decision recently affirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Dougall:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-4\">\u201cIn Dougall v. Sugarman, <em>supra, </em>a three-judge panel struck down, without a factual hearing, a New York statute which excluded all aliens from the competitive class of the Civil Service, on the grounds that none of the interests which New York advanced were adequate justifications for this classification under the standards of Graham v. Richardson. In the case before us, the federal government raises no different, or more compelling, interests. It is therefore inconceivable that the Government could establish a compelling state interest at a factual hearing to justify the exclusion of <em>all </em>aliens from <em>all </em>positions requiring the competitive Civil Service examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 930.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The question remaining for us is whether the Government has established a compelling interest or proper government objective to justify the total exclusion of aliens from the federal competitive civil service.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">Appellees set forth various arguments supporting their position that there is a compelling government interest offsetting any discrimination on the basis of alienage. Also, the District Court raised various points in support of its finding that the regulations did not violate any constitutional provisions. Most of these points were rejected in <em>Dougall </em>when considering whether New York had shown a compelling interest counterbalancing its discriminatory classifications. When applied to the federal discrimination, the arguments break down for similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">The lower court, in its decision, accepted as one justification for the government\u2019s action, the government\u2019s \u201cright to provide for the economic security of its citizens before its resident aliens.\u201d 333 F.Supp. at 532. This line of reasoning, termed the \u201cspecial public interest\u201d doctrine, Crane v. New York, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S.Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915) (that the government satisfied the economic needs of its citizens by restricting distribution of its resources to its citizens), has been discredited and rejected by the Supreme Court in Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra. </em>The rejection of this doctrine is supported in the public employment area. Sugarman v. Dougall, <em>supra, </em>413 U.S. at 642, 93 S.Ct. 2842. The California Supreme Court in Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick v. California, 71 Cal.2d 566, 79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645 (1969), also rejected the \u201ceconomic security\u201d justification, because the \u201calien may be a resident who has lived in California for a lengthy period, paid taxes, served in our armed forces, demonstrated his worth as a constructive human being, and contributed much to the growth and development of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 456 P.2d at 656. A resident alien must assume certain obligations in return for being allowed to reside lawfully in the United States. He must pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>taxes. He is subject to military service. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 454(a). He contributes to the economic growth and welfare of this country. Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848. While it might be thought he could and should cure his disability by simply applying for and obtaining his citizenship, there appears to be no logical justification for discrimination against aliens on economic grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Appellees also contend that resident aliens have no constitutional right to make or carry out national policy or partake in any of the institutions of government. The lower court found that government \u201cfunction(s) more smoothly and efficiently and more securely if competitive civil service positions are limited to citizens.\u201d 333 F.Supp. at 533. It is an oversimplification to infer, as appellees do, that all aliens should be excluded from the competitive civil service because they \u201cshould not be in a position to exercise national sovereignty; clearly, the large majority of civil service positions involve no such responsibilities.\u201d 61 Geo.L.J., <em>supra </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">Appellees, however, assert that the factors of \u201cloyalty and security\u201d make Federal Government service differ vastly from the ordinary employer-employee relationship. This is indeed true. We have no doubt that under certain circumstances our government may, for loyalty and security reasons, properly require citizenship for certain government positions. But the Commission regulations fail to delineate any specific positions where security, loyalty and policy-making require that the citizenship requirement be essential for employment. Instead they automatically exclude all aliens from the competitive civil service; an instance of overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Appellees point to the qualifications for high political office as authority for the proposition that the Constitution is clear in placing control of the government in the hands of citizens only. <em>Dougall </em>recognizes the state\u2019s right in an appropriately defined class of position to require citizenship as a qualification for office. We think this proper. But as with the Court in <em>Dougall, </em>we fail to see how a universal ban on alien employment can be justified because specific positions involve high degrees of security, loyalty, and policy-making. Thus, the problem of insuring loyalty, security and policy-making to citizens can be accomplished more effectively by classifying jobs as to their sensitive and nonsensitive nature. 61 Geo.L.J., <em>supra </em>at 221. The regulations fail to make any such distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">Appellees point to the universal practice of other nations requiring civil servants to be citizens. Such a contention, though relevant on the reasonableness of the discrimination, does not prove a compelling government interest. Its application toward solving the constitutional issue is questionable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">The conclusion found in Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick v. California, <em>supra, </em>although a state employment case, also applies here that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-10\">\u201cThe discrimination involved denies arbitrarily to certain persons, merely because of their status as aliens, the right to pursue an otherwise lawful occupation. The classification within the statutory scheme operates irrationally without reference to any legitimate state interest except that of favoring United States citizens over citizens from other countries. This latter objective does not reflect such a compelling state interest that it would permit us to sustain this kind of discrimination.\u201d 79 Cal.Rptr. at 90, 456 P.2d at 658.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">We hold that the Commission regulations unreasonably discriminate against resident aliens based solely on their status as aliens. We reject the contention of the appellants that the protection provided by the Fifth Amendment is co-extensive with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, in the fact situation of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>and with the broad sweep of the regulation involved, we hold that it so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process. Here there is no logical or persuasive reason advanced as to why aliens should be excluded from all federal civil service employment; nor is there a refinement of qualifications such as fluency with English, etc., which may or may not prevent employment of an alien. The broad sweep is the vice. It could be saved only by a compelling governmental interest. We have no doubt such a compelling government interest can be shown as to many civil service jobs, but the government has failed to show such a compelling interest for all jobs, and thus, the flat prohibition of the Commission regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 338.101, is a denial of due process, and unconstitutional.
