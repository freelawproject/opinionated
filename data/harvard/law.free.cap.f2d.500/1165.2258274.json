The Customs Court held the merchandise classifiable under TSUS 666.20 as parts of machinery for use in the manufacture of sugar.

Free</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-32\">The merchandise consists of approximately 8100 seamless copper tubes, six feet, 6% inches long, 16 gauge, 1% inch outside diameter, with their ends annealed. The importer-appellee, Antonio Roig Sucesores, ordered the tubes for use in new evaporators it had purchased but which it had received in incomplete con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>dition, without the tubes. The evaporators were to replace old ones used in its sugar manufacturing plant. Each evaporator consisted of an enclosed vessel with a heat exchanger in the bottom. The heat exchangers were made up of copper tubes fixed between plates so that steam could flow around the tubes while juice extracted from the sugar cane flowed through them to be heated. The ends of the tubes were annealed to soften the copper so that the ends could be flanged in assembling the tubes with the plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">The Customs Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs directed to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-5\">Is the TSUS item 666.20 classification for \u201cMachinery for use in the manufacture of sugar, and parts thereof\u201d a classification controlled by rule of \u201cchief use\u201d or controlled by rule of \u201cactual use\u201d under [General Interpretative Rule] 10(e) <em>supra 1</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">On that matter the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-7\">The legislative history, cited <em>supra </em>[Tariff Classification Study, Submitting Report, Part II, pages 5, 14, Appendix A, page 50, November 15, 1960], and in the supplemental briefs, discussing the problems attending tariff classifications by \u201cchief use\u201d and \u201cactual use\u201d, in our opinion, is too indefinite and uncertain to resolve that TSUS item 666.20 is an \u201cactual use\u201d provision as plaintiff contends. Since TSUS item 666.20 is in the same class-sifying language as paragraph 1604 of the Tariff Act of 1930, from which TSUS item 666.20 is derived, we are constrained to follow the established judicial construction that as classified in paragraph 1604, United States v. Union Sugar Div., Consolidated Foods Corp., 54 CCPA 1, C.A.D. 892 (1966), and TSUS item 666.20, S. Jackson &amp; Son, McCandless, Inc. v. United States, 65 Cust.Ct. 327, C.D. 4097 (1970), \u201cmachinery for use in the manufacture of sugar\u201d is a classification by \u201cchief use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">The court then held that \u201cthe imported tubes which were designed and dedicated for sole use with machinery used in the manufacture of sugar are parts of said machinery and sustain [ed] the protest.\u201d It rejected appellant\u2019s contention that there was no evidence that the imported tubes were in a class of tubes which were solely or chiefly used in heat exchangers of evaporators chiefly used in the manufacture of sugar. The court justified its position that proof that the evaporators were of a class or kind chiefly used in the manufacture of sugar was unnecessary by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1232-9\">* * * the rule of chief use, when and if applicable, is a rule for classifying imported articles, and the imported articles in this case are tubes not evaporators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">It then stated that \u201cit is fair to infer\u201d upon the record that appellee\u2019s \u201cevaporator is an integral component of its aggregate machinery, used in the manufacture of sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">The imported merchandise here is the seamless copper tubes and the classification in issue under TSUS 666.20 is that of the Customs Court as \u201cparts\u201d of \u201cmachinery for use in the manufacture of sugar,\u201d rather than as the \u201cmachinery\u201d itself. General Interpretative Rule 10 (ij), supra, providing that a \u201csolely\u201d or \u201cchiefly used\u201d test is applicable in determining the status of \u201cparts\u201d is applicable to the tubes. However, the Customs Court apparently overlooked the. fact that appellee must also prove that the \u201cmachinery\u201d of which the tubes are parts is \u201cmachinery <em>for use in the manufacture of sugar\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the evaporators with their heat exchangers containing the tubes are also subject to a use test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">As to the kind of use test applicable, we are satisfied that the court correctly concluded that \u201cmachinery for use in the manufacture of sugar in item 666.-20 is a classification by \u2018chief use\u2019.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>court aptly characterized the legislative history advanced before it as \u201ctoo indefinite and uncertain\u201d to demonstrate that the \u201cestablished judicial construction\u201d supporting its conclusion was not to be followed in this case. Appellee here argues again that TSUS 666.20 is controlled by actual use, relying largely on a part of the legislative history considered by the lower court and certain other arguments pointing out that \u201cmachinery for the manufacture of sugar\u201d was separated out from various other agricultural implements included with it in paragraph 1604 of the 1930 Act in adopting the present Tariff Schedules. Nothing persuasive of appellee\u2019s position is seen in the arguments advanced. Rather, it is significant that appellee has not cited any decisions to support the attack on the \u201cestablished judicial construction\u201d of \u201cmachinery for use in the manufacture of sugar\u201d as a chief use provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Appellee\u2019s burden of proving the classification claimed in his protest thus requires demonstration that the elements of \u201cchief use\u201d of the \u201cmachines\u201d or evaporators have been met. See General Interpretative Rule 10(e) (i), supra; also, L. Tobert Co. v. United States, 41 CCPA 161, C.A.D. 544 (1953) (use in the United States rather than mere local use) and United States v. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., 47 CCPA 1, C.A.D. 719 (1959) (use of the class or type of goods rather than a particular shipment). On this point, the court itself referred to \u201cthe record testimony that the evaporators with heat exchangers are also used in power plants and in distilleries, and that some distilleries use copper tubes in heat exchangers.\u201d In contrast to that testimony adverse to its position, appel-lee has offered no significant evidence that the evaporators using heat exchangers with the tubes therein were of a \u201cclass or kind\u201d whose \u201cuse in the United States\u201d for the manufacture of sugar \u201cexceeds all other uses (if any) combined.\u201d Rule 10(e)(i). Appellee thus has failed to provide satisfactory evidence of compliance with the use test for the \u201cmachinery\u201d part of TSUS 666.20. Likewise we find the evidence insufficient to comply with the sole or chief use test applicable under Rule 10(ij) for \u201cparts\u201d of such machinery. The most pertinent evidence is testimony of ap-pellee\u2019s witness Arsuaga that \u201cin Puerto Rico\u201d the type of tube imported \u201cis exclusively used in sugar mills.\u201d There is no evidence regarding use on <em>a national basis </em>of seamless tubes of the class or kind imported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">Appellee also relies on The Servco Co. v. United States, 68 Cust.Ct. 83, C.D. 4341 (1972), affirmed, United States v. Servco Co., 60 CCPA 137, C.A.D. 1098, 477 F.2d 579 (1973). That case dealt with Schedule 6, Part 2, Headnote l(iv), which states that Part 2, which includes TSUS 613.02 in which the District Director classified the present tubes, does not include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1233-9\">* * * other articles specially provided for elsewhere in the tariff schedules, <em>or parts </em>of articles. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1233-11\">Since appellee is adjudged not to have met his burden of proving that the tubes are properly classified in TSUS' 666.20, as claimed, the <em>Servco </em>ease is not reached in determining that the judgment below must be reversed. However, appellee\u2019s aforementioned failure of proof also results in a failure to show that the importations are provided for elsewhere than in TSUS 613.02, as originally classified. It would not suffice for appellee to prove the tubes do not belong in TSUS 613.02. That is only half of his dual burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
