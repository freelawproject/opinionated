GOODWIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">James Robert Peltier\u2019s appeal has been taken en banc so the full court can consider whether the rule announced by the Supreme Court in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), rev\u2019g, 452 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. 1971), should be applied to similar cases pending on appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the date the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was announced. We hold that it should, reverse Peltier\u2019s conviction, and remand the matter to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">Peltier was convicted of possessing marijuana, with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C, \u00a7 841(a)(1). The evidence was discovered during a search conducted on February 28, 1973, by border-patrol agents on roving patrol on Highway 395 near Temecula, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-15\">On June 21, 1973, the Supreme Court, in its opinion reversing this court\u2019s <em>Al-meida-Sanchez </em>opinion, held that border-patrol agents on roving patrol cannot stop and search automobiles pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1 without probable cause or warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-16\">The search in question here was of the same type as that condemned in <em>Al-meida-Sanchez. </em>There, the search was conducted 25 miles north of the Mexican border, on a California east-west highway that lies at all points at least 20 miles north of the border. 413 U.S. at 267-268, 273. Here, the search was conducted approximately 70 air miles north of the Mexican border and well to the north of the San Diego metropolitan area. The government concedes that the evidence must be suppressed if the rule announced in <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AM3v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Until Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), the Supreme Court traditionally-applied new constitutional criminal-procedure standards retroactively in all cases. 381 U.S. at 628. <em>See generally </em>Had-dad, \u201cRetroactivity Should Be Rethought\u201d: A Call for the End of the Linkletter Doctrine, 60 J.Crim.L., C. &amp; P.S. 417, 425-26 (1969); Mishkin, The High Court, the Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L.Rev. 56, 56-57 (1965). In <em>Linkletter </em>the Court was required to decide whether Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), which overruled Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782 (1949), should be given retroactive effect. After reviewing the history and theory of the -problem of retroactivity, the Court concluded that the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires that the Court\u2019s decisions be applied retroactively. In each case the Court must determine whether retroactive or prospective application is appropriate. Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"Auu\">In <em>Linkletter\u2019s </em>successors the Court devised a three-point test to determine whether or not to apply a new constitutional doctrine retroactively. The test looked to (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of reliance by law-enforcement officials on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards. <em>See </em>Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"aaq-dedup-0\">However, for the doctrine of retroac-tivity to be relevant at all, the Court must have articulated a new doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aag-dedup-0\">\u201cAn issue of the \u2018retroactivity\u2019 of a decision of this Court is not even presented unless the decision in question marks a sharp break in the web of the law.

Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), would not apply retroactively. The Court in <em>Johnson </em>observed that prior to <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>it had expressly declined to condemn an entire process of in-custody interrogation solely because police had failed to warn accused persons of their rights or had failed to grant them access to outside assistance, and that law-enforcement agencies had relied upon the Court\u2019s acquiescence. 384 U.S. at 731. <em>See also </em>Gosa v.

Mr. Justice Stewart\u2019s opinion for the Court, after reviewing the Court\u2019s automobile-search decisions and its administrative-inspection decisions, concluded that neither line of authority \u201cprovide[s] any support for the constitutionality of the stop and search in the present case * * 413 U.S. at 272.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Clearly, then, <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>overruled no earlier Supreme Court precedent; rather, it reaffirmed well-established Fourth Amendment standards dating back to Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914), and Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">Nor did <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>disturb a long-accepted and relied-upon practice. Although the government claims that it has relied upon judicial approval of roving searches prior to June 21, 1973, it has cited only one of our opinions, prior to our overruled decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>holding that government agents on roving patrol can stop and search automobiles without either probable cause or warrant. United States v. Miranda, 426 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">All of our other <em>pre-Almeida-Sanchez </em>decisions upholding roving-patrol searches away from the border involved stops that were predicated upon: (a) probable cause to believe that the automobile stopped was carrying illegal aliens or contraband, <em>see e. g., </em>United States v. Ardle, 435 F.2d 861 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 947, 91 S.Ct. 1638, 29 L.Ed.2d 116 (1971); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Kandlis, 432 F.2d 132 (9th Cir. 1970); or (b) a reasonable certainty that any contraband which might be found in or on the vehicle at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the search was aboard the vehicle at the time it entered the United States, <em>see, e. g., </em>Alexander v. United States, 362 F.2d 379 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 519, 17 L.Ed.2d 439 (1966); or (c) a reasonable certainty that the vehicle searched contained either goods which have just been smuggled or a person who has just crossed the border illegally. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Weil, 432 F.2d 1320, 1323 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 947, 91 S.Ct. 933, 28 L.Ed.2d 230 (1971). <em>See generally </em>Note, In Search of the Border: Federal Customs and Immigration Officers, 5 N.Y.U.J. Int\u2019l L. &amp; Politics 93 (1972). Moreover, our line of decisions, and that of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (see, <em>e. g., </em>Roa-Rodriguez v. United States, 410 F.2d 1206 (10th Cir. 1969)), permitting roving searches by the border patrol, enjoyed only brief acceptance and failed its first test before the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The government fares no better in its alternate claim that it was relying not only on prior judicial approval of roving searches but also upon the literal command of Congress and a regulation authorizing such searches. Section 287(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(3), provides for warrantless searches of automobiles and other conveyances \u201cwithin a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States * * This section, enacted in 1952, revised in a manner not relevant here a statute enacted in 1946. Act of Aug. 7, 1946, ch. 768, 60 Stat. 865. Soon after the 1952 revision, the Attorney General promulgated regulations, one of which defined \u201creasonable distance\u201d as \u201cwithin 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States * * *.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">This statute and regulation must, however, be read in light of the Fourth Amendment; and when so understood, they merely delegate authority to be exercised by border-patrol agents in accordance with constitutional limitations. Without the statutory authorization conferred by \u00a7 287(a)(3), border-patrol agents would not have legal power to search private vehicles for aliens under any circumstances. Under the statute, they are permitted to conduct certain warrantless searches. But, unless the search qualifies as a border search, the statute should not be read, as this court has read it, to dispense with the requirement of probable cause as well as the requirement of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">When the Supreme Court reversed us in <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>it did not declare the statute unconstitutional; it merely read the Fourth Amendment require-ment of probable cause into the right of border-patrol agents to conduct war-rantless searches which were not the functional equivalents of border searches. Other sections of the same act had earlier been subjected to similar judicial constructions to avoid conflicts with constitutional standards. <em>See </em>United States v. Almeida-Sanchez, 452 F.2d 459, 465-467 (9th Cir. 1971) (dissenting opinion of Browning J.), rev\u2019d, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). Judicial interpretation of a statute and departmental regulation to eliminate conflict with the Fourth Amendment hardly qualifies as the kind of \u201cnew\u201d constitutional rule sufficient to deny an appellant the fruits of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">Peltier is not claiming the benefit of any decision overruling or enlarging \u201cthen-applicable constitutional norms,\u201d Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. at 654; rather, he seeks the application of principles enunciated by Chief Justice Taft in 1925 in Carroll and consistently adhered to by the Supreme Court thereafter. This is a case not so much of the retroactivity of <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>as of the continued vitality of <em>Carroll </em>and its successors. The Supreme Court in <em>Al-meida-Sanchez </em>was not announcing a new legal doctrine, but correcting an aberration. Peltier is entitled to the benefit of the rule announced in <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>not because of retroactivity but because of Fourth Amendment principles never deviated from by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>A Supreme Court decision overruling state or circuit court decisions does not necessarily mark a departure from prior decisions of the Supreme Court. Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). The Supreme Court faced the question whether Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970), which barred du- ' plicate prosecutions when a single act violated both state and municipal laws, was fully retroactive. The Court concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-4\">\u201c* * * [T]his Court had not earlier had occasion to squarely pass on the issue. But its decision in <em>Waller </em>cannot be said to have marked a departure from past decisions of this Court. Therefore, while <em>Waller-type </em>cases may involve a form of practical prejudice to the State over and above the refusal to permit the trial which the Constitution bars, the justifiability of the State\u2019s reliance on lower court decisions supporting the dual sovereignty analogy was a good deal more dubious than the justification for reliance which has been given weight in our <em>Linkletter </em>[v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601] line of cases * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">\u201cWe hold, therefore, that our decision in Waller v. Florida [397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970)], is to be accorded full retroactive effect * * * \u201d Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. at 510-511.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">The conclusion which we have reached here may or may not be consistent with the result in the other circuits that have before them the application of <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>to searches conducted prior to June 21, 1973. The Fifth Circuit recently held that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>is not to be given retrospective effect. United States v. Miller, 492 F.2d 37 (5th Cir., 1974). However, its opinion does not mention three other cases in which the circuit applied <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>retroactively without discussion. <em>See </em>United States v. Speed, 489 F.2d 478 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. McKim, 487 F.2d 305 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Byrd, 483 F.2d 1196 (5th Cir. 1973). The Tenth Circuit also has applied <em>AlmeidaSanchez </em>to pending cases in which the search occurred prior to the decision in <em>Almeida-Sanchez. See </em>United States v. King, 485 F.2d 353, 359 (10th Cir. 1973); United States v. Maddox, 485 F.2d 361, 363 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">The judgment of conviction is reversed, and the matter remanded to the district court with instructions to suppress the evidence seized in the search of Peltier\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">Circuit Judges CHAMBERS, MERRILL, BROWNING, DUNIWAY, ELY and HUFSTEDLER concur in this majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">. We do not have before us the question of the effect of <em>Almeiia-8 anches </em>upon a eon-viction being tested in a collateral attack, and we express no opinion upon that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">. Mr. Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion, also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-6\">\u201c * * * [I] join in the opinion of the Court, which sufficiently establishes that none of our Fourth Amendment decisions supports the search conducted in this case * * 413 U.S. at 275.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">. We concede that a number of other opinions do contain some dicta from which the government might infer that this court would uphold a roving-patrol search so long as it was conducted within the 100-mile area defined in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1. <em>See, e. g., </em>Du-prez v. United States, 435 F.2d 1276, 1277 (9th Cir. 1970); Fumagalli v. United States, 429 F.2d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Elder, 425 F.2d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir. 1970); Barba-Reyes v. United States, 387 F.2d 91 (9th Cir. 1967); Fernandez v. United States, 321 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1963); Contreras v. United States, 291 F.2d 63 (9th Cir. 1961). Nonetheless, United States v. Miranda, <em>supra, </em>is the only ease which has been called to our attention in which this court held that a stop and search conducted by immigration agents on roving patrol was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1054-11\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"abn-dedup-1\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">The majority does not attempt to justify retroactivity based upon the tests of Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), and Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). Rather it asserts that before the question of retroactivity even becomes relevant, we must decide whether the Court in Almei-da-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), articulated a \u201cnew\u201d constitutional rule. In order to be new, the majority contends, the constitutional rule must overrule \u201cclear past precedent\u201d or disrupt \u201ca practice long accepted and widely relied upon.\u201d This threshold test comes from a footnote in Justice Stewart\u2019s dissent in Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, 381-382 n. 2, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 2180, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972). As we noted in United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d 960, 975 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1974), it is unclear whether this abridged test should be applied in all cases. But even applying the test adopted by the majority, I disagree that the <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>pronouncement is not new and, therefore, I believe the <em>Stovall </em>test is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-14\">The majority contends that the appropriate interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>demonstrates that the rule is not new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>and dictates retroactivity. But the majority, falling into the same error as the majority did in Part I of United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d 962, 968 (9th Cir. 1974) (Wallace, J. dissenting), fails to distinguish between where a majority of Justices has made a pronouncement and where it has not. Justice White, writing for himself and three other Justices, reviewed decisions of each of the courts of appeals having jurisdiction over districts bordering Mexico and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">[Tjhose courts and judges best positioned to make intelligent and sensible assessments of the requirements of reasonableness in the context of controlling illegal entries into this country have consistently and almost without dissent come to the same conclusion that is embodied in the judgment that is reversed today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">413 U.S. at 298 (footnote omitted). Justice Powell, although concurring in the Opinion of the Court, agreed with Justice White\u2019s conclusion on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxW\">Roving automobile searches in border regions for aliens, likewise, have been consistently approved by the judiciary. While the question is one of first impression in this Court, such searches uniformly have been sustained by the courts of appeals whose jurisdictions include those areas of the border between Mexico and the United States where the problem has been most severe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">413 U.S. at 278. The tenor of these statements, representing five of the nine Justices, seems more consistent with the conclusion that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>established a new constitutional rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">Even ignoring that a majority of the Supreme Court may well believe that <em>Al-meida-Sanchez </em>constitutes a new rule, the test adopted by the majority, when properly applied, also demonstrates that the rule of <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>is new. Under the first alternative of the majority\u2019s test, a decision constitutes a new constitutional rule if it overrules \u201cclear past precedent.\u201d It cannot be contended that to meet this alternative, the Supreme Court must reverse one of its prior decisions. On the contrary, as we held in United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d 960, 976 (9th Cir. 1974): \u201cThe test does not require . . . that the Supreme Court reverse itself in order for there to be an overruling of clear past precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">Prior to <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>the courts of appeals gave <em>no </em>indication that roving stops and searches were unconstitutional. <em>See, e.g., </em>United States v. Miranda, 426 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1970); Roa-Rodriquez v. United States, 410 F.2d 1206 (10th Cir. 1969). <em>See </em>United States v. McDaniel, 463 F.2d 129 (5th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 413 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 3046, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1973). The majority contends that this stream of judicial pronouncements is a mere aberration. However, these consistent holdings can hardly be said to be a deviation from the law when 35 of 36 judges who have considered the question in the three circuits involved in enforcing the immigration laws along our Mexican border have upheld immigration stops and searches. Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. at 298-299 n. 10 (White, J., dissenting). <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>does overrule clear past precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-14\">The majority\u2019s treatment of the statute pursuant to which the Border Patrol acted also deserves attention. Since 1952, searches for aliens within a reasonable distance from the border have been authorized by Congress. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(3). Merely stating, as does the majority, that statutes have to be measured by the Constitution only begs the question. As we held in United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d at 977:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1055-15\">Although it is true that statutes have to be measured by the Constitution, a legally enacted statute becomes the law until it is vitiated by a court decision. Where the constitutionality of the statute has been repeatedly upheld by the lower courts, it becomes a clear precedent for law enforcement action. Prior statutory law should be treated no differently from prior case law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>The identical statute which we held to be clear past precedent in <em>Bowen </em>is involved in this case. There we held that in applying the first alternative of the threshold test, \u201c[p]rior statutory law should be treated no differently from prior case law.\u201d United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d at 977 I, therefore, fail to see why <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>does not overrule clear past precedent, both statutory and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Under the second alternative of the majority\u2019s test, a decision constitutes a new constitutional rule if it \u201cdisrupts a practice long accepted and widely relied upon.\u201d Justice Stewart, in Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 106, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971), formulated the second alternative in language that adds an additional dimension. He stated that a decision may constitute a new rule either by overruling past precedent (the first alternative of the majority\u2019s test) \u201cor by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed . . . .\u201d Under the <em>Chevron Oil </em>formulation of the test, <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>clearly constitutes a new rule. First, the majority concedes that this issue has not previously been presented to the Supreme Court, making it by definition \u201can issue of first impression\u201d before that Court. Second, the resolution of an issue that would invalidate immigration stops and searches was not foreshadowed. As Justice White stated in <em>Almeida-Sanchez:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-6\">.. I cannot but uphold the judgment of Congress that for purposes of enforcing the immigration laws it is reasonable to treat the exterior boundaries of the country as a zone, not a line, and that there are recurring circumstances in which the search of vehicular traffic without warrant and without probable cause may be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment although not carried out at the border itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-7\">This has also been the considered judgment of the three Courts of Appeals whose daily concern is the enforcement of the immigration laws along the Mexican-Ameriean border, and who, although as sensitive to constitutional commands as we are, perhaps have a better vantage point than we here on the Potomac to judge the practicalities of border-area law enforcement and the reasonableness of official searches of vehicles to enforce the immigration statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">413 U.S. at 294-295. Numerous appellate court cases have dealt with this issue and yet, the result prior to <em>Almeida-San-chez </em>was consistently to uphold the stop and search. There simply was no foreshadowing of the <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">However, even under the majority\u2019s formulation of the second alternative, <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>still constitutes a new rule. The majority reaches an opposite conclusion by contending that there is only one prior decision in our circuit squarely upholding the roving patrol search. The majority observes in a footnote that, in cases dating back to 1961, we have approved similar immigration searches (500 F.2d at 978, n. 3), but discounts all of those cases on the basis that any approving language is dicta. The majority, however, fails to explain why this classification should make a difference. The cases, whether or not the language is dicta, are important because they demonstrate a long accepted practice that has been widely relied upon. Apparently four Justices of the Supreme Court did not make such a distinction, for Justice White stated in reference to our circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-11\">[Ujnder \u00a7 1357(a)(3), automobiles may be stopped without warrant or probable cause and a limited search for aliens carried out in those portions of the conveyance capable of concealing any illegal immigrant. <em>This has been the consistent view of that court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\"><em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>413 U.S. at 295 (White, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-13\">Not only has the Border Patrol been following a practice sanctioned by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>prior cases, it has also been complying with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(3) in making roving patrol stops. The statute explicitly authorizes immigration officials, within a reasonable distance of the border, to search vehicles without a warrant for illegal aliens. The statute in its present form was adopted in 1952. Since 1963, we have upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Fernandez v. United States, 321 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1963). A law enforcement practice, authorized for over a decade, adequately meets the second requirement of the majority\u2019s threshold test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">If either alternative of the majority\u2019s threshold test is met, <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>states a new rule. Here, both alternatives are met and, therefore, retroactivity should be judged by the <em>Stovall </em>test. Applying that test and for reasons similar to those stated in Part II of United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d at 975, I would hold that the retroactivity test would require prospective application in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the Court stated in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. at 637:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-7\">In rejecting the <em>Wolf </em>doctrine as to the exclusionary rule the purpose was to deter the lawless action of the police and to effectively enforce the Fourth Amendment. That purpose will not at this late date be served by the wholesale release of the guilty victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Circuit Judges KOELSCH, EUGENE A. WRIGHT, TRASK, CHOY and SNEED concur in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">. The majority\u2019s disclaimer in footnote 1, reserving the question of the application of <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>to collateral attacks upon prior convictions, does not minimize the potential havoc tl le majority\u2019s ruling could have on the administration of justice. Because of its retroactivity stance, any distinction between a defendant with a case on appeal at the time of the <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>decision and the countless others whose convictions were final prior to that time would be artificial at best. It appears to me that if the Court in <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>did not enunciate a new rule, all convictions based upon evidence obtained during a roving patrol search without warrant or probable cause must be reversed,, regardless of whether they are now final or on direct review. This conclusion is supported by the Court\u2019s statement in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 300, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-21\">We also conclude that, for these purposes, no distinction is justified between convictions now final, as in the instant ease, and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-22\">As Justice White said in Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 656, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1154, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-23\">[I] t should be clear that we find no constitutional difference between the applicability of <em>Ghimel </em>to those prior convictions that are here on direct appeal and those involving collateral proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-24\">Three other Justices joined in Justice White\u2019s opinion and Justice Marshall\u2019s dissent can be considered to be in harmony with the language quoted to the extent that he would apply the <em>Stovall </em>test in cases that are before the Court on collateral attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
