In an attempt to secure certain graduated vacation pay benefits from their employer, Allied Chemical Corporation, alleging their entitlement thereto under the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1971, they instituted appropriate grievance proceedings pursuant to the Agreement. Their claim was ultimately rejected by the umpire selected to arbitrate the dispute in the final step of the contractual five-tier grievance procedure. The Agreement provides that an umpire\u2019s decision \u201cshall be final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-21\">Dissatisfied with the umpire\u2019s decision, appellants brought suit in the district court to have the decision vacated on the grounds that \u201csaid adverse decision of the umpire is discrimination [sic], erroneous, wrong, unlawful and in violation of their legal rights.\u201d The district court, in a lengthy and considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted Allied Chemical Corporation\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Relying on the <em>Steelworkers </em>Trilogy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court correctly concluded that it could not review the merits of the umpire\u2019s award; instead, review was limited to the narrower issues of whether the umpire\u2019s decision \u201cdrew its essence\u201d from the Agreement, whether there was evidence of fraud, deceit or breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation, or whether the grievance procedure was a sham, substantially inadequate or substantially unavailable. Harris v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, 437 F.2d 167 (5 Cir. 1971); Amalgamated Butcher Workmen Local No. 641 v. Capitol Packing Co., 413 F.2d 668 (10 Cir. 1969); Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, 405 F.2d 1123 (3 Cir. 1969); Safely v. Time Freight, Inc., 307 F.Supp. 319 (W.D.Va.1969), aff\u2019d 424 F.2d 1367 (4 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">We agree with the district court that the umpire\u2019s decision must not be disturbed. Despite the catchwords employed by appellants to persuade us that the umpire\u2019s decision is in fact reviewable \u2014 they claim, for example, that the grievance procedure was a \u201csham and substantially inadequate,\u201d and that the decision amounted to \u201carbitrariness and capriciousness\u201d \u2014 we must look to the substance of their claim. Having done so, we are convinced that their argument is simply that the umpire reached an incorrect result. While they argue that the umpire\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement was so incorrect as to amount to a dispensing of his own brand of industrial justice, we conclude that the district court correctly rejected this argument. No conclusion can be reached other than that the umpire made a careful, reasoned attempt to construe a hazy provision of the contract. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Enterprise Wheel and Car Co., supra, </em>363 U.S. at 599, 80 S.Ct. at 1362,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIWp\">the question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision concerns construction of the contract, the courts have no business overruling him<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because their interpretation of the contract is different from his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">. Accordingly, we dispense with oral argument and the judgment below will be affirmed for the reasons stated by the district court (367 F.Supp. 1133).</p>\n<p id=\"axn-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">.
