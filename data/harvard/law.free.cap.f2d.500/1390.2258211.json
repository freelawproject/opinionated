Claim 12 stands allowed. The main issue in this appeal is whether the Board of Appeals has statutory administrative jurisdiction to reject appealed claims on new grounds. We affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">\n<em>The Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">Claim 8 adequately exemplifies the claimed subject matter for our disposition of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-12\">8. In the process for producing pigmentary metal oxide by vapor phase oxidation of the corresponding metal halide in a reactor wherein reactants are introduced into said reactor through a reactant inlet nozzle assembly upon the exposed surfaces of which metal oxide deposits, the improvement which comprises inhibiting the growth of said metal oxide deposits by vibrating directly said inlet nozzle assembly at vibrational frequencies and with force sufficient to inhibit said growth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-14\">Appellant\u2019s specification (other than the claims) and one of the two references relied on by the board were omitted from the printed transcript of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">\n<em>Patent Office Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AI4\">In the Final Action and the Examiner\u2019s Answer, the examiner rejected claims 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 11 under 35 U. S.C. \u00a7 112. The basis for this rejection was that the claims were \u201cvaguely and functionally expressed\u201d and \u201cindefinite\u201d or \u201cunduly broad.\u201d No prior art rejection under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 or 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 was made nor were any prior art references cited by the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-16\">The board determined that the examiner\u2019s rejection was \u201cpredicated on the fact that the appealed claims do not recite specific numerical ranges for the frequency and force at which the vibration of the reactor nozzle is performed.\u201d It reversed this rejection and further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-17\">* * * * -X- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-18\">However, we do not believe that the appealed claims recite a patentable invention. Hence, we are required to make a new rejection of these claims under the provisions of Rule 196(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-19\">Claims 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 11 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over \u201cVibrating,\u201d the Vibco Inc. publication [cited by appellant in a Rule 116 amendment], and \u201cVibrolator Vibrators,\u201d the Martin Engineering Company publication [cited by board].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-20\">We make this new rejection fully cognizant of the fact that the Examiner has allowed claim 12. The allowed claim differs from the newly rejected claims only in reciting specific values for the force and frequency of the vibration used in the instant process. The Examiner may wish to review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>allowance of claim 12 in the light of our present holdings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-4\">The decision of the Examiner is reversed. We have made a new rejection of the appealed claims under the provisions of Rule 196(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-5\">* -X- * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">Appellant did not seek any reconsideration provided for in Rule 196(b) and appealed directly to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">\n<em>Appellant\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A-km\">Appellant contends that the Board of Appeals is not authorized by statute to originate, <em>sua sponte, </em>a truly new rejection of appealed claims and that any such action exceeds its jurisdiction conferred solely by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that since Patent Office Rule 196(b), 37 CFR 1.196(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is an effort by the Commissioner of Patents to confer jurisdiction on the Board of Appeals greater than that authorized by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7, the rule is invalid as inconsistent with law under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">Finally, appellant contends that the Board of Appeals has denied him due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment by the \u201cadverse comment\u201d on allowed claim 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-14\">Appellant has not briefed or argued the merits of the board\u2019s new rejection based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-15\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-16\">\n<em>The Board\u2019s Statutory Administrative Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-17\"> We hold that the Board of Appeals acted within its statutory administrative jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 when it rejected the appealed claims on a new ground. Therefore, we further hold that the relevant part of Rule 196(b) is \u201cnot inconsistent with law\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-18\">The statutory scheme enacted by the Congress convinces us that the phrase \u201creview adverse decisions of examiners\u201d as used in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 is not to be interpreted restrictively. The members of the Board of Appeals are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>denominated \u201cexaminers-in-chief\u201d in both 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 (\u201cOfficers and employees\u201d) and 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7. The title chosen by the Congress implies that the members of the board have authority <em>to examine </em>or <em>reexamine </em>appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Furthermore, the right of an applicant to appeal from the decision of the primary examiner to the Board of Appeals is given by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 134,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is part of \u201cChapter <em>12 </em>\u2014 Examination of Application\u201d (emphasis ours) in Title 35 U.S.C. Thus, the Congress created a Board of Appeals, composed of \u201cexaminers-in-chief,\u201d which functions as part of the overall Patent Office examination process noted by the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 694, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-6\">* * * it must be remembered that the primary responsibility for sifting, out unpatentable material lies in <em>the Patent Office. </em>To await litigation is \u2014for all practical purposes \u2014 to debilitate the patent system. * * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">This court has frequently approved the action of the Board of Appeals in rejecting appealed claims on new grounds. For example, In re Peterson, 189 F.2d 288, 291, 38 CCPA 1068, 1073 (1951), contains the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-9\">It is trite to state that it is within the jurisdiction of the Board of Appeals to apply grounds of rejection not relied upon by the examiner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-10\">' -X- -X- *</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-11\">Another example is In re Hughes, 345 F.2d 184, 185, 52 CCPA 1355, 1357 (1965), where this court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afs-dedup-1\">We do not mean by this to imply that the Board of Appeals may not, if it sees fit, enter new or alternative grounds for rejection of claims in an appealed application. Such practice is not uncommon and is often of great value in clarifying the examiner\u2019s position or in correcting errors and oversights. And if the new ground of rejection is properly identified as such, the applicant is in no way prejudiced, for he has the benefit of the adequate procedural safeguards of Buie 196(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-17\">The historical origin of the phrase \u201creview adverse decisions of examiners\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7) traces back to Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1861, ch. 88, 12 Stat. 246, where the language \u201cto revise and determine upon\u201d was employed. In Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U.S. 50, 66, 5 S.Ct. 25, 33, 28 L.Ed. 656 (1884), the Supreme Court made this statement regarding that section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-18\">The act of [March 2,] 1861, c. 88, 12 Stat. 246, created the office of examiners in chief, \u201cfor the purpose of securing greater uniformity of action in the grant and refusal of letters patent,\u201d \u201cto be composed of persons of competent legal knowledge and scientific ability, whose duty it shall be, on the written petition of the applicant for that purpose being filed, to <em>revise and determine upon </em>the validity of decisions made by examiners when adverse to the grant of letters patent; -x- *_\u00bb [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">The 1841 edition of Noah Webster\u2019s <em>An American Dictionary Of The English Language, </em>vol. II, p. 486, contains the following definitions of \u201crevise\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-20\">1. To review; to re-examine; to look over with care for correction; as, to <em>revise </em>a writing; to <em>revise </em>a proof sheet. Pope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1457-21\">2. To review, alter and amend; as, to <em>revise </em>statutes. Boyle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1457-22\">Thus, the Congress, in its original enactment on this point, expressed an intent to confer upon the examiners-in-chief the power to examine or reexamine appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>\n<em>The Board\u2019s Comment on Allowed Claim 12</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention is that the board\u2019s \u201cadverse comment\u201d on allowed claim 12 denied him due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an action taken by the Boardg of Appeals must amount to a \u201cdecision\u201d or this court has no jurisdiction to review that action. In re James, 432 F.2d 473, 57 CCPA 1371 (1970). Here, the board\u2019s comment did not amount to a \u201cdecision.\u201d The board merely stated: \u201c[t]he Examiner may wish to review the allowance of claim 12 in the light of our present holdings.\u201d Hence, this portion of the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">\n<em>The Merits of the Board\u2019s New Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">Appellant\u2019s notice and reasons of appeal filed with the Commissioner under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 142 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would justify our consideration of the merits of the board\u2019s new rejection based on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. However, appellant\u2019s failure to brief and argue the merits of the new rejection must be construed as an abandonment thereof for the purposes of this appeal. See In re Golen, 352 F.2d 385, 53 CCPA 724 (1965) and In re Le Baron, 223 F.2d 471, 42 CCPA 956 (1955). Therefore, the board\u2019s new rejection of claims 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 11 under 35 U. 5. C. \u00a7 103 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">In summary, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed on the issue of its statutory administrative jurisdiction to reject appealed claims on a new ground and on the merits of the new rejection. Insofar as the appeal relates to the board\u2019s comment on allowed claim 12, it is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1455-21\">.

The appellant may submit an appropriate amendment of the claims so rejected or a showing of facts, or both, and have the matter reconsidered by the primary examiner. The statement shall be binding upon the primary examiner unless an amendment or showing of facts not previously of record be made which, in the opinion of the primary\" examiner, avoids the additional ground for rejection stated in the decision. The applicant may waive such reconsideration before the primary examiner and have the case reconsidered by the Board of Appeals upon the same record before them. Where request for such reconsideration is made the Board of Appeals shall, if necessary, render a new decision which shall include all grounds upon which a patent is refused. The applicant may waive reconsideration by the Board of Appeals and treat the decision, including the added grounds for rejection given by the Board of Appeals, as a final decision in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1456-20\">. \u00a7 6.
