The principal charges alleged in the complaint were that (1) TMR had mismanaged the Fund;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) TMR wrongfully acquired the right to use the name \u201cManhattan Fund\u201d; and (3) the sale of TMR to CNA in effect involved the sale of the investment advisory contract with the Fund,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which plaintiffs contended was a corporate opportunity for which the Fund, rather than defendants, should receive compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">\n<em>Proceedings Leading to Approval of Amended Settlement Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">On November 30, 1970 the parties entered into a \u201cStipulation and Agreement of Settlement and Compromise\u201d whereby TMR agreed to relinquish to the Fund all \u201cright, title and interest\u201d in the use of the words \u201cManhattan\u201d and \u201cManhattan Fund\u201d, and new TMR agreed to reduce the Fund\u2019s management fees for a ten year period commencing January 1, 1971. The settlement agreement was submitted to Judge McLean, who entered an order setting a hearing for March 19, 1971. His order provided that notice be given to all stockholders of the Fund, and that stockholders who object to the settlement \u201cmay appear at the hearing and show cause why the settlement and compromise * * * should not be approved as fair, reasonable and adequate * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Appellants Kornreich, Jqlien and Levine filed written objections and memo-randa and appeared at the hearing to protest approval of the settlement. In substance they argued that the settlement was inadequate on the grounds that (1) it gave no recognition to the charge that defendants had wrongfully profited from the sale of the Fund\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>management contract with TMR; and (2) the proposed reduction in management fees was illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Counsel for plaintiffs stated that the charge with respect to the sale of the Fund\u2019s management contract was not specifically addressed in the settlement because there were indications that the Securities and Exchange Commission had changed its previous position that the management contract was an asset of the Fund, and because there were \u201ca number of decisions * * * indicating that when stockholders of an advisory management fund sell their stock it is their own profit and no part of it belongs to the \u201cFund\u201d.. In considering the \u201cproblems of success or failure\u201d on this issue, it was decided that it would be in the best interests of the Fund and its stockholders to agree to the settlement, which in substance provided only for a ten year reduction in management fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In contending that the proposed reduction in management fees was illusory, appellants first argued that the reduction in fees would be offset by refunds which the investment adviser would be required to make to the Fund if management expenses exceeded the amounts allowable under the blue sky laws of several states, most notably California. Appellants pointed out that blue sky refunds for 1970 totalled $410,643, whereas the estimated proposed reduction in management fees for 1971 was only $92,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The parties to the settlement agreement did not deny that blue sky refunds would constitute an offset to the proposed management fee reduction, but contended that (1) if the refunds became burdensome, the Fund \u201cmay have to withdraw entirely\u201d from the states that exact expense limitations; and (2) in any event, it was highly unlikely that the \u201cunusual, unprecedented and extraordinary market conditions\u201d which made the expense limitations operative in 1970 would recur during the ten year period of the fee reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">In order to insure that the parties were sincere in their statements that there will no longer be any liability on the part of the Advisor to repay the Fund because of the operation of the Blue Sky Laws\u201d, counsel for appellants Julien and Levine, by letter dated March ' 30, 1971 addressed to Judge McLean, recommended that \u201cthe stipulation of settlement be amended to provide that the reduction of the management fee * * * shall be in addition to any repayments required under the provisions of the blue sky laws\u201d. The suggested amendment was not incorporated in the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Pointing out that under paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement the guaranteed reduction was contingent on the existence of a management contract with a subsidiary of CNA or its parent corporation, appellants contended that the possibilities of a termination of the contract<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or sale of TMR or assignment of the contract to a non-subsidiary of CNA or its parent made the ten year guarantee \u201cillusory and a hoax\u201d, and that the proposed guarantee could only be satisfied by an unconditional promise to reduce management fees by a specified dollar amount. The parties admitted, under questioning by the court, that there was no guarantee of a specified dollar reduction, but argued that there was \u201ca real reduction\u201d in terms of percentages \u201cas long as the contract continues\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">At the hearing counsel for appellant Kornreich cited Judge McLean\u2019s approval of the settlement proposal in the <em>Dreyfus </em>case, reported as Kurach v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Weissman, 49 F.R.D. 304 (S.D.N.Y. 1970). In <em>Dreyfus </em>the original settlement provided that the management fee reduction was contingent upon the continued legality of a brokerage arrangement between the Dreyfus Fund and a subsidiary of the managing corporation. The Securities and Exchange Commission objected to the settlement, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the contingent nature of the fee reduction rendered it illusory. Counsel for the parties decided to amend the settlement to provide that the minimum fee reduction would be \u201cabsolute and unconditional, regardless of any future change in the law\u201d. The court approved the settlement as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Counsel for appellant Kornreich argued that under <em>Dreyfus </em>the management fee reduction proposed by the parties was defective because of its contingent nature' and the fact that there was no minimum guarantee of a set dollar amount. Judge McLean stated that he had not \u201cconsidered the Dreyfus ease at all since this thing came up\u201d, and at the close of the hearing he commented that in making his decision he would \u201cget more familiar with * * * the Dreyfus case than I am at the moment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Prior to Judge McLean\u2019s decision on the settlement, this court on June 22, 1971 decided Rosenfeld v. Black, 445 F.2d 1337 (2 Cir. 1971), cert. dismissed, 409 U.S. 802, 93 S.Ct. 24, 34 L.Ed.2d 62 (1972). In <em>Rosenfeld </em>the plaintiffs, stockholders of a mutual fund known as The Lazard Fund, Inc., alleged that the Fund\u2019s investment adviser had wrongfully received compensation for effecting a transfer of its investment advisory office. The district court had granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, 319 F.Supp. 891 (S.D.N.Y.1970). We reversed, holding that there was \u201cno reason why the \u2018well-established principle of equity\u2019 forbidding realization of profit for effecting the turn-over of corporate or other fiduciary office should not apply to the investment adviser of a mutual fund\u201d, 445 F.2d at 1343, and that this \u201cprinciple of equity\u201d had not been superseded by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. <em>Id. </em>at 1344-1348.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is conceded that <em>Rosenfeld </em>added substantial force to plaintiffs\u2019 claim, previously unrecognized in the settlement, that defendants had wrongfully profited by effecting a transfer and sale of the Fund\u2019s management contract with TMR.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">It appears from a transcript of a hearing before Judge McLean on December 17, 1971<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that following the decision in <em>Rosenfeld </em>counsel for plaintiffs and defendants met with him on June 29, 1971 and requested that he withhold his decision on the settlement because, in light of <em>Rosenfeld, </em>they wanted to consider an amended settlement agreement more favorable to the Fund.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge McLean informed counsel that he had decided to disapprove the original settlement agreement, but agreed to \u201cwithhold decision until the amended settlement proposal came in\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">The parties agreed to submit an amended settlement in early September, but they failed to comply with this self-imposed deadline. Judge McLean expressed dissatisfaction with the delay. He announced that if the amended settlement agreement were not submitted by December 31, 1971, he would \u201cproceed to deny the application [to approve the settlement] which has been pending before me since March, I will pass immediately upon the motions which I have been holding up and also upon Mr. Ju-lien\u2019s present motion [to intervene], and I will not entertain any further proposals in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>On December 28, 1971 the parties submitted an amended stipulation of settlement, more favorable to the Fund than the original proposal, in that it provided for a guarantee to the Fund of a fee reduction of $250,000 should the contract be terminated during the ten year period, and that nine former shareholders of TMR would deliver to the Fund stock of CNA worth $1,000,000 in settlement of the claim based on the <em>Rosenfeld </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">On January 12, 1972 Judge McLean entered an order setting March 17 as the date for the hearing to determine whether the amended settlement was \u201cfair, proper, reasonable and adequate\u201d and providing for notice to the Fund shareholders. During January and February depositions of principal witnesses were taken to aid in determining the adequacy of the settlement, and, pursuant to Judge McLean\u2019s instructions, counsel for appellants were allowed to participate in the taking of the depositions and conducted a substantial portion of the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">At the hearing appellants Kornreich, Julien and Levine, joined by appellants Shainwald, objected to the amended settlement proposal, contending that the problem of the blue sky refunds had not been cured and that the $1,000,000 in CNA stock was inadequate in settlement of the <em>Rosenfeld </em>type claim. The parties, on the other hand, defended the adequacy of the settlement, and with respect to the blue sky refunds argued that although refunds of $410,643 and $53,373 were made in 1970 and 1971, respectively, it was an \u201cextremely remote\u201d possibility that such refunds would occur \u201cin the next ten years\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">On September 18, 1972 Judge McLean issued an opinion approving the amended settlement. Noting appellants\u2019 contention that the $1,000,000 settlement of the <em>Rosenfeld </em>claim was inadequate, Judge McLean concluded, after a thorough analysis, that the recovery was \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d. With respect to the blue sky refunds, Judge McLean could \u201csee nothing in the proposed settlement agreement to the effect that any payment required by state blue sky laws is to be offset against the reduction in the management fee\u201d. Rather, \u201cUnder the settlement agreement, TMR will be obligated to reduce the management fee in the specified amount.\u201d He concluded that \u201cIf [TMR] is also obligated by reason of state blue sky laws to pay money to the Fund, the latter payment will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, [the management fee reduction].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">As noted <em>supra, </em>following Judge McLean\u2019s death, the case was transferred to Judge Ward, who entered a judgment on December 18, 1972 pursuant to Judge McLean\u2019s opinion, which, <em>inter alia, </em>approved the amended settlement and dismissed the consolidated action with prejudice. The court retained jurisdiction for the purpose of passing upon \u201cany applications which may be made by plaintiffs or objectors or their counsel and accountants for an allowance of fees and disbursements incurred by them in the prosecution and settlement of the * * * consolidated action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Counsel for plaintiffs submitted an application for attorneys\u2019 and accountants\u2019 fees and disbursements in the amount of $400,OOO.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Their request was accompanied by affidavits and exhibits setting forth in detail the services of the counsel and accountants and the benefits accruing to the Fund as the result of the amended settlement, which plaintiffs estimated at $2,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Appellants filed similar applications, contending that their efforts had resulted in the incorporation of improvements in the amended settlement. Specifically, they claimed \u201csole credit\u201d for the unconditional guarantee of a $250,000 reduction in management fees and the portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>of Judge McLean\u2019s opinion which held that blue sky refunds were to be in addition to, and not a credit against, the reduction in management fees. In addition, appellants claimed \u201csubstantial credit\u201d for the $1,000,000 settlement of the <em>Rosenfeld </em>claim, arguing that if it had not been for their objections Judge McLean might have approved the original settlement and agreement prior to the decision in <em>Rosenfeld. </em>Appellant Kornreieh requested fees of $75,000 and costs of $240, and the other appellants requested $125,000 in fees and costs of $397.05.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\n<em>Decision of the District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Following a hearing at which oral arguments wei&gt;e presented but no evidence submitted, Judge Ward granted the application of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in the amount of $300,000 and denied the application of appellants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">After reviewing the benefits to the Fund resulting from the settlement,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the court concluded that $2,000,000 was \u201ca reasonable estimate of the benefit to the Fund afforded by this settlement\u201d. With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 application, the court stated that the \u201cconclusion is inescapable\u201d that a substantial portion of the $2,000,000 benefit was \u201clargely due to the decision in Rosenfeld\u201d, that prior to this decision plaintiffs\u2019 counsel gave \u201cunqualified support\u201d to the original settlement, which did not provide for the $1,000,000 payment of CNA shares to the Fund, and that counsel for plaintiffs \u201cdid not request that a decision on the settlement be withheld until after a decision in <em>Rosenfeld </em>came down, nor did they indicate to Judge McLean that an appeal was pending before the Second Circuit in that case\u201d. On the other hand, the court noted that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel have spent considerable time on this matter\u201d,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and concluded that $300,000 was \u201ca fair and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee inclusive of disbursements\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">With respect to appellants\u2019 application, the court noted that it was confronted with the \u201cdifficult task\u201d of determining \u201cthe 'extent, if any, the objectors contributed to the settlement approved by Judge McLean\u201d. Stating that, \u201cThis, in some measure, is dependent upon the influence the objectors\u2019 arguments had on Judge McLean\u201d, the court observed that the extent of this inflow \u201cis simply not clear\u201d, but considered it \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that \u201cnowhere in the record did Judge McLean indicate that any objector benefitted this settlement\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">The court rejected appellants\u2019 claim that they were responsible for the guaranteed management fee reduction of $250,000, on the ground that \u201cthe guarantee was primarily a contribution of Judge McLean, and, to a lesser extent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the improved bargaining position of plaintiffs after the decision in Rosenfeld v. Black\u201d. The court noted that at oral argument counsel for certain defendants had \u201cindicated that Judge McLean insisted that the final settlement include a guaranteed fee reduction, and that he was aware of this problem from prior similar litigation\u201d in the <em>Dreyfus </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">With respect to the blue sky refunds, the court stated that \u201cJudge McLean clearly indicated that the objectors made no contribution which benefitted the settlement\u201d, since in his opinion approving the settlement he observed that he could \u201csee nothing in the proposed settlement agreement to the effect that any payment required by state blue sky laws is to be offset against the reduction in the management fee * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Finally, the court rejected appellants\u2019 contention that their objections caused Judge McLean to delay his decision until after the opinion in <em>Rosenfeld </em>had been issued. The court noted that appellants had failed to ask Judge McLean to delay his decision pending the outcome of <em>Ro-senfeld </em>on appeal, and held that appellants \u201care not entitled to the inference * * * that Judge McLean\u2019s decision was \u2018delayed\u2019 because of their efforts\u201d and that there is \u201cno indication that Judge McLean would have given less attention to this settlement in the absence of these objections\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Concluding that the objectors had \u201cshown no substantial benefit to the Fund\u201d, the court denied their applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\n<em>Denial of Fees and Disbursements for Objectors-Appellants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that shareholders\u2019 derivative actions \u201cshall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs\u201d. One of the purposes of the dual requirement of court approval and notice to shareholders is to \u201cprevent the unrighteous compromise of just shareholder\u2019s actions\u201d. 3B Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, para. 23.1.24 [1]. Accordingly, it is well settled that objectors have a valuable and important role to perform in preventing collusive or otherwise unfavorable settlements, and that, as the district court recognized, they are entitled to an allowance as compensation for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses where a proper showing has been made that the settlement was improved as a result of their efforts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Ordinarily the tri^l judge has broad discretion in deciding whether, and in what amount, attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded, since he is in the best position to determine whether the participation of objectors assisted the court and enhanced the recovery. See <em>Pergament, supra, </em>224 F.2d at 83. Here, however, we have an unusual situation in that the district judge who passed on the applications for attorneys\u2019 fees did not preside over the proceedings which formed the basis for the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">Counsel have not cited, nor have we found, any cases dealing with the fact situation here presented. It is clear that the final settlement embodied alterations urged by appellants in their objections to the first proposal. The district court concluded that the extent of the influence the objectors\u2019 arguments had on Judge McLean in enhancing the settlement \u201cis simply not clear.\u201d We agree that it is manifestly impossible to determine definitely to what extent, if any, Judge McLean may have been influenced by objectors\u2019 contentions. We do conclude, however, that appellants have made a <em>prima facie </em>showing which requires an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>hearing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See Lindy Bros. Bldrs., Inc. of Phila. v. American R. <em>&amp; </em>S. San. Corp., 487 F.2d 161, 169-170 (3 Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The appellants made a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the provision in the approved agreement for a guaranteed minimum reduction in the management fee resulted from their contention that the fee reduction provision in the initial settlement agreement was illusory in the absence of a guaranteed minimum. While the district court concluded that \u201cthe guarantee was primarily a contribution of Judge McLean\u201d, who was aware of the problem from his prior handling of the <em>Dreyfus </em>case, this is by no means clear from the record. When counsel for appellant Kornreich brought <em>Dreyfus </em>to the court\u2019s attention, Judge McLean stated that he had not \u201cconsidered the Dreyfus case at all since this thing came up\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In this regard the case is similar to Green v. Transitron Electronic Corporation, 326 F.2d 492, 498-499 (1 Cir. 1964), wherein the district court had denied an allowance to an objector\u2019s counsel on the ground that the court was aware of the problem prior to the time when the objection was made. The Court of Appeals noted that at the time of the objection \u201cnone of the court\u2019s misgivings were a matter of record\u201d, and held that it was \u201cunfair to counsel when, seeking to protect his client\u2019s interest and guided by facts apparent on the record, he spends time and effort to prepare and advance an argument which is openly adopted by the court, but then receives no credit therefor because the court was thinking along that line all the while.\u201d 326 F.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Appellants also made a <em>prima facie </em>showing with respect to the blue sky refunds. Although the settlement agreement does not contain a provision relating to such refunds, Judge McLean\u2019s opinion approving the agreement makes it clear that any blue sky refunds are to be in addition to and not a credit against the reduction in management fees. Had it not been for appellants\u2019 objection, Judge McLean would have had no occasion to consider this issue. The parties at no time contended that blue sky refunds would not be credited against the reduction in management fees. Moreover, they failed to respond to appellants\u2019 suggestion that the agreement \u201cbe amended to provide that the reduction of the management fee * * * shall be in addition to any repayments required under the provisions of the blue sky laws\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Appellants\u2019 contribution to the enhanced settlement by reason of <em>Rosen-feld </em>is more questionable. They did urge the' point decided in <em>Rosenfeld </em>at the hearing on the original settlement proposal, but apparently were not aware of that case, and in any event did not request Judge McLean to withhold his ruling pending this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ro-senfeld. </em>On the other hand, counsel for plaintiff not only did not request that a decision be withheld pending a decision in <em>Rosenfeld, </em>but actually urged approval of a settlement which did not include the <em>Rosenfeld </em>type claim. Yet, they were awarded a substantial fee, based in part on the enhanced value of the amended settlement \u2014 $75,000 in excess of the amount requested when they were urging approval of the initial agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Appellants do not claim full credit for the enhancement in the recovery by reason of the <em>Rosenfeld </em>type claim, but argue that absent their objection Judge McLean might have approved the initial agreement before <em>Rosenfeld </em>was decided. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>The district court held that appellants were \u201cnot entitled to the inference * * * that Judge McLean\u2019s decision was \u2018delayed\u2019 by their efforts\u201d. This conclusion might well be justified, but appellants should be given an opportunity to submit any proof they may have to support their contention that the delay was due, at least in part, to their objections. At an evidentiary hearing, the other parties will of course have an opportunity to rebut appellants' proof on this issue as well as appellants\u2019 other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Reversed and remanded for an eviden-tiary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. The order was entered by Judge Robert J. Ward on August 13, 1973. Proceedings seeking approval of proposed settlement agreements were handled by the late Judge Edward O. McLean, who issued an opinion approving an amended settlement on September 18, 1972. Judge McLean died a few days later, and the case was transferred to Judge Ward, who entered a judgment on December 18, 1972, pursuant to Judge McLean\u2019s opinion, approving the amended settlement and retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of passing on any applications of plaintiffs and objectors for counsel and accounting fees and expenses. By reason of the fact that tire question of allowance of fees and expenses was determined by a judge other than the trial judge, it is necessary to review the factual background in some detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">.

The merger agreement required that TMR use its best efforts to convince the stockholders of the Fund to approve termination of the management contract with TMR, and to approve, on the same terms, a new management contract with new TMR. At a meeting on August 16, 1968, the stockholders approved the management and distribution contracts with new TMR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">. In addition, counsel for the Fund stated on behalf of his client that, \u201cThere has never been any merit in this lawsuit as far as we are concerned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">. The settlement agreement set forth in a sliding-scale formula which tied the reduction in management fees to the \u201caverage of the daily net asset value of the Fund\u201d for the year in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b888-15\">. Paragraph 7 of the proposed management contract provided that the contract could be terminated by either the Fund or TMR on 90 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b889-8\">. See also Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689 (2 Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. The hearing was upon a motion of appellants Julien and Levine to intervene as plaintiffs. A similar motion to intervene was made by appellant Kornreich. The court denied both motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b889-17\">. Counsel for appellants were not present at the June 29 meeting, although they had informed Judge McLean of the decision in <em>Rosenfeld </em>by letter dated June 25, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. In fact, blue sky refunds for 1972 totalled $91,636, whereas the management fee reduction pursuant to the amended settlement amounted to only $80,426.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b890-12\">. In connection with the original settlement proposal plaintiffs had requested $225,000 in attorneys\u2019 and accountants\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. Appellant Kornreieh estimated that her attorneys spent 324 hours on the case. The estimate for the other appellants was 500 hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. The approved settlement provided that 25% of the fees and disbursements awarded plaintiffs would be paid by certain defendants. In its brief the Fund states that it has paid plaintiffs\u2019 counsel $225,000, representing its 75% share of the $300,000 fee awarded, that if the district court had awarded fees to appellants \u201cthe entire amount thereof would have constituted a charge on the settlement fund to be wholly paid by the Fund\u201d, and that accordingly \u201cthe Fund is the only party to this proceeding which has an economic interest in this appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. The benefits included the payment of stock of CNA valued at $1,000,000, the \u201cguaranteed reduction of the management fee of no less than $250,000, which reduction could, based upon an agreed formula, reach $1,000,000 within ten years\u201d, defendants\u2019 waiver of all claims for indemnification from the Fund for expenses and legal fees, the transfer to the Fund of all rights in the names \u201cManhattan Fund\u201d, and \u201cManhattan\u201d, and payment by TMR and Gerald Tsai, Jr. of 25% of the fees and disbursements awarded to attorneys and accountants for consolidated plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b891-16\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel estimated that they spent \u201cin excess of 4,881 hours in the investigation and prosecution of this action\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b891-17\">. We agree with appellants that there was never really any occasion for Judge McLean to make such an observation, since normally \u201csuch an evaluation and mention would come by fee application hearing or decision\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b892-9\">. See, e. g., Pergament v. Frazer, 132 F.Supp. 323 (E.D.Mich.1954), aff\u2019d as modified, 224 F.2d 80 (6 Cir. 1955); Winkelman v. General Motors Corporation, 48 F.Supp. 504, 512 (S.D.N.Y.1942); and Milstein v. Werner, 58 F.R.D. 544, 552 (S.D.N.Y.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. As noted <em>supra, </em>tlie district court\u2019s decision was based upon affidavits, exhibits, briefs and oral argument. No one, including appellants, demanded an evidentiary hearing, although appellants contend on appeal that \u201can evidentiary hearing should have been ordered\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b893-14\">. It is recognized that further negotiations were conducted by the parties subsequent to the <em>Rosenfeld </em>decision and also that counsel for plaintiffs were required to spend additional time as a result of appellants\u2019 objections to the amended settlement prior to its approval by Judge McLean.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
