She was 25 years of age at the time of the plea and sentence and had had no previous contacts with law enforcement authorities. An honor student and a college graduate, the appellant was the product of an intact, financially secure home. She was engaged to be married and has been married during the course of these proceedings. She made a full acknowledgment of her offense and cooperated with the Government. There was no evidence that she was connected with any organized criminal activity. On February 19, 1974, her constitutional rights to indictment and trial were waived and a plea of guilty was entered to a one count information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-7\"> Concededly, the appellant was eligible by virtue of her age and as a \u201cyoung adult offender,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209, for the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq., and could have been sentenced pursuant to its provisions. While the district court acted within the scope of its discretionary powers, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209, in rejecting her plea to be sentenced as a \u201cyoung adult offender,\u201d we are constrained to disapprove of the manner in which this was done and to remand the case for re-sentence before another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-14\">During the rather extended colloquy attendant upon her sentencing proceedings, the district court made much of the fact that the appellant came from a privileged background rather than from \u201cthe ghetto\u201d and was not the \u201cusual dumb kid.\u201d The court referred to her as one \u201cfar above the average, so that she knew what she was doing.\u201d Understandably, the appellant has been left with the impression, forcefully argued to us by her counsel, that her intelligence and privileged background were counted against her as pejorative factors disentitling her to treatment under the Youth Corrections Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s explication, coupled with its express refusal of what appears to have been a joint request of defense counsel and the United States Attorney that the court make a specific finding that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act, leads us to conclude that the court employed a fixed and mechanical approach in imposing sentence rather than a careful appraisal of the variable components relevant to the sentence upon an individual basis. Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576, 585, 79 S.Ct. 421, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 247-250, 69 S.Ct. 1529, 93 L.Ed. 1760 (1949). This situation requires us to invalidate the sentence. United States v. Brown, 470 F.2d 285, 288-289 (2d Cir. 1972); United States v. Baker, 487 F.2d 360, 362-364 (2d Cir. 1974) (Lumbard J., dissenting; Woolsey v. United States, 478 F.2d 139, 143-145 (8th Cir. 1973). We are aware that United States v. Kaylor, 491 F.2d 1133 (2d Cir. 1974) (en <em>banc) </em>dealt with the \u201cyouth offender\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and required no express finding in this case of a \u201cyoung adult offender\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that she would derive \u201cno benefit\u201d from a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act. <em>Compare </em>Dorszynski v. United States, -U.S.-, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). The presence or absence of the specific finding sought by the attorneys is not a controlling factor. The court\u2019s statements, considered as a whole, were inappropriate because they are susceptible of the meaning that only a specific class of persons can claim consideration under the provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">Under these circumstances we direct that the case be reassigned for sentence by another judge \u201cboth for the judge\u2019s sake and the appearance of justice,\u201d Mawson v. United States, 463 F.2d 29, 31 (1st Cir. 1972) <em>(per </em>curiam); United States v. Brown, supra.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-11\">Judgment reversed with instructions to vacate the sentence and to proceed to resentence in a manner consonant with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">. This conclusion is supported by Judge Travia's comments at the time of sentence :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1W\">\u201c[Sllie\u2019s not the ordinary so-called individual who . . . doesn\u2019t know the nature of her act or that she comes from such terrible circumstances that the family\u2014 she became involved. This young lady was in a different sphere of influence entirely, brought up differently. She\u2019s been to college. She\u2019s graduated from college. So that she cannot argue from the point of view that she was so-called ignorant of what was going on or that she was befuddled or was drawn into a picture or didn\u2019t know what was going on. Not the usual dumb kid who is dragged in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-11\">\u201cSo when you say she is young \u2014 sure, I wish I was young at 25 or 26. But not that young that we don\u2019t know what we are doing at that stage .... It\u2019s not like dealing with a youngster who comes out of the ghetto, who grows up to know nothing that is right except to commit one crime after another to satisfy whatever may be his problems at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-16\">\u201cA youngster at this age and this caliber, of this type of background and education, pretty much cannot plead ignorance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-17\">\u201cI am not dealing here with the usual type of individual who comes before us where they have all the \u2014 these personal problems and family problems and all that, things where they really might have an argument that they were unaware of all these ramifications of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-18\">\u201cHere we don\u2019t have \u2014 if I could use the word of a dumb kid who didn\u2019t know what she or he were doing. We have a person who in my judgment is far above the average, so that she knew what she was doing. She certainly knew the nature of what she was doing in that she was fooling around with stuff that was, you know, a little bit of dynamite.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006(e): \u201c \u2018Youth offender\u2019 means a person under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209: \u201c. . . a defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but lias not attained liis twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction. . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">. The judge on remand may wish to consider resentencing under the Youth Corrections Act since it appears that the term \u201cconviction\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209, <em>supra </em>note 3, would mean the date of the plea of guilty in the context of this case and the appellant would therefore qualify for such consideration. United States v. Kleinzahler, 306 F.Supp. 311, 313-314 (E.D.N.Y.1969); <em>cf. </em>Standley v. United States, 318 F.2d 700, 701 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1416-12\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ava\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">Before characterizing the sentencing procedure adopted by the sentencing judge in imposing sentence as \u201ca fixed and mechanical approach * * * rather than a careful appraisal of the variable components relevant to the sentence upon an individual basis\u201d and hence, as the majority states, a situation is presented which \u201crequires us [the majority] to invalidate the sentence,\u201d it may not be amiss to examine the transcript to ascertain what the \u201csituation\u201d really was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-15\">This young lady, anxious to take advantage, if possible, of being sentenced under the Youth Corrections Act, 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) pleaded guilty, on February 19, 1974, before Chief Judge Jacob Mishler to an information charging her with wilfull and knowing possession of four ounces of cocaine with intent to sell or deliver it for someone else\u2019s use. Upon thorough and protracted questioning by the Court, the defendant admitted possession of the cocaine; that she was delivering it to someone else; that she knew the maximum sentence could be fifteen years plus a fine and parole; and that knowing the consequences and having been advised of her rights by Court and counsel, she desired to plead guilty. Sentence was fixed for March 22nd; the sentencing judge\u2019s name (then unknown) was to \u201ccome out of a drum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-16\">On March 25, 1974, defendant came before Judge Travia for sentence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>Court had made available to her counsel the presentence report and various relevant letters and had directed counsel to read and discuss them with her. Alleged inconsistencies were discussed such as the quantity of marijuana and cocaine found in defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">The Court, mindful that defendant would be 26 years of age the next day,, was aware of \u201cthe possibility of the imposition of sentence pursuant to the Youth Corrections Act rather than the adult sentence which she faces in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel argued vigorously that his client had \u201ca real first class background\u201d; that she was a \u201ccollege graduate\u201d; that she had \u201ca good work record, excellent family\u201d but performed a stupid thing \u2014 a criminal act, and urged that defendant be given the benefit of the Youth Corrections Act and probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-7\">The Court, in sentencing, noted that (in conformity with the practice in the Eastern District of discussing cases in a presentencing panel and receiving the sentencing recommendations of the other judges on the panel) he had conferred with other judges as to their recommendations with respect to the sentence and also said in part: \u201cI have read this pre-sentence report maybe five times already. I read every letter that was sent. to me by a number of people * * The Court \u201cafter doing a little soul-searching of [his] own, * * * \u201d and having considered all the facts before him concluded not to sentence under the Youth Corrections Act but under the adult provisions of the law. The Court used defendant\u2019s education only to show that \u201cshe knew what she was doing\u201d and that he could not find \u201cthat she would in any way benefit by this YCA.\u201d The Court then sentenced defendant to four years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">The Court, in turn, pointed to defendant\u2019s education and background. \u2014 hence, her ability to understand the nature of her crime. Such knowledge was reinforced by her admissions at the time of the guilty plea and her statement before the sentencing judge himself: \u201cI just want to say that I wasn\u2019t pleading ignorance as somebody from the ghetto. But I had knowledge.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate that the sentencing judge deemed \u201cintelligence and privileged background\u201d to be \u201cpejorative factors disentitling her to treatment under the Youth Corrections Act.\u201d The majority\u2019s holding would imperil every sentence preceded by the trial judge\u2019s comment, \u201cYou had a good education. You should have known better.\u201d Or, since the majority \u201care constrained to disapprove of the manner <em>in </em>which this [the sentencing] was done,\u201d does this mean that a sentencing judge cannot excoriate a narcotics vendor without fear of having his sentence invalidated ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-12\">These comments \u201ccoupled with its [the sentencing judge\u2019s] express refusal * * * [to] make a specific finding that appellant would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act\u201d led the majority \u201cto conclude that the court employed a fixed and mechanical approach in imposing sentence rather than a careful appraisal of the variable components relevant to the sentence upon an individual basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-14\">Although not available at the time of sentencing or of the argument of this appeal, I had thought that the question of the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion to apply the Youth Corrections Act had been put to rest by the Supreme Court (1974) in Dorszynski v. United States, -U.S.-, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855. The four concurring Justices differed only from the five as to the form of the \u201cno benefit\u201d statement, namely, whether a \u201cmerely conclusory statement\u201d or a more explicit statement was required. As to the issue before us, <em>i. </em>e., the right of the sentencing judge to decide for or against sentencing under the Act, there was no disagreement. Writing for the four, Mr. Justice Marshall said: \u201cBut the Act clearly intended that the' ultimate sentencing decision remain with the trial judge.\u201d For the five, the Chief Justice wrote: \u201cThe sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>issue in this case is the validity of the sentence imposed by the District Court.\u201d As to sentencing discretion, after a review of the legislative history of the Act, the Chief Justice said: \u201cThe intent of Congress was in accord with long-established authority in the United States vesting the sentencing function exclusively in the trial court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-4\">\u201cIf there is one rule in the federal criminal practice which is firmly established, it is that the appellate court has no control over a sentence which is within the limits allowed by a statute.\u201d Gurera v. United States, 40 F.2d 338, 340 (CA8 1930).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\"><em>See </em>Gore v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Townsend v. Burke, <em>supra; </em>Blockburger v. United States, <em>supra. </em>* * * * As our review has shown, the exclusive sentencing power of district judges was acknowledged, and Congress\u2019 intention to affirm that power was clearly indicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">A judge is guilty of mechanical sentencing when he displays a \u201cfixed sentencing policy based on the category of crime rather than on the individualized record of the defendant.\u201d United States v. Baker, 487 F.2d 360, 361 (2d Cir. 1973). Such an attitude can be demonstrated in one of two ways. First, it can be proven out of the mouth of the' sentencing judge, <em>i. e., </em>he can state, at sentencing, that he \u201croutinely\u201d or \u201chabitually\u201d metes out a certain sentence for a given crime. For instance, in Woosley v. United States, 478 F.2d 139 (8th Cir. 1973), the sentencing judge, before imposing the maximum sentence on a defendant who pleaded guilty to a violation of the Selective Service Act, declared that it had been his practice for over thirty years to impose the maximum sentence in selective service eases. 478 F.2d at 144. Second, a mechanical attitude toward sentencing can be <em>prima facie </em>established by the sentencing court\u2019s prior record in similar cases. In the <em>Woosley </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit examined the district court records and found an unwarranted consistency in the sentencing judge\u2019s past treatment of selective service offenders. Similarly, in United States v. Baker, <em>supra, </em>this court examined the records of the district court in an attempt to uncover a mechanical attitude toward sentencing on the part of the district judge. 487 F.2d at 361 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">At no point in the sentencing process in this case did the Court declare that it was his custom or habit to sentence all drug offenders to four years\u2019 incarceration with open parole and three years\u2019 special probation. Likewise, the record discloses no survey of the district judge\u2019s past sentences from which this court might deduce that he sentences drug offenders in a mechanical way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">The District Court determined that defendant should be sentenced as an adult because she had been well educated and had been given many advantages, and whose criminal act could not be mitigated by a claim of ignorance or by the effects of crushing poverty which might have numbed her moral judgment. In addition, although defendant had no previous police record, there is evidence in the presentence report that she had engaged in transactions involving hard drugs before and had participated in drug distribution. Thus, the approach of the District Court was anything but mechanical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-10\">The facts here presented completely refute, in my opinion, the charge that the Court \u201cemployed a fixed and mechanical approach in imposing sentence.\u201d To the contrary, they show careful consideration of the individual before him. Under the circumstances, although the sentence may appear to have been unduly harsh, such correction, as the Supreme Court has indicated, is not for the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-11\">In light of <em>Dorszynski, supra, </em>the fact that the sentencing judge carefully considered the <em>pros </em>and <em>cons </em>of sentencing under the Act and the time-honored discretion vested in the sentencing judge, I can reach no other conclusion than that the judgment should be affirmed. For these reasons, I must dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
