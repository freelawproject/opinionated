Henderson, Warden, 5 Cir., 1974, 485 F.2d 694, on the problem posed in substituting letters for pleadings. The court ordered the letters filed in forma pauperis as a petition for mandamus and dismissed for failure to exhaust prison remedies. <em>See </em>Jones v. Carlson, 5 Cir., 1974, 495 F.2d 209; Thompson v. Federal Prison Industries, 5 Cir., 1974, 492 F.2d 1082, on the requirement of exhaustion in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-25\">Correspondence between appellant and the court continued and a subsequent order was issued also denying relief. Appellant then filed a formal petition for rehearing in which he interpreted his previous letters to some extent and requested the court to direct the clerk to file a notice of appeal to this court. The court at that point issued a rule nisi to the warden who, in turn, responded with respect to the claims asserted variously by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-26\">The district court then denied relief as to these same claims: (1) that prison officials were responsible for the loss of a $5.00 money order mailed by appellant\u2019s mother to him, (2) that prison officials illegally interfered with appellant\u2019s mail, and (3) that he was entitled to be transferred to another penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Given the <em>in extenso </em>handling in the district court, we treat the response, including the supporting affidavit and documents, filed by the warden as a substitute for exhausting the prison administrative remedy which is ordinarily required. Jones v. Henderson, <em>supra</em>; Thompson v. Prison Industries, <em>supra. </em>Finding the claims assigned to be without merit, we can thus affirm rather than remanding with direction that the cause be dismissed for failure to exhaust prison remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
