The Commissioner determined deficiencies in the taxes, $2,646.32 for 1966 and $3,930.75 for 1967. Additionally, he added penalties in the amounts of $132.-31 and $196.53 under the provisions of section 6653(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The Tax Court, in an opinion reported at P-H Tax Ct. Mem. If 72,118, upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination as to some items and increased allowable amounts as to certain other items. The taxpayers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\"> The taxpayers first argue that the Commissioner\u2019s notice of deficiency constituted an infringement of their constitutional rights. They had refused to produce their books and records for examination by representatives of the Internal Revenue Service. This argument is without merit. The Commissioner was under no obligation to issue an administrative summons or to initiate District Court proceedings to enforce such a summons. His decision as to whether to so proceed is discretionary. <em>See generally, </em>Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 523-525, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\"> There is nothing in the record to support the taxpayers\u2019 contention that the Commissioner\u2019s issuance of the notice of deficiency was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-22\">The taxpayers also seem to argue that the burden rested upon the Commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>er to prove the deficiencies claimed in his notice. If the burden rested upon them, so they argue, they would be required to produce books and records which might be self-incriminating. It has long been held that it is presumed that the Commissioner\u2019s determinations are correct and that since deductions are allowed as a matter of legislative grace, the burden is upon taxpayers to establish every element of their claimed deductions. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933); Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 590, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 87 L.Ed. 1607 (1943); rehearing denied, 320 U.S. 809 (1943); DeMink v. United States, 448 F.2d 867 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">As to the factual issues, the taxpayers do not attack the decision of the Tax Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, in any event, our scope of review in a case such as this is limited. We are not empowered to set aside the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings unless they are without support of substantial evidence or, upon the basis of the whole record, we are left with the firm conviction that justice has miscarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In one respect, we do think that both the Commissioner and the Tax Court were mistaken. This has to do with the assessment of the penalties under section 6653(a). That section allows the assessment of such penalties only when a taxpayer\u2019s underpayment \u201cis due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations . \u201d Our review of the whole record, including the taxpayers\u2019 briefs (prepared by themselves), and the attitude of the husband taxpayer, who argued before us, convinces us that while the taxpayers were misguided and unsophisticated in the realm of tax law, they acted in good faith, without negligence and without \u201cintentional disregard\u201d of applicable rules and regulations. Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is modified by reducing the judgment for the Commissioner to the extent of the amount of the penalties, 5% of the amounts of income taxes found by the Tax Court to be owed by the taxpayers for the years 1966 and 1967. As so modified, the judgment of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"Az1\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. After carefully reviewing all of the evidence, the Tax Court allowed to the taxpayers as 1966 business deductions, $3,464.68 more than the amount allowed by the Commissioner. Of the $11,261.17 which the taxpayers claimed as business deductions for 1967, the Tax Court allowed $7,993.69, $5,-272.52 more than the Commissioner\u2019s notice of deficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
