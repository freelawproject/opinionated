Lydick, United States District Judge, Los Angeles, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b97-19\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b97-21\">PER. CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b97-22\">The appellant was convicted of having violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>prohibits the entry into this country of an alien who has previously been arrested and deported, unless the alien has obtained permission to re-enter from the Attorney General of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The only issue here presented is whether the arrest of the appellant was valid. The arrest was made by an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service without warrant. A rather unique statutory provision, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a) (2), is involved. It authorizes the arrest of an alien such as the appellant without warrant, but only if the arresting officer, at the time of the arrest, had \u201creason to believe\u201d that the alien was likely to escape before a warrant could be procured. It is argued that the evidence was insufficient to justify the officer\u2019s alleged belief that the appellant was likely to escape. The contention has some persuasion, but we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">When the appellant was stopped for interrogation, he appeared, according to the testimony of the arresting officer, to be one whom the officer had previously observed in the custody of the Immigration Service. The officer testified that the appellant was extremely nervous, was \u201clooking around to the left and right past me,\u201d and that he, the officer, \u201cfelt that he was looking for an opportunity to run.\u201d The appellant admitted to the officer that he was an alien and that he had no immigration papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Following the appellant\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion, it would seem that an arresting immigration officer could never have reason to believe that the ar-restee was likely to escape, absent an on-the-scene admission of the arrestee to that effect. We cannot apply such an unreasonably restrictive interpretation to the pertinent statute. Being unable to look into the appellant's mind, the officer could do no more than to draw his own inferences from the objective circumstances. From the circumstances we have above described, we conclude that they were sufficient to support the determination that the arresting officer\u2019s inferences were not unreasonable and that they were thus adequate to warrant his expressed \u201creason to believe\u201d that, if not immediately arrested, the appellant was likely to escape. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Mallides, 473 F.2d 859 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. Alvarado, 321 F.2d 336 (2d Cir. 1963); Taylor v. Fine, 115 F.Supp. 68 (S.D.Cal.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"AYk\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
