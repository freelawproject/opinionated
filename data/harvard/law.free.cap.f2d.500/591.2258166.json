Neither appellant sought to exhaust his available administrative remedies. Instead, each independently brought suit in district court to enjoin his suspension pending a full administrative hearing, alleging that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment requires a pre-suspension administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-26\">In Temple\u2019s case, the trial court denied his motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his action for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that he had failed to exhaust his administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tive remedies. In Francois v. Bushell, 325 F.Supp. 531 (N.D.Cal.1971), the trial court concluded that Francois was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies, but it upheld the constitutionality of the summary suspension without a hearing. These appeals followed, and this court granted appellants\u2019 motion to consolidate the actions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The Supreme Court in Arnett v. Kennedy, 1974, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15, directly addressed and rejected appellants\u2019 constitutional arguments. There is no need, therefore, to resolve the exhaustion of remedies question.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
