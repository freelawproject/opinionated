The district court concluded, \u201c(a)fter a thorough and independent review of the entire 369-page record of .this case\u201d, that the decision of the Secretary was supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the summary judgment entered for defendant with some observations as will be expressed hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Plaintiff was born December 30, 1916, in Puerto Rico and came to this country in 1955. While in Puerto Rico, he worked in a cigar factory, where he made cigars by hand, and also in a sugar refinery \u201cconditioning\u201d sugar cane. Upon arriving in the United States, he was employed briefly in the agricultural field and then worked for about eight years, until 1964, as a busboy in a Philadelphia hotel. The record discloses that, at the age of seven, plaintiff sustained a fracture of the right leg and dislocation of his right hip, resulting in a shortening of his leg. In February, 1964, plaintiff underwent a segmental sigmoid resection for diverticuloma of the sigmoid and has not worked since. Subsequently, after frequent hospital treatments for back and leg complaints, he was confined to Hahnemann Hospital from April 18, 1966, to July 29, 1966, and on May 9, 1966, underwent surgery described as a right hip fusion. He presently walks with a limp and wears a four-inch lift in his right shoe. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and pelvis are established in the record without contradiction. The plaintiff last met the earnings requirement of the Act on March 31, 1969, and, therefore, the hearing examiner viewed his alleged \u201cback, leg and stomach\u201d impairments in light of their severity as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"avr-dedup-0\">In denying plaintiff\u2019s application, the examiner made the following \u201cevaluation\u201d of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At0\">\u201cThe Hearing Examiner is of the opinion that the medical evidence fails to disclose any impairment, of the claimant\u2019s back or stomach, as alleged on his application, of a level of severity which would have prevented him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity on or before March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>31, 1969, when he was last insured for Disability Insurance Benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\u201cIt may be observed in passing that there is no medical evidence at all which shows a significant impairment of the claimant\u2019s stomach, of any long duration, so there is no evidentiary basis whatever to show the claimant to have been disabled on that account, on or before March 31, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cWith respect to the claimant\u2019s alleged back impairment, it appears that the chief problem in this regard was secondary to the injury to the applicant\u2019s right hip, which occurred in early childhood and this was an impairment which did not prevent him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity at any time, prior to 1964. Thereafter, the applicant underwent surgery, which from all accounts was rather beneficial. The clinical records of most recent date in this respect, namely those referring to treatments received in April 1968 and December 1969, show the claimant to have been \u2018in good orthopedic condition, presently\u2019 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u2018doing nicely\u2019 (Exhibit 26). In light of the foregoing medical findings at the clinic where the claimant was treated the Hearing Examiner can perceive no adequate basis in the evidence for regarding the claimant to have been disabled because of a back impairment, or any other physical impairment of an orthopedic nature, on or before March 31, 1969.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">* * * *\u25a0 -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">\u201cThe Hearing Examiner finds nothing in this aspect [educational, vocational and non medical evidence] of the evidence which would, in any appreciable measure, compensate for the deficiencies in the medical evidence discussed hereinabove. There is, for example, no basis in either aspect of the evidence which would warrant a conclusion that the claimant was not physically able to perform some appropriate form of work which would have been performed while in a seated position such as employment in the cigar making industry, a type of employment in which he had actual experience prior to the surgery on his right hip, with its reported beneficial effect, on or before March 31, 1969 when he was last insured for disability insurance benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The examiner then proceeds to make but three \u201cspecific findings\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">\n<em>\u201cFACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">\u201c1. The claimant in this case filed an application for disability insurance benefits on February 11, 1970.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">\u201c2. The claimant last met the earnings requirement for disability insurance benefit purposes on March 31, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">\u201c3. The medical evidence fails to show that the claimant was unable to engage in any substantial gainful ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tivity by reason of a back or stomach impairment, as alleged on his application, or any other type of impairment, on or before March 31,1969.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">While affirming the district court, we express concern over the brief treatment given by the examiner in evaluating the evidence. In his decision, the examiner submitted a four-page summary of the evidence preceding the \u201cevaluation\u201d hereinabove set forth but did not express any judgment as to what portions of the evidence he accepted or rejected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, he did not address himself to the testimony of plaintiff and his wife concerning plaintiff\u2019s pain, his alleged inability to dress himself or bathe, his limitations on sitting, standing, and walking, as well as other restrictions caused by his extensive hip and leg deformities. As fact finder he has the right to reject their testimony entirely, but failure to indicate rejection could lead to a conclusion that he neglected to consider it at all. \u201cIn addition to objective medical facts and expert medical opinions, the Hearing Examiner must consider the claimant\u2019s subjective evidence of pain and disability, as corroborated by family and neighbors; and all of these factors must be viewed against the applicant\u2019s age, educational background and work experience.\u201d Mode v. Celebrezze, 359 F.2d 135, 136 (4th Cir. 1966). Pain, in itself, may be a disabling condition, Ma-runich v. Richardson, 335 F.Supp. 870 (W.D.Pa.1971), and the present record includes medical data which would not contradict, indeed, would support plaintiff\u2019s complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Furthermore, in his \u201cevaluation\u201d, the examiner gives no clue as to why he chose to accept certain medical evidence and reject contradictory evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Kennedy v. Richardson, 454 F.2d 376 (3rd Cir. 1972). In our view an examiner\u2019s findings should be as comprehensive and analytical as feasible and, where appropriate, should include a statement of subordinate factual foundations on which ultimate factual conclusions are based, so that a reviewing court may know the basis for the decision. This is necessary so that the court may properly exercise its responsibility under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to determine if the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. It is incumbent upon the examiner to make specific findings \u2014 the court may not speculate as to his findings. Williams v. Celebrezze, 359 F.2d 950 (4th Cir. 1966). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cWe think it is not too much to require that an administrative decision that a claimant is not eligible ... be supported by explicit findings of all facts that are essential to the conclusion of ineligibility.\u201d Choratch v. Finch, 438 F.2d 342, 343 (3d Cir. 1971). Recognizing the heavy work burden on hearing examiners acting under the Social Security Act, we emphasize that the above comments are designed to be helpful in the joint work of the administrative agency and the courts in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">While the findings in this case could be improved upon, nevertheless, after careful consideration of the record and relating it to the examiner\u2019s findings, we conclude that such findings are sufficient to satisfy the substantial evidence test. See United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 185, 65 S.Ct. 437, 89 L.Ed. 650 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\">. However, any inference to be drawn from a clinical notation that plaintiff is \u201cin good orthopedic condition\u201d, should be made in the light of what the record shows to be extensive injury to, and functional limitations on, his musculoskeletal system. The term \u201cdoing nicely\u201d is a relative t\u00e9rm that may indicate merely that plaintiff\u2019s condition was as good as could be expected under the circumstances. But, in any event, the extraction of these few conclusory comments without further elaboration is of questionable significance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">. The Social Security Regulations provide that the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision shall he in writing \u201cand contain findings of fact and a statement of reasons\u201d. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.939. A directive to make findings of fact normally means clear and explicit findings of all facts necessary to support the conclusions reached. Dowdy v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg., 267 F.2d 827, 828 (5th Cir. 1959). There is no reason why this customary and accepted procedure should not be followed in Social Security cases. Indeed, the judiciary must hold administrative officers to high standards in the discharge of the fact-finding functions. United States v. Forness, 125 F.2d 928, 942 (2nd Cir. 1942). See also, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.926 and 404.927.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\">. The examiner merely extracted portions of the medical reports which he stated \u201c . . . are of interest\u201d. Consequently, the summary serves no purpose except for identifying portions of the evidence; there is absolutely no attempt to analyze or evaluate those items referred to in the summary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">. For example, there is no reference in the \u201cevaluation\u201d to</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">(a) X-ray studies in February, 1963, and August, 1964, indicating a \u201closs of the normal lordotic curve in the lumbar area\u201d and a \u201closs of the right acetabulum and displacement of the right femoral head upward\u201d. In addition, there was considerable angulation at an old fracture site of the proximal right femoral shaft, osseous loose body in the hip joint and degenerative joint disease most marked in the distal thoracic spine;</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">(b) Report of Dr. Elliott Goodman dated December 4, 1965, reciting plaintiff\u2019s orthopedic problems and noting an inability to bend the right knee as well as marked atrophy of the right thigh;</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">(e) Report of confinement in Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, from April 18, 1966, to July 29, 1966, during which confinement a hip fusion was effected which involved the taking of a three by one and one-half inch bone graft from the anterior and superior il-iac spine and a subtrochanteric osteotomy.
