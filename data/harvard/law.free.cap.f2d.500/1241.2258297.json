He also contends that the manner in which the district court conducted the probation revocation hearings denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-17\">On January 12, 1973, Foster pleaded guilty to possessing an altered $20 Federal Reserve Note with intent to defraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472. The district court sentenced him to the custody of the Attorney General, providing that Foster \u201cshall be confined in a jail-type institution for the first 60 days, said days to be served on consecutive weekends from 8:00 A.M. Saturdays until 6:00 P.M. Sundays commencing January 20, 1973; the remainder of the term of imprisonment is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation for a period of three years on the conditions he obey all laws Federal State and local and comply with all rules and regulations of the Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-18\">At the time of sentencing, Foster had been in continuous federal custody for 39 days: from December 5, 1972, the date of his arrest upon the charge to which he pleaded guilty, to January 12, 1973. In imposing sentence, the district court indicated its intention to credit the time Foster had already spent in custody to the 60-day-jail-term portion of the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-19\">Foster was released into state custody on January 12, 1973, and removed to the Orange County jail pending sentencing on state charges. The state court imposed a 15-day sentence to run concurrently with Foster\u2019s 60-day federal term. He was released from the Orange County jail on February 6, 1973, after serving the 15-day state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>When released from the Orange County jail, Foster had served 64 continuous days in custody since his arrest on December 5, 1972. Foster believed that his confinement for more than 60 days in the Los Angeles County and Orange County jails discharged his federal jail time requirement, an apprehension which was apparently shared by the state judge who sentenced him to jail in Orange County.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\">After his release from jail, Foster moved to Palm Springs, where he was employed until arrested on a bench warrant on August 8, 1973. Foster was charged with violating the terms of his probation by failing to report to the Los Angeles County jail to serve his federal jail time, failing to report to the probation department, and failing to report his change of address to his probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">The conviction for possession of an altered Federal Reserve Note was Foster\u2019s first offense. Neither at the time of sentencing nor afterward was he informed by the district court, anyone from the Government, or his own attorney that he should report to the probation department for any purpose. No presentence report was prepared. He was not contacted by anyone from the probation department during his two months of confinement in Los Angeles and Orange County jails. He was not interviewed by a probation officer until his arrest on the bench warrant in August 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">On September 13 and October 1, 1973, the district court held hearings pursuant to its order to show cause why Foster\u2019s probation should not be revoked. At the conclusion of the second hearing the district court found that Foster had violated the conditions of probation, vacated the prior probation order, and suspended further execution of the prior sentence. The court then placed Foster on five years\u2019 probation, conditioned on his serving 180 days in the county jail on consecutive weekends. Foster appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Although Foster served no time in the Los Angeles County jail following imposition of sentence by the district court, this failure is not an adequate ground for revoking his probation. Confinement in the Los Angeles facility was not a condition of probation. The judgment specified only that the confinement be in a \u201cjail-type institution.\u201d Foster was confined at such an institution, Orange County jail, after sentencing by the district court. Foster must receive credit for the time served at the Orange County facility if, during that confinement, he was \u201cin custody in connection with the offense or acts for which [the federal] sentence was imposed.\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568.) However, we are unable to determine from the record before us the exact basis of his confinement in the Orange County jail. If the state would not have incarcerated him pending the outcome of his state prosecution but for the federal conviction, the time he spent in the Orange County jail is to be deemed \u201ccustody in connection with\u201d the federal charge. (United States v. Eidum (9th Cir. 1973) 474 F.2d 579, 580-81; Davis v. Attorney General (5th Cir. 1970) 425 F.2d 238, 240.) On the other hand, if his custody in the Orange County jail was exclusively pursuant to the state offense and was not influenced by the federal conviction, no credit for time served is due. The record can be appropriately developed and the issue resolved on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">The record before us does establish that, because of the failure by the district court \u25a0 to specify Los Angeles County jail and uncertainty as to the effect of detention at Orange County jail, it was reasonable for Foster to believe that the 60-day-jail-term portion of his sentence had been satisfied by his confinement in both the Los Angeles and Orange County jails. Accordingly, even if he must still serve a portion of his original 60-day term, Foster\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>report to the Los Angeles County jail was not a proper basis for revocation of probation. (United States v. Chapel (9th Cir. 1970) 428 F.2d 472, 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">Foster was not informed in any way that he had an obligation either to report to the probation department or to advise the probation office of his change of address. Foster\u2019s failure to maintain contact with the probation department, therefore, cannot be a predicate for revoking his probation. <em>(See </em>United States v. Chapel, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Taylor (4th Cir. 1963) 321 F.2d 339, 341. <em>See generally </em>ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Probation \u00a7 5.1 (approved draft 1970).) Although the district court was not required to believe Foster\u2019s testimony, disbelief is not a substitute for affirmative evidence that he was in any way informed that these duties were conditions of his probation. <em>(Cf. </em>Wessel v. Buhler (9th Cir. 1971) 437 F.2d 279, 282-283.) Nothing in the record supports a finding that Foster was informed of such conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-16\">The record of the hearings pursuant to the order to show cause why probation should not be revoked reveals that the \u201cinterchanges between court and counsel were marked by expressions and revealed an attitude which hardly reflected the restraints of conventional judicial demeanor.\u201d (Offutt v. United States (1954) 348 U.S. 11, 12, 75 S.Ct. 11, 12, 99 L.Ed. 11.) The district court\u2019s frequent interruptions of Foster\u2019s counsel and its intemperate remarks deprived Foster of a fair hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (ABA Code of Judicial Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>duct, Canon 3; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Marshall (9th Cir. 1973) 488 F.2d 1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">The order revoking the original grant of probation and imposing the new terms of probation is vacated. The cause is remanded for the purpose of determining whether Foster is entitled to any credit on his original federal sentence for the time served in the Orange County jail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-15\">. The court said: \u201cMr. Foster, you are going to do a little more time, whatever the remainder is of the 60 days from that which you have already done. You have seen what it is in terms of five weeks. You are intelligent enough to make up your own mind. If you like it or you think there is nothing to it, all you have to do is come back to this Court within three years and we\u2019ll make sure that that is increased about 20 times.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">. The following excerpts from the record are illustrative:</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">During the hearing on September 13, 1973, Foster\u2019s counsel, Mr. Portman, attempted to explain to the court that his client had a good faith belief that he had fully served his federal jail sentence and to demonstrate that the record supported his client\u2019s claim of ignorance of the conditions of reporting. Mr. Portman said: \u201cI have consulted the probation file and there is no signature of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">\u201cIf I may approach the clerk again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">\u201cOn the standard temporary conditions of probation, which I believe is customarily tendered to a custody case either in the courtroom\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">\u201cTIIE COURT: So what? Mr. Portman, he was told certain things and that he was on probation. Now, if they are not going to take it from my telling them, then they will go to the can instead of going on probation. If they think they have to sign something\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: Your Honor, what I am saying is this : He tells me\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Don\u2019t give me any of that, Mr. Portman, that because he didn\u2019t sign anything he didn\u2019t have to report to the probation officer. That is a bunch of bunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">The following exchanges took place at the hearing on October 1, 1973 :</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">MR. PORTMAN: \u201cI think there certainly is basis for what the defendant says in stating that he believes he had served his 60-day sentence. In fact, at the least he had served approximately 45 days. At the most he had served 62 days or 60 days and two more days of state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-17\">\u201cWith regard to the second two points, the failure to \u2014 obviously the defendant did not report to the Probation Office and the defendant did not make the Probation Office aware of his current address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-18\">\u201cThe question is, should the defendant be violated when there is no indication that the defendant knew that he was required to do so. In other words, can\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you mean we have to spoon-feed him, is that right, Mr. Port-man? We have to spoon-feed and tell them, \u2018Look, little boy, you better go upstairs and talk to the probation officer, because if you don\u2019t go up and talk to him you are going to be in violation of probation.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-20\">\u201cMr. Portman, I am never going to do that to any defendant. If he wants probation from this court, then he ought to know what he is asking for, because probation, as I understand it, is largesse of the court, of the discretion of the trial judge</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-21\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: No one is arguing with that, your Honor. No one is arguing with that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-22\">\u201cWhat I am saying, though, is in this particular situation perhaps he should have been advised by his attorneey at the time of what his obligations were. This was a case where there was not a pre-sentence report. The man was not interviewed by a probation officer, where most defendants who are in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>custody \u2014 and this man happened to be in custody \u2014 are told by the probation officer at that point of their obligations. This man was not. There is no evidence that he was ever told anything by his attorney. lie says he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">\u201cThe Government has not put on any impeachment witness to the contrary. At the time he was sentenced he went immediately back to County Jail. He was not interviewed by anyone from the Probation Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">\u201cI think we can look to his demeanor. He states that lie did not know of his obligations. He had never been on probation before. I feel to violate a man for not obeying a condition of probation when he is unaware and not through an intentional or an intended evasion but through just the circumstances of this particular case is to penalize him, I feel, unfairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-9\">\u201cI would submit on that, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you want to make a test case of it, Mr. Portman? Is that what it is all about?</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: No, it is not all\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that what it is all about?</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-14\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN : Sir, no\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that what it is all about? If you want to make a test case of it, you tempt me very much, but I won\u2019t punish your defendant, your client, by what you might want to do, Mr. Portman, because I do not think it is the obligation of this court to spoon-feed a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-17\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: Your Honor, I am not interested\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: I won\u2019t do it unless I am told to do it by the Court of Appeals. The only way they can tell me is by sending this case up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-19\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: I would hope that it would not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: If you want to do that, we can accommodate you and Mr. Foster very easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-21\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: Your Honor, I would hope this case would not have to go to the Court of Appeals, and that is the reason\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: To take a position contract [contrary] to that, that this man didn\u2019t know that he was on probation and that he should be talking to a probation officer somehow or in some way is totally ridiculous, Mr. Portman, totally ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-24\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: Sir, I believe those to be the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-26\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is totally ridiculous, that any defendant can come in and say, T didn\u2019t know I was supposed to report to the probation officer when you put me on probation,\u2019 like it is some kind of a key to the outside world with no strings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-27\">\u201cMr. Portman, there are very many strings to probation, sometimes tougher than going to jail, sometimes tougher than going to jail. Every defendant ought to recognize that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-28\">((</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-29\">\u201cTHE COURT: The court finds the defendant in violation of the probationary conditions heretofore imposed on January 20, 1973. The probationary order of January 20, 1973, is revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-30\">\u201cThe further execution of the sentence therein imposed is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation for a period of five years on the following terms and conditions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-31\">\u201cThat he obey all local, state, and federal laws, and that he comply with the rules and regulations set down for his conduct by the probation officer;</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-32\">\u201cThat lie serve the first 180 days in the County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-33\">\u201cSo there won\u2019t be any question about it, Mr. Portman and Mr. Foster, 180 days. You haven\u2019t done 180 days if you stood on your head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-34\">\u201c180 days is to be served by the defendant on consecutive weekends commencing October 6, 1973, at 8:00 a. m., and continuing until October 7, 1973, at 6:00 p. m., and continuing thereafter until the 180 days shall have been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-35\">\u201cMr. Portman, if you want to test that, go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-36\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: Your Honor, I would like to speak briefly to what the defendant has done before sentencing was imposed, if the court would care to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-37\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, I am not going to be a calculator, either, Mr. Portman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-38\">\u201cMR. PORTMAN: As the court wishes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
