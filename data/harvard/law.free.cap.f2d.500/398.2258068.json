Citizens Casualty Co. of N. Y. et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">In this appeal from their convictions for transportation of stolen motor vehicles in interstate commerce, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2312, 2313, \u00a7 2, appellants allege that the evidence against them was insufficient and that their Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation of witnesses against them were denied. We find these contentions to be without merit and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-22\">Appellants allege they were training members of the International Anti-Communist Brigade for an invasion of Cuba. The government\u2019s theory was that this was just a guise to hide a conspiracy to transport stolen motor vehicles into Mexico. Taking the view most favorable to the government, a reasonably minded jury could accept the relevant evidence as sufficient to support appellants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Warner, 5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-23\">Appellants\u2019 other contentions deal with the cross-examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>final witness at trial, Agent Gibbons of the FBI. Gibbons\u2019 direct testimony dealt exclusively with another defendant, Gonzales, except for a reference to appellant Sturgis as the leader of the brigade. On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel sought to elicite testimony about a statement given to Gibbons by Sturgis, This question was ruled beyond the scope of direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The fact that Sturgis was the leader of the brigade had already been established by other witnesses Appellant\u2019s contentions that he was denied the right to confrontation are without merit. He could have called the agent as his own witness, or taken the stand himself on this point. Any prejudice that might have resulted was harmless. <em>See </em>United States v. Resnick, 5 Cir., 1974, 488 F.2d 1165 at 1168 quoting from Kotteakos v. United States, 1946, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 10 L.Ed. 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
