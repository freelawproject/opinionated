They seek desegregation of those schools. The schools of the District have never been subject to a statutorily imposed \u201cdual school system\u201d separating blacks from whites. The plaintiffs contend that acts of <em>de jure </em>segregation have been committed by the School Board with the result that the responsibility fell upon the Board to desegregate the school system. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs upon this issue and called upon the parties to submit plans for accomplishing desegregation. Two plans were submitted, one by the plaintiffs and one by the defendants. Both plans provided for\" the balancing not only of blacks and whites but of Chinese-Americans and other ethnic groups as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Before court hearings on the plans were scheduled to commence, parents of children of Chinese ancestry attending public elementary schools in the district sought leave to intervene. They additionally sought an order shortening time for service of the moving papers so that their application might be ruled upon in time for them to participate in those hearings. The district court refused to shorten time, and the hearings were held without their participation. Thereafter, the district court denied their application to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">The court approved both plans and directed defendants forthwith to carry out desegregation of the elementary schools in the manner provided by one or the other of the two plans. Its findings and judgment are set forth in 339 F.Supp. 1315 (N.D.Cal.1971). Defendants elected to follow the plan which they themselves had submitted. They have been operating under that plan ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">I. <em>De Jure Segregation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">(Nos. 71-1877, 71-1878, 71-2163, and . 71-2189)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">District-wide integration has been the goal of the School Board for some time, and the plan under which it is now operating had been designed by it, prior to commencement of the instant suit, as a long-range plan to be accomplished gradually over a period of years. The question before us is not the desirability of district-wide integration, but whether the constitutional rights of the litigants necessitate immediate, court-ordered desegregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-20\">More particularly, this appeal presents the question whether the district court applied correct standards in determining that acts of <em>de jure </em>segregation were committed by the defendants. Since this case does not involve a statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>created dual school system, we delayed taking submission of the case until the filing of the opinion of the Supreme Court in Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). In <em>Keyes, </em>as here, the contention was that the \u201cSchool Board alone, by use of various techniques such as the manipulation of student attendance zones, school site selection and a neighborhood school policy, created or maintained racially or ethnically (or both racially and ethnically) segregated schools throughout the school district, entitling petitioners to a decree directing desegregation of the entire school district.\u201d 413 U.S. at 191, 93 S.Ct. at 2689. In discussing the standards for determining whether <em>de jure </em>acts of segregation had been committed by a school board, the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">\u201cWe emphasize that the differentiating factor between <em>de jure </em>and so-called <em>de facto </em>segregation to which we referred in <em>Swann </em>[v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 17-18, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971)] is <em>purpose </em>or <em>intent </em>to segregate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. at 2697 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">This court, in Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees, 488 F.2d 579 (9th Cir. 1973), has construed <em>Keyes </em>as requiring for any finding of unconstitutional segregation a \u201cdetermination that the school authorities had intentionally discriminated against minority students by practicing a deliberate policy of racial segregation.\u201d 488 F.2d at 585.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\"><em>Keyes </em>and <em>Soria </em>were filed after the decision by the district court in this case. Quite understandably, therefore, the district court made no finding as to whether the School Board possessed the requisite segregatory intent. On the contrary, the district court treated proof of such intent as unnecessary. \u201cIn the context of segregation,\u201d it held, \u201c[the term <em>de </em>jure] * * * means no more nor less than that the school authorities have exercised powers given them by law in a manner which creates or continues or increases substantial racial imbalance in the schools. It is this governmental action, regardless of the motivation for it, which violates the Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>teenth Amendment.\u201d 339 F.Supp. at 1319. As <em>Keyes </em>and <em>Soria </em>have now made clear, the district court thereby applied an erroneous legal standard in determining that a constitutional violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Although the record contains evidence relevant to the question of the School Board\u2019s intent, it is not at all clear that the evidence is sufficient to permit a fair resolution of this issue. Because the litigants, like the district court, did not focus upon the issue of intent, we cannot be confident that all of the relevant and reasonably available evidence is now before us. The case must be remanded to afford an opportunity to reexamine the record on the issue of intent. Upon remand the district court will permit the parties to offer such additional evidence as they may desire pertaining to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The school district has been operating under the court-ordered desegregation plan since September, 1971. As in <em>So-ria, </em>\u201cwe shall not at this time undo that result.\u201d 488 F.2d at 588. Therefore, the injunction shall remain in effect until the final resolution of the litigation, unless the district court in its discretion modifies it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Nos. 71-1877, 71-1878, 71-2163, and 71-2189 are vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of Keyes v. School District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973), and Soria v. Oxnard School District Board of Trustees, 488 F.2d 579 (9th Cir. 1973), and in accordance with the views here expressed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">II. <em>Intervention</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGfG\">(No. 71-2105)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Parents of elementary school children of Chinese ancestry claim entitlement to intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2), F.R.Civ.P. They oppose the compulsory reassignment of such students to schools outside the area in which they reside. Alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that such reassignment will make it impossible for such children to attend community schools offering education in Chinese language, art, culture and history, they contend, on constitutional and equitable grounds, that they are not properly bound by the court\u2019s decree, or that, if they are so bound, they are entitled to participate in the fashioning of that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Rule 24(a)(2) permits timely intervention when the applicant shows: (1) an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (2) that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest; and (3) that the interest is not adequately represented by existing parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">Appellants claim a sufficient interest in the outcome of the action to satisfy the first requirement of the rule. In Smuck v. Hobson, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 372, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>408 F.2d 175, 180 (1969), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, sitting in banc, concluded that the \u201cconcern [of parents seeking intervention in a desegregation suit] for their children\u2019s welfare\u201d was sufficient under the circumstances to satisfy that requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We adopted the general rationale of <em>Smuck </em>in Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 427 F.2d 1352, 1353 (9th Cir. 1970), but there we reached a different result because the third requirement of the rule was not satisfied. Moreover, other courts have recognized that, for purposes of Rule 24(a)(2), all students and parents, whatever their race, have an interest in a sound educational system and in the operation of that system in accordance with the law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That interest is surely no less significant where, as here, it is entangled with the constitutional claims of a racially defined class.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The second requirement of the rule, that the applicant be \u201cso situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest,\u201d is similarly satisfied. It is true that here the denial of intervention may leave appellants the practical alternative of asserting in a subsequent lawsuit that the new policies adopted by the school district are unconstitutional. However, appellants additionally seek to influence the manner in which the school district exercises its admitted discretion in formulating and implementing such policies. The denial of intervention may eliminate appellants\u2019 opportunity to challenge new policies which, although they may not be constitutionally required, are nevertheless constitutionally permissible. See <em>Smuck, supra, </em>408 F.2d at 180-181. Moreover, the actual outcome in the court below \u2014 the approval of plans balancing the very class appellants claim to represent \u2014 demonstrates that their interest may indeed be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The third requirement for intervention of right is that the applicant\u2019s interest not be \u201cadequately represented by existing parties.\u201d The district court found that \u201c[t]he vague and conclusory allegations of the complaint in intervention are insufficient to overcome the presumption that government officials are adequately representing the interests of all citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">The factual situation before us bears a similarity to that in Trbovich v. United Mine Workers of America, 404 U.S. 528, 92 S.Ct. 630, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (1972), in which the Supreme Court held that there was sufficient doubt about the adequacy of representation of a complaining union member by the Secretary of Labor in a suit to set aside an election of union officials to warrant the union member\u2019s intervention of right.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Here we cannot agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the school district, which is charged with the representation of all parents within the district and which authored the very plan which appellants claim impairs their interest, adequately represents appellants. Nor do we agree with appellee\u2019s contention that the other intervenors in the action, a group of racially mixed parents, adequately represent appellants\u2019 distinct viewpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The remaining question is whether appellants\u2019 application was timely made within the meaning of Rule 24(a)(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, where appellants filed their application eleven days after the proposed plans were filed, but prior to entry of the court\u2019s ultimate decree, the district court ruled \u201cthat to allow intervention at this juncture would unduly delay and prejudice the rights of the original parties.\u201d Despite some authority to the contrary,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we ordinarily might well conclude, on the facts before us, that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the application as \u201cuntimely.\u201d However, our disposition today of the related appeals \u2014 vacating and remanding the main case below for reconsideration while leaving the injunction in force \u2014 substantially reduces any prejudice to the rights of the original parties and thus undercuts the basis of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">On the peculiar circumstances of this case and in view of our disposition of the related appeals, No. 71-2105 is vacated and remanded with instructions to permit appellants to intervene in accordance with the views here expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">III. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"AxAP\">(No. 72-2980)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">The district court entered an order awarding appellees $24,637.50 in at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>torneys\u2019 fees. Appellants took a separate appeal from this order. We vacated submission of this appeal to await the decision of the Supreme Court in Bradley v. School Board, 472 F.2d 318 (4th Cir. 1972), cert. granted 412 U.S. 937, 93 S.Ct. 2773, 37 L.Ed.2d 396 (1973), vacated 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (May 15, 1974),-a case involving similar issues. Appellees present three theories in support of the award of fees, each of which assumes a successful plaintiff. Because of our view that the main case must be remanded for further fact-finding, it remains to be seen which party will ultimately prevail on the merits. As matters now stand, therefore, a decision on the attorneys\u2019 fees issue would be premature. Accordingly, we vacate the order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for further consideration by the district court when the litigation has been resolved on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\">. <em>See </em>Note, Keyes v. School District No. 1: Unlocking the Northern Schoolhouse Doors, 9 Harv.Civ.Rights-Civ.Lib.L.Rev. 124, 149: \u201c[I]t is now clear that a finding of de jure segregation has basically <em>three </em>prerequisites: (a) school board action (b) <em>with a purpose to segregate </em>(c) which in fact produces segregation in the system\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">It was with reference to this requirement that Justice Powell disagreed with the majority in <em>Keyes. </em>He stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cThe net result of the Court\u2019s language, however, is the apjjlication of an <em>effect </em>test to the actions of southern school districts and an <em>intent </em>test to those in other sections, at least until an initial <em>de jure </em>finding for those districts can be made. Rather than straining to perpetuate any such dual standard, we should hold forthrightly that significant segregated school conditions in any section of the country are a prima facie violation of constitutional rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">413 U.S. at 232, 93 S.Ct. at 2709.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">\u201cI would hold, quite simply, that where segregated public schools exist within a school district to a substantial degree, there is a prima facie case that the duly constituted public authorities . . . are sufficiently responsible to warrant imposing upon them a nationally applicable burden to demonstrate they nevertheless are operating a genuinely integrated school system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">413 U.S. at 224, 93 S.Ct. at 2705.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">The Court in <em>Keyes </em>specifically reserved the issue of \u201cwhether a \u2018neighborhood school policy\u2019 of itself will justify racial or ethnic concentrations in the absence of a finding that school authorities have committed acts constituting <em>de jure </em>segregation.\u201d 413 U.S. at 212, 93 S.Ct. at 2699.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-19\">We understand the reserved question to be whether it is sufficient to show intentional discriminatory action by someone other than the school board resulting in racially divided neighborhoods, to which the school board applies a \u201cneutral\u201d neighborhood school policy. <em>Cf. </em>Kelly v. Guinn, 456 F.2d 99, 106 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1972). Engrafting a neighborhood school policy onto such involuntary neighborhoods may be sufficient ratification of the illicit intent of others to preclude the necessity for showing a purpose by the school board itself to segregate. At this stage of the litigation, this issue is not presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">. The district court took pendent jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 claim that racial segregation also violates state law, specifically 5 Cal.Admin.Code \u00a7\u00a7 14020-21. Plaintiffs did not seriously press the pendent claim in this court. Further, it is clear from the district court\u2019s opinion that the remedy ordered was based upon the constitutional violation, rather than upon a violation of state law. Therefore, we do not decide whether it was a proper exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion, United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), to accept pendent jurisdiction over a state claim where the impact of the state law is as uncertain as it is here. <em>See </em>Jackson v. Pasadena School District, 59 Cal.2d 876, 31 Cal.Rptr. 606, 382 P.2d 878 (1963); San Francisco Unified School District v. Johnson, 3 Cal.3d 937, 958, 92 Cal.Rptr. 309, 323, 479 P.2d 669, 682 (1971). <em>Cf. </em>Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, -, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-19\">. Rule 24(a) (2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-20\">\u201c(a) Intervention of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">\u201cUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: * * * (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\">. The <em>Smuck </em>court looked to the policies underlying the rule, observing as follows at 379-180:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\u201cThe goal of \u2018disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process\u2019 may in certain circumstances be met by allowing parents whose only \u2018interest\u2019 is the education of their children to intervene. In determining whether such circumstances are present, the first requirement of Rule 24(a) (2), that of an \u2018interest\u2019 in the transaction, may be a less useful point of departure than the second and third requirements, that the applicant may be impeded in protecting his interest by the action and that his interest is not adequately represented by others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">\u201cThis does not imply that the need for an \u2018interest\u2019 in the controversy should or can be read out of the rule. But the requirement should be viewed as a prerequisite rather than relied upon as a determinative criterion for intervention. If barriers are needed to limit extension of the right to intervene, the criteria of practical harm to the applicant and the adequacy of representation by others are better suited to the task.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-14\">. <em>See </em>United States v.

First, the statute gives the individual union members certain rights against their union, and \u2018the Secretary of Labor in effect becomes the union member\u2019s lawyer\u2019 for purposes of enforcing those rights. [Citation omitted.] And second, the Secretary has an obligation to protect the \u2018vital public interest in assuring free and democratic union elections that transcends the narrower interest of the comjdaining union member.\u2019 [Citation omitted.] Both functions are important, and they may not always dictate precisely the same approach to the conduct of the litigation. Even if the Secretary is performing his duties, broadly conceived, as well as can be expected, the union member may have a valid complaint about the performance of \u2018his lawyer.\u2019 Such a complaint, filed by the member who initiated the entire enforcement proceeding, should be regarded as sufficient to warrant relief in the form of intervention under Rule 24(a) (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The Court also observed at 538 n. 10, 92 S.Ct. at 636:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\u201cThe requirement of the Rule [24(a)(2)] is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of his interest \u2018may be\u2019 inadequate; and the burden of making that showing should be treated as minimal.
