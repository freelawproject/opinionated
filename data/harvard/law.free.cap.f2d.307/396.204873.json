At his trial a policeman testified that he saw appellant in the vehicle on that date. The opening statement of appellant\u2019s trial counsel asserted an alibi. The court allowed the prosecution to reopen its case and recall the policeman. He testified that he had been mistaken about the date and that the incident occurred on March 23, as he had testified before the grand jury and as a police \u201crun book\" showed. The court continued the case for a day to \u201cgive the defendant an opportunity to prepare in connection with the 23rd of March instead of the 19th of March.\u201d Appellant testified to alibis for both dates. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-26\">The indictment contained a second count which charged appellant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>unauthorized use of a second car on a second date. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of one to three years on both counts. Since the sentences run concurrently we need not consider his contentions regarding the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
