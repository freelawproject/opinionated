The lower court granted a summary judgment for the defendant-appellee and plaintiff-appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">The plaintiff, through its president David Balogh, had for approximately three years prior to November, 1959, done business with one Julio Castro of Bogota, Colombia, S.A., a tradesman in loose emeralds. Castro advised Balogh that he had a prospective customer for a large emerald and, on November 3, 1959, Castro and Balogh went to the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida to meet the customer. Balogh took with him an emerald, the subject matter of this action, which had been consigned to Balogh by one Jerome Block. Balogh and Castro spent some time in the coffee shop of the hotel and then went to a yacht moored across the street from the hotel; on the way Balogh delivered the emerald to Castro, on consignment, and Castro signed a memorandum so acknowledging. Aboard the yacht, Castro engaged in negotiations for sale of the emerald, with a third party who indicated a desire to have the emerald examined by his jeweler. Castro delivered the emerald to the third party who, having signed a memorandum acknowledging its receipt from Castro, left with the stone. Being advised by the third party to return to the coffee shop, Balogh and Castro waited there for a time, after which they inquired of the jeweler who was to examine the emerald and were informed that no one had been to him for such an examination. Plaintiff later identified the third party to whom the emerald was given and the man was arrested, but was acquitted upon trial. Castro is not accused of being implicated in any fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>lent scheme, but he has refused to pay for the gem. The emerald was never returned to the appellant, Balogh, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The liability of the defendant insurance company in this action depends on whether the loss comes within the exception in the policy, which covered all loss \u201carising from any cause whatsoever except: (A) Loss * * <em>* </em>caused by or resulting from sabotage, theft, conversion or other act or omission of a dishonest character * * * (2) on the part of any person to whom the property hereby insured may be delivered or entrusted by whomsoever for any purpose whatsoever * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">The question, therefore, is narrowed to this: was the emerald \u201cdelivered or entrusted\u201d to the third party who made off with the stone? If so, the exception denies liability; if not, there is coverage. It seems to us beyond question that the loss occurred because of that third person\u2019s dishonest act, whether he was the same person Balogh thought he identified or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The parties have brought before us two cases construing clauses almost identical with that above quoted, wherein opposite conclusions were reached. In Abrams v. Great American Insurance Co. (Ct.App.N.Y., 1935), 269 N.Y. 90, 199 N.E. 15, plaintiff was induced \u201cthrough trick and device, by means of false representations and with intent to steal,\u201d to hand over jewelry to one Rose Friedman for the professed purpose of effecting a sale by her to a third party. Instead, she absconded to France with the jewelry. The plaintiff did not recover, the court reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-8\">\u201cIf plaintiff entrusted the jewelry to Rose Friedman, the transaction falls within the exception, and the loss arising from the larceny or \u2018theft\u2019 or \u2018act of a dishonest character\u2019 by the person to whom the property was \u2018entrusted\u2019 is not covered by the policy. The language employed in the contract of insurance must be given its ordinary meaning, such as the average policyholder of ordinary intelligence, as well as the insurer, would attach to it. Such common words in the policy as \u2018theft,\u2019 \u2018dishonest,\u2019 and \u2018entrusted\u2019 cannot be deemed to have been used as words of art with legalistic implications. The exception in the policy does not include such phrases as \u2018common law or statutory larceny\u2019 but the plain word \u2018theft.\u2019 When the word \u2018entrusted\u2019 appears in the contract the parties must be deemed to have entertained the idea of a surrender or delivery or transfer of possession with confidence that the property would be used for the purpose intended by the owner and as stated by the recipient. The controlling element is the design of the owner rather than the motive of the one who obtained possession. Because plaintiff was deceived and his confidence was abused, he entrusted his property to a thief. The meaning of the word as used in this contract is such \u2018as common thought and common speech would now image and describe it.\u2019 Van Vechten v. American Eagle Fire Ins. Co., 239 N.Y. 303, 307, 146 N.E. 432, 433, 38 A.L.R. 1115. Our view of the case places us in agreement with the decision in Lake v. Simmons, decided by the Court of Appeal (1926) 2 K.B. 51, rather than the opposite decision by the House of Lords in the same case (1927) App.Cas. 487.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">The opposite conclusion was reached in Freedman v. Queen Insurance Company of America, (S.Ct.Cal., 1961), 56 Cal.2d 454, 15 Cal.Rptr. 69, 364 P.2d 245, upon the reasoning that there was no real \u201cconsent\u201d by the owner in that he was induced by fraud and deceit to deliver the item and therefore there was no \u201centrustment.\u201d The California court felt that there was no more delivery or entrustment in such a case than if the item had been handed over at the point of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>We find ourselves in agreement with the Abrams case. The test is the intent or state of mind of the person turning the item over to another, not the intent or state of mind of the person receiving the item. The risk that someone will swindle or trick the insured is excepted from the coverage, by its plain terms \u201cdishonest[y] * * * on the part of any person to whom the property may be delivered or entrusted * * * \u201d To follow the California decision would be to hold that coverage depended upon whether the other party conceived of his dishonest plan before or after he took possession of the property. We do not think that this is the test set out in the language of the policy before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">It is not, in our opinion, controlling that the \u201cdishonest act\u201d in this case was that of the third party, not the one to whom plaintiff entrusted the emerald. The policy says: \u201centrusted by whomsoever;\u201d and here the property was entrusted to the thief by Castro, whom we hold to be included in \u201cwhomsoever.\u201d Moreover, plaintiff-appellant was present through its responsible officer when the property was \u201centrusted\u201d to the thief, and is bound by Castro\u2019s \u201centrustment\u201d to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">The contention that if the insurer wished to exclude or except such losses it could have expressly excluded loss by reason of a fraudulent scheme, trick, devise or false pretense is, in our opinion, without merit. We think that the policy effectively excepts or excludes such loss by excepting loss \u201cresulting * * * from * * * dishonest [y] 1 * * * on the part of any person * * * to whom the property * * * is delivered or entrusted * * The test is whether or not the property was entrusted or delivered to the dishonest person. Here, it is undisputed that the jewel was voluntarily handed over to the thief and thus was, under the terms of the policy, entrusted to him. The judgment of the lower court was right and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
