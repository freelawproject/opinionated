As indicated in our per curiam in 303 F.2d at p. 776, the determination made by us in 1960 as to frivolousness rested upon consideration of an agreed statement of facts prepared by petitioner\u2019s counsel and the United States Attorney and approved by petitioner, the original files of the District Court, a transcript of part of the testimony on the trial and memoranda by both petitioner\u2019s counsel and the United States Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-23\">Our appraisal at that time as to frivolousness was, we think, as heretofore stated, both right and proper on the claims and issues which were sought to be raised. Ibid. But in any event, it was valid and not void judicial action, having finality from the judgment of dismissal, so that petitioner is not entitled to ask to have it reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-24\">Petition for rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
