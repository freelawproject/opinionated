Flora Construction appeared pro se by its president, who is not an attorney at law, and filed a motion for a more definite statement. The trial court held that a corporation may not appear pro se and allowed time for the corporation to secure representation by an attorney at law. Flora Construction moved for reconsideration of this order and, when that motion was denied, filed notice of appeal. Fireman\u2019s Fund moves to dismiss the appeal because of the lack of an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-26\">The record shows no final decision appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and no interlocutory order appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292. The action involves multiple claims and multiple parties and no effort was made to comply with Rule 54(b), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-27\"> In the circumstances we treat the papers presented by Flora Construction as an application for leave to file a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the district court to permit Flora Construction to appear by its president who admittedly is not an attorney at law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The rule is well established that a corporation can appear in a court of record only by an attorney at law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the action of the trial court was entirely proper, application for mandamus is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-12\">.
