United States, 368 U.S. 424, 426, 82 S.Ct. 468, 470, 7 L.Ed.2d 417, 420, where the Supreme Court said: \u201cWe hold that the failure to follow the formal requirements of Rule 32(a) is not of itself an error that can be raised by collateral attack * * * \u201d. Reaffirmance of this holding was made in Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">An examination of the transcript of the sentencing proceedings shows that nothing is involved other than (within the language of the Machibroda case) \u201cthe failure of the District Court specifically to inquire at the time of sentencing whether the petitioner personally wanted to make a statement in his own behalf\u201d. No circumstances of a judicial abuse are present which could render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>proceedings void. The question on the appeal here thus is ruled by the holding in the Hill and Machibroda cases that failure to make such an inquiry of the defendant is \u201cnot of itself\u201d a ground for vacating a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The motion of the Government to dismiss the appeal as frivolous is accordingly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
