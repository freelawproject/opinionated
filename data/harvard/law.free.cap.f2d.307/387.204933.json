He had been driving and occasionally backing for 1% to <em>2y2 </em>hours. A crane was mounted on the truck. The weight of the whole was about 68,000 pounds (34 tons). The truck did not have power steering.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-29\">Though the work Vinson was doing when he died was, as the Deputy Commissioner found, a normal part of his job, the Deputy Commissioner denied compensation to Vinson\u2019s widow and chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>dren. -He found that Vinson \u201cwas not subjected to heavy physical strain\u201d and that death \u201cdid not result from injury arising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d. There is no substantial support in the record for these findings. The District Court therefore erred in granting summary judgment for the ap-pellees in this suit by the appellants to set aside the order denying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"> \u201cOur task is to ascertain whether the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence upon the record considered as a whole * * *. The reviewing court will not sustain the administrative findings merely because they are substantiated by some isolated evidence. Our review must also take account of the settled rule that the Act is to be construed with a view to its beneficent purposes. Doubts, including the factual, are to be resolved in favor of the employee or his dependent family.\u201d Friend v. Britton, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 139, 141, 220 F.2d 820, 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Anyone who distinctly remembers turning and backing an ordinary car, without power steering, when the car was moving slowly, knows it was hard work. Obviously it would have been harder if the ear had weighed 34 tons. If there were no evidence in the present record that driving and backing 34 tons of truck and crane, without power steering, on a construction site, was strenuous work, we might perhaps take judicial notice of the fact. But there is ample evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">A fellow employee <em>of </em>Vinson testified that moving the steering wheel of the truck was \u201chard labor * * * very hard. A hard maneuver. * * * I know of many times I reached up and actually helped him pull the wheel around.\u201d A heavy \u201ccounterweight\u201d was usually over the rear wheels of the truck but was over the front wheels when Vinson died. The operator of the crane on the truck testified that this position of the counterweight made steering hard for the truck driver and that sometimes \u201cit would take two people [to] turn the wheel. * * * When you make a tight turn you need all the help you can get.\u201d A foreman testified that when Vinson died he was \u201cmaneuvering and backing in to a very tight and difficult spot.\u201d The fellow employee had suggested to Vinson that he \u201cget a lighter job * * * because it was just too much for a man his age and it took a young man with a lot of muscle power to drive it.\u201d He made this suggestion \u201cwatching him sweat and try to turn that rig around, trying to get it back into places and stuff like that * * *. Because I seen it was hard work for him.\u201d Vinson himself had talked about getting an easier job \u201cbecause it was pretty hard to steer, especially in that particular position.\u201d Shortly before Vinson died, as on earlier occasions, he had been helped in turning the wheel. There is no suggestion he was being helped when he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">A witness who succeeded Vinson as operator of the truck testified that it was \u201cquite hard\u201d to steer and that he needed help a \u201cnumber of times\u201d. He undertook to explain this by saying that \u201cwith the anchor bolts in the positions that they were in accordance with the H beams, you have to back in between the H beams and the anchor bolts being in the way, * * * you have to stop, turn the wheel while sitting still, which is a lot harder to steer than it is if you are moving, and to miss these anchor bolts, you have to move the wheel as far as possible to clear these bolts and to get back in between the H beams. And it is quite a strain.\u201d <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">One witness who had operated a similar \u201crig\u201d but not this one thought \u201cextraordinary strength\u201d was not required. Another such witness thought this truck was no more difficult to manage than any other truck with manual steering but \u201call truck driving is a manual operation and it is hard work\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Dr. Ethridge, a specialist in cardiology, concluded from the autopsy report that Vinson had a pre-existing arteriosclerosis. He thought the work Vinson \u201cwas performing was competent to precipitate, to accelerate an arteriosclerotic condition to the point where it causes death from coronary insufficiency, secondary to sclerosis.\u201d \u201cStrenuous physical effort\u201d could, and probably did, cause Vinson\u2019s death. \u201cSometimes, this exertion, physical exertion, causes no difficulty and other times it could cause either death or a heart attack * * * and it is often very difficult to know why on a particular day a certain degree of effort produces a lot of trouble \u2014 -I mean, patients end up in the hospital because they have difficulty or even die, and on another day seemingly might have done something similar without difficulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Dr. Walsh, another specialist in cardiology, gave it as his \u201cconclusion that there was no evidence that there was a relationship between his work and his death\u201d, but he based this conclusion on a belief that there was no \u201cdefinite evidence * * * as to whether this man at the time that he died was engaged in extra strenuous activity * * *.\u201d No one who knew the record could have entertained such a belief. He recognized that if \u201cone was doing something very strenuous, something unusual, then we would say, or I would say it was probably that there was a relationship between actually an individual\u2019s sudden death due to acute coronary insufficiency and this unusual effort.\u201d He recognized that \u201cCertainly the job must have been at times strenuous if it took two men to turn the wheel of the truck. That would be obvious to everyone.\u201d Since Vinson was \u201cmaneuvering and backing in to a very tight and difficult spot\u201d when he died, it seems clear that this was one of the times when his job was very strenuous. He was doing alone the sort of thing it sometimes took two men to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-14\">. As this witness was the last, the medical witnesses did not have the benefit of his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
