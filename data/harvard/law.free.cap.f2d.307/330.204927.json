The District Court denied recovery. Its opinion is reported at 190 F. Supp. 95. The jurisdiction of the District Court is founded on \u00a7 7402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The jurisdiction of this Court rests on Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1291-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-21\">The Washington Toll Bridge Authority was established, and its powers and duties prescribed, by the laws of 1937, Chapt. 173, p. 654.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is an instrumentality of the State of Washington and exists, for the most part, as a self-supporting entity with all of the rights and liabilities of a common carrier. Since 1951, it has operated an extensive ferry system on the Puget Sound and its tributaries between local and international points. This system is perhaps the larg-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>es\u00ed of its kind in the United States. Its necessity is dictated by the geography of the area and it provides a vital link in the State\u2019s highway system, carrying passengers and property over various bodies of water to connect the State highways and thereby avoiding circuitous land travel. The ferry system operated by the Authority is an expansion of services formerly provided, in part, by King County, State of Washington, a municipal corporation, and its successor, King County Ferry District No. 1, and, in greater part, by the Puget Sound Navigation Company, a private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Since the commencement of the Authority\u2019s ferry operations, the United States has pursued it for taxes imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 4261, 42571 and 4291, Title 26 U.S. C.A. of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These provisions are comprehensive in application. They impose a tax upon the \u201camount paid\u201d for the transportation of persons or property \u201cby water\u201d and other means. The tax is made payable by the .person paying for the transportation and the person receiving the payment is obligated to collect the tax. From June 1951 until April 1, 1952, the Authority collected and paid similar taxes under protest. Thereafter, it entered into extended negotiations with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which culminated in an agreement whereby past claims were compromised. In order to adjudicate the question the Authority agreed to raise its fares in an amount equal to the tax and to place the amount in escrow and, in turn, the Commissioner agreed to promptly initiate litigation. Pursuant to this agreement an amount equal to the tax was collected by the Authority for the first three quarters of 1957 and placed in escrow. The United States made its assessment and filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The findings of fact by the District Court are based upon a stipulation with exhibits and the testimony of Darrell Hedges, executive secretary of the Authority. These findings are not strenuously disputed and are substantially, though more detailed, the same as heretofore recited. The District Court, following a previous decision of this Court, infra, reached the conclusion that the operation of the ferry system by the Authority was a governmental function and, as such, was immune from federal taxation. In addition, the District Court held that these tax provisions were not intended by Congress to apply to state-operated ferry systems. The correctness of these conclusions of law are the primary concern of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">In United States v. King County, 281 F. 686 (9th Cir.1922), this Court held that the ferry system operated by King County was immune from a federal tax of the type here involved because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201can interference with and a burden upon the governmental functions of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Contrary to the assertion of appellant that the Washington Toll Bridge authority exists as a \u201cseparate entity,\u201d specially created by the State of Washington rather than as an \u201cagency\u201d of the State in the full sense of that term, we shall consider the questions involved in this appeal on the basis of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Authority is an instrumentality of the State of Washington authorized to operate the ferry system as an integral part of the highway system of the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It was recognized at the time of the decision in King .County, as it is now, that the control over, and the operation of, ferries is historically a governmental function. It was thought at the time of such decision and for some years thereafter, in order to preserve the independence of the State, that the federal government could not constitutionally impose a tax on State activities determined to be governmental in character as opposed to activities determined to be proprietary. In more recent years, however, this distinction has been recognized as an unsatisfactory and inconclusive guide for determining the immunity of a State activity from the federal taxing power. In Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 58 S.Ct. 969, 82 L.Ed. 1427 (1938), the question for decision was whether the imposition of a federal income tax on salaries received by employees of the Port of New York Authority placed an unconstitutional burden on the States of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is a bi-state corporation created by compact between New York and New Jersey and approved by the Congress of the United States. The Authority constructed vehicular bridges over waters of New York Harbor or adjacent to it, and vehicular tunnels under the Hudson River. The Authority collected tolls from the users of such facilities. It is obvious that the bridges and tunnels formed a part of the highway systems of the two States and that the construction and operation of the same was a governmental function. It was contended that the imposition of a federal income tax on the salaries paid to employees of the Authority constituted an interference with and a burden upon the States in the performance of a governmental function. This contention was rejected by the Supreme Court in sustaining the imposition of the tax. In the course of its opinion, the Court stated (at pp. 419-420, 58 S. Ct. at p. 975) that prior judicial pronouncements of that Court establish</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2W\">\u201ctwo guiding principles of limitation for holding the tax immunity of state instrumentalities to its proper function. The one, dependent upon the- nature of the function being performed by the state or in its behalf, excludes from the immunity activities thought not to be essential to the preservation of state governments even though the tax be collected from the state treasury. * * * The other principle, exemplified by those cases where the tax laid upon individuals affects the state only as the burden is passed on to it by the taxpayer, forbids recognition of the immunity when the burden on the state is so speculative and uncertain that if allowed it would restrict the federal taxing power without affording any corresponding tangible protection to the state government; even though the function be thought important enough to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>mand immunity from a tax upon the state itself, it is not necessarily protected from a tax which well may be substantially or entirely absorbed by private persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Further, in the course of its opinion, the Court stated, at p. 422, 58 S.Ct. at p. 976:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeG\">\u201c * * * The state and national governments must co-exist. Each must be supported by taxation of those who are citizens of both. The mere fact that the economic burden of such taxes may be passed on to a state government and thus increase to some extent, here wholly conjectural, the expense of its operation, infringes no constitutional immunity. Such burdens are but normal incidents of the organization within the same territory of two governments, each possessed of the taxing power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In New York v. United States, 326 U.S 572, 66 S.Ct. 310, 90 L.Ed. 326 (1946), the Supreme Court held that the State of New York was not immune from the tax imposed by \u00a7 615 of the Revenue Act of 1932 on the sale of mineral waters taken from Saratoga Springs owned and operated by the State. The State of New York contended that it was immune from the tax because it was engaged in the disposition of its natural resources and that such activity was governmental in character. While it can be reasonably asserted that in the sale of mineral waters the State was engaging in a proprietary instead of a governmental function, the Court took occasion to state (at p. 580, 66 S.Ct. at p. 313), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201c * * * To res^ thg federal taxing power on what is \u2018normally\u2019 conducted by private enterprise in contradiction to the \u2018usual\u2019 governmental functions is too shifting a basis for determining constitutional power and too entangled in expediency to serve as a dependable legal criterion. The essential nature of the problem cannot be hidden by an attempt to separate manifestations of indivisible governmental powers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">In concluding its opinion, the Court stated, at p. 583, 66 S.Ct. at p. 314:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">\u201c * * * So we decide enough when we reject limitations upon the taxing power of Congress derived from such untenable criteria as \u2018proprietary\u2019 against \u2018governmental\u2019 activities of the States, or historically sanctioned activities of government, or activities conducted merely for profit, and find no restriction upon Congress to include the States in levying a tax exacted equally from private persons upon the same subject matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">From the teachings of the above cited cases<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is manifest that immunity of the State activity here involved from the taxing power of the federal government cannot be successfully asserted on the <em>ad hoc </em>basis that such activity involves a governmental function. Attention must be focused on the specific activity and on the nature and extent of interference with, or burden upon, the State, and this interference or burden must be \u201cactual and substantial,\u201d and not the creature of speculation and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Applying these teachings to the instant case, it is difficult to understand how the present tax unduly interferes with the State of Washington\u2019s function of government. The record is void of any tangible evidence to this effect. The tax involved is made payable by the persons who pay for the transportation while the State\u2019s only obligation is to collect the tax. Since the King County case, the States have been forced to accept the role of tax collector for the federal government on numerous occasions, e. g., income and admission taxes. See Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. United States, 296 F.2d 336 (1st.Cir.1961). Such collections have not unduly interfered with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>or placed a burden upon, the states\u2019 function of government. And because the tax is absorbed by the persons using the ferry system, it imposes no undue economic burden upon the State of Washington. Any indirect economic consequences incident to such a tax, such as a decrease in the volume of business if the toll is raised or absorption by the State if it is not, are speculative in nature, not \u201cactual or substantial.\u201d Here the Authority raised its toll in an amount equal to the tax and there is no claim that this has affected the operation of its ferry system in any manner. Consequently, we hold that the Authority is not constitutionally immune from the duty to collect and to remit to the United States Government the federal excise taxes on transportation here involved. This holding requires us to, and we do, overrule the earlier holding of this Court in the King County case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Having concluded that no immunity from the duty to collect and remit the taxes exists, the next question is whether Congress intended them to apply to a State-operated ferry system. For this purpose the provisions concerning the tax on persons and property will be considered separately. Section 4271 imposes the tax upon the \u201camount paid\u201d for the transportation of property \u201cby water\u201d and other means. It is imposed on the person paying for said transportation. Section 4272(a) discloses that this tax does not apply to amounts paid to a person who is not \u201cengaged in the business of transporting property for hire.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These Sections were construed in United States v. State Road Department of Florida, 255 F.2d 516 (5th Cir.1958). There the Court recognized the power of Congress to tax non-discriminatorily activities of a State and, conversely, to exempt a State from such a tax. It held that the exemption in \u00a7 4272(a) applied to a State-operated ferry system because it was not \u201cengaged in the business of transporting property for hire.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In view of the historical nature of a State-operated or controlled ferry system and its function as a link in a highway system, this Court agrees with the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, construing \u00a7 4272 (a) as exempting the tax otherwise made payable under \u00a7 4271 for the transportation of property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Section 4261 imposes the tax on persons. It is likewise made payable by the person paying for the transportation. However, this provision has no exemption equivalent to \u00a7 4272(a) where payments are made to persons not engaged in the business of transporting for hire. Nor do any of the exemptions for the tax imposed on persons, as specified in \u00a7 4263, apply here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, neither \u00a7 4272(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>nor the State Road Department of Florida case is authority for reasoning that the tax on persons is not applicable to State-operated ferry systems. Congress must haye intended to, and did, treat the tax on persons and property differently, enacting statutes broad in scope to encompass the subject matter here involved, but exempting therefrom the tax on property and not the tax on persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">It may be argued that only \u201cpersons\u201d receiving the payments are obligated to collect the tax under \u00a7 4291 and that a State is not such a person. However, a State has been considered a person under comparable statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Any other construction of the word \u201cperson\u201d would be unreasonable once it is determined that the tax sought to be collected applies and is within the constitutional power of Congress to impose. The Authority\u2019s argument that a state is not such a \u201cperson\u201d is untenable and assumes a factual situation not disclosed by the record. This Court concludes that \u00a7\u00a7 4261 and 4291 require passengers of the ferry system to pay the tax and the Authority to collect it and pay it over to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"> We find no merit in the Authority\u2019s contention that the decision of this Court in the King County case is <em>res judicata </em>in this case. This defense is inapplicable for the reasons that a different tax year is involved, a different statute is involved, and different parties are involved. Similarly, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable. As stated in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, at p. 599, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c * *\u2022 * That principle [collateral estoppel] is designed to prevent repetitious lawsuits over matters which have once been decided and which have remained substantially static, factually and legally. It is not meant to create vested rights in decisions that have become obsolete or erroneous with time, thereby causing inequities among taxpayers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to-enter judgment in accordance with the-views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-22\">.

After holding that the operation of a ferry was strictly a governmental function, the Court said, at p. 690:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u201cIt is true that in the [instant] case the tax was not imposed directly upon the county of King, but upon the persons paying to it the transportation charges; but it is obvious that the collection of those charges is at least one of the means which the county must resort to for the purpose of paying the costs of the ferry, which, if insufficient, must be made good from its other revenues or by general taxation. Hence it seems plain that the federal tax here involved is an interference with and a burden upon the governmental functions of the state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">.
