Until July 4, 1946,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he was either an \u00bflien or a noncitizen of the United States. Since July 4, 1946, he has been, and is still, an alien. He was admitted to the United States as a non-immigrant alien on October 2, 1959. He has never been admitted for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Appellant enlisted in the naval forces of the United States on August 2, 1928, at which time he was in the United States. He served honorably in an active-duty status in said forces from August 2, 1928, to August 1, 1932, when he was separated from said service under honorable conditions. He enlisted in said forces on October 12, 1932, at which time he was in the Philippine Islands. He served honorably in an active-duty status in said forces from October 12, 1932, to November 11, 1937, when he was transferred to the naval reserve. He was recalled to an active-duty status in said forces on December 16, 1941, and served honorably in said status from December 16, 1941, to January 25, 1947, when he was separated from said service under honorable conditions. The service on which he based his petition was that performed between December 16, 1941,- and December 31, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">Because, at the time of his latest enlistment \u2014 October 12, 1932 \u2014 appellant was not in the United States, the Canal Zone, American Samoa or Swains Island, the District Court held he was not entitled to naturalization under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1440(a). We-do not agree. We hold that, as used in \u00a7 1440(a), the term \u201cenlistment\u201d included appellant\u2019s enlistment of August 2, 1928, at which time, as stated above, he was in the United States. That the enlistment of October 12, 1932, was the enlistment next preceding the period of service on which the petition was based is, in our opinion, immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">Tak Shan Pong v. United States, 359 U.S. 102, 79 S.Ct. 637, 3 L.Ed.2d 662, cited in the District Court\u2019s opinion, did not arise under \u00a7 1440(a) and is not in point here.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">Order reversed and case remanded, with directions to enter an order granting appellant\u2019s petition for naturalization.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-21\">This opinion was written and approved prior to Judge Mathews\u2019 death on September 7, 1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">.
