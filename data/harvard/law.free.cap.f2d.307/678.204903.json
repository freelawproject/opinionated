The trial court\u2019s refusal to direct an acquittal as to appellant was clearly correct since the evidence left a distinct issue as to illegal possession of recently stolen property which was for the jury to resolve. Appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court should have given an instruction on circumstantial evidence is also without merit. Defense counsel in the trial court did not object to the court\u2019s refusal to give such an instruction, and later expressed satisfaction with the instructions that were given. Viewing the record as a whole, the trial court\u2019s decision to withhold an instruction on circumstantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>dence could not reasonably be noted by this court under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C. See Cogdell v. United States, No. 16696, D.C.Cir., 307 F.2d 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b725-5\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AyM\">(concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In my view of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, the question whether the court was required to grant appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal is a close one. But I cannot say that the court\u2019s refusal is error. Therefore I concur in affirming the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
