An impairment which is readily remediable does not qualify as one \u201cof long-continued, indefinite duration.\u201d Bradey v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 855, 857 (4th Cir. 1962). But a person shown to be completely disabled is not to be denied benefits upon a mere suggestion that a remedy may be possible in some indefinite future.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">In the present case, the claimant asserted, and Dr. Poole, called by the Secretary, confirmed that Stephens has a heart disease. Though not organic in origin, his condition, diagnosed as \u201cneurocirculatory asthenia \u2014 a neurosis of the heart,\u201d is disabling and in fact disables this claimant. On slight exertion he experiences an \u201ceffort syndrome,\u201d manifested by fatigue, anxiety, palpitation of the heart, and sticking pains in the chest. The record reveals not the slightest reason to doubt that Stephens was on the date of claimed disability and is presently unable to engage in any \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d The only question is whether his condition is remediable. Dr. Poole, not a psychiatrist, testified that neurocirculatory asthenia is at least \u201cpartially\u201d curable by psychiatric treatment, but that \u201cit would be a long, hard road.\u201d The psychiatrist to whom the Secretary sent Stephens confirmed Dr. Poole\u2019s diagnosis of the illness, but he was not asked and did not express an opinion as to the nature and extent of the treatment that could be given this claimant or the prospects for recovery within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">In the absence of testimony on this point one cannot make a judgment as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>remediability. The examiner\u2019s determination that Stephens was not entitled to benefits is grounded on Dr. Poole\u2019s testimony, which was most vague on this point. The Secretary does not suggest that such speculative evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the claimant\u2019s condition is remediable. Rather, he argues that the claimant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We think that the judgment should be vacated with directions to the District Court to remand the case to the trial examiner for further development of the issue of remediability. It seems clear that more enlightening evidence is available on the issue, and in all fairness to both parties, this should be made part of the record before a final decision is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Order vacated and case remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
