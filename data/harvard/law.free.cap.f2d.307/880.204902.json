From its consideration of that record, the district court held that the state court disbarment proceedings were consistent with due process to appellant; that the evidence presented at the state court hearing was sufficient to justify the state disbarment order; that there was no grave reason why, in the interest of right and justice the district court should not accept the Pennsylvania disbarment proceedings and that consequently \u201c * * * none 0f the conditions which might erase appellant\u2019s status of unworthiness is present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">Appellant was not entitled to a trial de novo in the district court. He had the duty of coming forward with evidence to rebut the state court record. He declined that opportunity. He had a proper and fair hearing in both the state and district court proceedings.
