After noting the difficulty of determining from the papers before him what was the law applicable to the libel, concededly that of Turkey, Judge Metzner based his order fixing the amount of the bond on the apparent availability in Turkey of assets of the respondent sufficient to meet any award made to the libellant in arbitration proceedings pending there and on affidavits of the proctors for both parties concerning negotiations between them for a release of the attachment. The libellant contests the appropriateness of these considerations in determining what was a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d amount for the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Without passing on the question of ap-pealability, we find no merit in the appellant\u2019s contentions, and for that reason affirm the order below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
