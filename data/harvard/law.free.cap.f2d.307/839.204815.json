The maximum penalty for each offense is five years imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-28\">On April 9, 1962, the district court entered a judgment of conviction against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>the defendant expressly noting that the judgment was entered pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). This statute empowers a court for a maximum period of six months to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence without being restricted to sixty days, as provided by Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. Following the April 9 judgment, defendant was placed in the custody of the Attorney General and committed by him to the United States Penitentiary at Lewis-burg, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Thereafter, on July 17, 1962, again pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b), the district court entered an Order On Probation, suspending sentence and placing the defendant on probation for a term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Defendant took no appeal from the April 9 judgment but has appealed the Order On Probation entered July 17, 1962. The United States Attorney\u2019s position is that the judgment of April 9, 1962, under \u00a7 4208(b), was a final appeal-able judgment and that defendant\u2019s right of appeal has been lost by failure to give notice of appeal within ten days thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The defendant contends that under the April'9 judgment \u201cNo sentence whatever was pronounced. No punishment was imposed, * * However, the district court expressly noted that it was acting under the provisions of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). Under this section the statute clearly states that the term of \u201ccommitment shall be deemed to be for the maximum sentence of imprisonment prescribed by law.\u201d Consequently, at this point the defendant was on notice as to the extent of his punishment. If he desired to appeal, this was the time that he should have acted. While it is true that defendant could reasonably assume that the judge would modify this maximum sentence, the judge was assuredly under no duty to do so. See United States v. Behrens, 190 F.Supp. 799 (D.C.S.D., Ind.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">An order will be entered docketing the case and granting the motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
