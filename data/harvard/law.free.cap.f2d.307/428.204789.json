It is conceded that International engaged in certain unfair labor practices, including the discharge of several employees because of their union activities. The sole issue here is whether the Board properly found that Gibraltar Industries, Inc., was a joint employer with International of the affected employees and thus jointly subject to the remedial portion of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-24\">Though there is no substantial dispute as to the evidentiary facts, Gibraltar challenges some of the Board\u2019s inferene-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>es and the ultimate conclusion drawn from those facts. International, wholly owned by its president, James Fyle, had been engaged for several years in the manufacture of mobile homes and cpm-mercial trailers at its plant in Baltimore, Maryland. At the time of the hearing in January 1961, International was insolvent and in receivership in a state court. On December 2, 1960, International ceased doing business and a few days thereafter all former International employees went to work for Gibraltar doing exactly the same work they had done for International.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In December 1958 Gibraltar was formed by Charles Frederick Painter and E. B. Jeffress to engage in business as a wholesale mobile-home dealer. James Fyle became Gibraltar\u2019s secretary and a holder of two per cent of its stock. On January 1, 1960, Painter bought Jeffress\u2019 interest in Gibraltar and thus became the owner of ninety-eight per cent of that corporation\u2019s outstanding stock. Shortly after Gibraltar was organized, it executed, with Painter individually and with International, a contract whereby International agreed to sell all the mobile homes it produced to Gibraltar which, in turn, agreed to buy all its mobile homes from International. Painter agreed to provide International with working capital and to indemnify its suppliers. The-agreement was subject to termination upon terms and conditions not here relevant ; it had not been terminated at the time International went out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Apparently because International was so critically short of working capital, it was unable, soon after executing _the 1958 agreement, to meet the production quota established therein and Painter was dissatisfied with the workmanship and the quality of the finished products. In early 1959 Gibraltar established offices on International\u2019s premises. Painter moved into offices adjoining Fyle\u2019s office and a \u201cGibraltar\u201d sign was placed over that corporation\u2019s office door. Both Painter and Gibraltar began advancing large sums of money to International. In June 1959, Fyle endorsed all his shares of International stock \u2014 the total outstanding issue \u2014 to Painter, who was also given a chattel mortgage on most of International\u2019s equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A written hypothecation instrument was executed by Fyle with respect to the \u201cassignment\u201d of the International stock which permitted Painter to sell the shares in accord with the terms of a note to be signed by International as evidence of the loan. The record does not indicate that such a note was ever executed, and Fyle testified that when he turned the stock over to Painter, he relinquished control of International and never expected to have the stock returned to him. Painter testified that he took the stock in addition to a chattel mortgage on International\u2019s equipment as security for the loans to International.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">By June 23, 1959, when the stock \u201cassignment\u201d was made, Painter had access to all International books and records and, according to Fyle, it was Painter who completely controlled International. But during the ensuing months International\u2019s financial condition became worse despite Painter\u2019s aid. In October 1959 International\u2019s bank refused to permit Fyle to draw any more checks on the corporation\u2019s account. For a few months International was permitted to retain a checking account with Painter as a guarantor, but after February 1960 International\u2019s account was discontinued entirely; thereafter the company had no bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Although the 1958 agreement required only Painter\u2019s personal indemnification of International\u2019s suppliers, Gibraltar began in early 1960 (right after the closing of International\u2019s bank account) to pay the suppliers directly, taking credit for such amounts against future delivery of mobile homes. Eventually purchases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of materials for the use of International were made directly on Gibraltar purchase orders. Painter, in February 1960, began advancing cash to meet International\u2019s weekly payroll and this procedure continued through the remaining months that International was in business. Other funds were advanced to pay for all insurance carried by International, including workmen\u2019s compensation insurance for all the corporation\u2019s employees. In the early summer of 1960, when International\u2019s credit had become suspect among dealers and suppliers, the \u201cInternational\u201d sign was removed and a \u201cGibraltar\u201d sign was installed over the door of <em>International\u2019s offices. </em>Also, Gibraltar\u2019s name, instead of International\u2019s, began appearing on the completed mobile homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Early in 1960, International was about $8000 in arrears in its rent when the owner of the premises demanded a guarantee of payment by a responsible party. Painter assumed liability for the payment of the back rent and advanced funds each month for the current rent. In August 1960 International\u2019s lease expired and Gibraltar took it over, retaining the right to terminate it upon sixty days\u2019 notice to the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">As Painter and Gibraltar gained financial control over International, Painter himself commenced direct participation in the actual operations of International\u2019s business. The 1958 agreement authorized Painter to inspect International\u2019s inventory and production records and to refuse to guarantee payment of suppliers when in his discretion inventory was in excess of production needs. After Painter became Gibraltar\u2019s dominant stockholder in January 1960 he began to make frequent appearances at International\u2019s production line, inspecting the work, making suggestions and ordering changes which he thought necessary or desirable. He sometimes appeared at meetings of supervisors and group leaders and in other ways exerted his influence over the details of the production processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">There are several instances where Painter exercised control over International\u2019s employees. In June 1959 he decided that the plant superintendent who had worked for International a number of years was not capable and should be replaced. Wayne Stutsman was employed as the new plant superintendent, according to the Board\u2019s findings, at the instigation of Painter. At one point Fyle noticed that he, as president of International, was receiving less compensation for his work than was the plant superintendent and decided to give himself a raise of $50 per week. In the discussion that followed, Painter told Fyle that he (Fyle) was not as valuable an employee as the plant superintendent; Fyle did not receive the raise he had intended. International\u2019s controller, who had been selected and employed by Painter to guide Fyle\u2019s purchasing policies, looked to Painter for a salary increase. Over Fyle\u2019s objection, Painter determined that Fyle\u2019s former secretary should not be rehired. In the summer of 1960 Painter\u2019s personal airplane pilot was made purchasing agent for International though he remained on Gibraltar\u2019s payroll. Leroy McDonald, paint foreman for International, testified that he wanted to quit his job but that Painter persuaded him to stay and gave him a raise. Painter further manifested his control over International\u2019s affairs by dismissing the purchasing agent employed by International (prior to appointing his pilot for the job) and on another occasion by telling Stutsman to hire a particular boy as a painter.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In May 1960 Fyle prepared a classified advertisement seeking craftsmen needed for International\u2019s production line. Upon Painter\u2019s order, however, the advertising copy was changed by substituting Gibraltar\u2019s name in the text instead of that of International.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The Board, upon the basis of the economic relationship between Gibraltar and International, the control Gibraltar exercised over the employees of International, and the active participation of Painter in the unfair labor practices (which concededly did occur with Painter\u2019s knowledge, consent and encourage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ment), disagreed with the Trial Examiner\u2019s finding that Painter\u2019s conduct \u201cmerely displayed a creditor\u2019s concern.\u201d The Board reversed the Examiner\u2019s amendment of the complaint by which he had eliminated the allegation that International\u2019s employees were also employees of Gibraltar. It found Gibraltar and International to be joint employers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We are of the opinion that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion and order imposing joint and several liability on both corporations for the unfair labor practices found. Gibraltar contends that it and International are separate legal entities and that since the unfair labor practices were against International employees by the management of International, it (Gibraltar) should not be jointly liable for the remedial portion of the Board\u2019s order. It is also urged that Gibraltar was not a joint employer of the affected employees because (1) neither Gibraltar nor its principal stockholder, Painter, <em>owned </em>any stock in International; (2) Painter was not an officer or director of International; (3) each corporation maintained separate offices though in the same building; (4) each corporation kept its own books and records; (5) Gibraltar paid rent to International; (6) each corporation had its own employees; (7) the two corporations had a contractual arrangement under which each operated with respect to the other; (8) all funds advanced by Gibraltar to International were charged against the future delivery of trailers to be built; (9) Painter and Gibraltar were not the only creditors of International in substantial amounts; and (10) the concern and interest manifested by Painter and Gibraltar in International\u2019s work product was only that of any purchaser who was obligated to buy the product for resale. We do not find these arguments persuasive. There is ample evidence in the record showing almost complete control by Gibraltar\u2019s president, Painter, of International\u2019s affairs. It may well be, as Gibraltar argues, that such control was necessary under the circumstances to protect an investment, but notwithstanding the necessity of such control, it is evident that the employees of International from its president down were <em>de facto </em>employees of Gibraltar at the time the unfair labor practices here involved occurred. Where necessary to safeguard statutory rights, the Board may view separate legal entities as a single employing enterprise. See N. L. R. B. v. Jones Sausage Co., 257 F.2d 878 (4th Cir. 1958); N. L. R. B. v. Williams, 195 F.2d 669 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 834, 73 S.Ct. 42, 97 L.Ed. 649 (1952). In Williams, the court, considering two closely-related businesses as constituting an appropriate single bargaining unit, stated that the test for determination of that issue is whether there are present unity of interest, common control, dependent operation, sameness in character of work and unity of labor relations between the separate entities involved. We approve the application of the same test in deciding the issue in the case at bar and reach the conclusion that Gibraltar was properly found to be a joint employer with International. The Board is entitled to consider <em>de facto </em>control in ordering remedial action by a party exercising such control in a manner which violates the National Labor Relations Act. See N. L. R. B. v. Dayton Coal &amp; Iron Corp., 208 F.2d 394 (6th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">. In November 1960, about a week after the complaint was issued in the instant case, Painter began foreclosure proceedings. The following month Painter bought at public auction all the items covered in the mortgage, which constituted virtually everything International owned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">. The Supreme Court in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 496-497, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), made it perfectly clear that slavish deference by the Board to the Examiner\u2019s decision is not required. In the instant case the Examiner found James Eyle a biased witness and placed little confidence in his testimony. The Board\u2019s findings do not depend to any substantial extent on Eyle\u2019s credibility, however. In reviewing the whole record, we have examined and considered the Trial Examiner\u2019s Intermediate Report, but in our opinion the Board was justified in rejecting part of that Report and the Examiner\u2019s recommendation with respect to the amendment of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
