The petition was timely filed. Service was properly made, and the deportation was stayed. This court has jurisdiction to review the order entered below under the provisions of Section 1105a of Title 8 United States Code Annotated, and Sections 1031-1042 of Title 5, United States Code Annotated.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-22\">The question here presented is whether respondent\u2019s order is erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-23\">The facts are not in dispute. They may be summarized as follows: Petitioner is an alien, a native and citizen of China, who was first lawfully admitted into the United States in 1919 as the lawful minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>son of a domiciled merchant. He last entered the United States at the Port of Honolulu, the then Territory of Hawaii, on August 10,1950, at which time he was admitted as a lawful returning permanent resident in possession of a valid re-entry permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">On February 15, 1954, petitioner was convicted of a conspiracy to assist other aliens to enter the United States in violation of the law. The district court, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 241(b) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(b) (2)), recommended to the Attorney General that petitioner \u201cbe not deported.\u201d This resulted in the provision of Subsection (a) (4) of \u00a7 1251 being inapplicable (conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Despite this judicial recommendation, and the resulting inapplicability of \u00a7 1251 (a) (4), on April 3, 1954 respondent issued a warrant of arrest charging petitioner as being deportable under \u00a7 241 (a) (13) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">After an extensive hearing, the Special Inquiry Officer, in a decision dated July 18, 1955, sustained the charge and directed that petitioner be deported from the United States. This decision was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals on December 20, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Petitioner does not set forth his specification of errors in conformity with the rules of this court. In his statement of of facts, however, he says :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">\u201cThis petition for review was filed for the specific purpose of seeking a judicial determination as to whether the administrative decision is erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Thus, petitioner does not here assert that the record in no way supports respondent\u2019s decision; consequently, this court is not called upon to determine whether there is reasonable, substantial, or probative evidence in the record to support respondent\u2019s order. The issue presented, in petitioner\u2019s words, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-15\">\u201cThe Immigration and Naturalization Service erred in holding petitioner subject to deportation on the charge set forth in the warrant of arrest contrary to the recommendation of the District Court to the Attorney General that petitioner not be deported from the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">It is petitioner\u2019s contention that respondent is without jurisdiction or power to deport him because petitioner is entitled to the benefit of the district court\u2019s recommendation that he not be deported. The district court\u2019s recommendation was founded upon \u00a7 241(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which, prior to enactment of the Narcotics Control Act of 1956, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-17\">\u201c(b) The provisions of subsection (a) (4) of this section respecting the deportation of an alien convicted of a crime or crimes shall not apply (1) in the case of any alien who has subsequent to such conviction been granted a full and unconditional pardon by the President of the United States or by the Governor of any of the several States, or (2) if the court sentencing such alien for such crimes shall make, at the time of first imposing judgment or passing sentence, or within thirty days thereafter, a recommendation to the Attorney General that such alien not be deported, due notice having been given prior to making such recommendation to representatives of the interested State, the Service, and prosecution authorities, who shall be granted an opportunity to make representations in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>As one reads \u00a7 241(b), it seems fairly clear that the power of the sentencing court to recommend that a convicted alien not be deported is limited to those cases where an alien is convicted of an offense within the meaning of \u00a7 241(a) (4) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (4)). But, as read and applied by some courts, \u00a7 241(b) was not free from ambiguity. The ambiguity in the scope of the application of \u00a7 241(b) resulted from first, the vague and uncertain language (here acknowledged to be so by respondent) of \u00a7 241(a) (4), <em>and </em>secondly, because for a number of years sentencing courts made judicial recommendations against deportation in cases where aliens were convicted of a violation of the narcotics laws <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 even though aliens convicted of violations of narcotics laws were specifically deportable under \u00a7 241(a) (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">With this brief background in mind, suffice it to say that Congress was not happy with the interpretation given \u00a7 241 by the courts. Consequently, by \u00a7 301 (c) of the Narcotics Control Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 575) Congress amended \u00a7 241 (b) by adding the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arug\">\u201cThe provisions of this subsection shall not apply in the case of any alien who is charged with being de-portable from the United States under subsection (a) (11) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The congressional intent of this amendment is clear from its history. In Conference Report No. 2546, the managers of the bill said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">\u201c(3) It amended section 241(b) of that act by including additional language to state clearly that this provision does not permit judicial recommendation against deportation of an alien convicted of a narcotic offense. Clarification of this provision has been made desirable by reason of the decisions in United States ex rel. De Luca v. O\u2019Rourke ([8 Cir.] 213 F.2d 759) and Ex Parte Robles-Rubio (D.C. <em>119 </em>F.Supp. 610).\u201d (2 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin. News \u201956, p. 3321.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">The 1956 amendment to \u00a7 241(b) is the basis for petitioner\u2019s contention in the case at bar. This amendment, contends petitioner, directly or indirectly amends \u00a7 241(b) to mean that judicial recommendations can now be made in all those classes of deportability enumerated in \u00a7 241(a) except when the deportation is ordered under \u00a7 241(a) (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">This contention, we believe, to be untenable. While the intent of Congress may be clearer in the statute\u2019s legislative history than it is in the language of the statute itself, we do not believe \u00a7 241(b) can be given the meaning contended for by petitioner. As we read \u00a7 241(b), taking cognizance of its history, it can only mean that the sentencing court is limited to making recommendations in \u00a7 241(a) (4) convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>This brings us to the case at bar. The district court here recommended that petitioner not be deported. Does this recommendation render respondent powerless \u2014 or without jurisdiction \u2014 to deport petitioner? For the reasons stated above, the answer would depend upon whether the case at bar was a proceeding to deport petitioner under \u00a7 241(a) (4). It was not. Hence, the district court\u2019s recommendation does not bar respondent from deporting petitioner, and respondent\u2019s final order of deportation must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Respondent did <em>not </em>charge petitioner as being deportable under \u00a7 241(a) (4); nor was \u00a7 241(a) (4) relied upon by respondent in the proceedings below. Respondent <em>did </em>charge and find a violation of \u00a7 241(a) (13).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, respondent charged petitioner as being de-portable under \u00a7 241(a) (13) because he had committed acts proscribed under that section; not with being deportable for the reason that he had been convicted of a crime within the purview of \u00a7 241(a) (4). As pointed out in marginal note 4, supra, the only significance attached to petitioner\u2019s conviction in the proceedings below was that the conviction had made it easier for respondent to prove that petitioner did in fact commit acts proscribed by \u00a7 241(a) (13). And, though it is not required, a reading of the record shows that respondent\u2019s decision was well founded in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-10\">. This Subsection, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a) (13), reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">\u201c(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">\u201c(13) prior to, or at the time of any entry, or at any time within five years after any entry, shall have, knowingly and for gain, encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted or aided any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. This section reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">\u201c(a) Any alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">\u201c(4) is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after entry and either sentenced to confinement or confined therefor in a prison or corrective institution, for a year or more, or who at any time after entry is convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, regardless of whether confined therefor, and regardless of whether the convictions were in a single trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-14\">. This is pointed up in footnote 5 in Ex parte Robles-Rubio, N.D.Calif.1954, 119 F.Supp. 610, at page 613, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">\u201c5. Since 1922, when violation of the Jones-Miller Act was first made a deport-able offense, the courts have possessed the power to recommend against the deportation of an alien convicted of violating that narcotic statute. * * * And, when, in 1931, the violation of other narcotic statutes, including the Harrison Narcotics Act, was made a deportable offense, the power of the courts to recommend against deportation was made applicable to violators of these statutes. * * * Thus for 30 years prior to the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the courts have been making recommendations against deportation in narcotic eases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-5\">.
