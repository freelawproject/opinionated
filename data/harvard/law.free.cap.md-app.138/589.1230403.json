The properties were found disqualified for the agricultural use assessment after they were rezoned to Mixed Use Community property (\u201cM-X-C\u201d), at Rouse\u2019s request. The removal of the agricultural use assessment led to the imposition of the Ag Tax and penalty. The Tax Court upheld the Ag Tax and penalty, which led to Rouse\u2019s first appeal. <em>See Rouse-Fairwood Limited Partnership v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 708 A.2d 19 (1998) <em>(\u201cRouse I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Following our remand in <em>Rouse I, </em>the Tax Court again upheld the Ag Tax and penalty, by Order dated November 4, 1999. Thereafter, pursuant to an opinion of May 12, 2000, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Md. Code (1986, 1994 Repl. Vol., 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 8-209(h)(1)(h) and \u00a7 13-305(c)(2) of the Tax Property Article (\u201cT.p_\u201d) are centra] to this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Rouse contends that the Supervisor, the Tax Court, and the circuit court erred by considering the three parcels as a single entity when analyzing the \u201cmore intensive use\u201d issue under T.P. \u00a7 8-209(h)(1)(h). Instead, Rouse maintains that each parcel should have been considered as a discrete entity, so that all three parcels would not have been disqualified for the agricultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>use assessment. Then, only Parcel 1 would have been subject to the Ag Tax and penalty, pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">On appeal, Rouse presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">1. In light of this Court\u2019s holding that this case \u201cpresents a Euclidian zone (R-R, as it existed on June 30, 1972) as a base zone for comparison to a planned unit development (or floating zone), the M-X-C, as <em>embodied in Rouse\u2019s approved preliminary development plan </em>\u201d... did the Tax Court err as a matter of law in finding that M-X-C is a more intensive zoning category than [Rural Residential] without reference to the uses permitted by Rouse\u2019s approved preliminary development plan on each of the three properties involved in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">2. As a matter of fact, based on the evidence of record and the definition of intensity of use adopted by this Court in <em>Rouse I, </em>is the use permitted under the M-X-C zoning [of Parcels 2 and 3] less intensive than the use permitted on those same parcels under R-R zoning?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The dispute involves the same evidentiary record that we considered in <em>Rouse I. </em>By Order dated August 3, 2000, we permitted the parties to re-submit the same Joint Record Extract that they previously presented in connection with the first appeal, updated with a Supplementary Extract. In the same spirit, we shall incorporate here most of our factual summary from <em>Rouse </em>Z, 120 Md.App. at 673-84, 708 A.2d 19, and supplement it with additional information pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">In January 1990, Rouse acquired three contiguous properties in Prince George\u2019s County from three different owners. The land is located just west of the City of Bowie, and consists of a total of 1,058 acres. Parcel 1 contains approximately 473 acres, Parcel 2 consists of approximately 339 acres, and Parcel 3 measures approximately 246 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>At the time Rouse acquired the subject properties, each was used as a sod farm and was benefitted by an agricultural use assessment under T.P. \u00a7 8-209. To maintain that favorable assessment, and to avoid imposition of the Ag Tax, appellant filed a declaration of intent for each parcel with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d), pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(l)(i), by which it agreed to maintain the agricultural use of each parcel for five consecutive tax years, <em>i.e., </em>until July 1, 1995. Under T.P. \u00a7 13-305(e)(2)(i), if a transferee fails to comply with the declaration of intent, or if the property fails to qualify during the five-year period for the agricultural use tax assessment under T.P. \u00a7 8-209, then the Ag Tax, plus a 10% penalty, is due on the \u201cportion\u201d of the land that fails to satisfy the declaration of intent or qualify for agricultural use.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">At the relevant time, the rezoning of land after July 1,1972, to a more intensive use than was permitted on or before July 1, 1972, disqualified the land for an agricultural use assessment. T.P. \u00a7 8-209(h)(l)(ii) stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">[T]he following land does not qualify to be assessed under this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">(ii) land rezoned after July 1, 1972, to a more intensive use than the use permitted on or before July 1, 1972, if a person with an ownership interest in the land has applied for or requested the rezoning... ,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI0\">It is undisputed that on July 1, 1972, the subject properties were zoned R R (Rural Residential).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">In 1992, the Prince George\u2019s County Code was amended to include a Planned Unit Development (\u201cPUD\u201d) zoning category, called Mixed Use Community (\u201cM X C\u201d), for large tracts of at least 750 acres. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County Zoning Ordi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>nance </em>(1994) (the \u201cZoning Ordinance\u201d), \u00a7 27-546.04(a). Appellant participated in developing the ordinance that created the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">On May 8, 1993, Rouse filed an Application for Zoning Map Amendment, seeking to rezone all 1,058 acres of the subject properties to M-X-C. As required, the Application was accompanied by a Preliminary Development Plan (\u201cPDP\u201d). According to Rouse, when the County approves the M-X-C zoning, it necessarily adopts the PDP. In this case, the PDP provided for a mix of uses on the land, including residential, commercial, recreational, and public. Eventually, a Final Development Plan (\u201cFDP\u201d) must be filed and approved, which must be generally consistent with the PDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On May 9, 1994, the County enacted a Zoning Ordinance approving the M-X-C zoning for all 1,058 acres. The Zoning Ordinance of May 9,1994, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">Total development of this 1,058 acre site shall be limited to 1,799 dwelling units, 100,000 square feet of retail space, and 250,000 square feet of office/service/institutional uses, and such other \u201ccommunity space\u201d determined to be appropriate during subsequent phases of approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Rouse intends to develop the subject properties over a period of ten to fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The rezoning of Rouse\u2019s land to M-X-C occurred less than five years after Rouse purchased the subject properties, and while the parcels were subject to the declarations of intent. The Supervisor concluded that the rezoning of the three parcels to M-X-C constituted a more intensive use than had been permitted under the R-R zoning that was in effect on July 1, 1972.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, in December 1994, appellee issued three separate notices to appellant, advising that the May 1994 rezoning to M-X-C violated Rouse\u2019s declarations of intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Therefore, pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 13-305, the Supervisor levied an Ag Tax of $408,377.50 and penalties of $40,837.75. Appellant appealed to the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On January 17, 1996, the Tax Court held an evidentiary hearing, at which both parties presented expert witnesses. The experts testified about the permitted uses of the subject properties under the current M-X-C zoning and the R-R zoning. The experts also expressed their opinions about whether M-X-C zoning was a more intensive use than R-R zoning as of July 1,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Under R-R zoning in 1972, the minimum lot size was 20,000 square feet for single family detached residential development. \u201cCluster\u201d developments,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with reduced lot sizes and the flexibility to introduce single family attached dwellings (townhouses) into the total dwelling yield of a development proposal (but at no greater number of total units than could be obtained under the maximum allowed non-cluster density of 2.0 units per acre), were also permitted. But the difference between the reduced lot size (10,000 square feet for detached dwellings and 1,500 square feet for townhouses) and the conventional lot size (20,000 square feet) was to be set aside as open space elsewhere in the parcel. Nonresidential uses, permitted as of right, included, <em>inter alia: </em>churches, libraries, museums, public buildings, public parks, and animal hospitals. Uses permitted by special exception included, <em>inter alia: </em>airports, antique shops, cemeteries, commercial recreational attractions, golf courses, hospitals, motels, horse racing tracks, sanitary landfills, sawmills, and tourist homes. Principal uses not enumerated as permitted uses or as special exception uses were expressly not allowed in the R-R zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">M-X-C zoning allow a mix of uses on the land. In order to obtain M-X-C zoning, the preliminary development plan accompanying the rezoning application must demonstrate that the PDP complies with the following criteria: (1) at least 30% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the gross area must be devoted to community use areas; (2) at least 10% of the gross area must be devoted to single family, low density dwellings; (3) at least 20% of the gross area must be devoted to single family, medium density residential units; (4) no more than 15% of the gross area may be devoted to \u201cother residential\u201d units; and (5) nonresidential areas must comprise between 5% and 20% of the gross area of the zone. These general parameters of the development are refined in the subsequent phases of the approval process, in which the developer must submit a Comprehensive Sketch Plan (\u201cCSP\u201d) and a Final Development Plan. Both the CSP and FDP must be consistent with the PDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Permitted residential uses in the M-X-C zone include: single family detached houses; townhouses; duplex houses; and apartments. As a matter of right, various nonresidential uses are also permitted under M-X-C zoning, but not under R-R zoning. These include: banks; data processing facilities; eating or drinking establishments; research and development and testing laboratories]; blueprinting, book, camera, gift, jewelry, music, souvenir, or other specialty stores; department store; dry cleaning; drugstore; food and beverage store; gas station; hardware store; pet shop; photographic supply store; seafood market; repair shops; variety and dry good stores; and an arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant\u2019s land use planning expert, Thomas Kieffer, the head of the planning and zoning department of Ben Dyer Associates, opined that \u201cthe development permitted under the M X C at [the subject properties] is less intense than that permitted under the R-R.\u201d He compared the properties under the two zones, using some of the criteria developed in the 1960s by the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>some of his own. Kieffer admitted that he could not perform an analysis using all of the FHA factors, however, because the factors were designed to analyze completed projects rather than planned projects. He considered the following factors: (1) density, expressed in terms of dwelling units per acre (\u201cdu/ac\u201d) for residential development, and floor area ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) for nonresidential development; (2) average household size; (3) student yield; (4) sewage disposal requirements; (5) parking requirements; and (6) traffic congestion. Kieffer concluded that, in every category except two (parking requirements and traffic generation during p.m. peak hour trips), the R-R zoning category was more intensive than M-X-C zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Regarding the nonresidential uses, Kieffer compared a hospital, which was a permitted use as a matter of right in R-R zoning in 1972, to the mix of office, service, and institutional type uses permitted under M-X-C zoning. For comparison purposes, Kieffer used the Greater Laurel Beltsville Hospital, which had been built in an R-R zone, on a 48 acre parcel. After considering the intensity factors, Kieffer concluded that the hospital under R-R zoning would be more intensive than the commercial type uses permitted under M-X-C zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Kieffer\u2019s comparison of residential development under R-R zoning and M-X-C zoning focused largely on the differences in density. Specifically, he determined that, based on a housing mix of 75% single family detached dwellings and 25% single family attached dwellings, the R-R zoning had a net density of 1.849 dwelling units per acre. On the other hand, under M-X-C zoning, pursuant to the PDP approved as part of the M-X-C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>rezoning for the subject properties, based on a housing mix of 37% single family detached dwellings, 58% single family attached dwellings, and 5% multi-family housing, the net density would be 1.79 du/ac. In his analysis of the M-X-C zoning, Kieffer deducted approximately 60 acres to account for a proposed road interchange that exists on the current master plan. Kieffer did not subtract this 60 acres when he analyzed the subject properties under R-R zoning, however, because the interchange did not exist on the 1972 master plan. Instead, Kieffer subtracted 21 acres under his R-R zoning analysis to account for an \u201couter beltway\u201d that had been shown on the 1972 master plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In viewing the subject properties collectively, Keiffer concluded that M-X-C zoning was less intensive than R-R zoning. In addition, Kieffer analyzed each of the subject properties individually. For Parcel 1, he concluded that the residential uses under M-X-C were more intensive than under R-R, but that the nonresidential uses on that parcel were less intensive than under R-R. With respect to Parcel 1, he opined that M-XC zoning was not more intense than R-R zoning. He explained: \u201c[I]t\u2019s too close to call. I can\u2019t say for sure that the overall effect is that parcel one would be more intense under the MX-C zone.\u201d For Parcels 2 and 3, however, which are solely targeted for residential development, Kieffer concluded that M-X-C zoning was less intensive than R-R zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Thomas Lockard, a land use planner with the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Department of the Maryland National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission, testified as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>expert for appellee. He said that, as of July 1, 1972, the only dwelling types permitted under R-R zoning were single family detached homes and, in a cluster development, single two-family attached homes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lockard noted that, unlike in the MX-C category, no apartments were permitted in an R-R property. Lockard also stated that, under M-X-C zoning, the permitted dwellings include single family detached houses, townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, and apartment buildings. Regarding nonresidential uses, Lockard listed the commercial establishments permitted as a matter of right under M-X-C, but not under R-R zoning. He also observed that a hospital would be \u201cprobably the most intensive use that would have been permitted in the R-R zone.\u201d Lockard offered his opinion that, \u201cbased ... on the types of uses generally permitted under the R-R zone versus the types, quantities, and amounts of uses permitted under the M-X-C zone,\u201d the M-X-C zone, under Rouse\u2019s approved PDP, is more intensive than was the R-R zone in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The following testimony during Lockard\u2019s cross-examination is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You did a comparison here, right? You did a comparison between the M-X-C zone and the R-R zone, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">[LOCKARD]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: When you used, as your comparison, the R-R zone, did you look at the PDP which was approved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">[LOCKARD]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And was that the basis of your analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">[LOCKARD]: It was, as well as the types of uses that are permitted in that zone by ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So you looked at the types of uses that could have been applied to this M-X-C zone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2q\">[LOCKARD]: And still can be developed on this property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>Will you agree with me that the permitted uses on this property unit be those uses that are described on the final development plan filed in the land records?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">[LOCKARD]: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>And that the final development plan must be consistent with the uses set forth on the PDP?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">[LOCKARD]: <em>That is correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>So you agree </em>that as far as permitted uses and bulk regulations and other zoning requirements, <em>we look to the FDP as ultimately approved consistent with the PDP, is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">[LOCKARD]: <em>That is </em>\u2014 that <em>is correct to a point. Up to this point not all of the uses on this property have been tied down with any specificity. They have been generally identified as to what they will be. </em>But not \u2014 but <em>there are many uses which could fall under the office, service, institutional use for which we have two hundred and fifty thousand square feet approved.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Looking at the permitted uses approved in the PDP, and the FDP will be consistent with the PDP, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">[LOCKARD]: It would have to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. Looking at the permitted uses in the PDP, there\u2019s a limitation of one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine dwelling units, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">[LOCKARD]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So when someone suggests that well you could have more dwelling units because you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>could get two per gross acre, that\u2019s really not relevant to the intensity of use that will be permitted under this M-X-C zone, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">[LOCKARD]: That is correct. They are \u2014 the applicant is capped at one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine dwelling units and cannot exceed that, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In its analysis, the Tax Court focused on the meaning of the phrase \u201cmore intensive use\u201d in T.P. \u00a7 8-209, which is not defined in the statute. The Tax Court also acknowledged \u00a7 27-109(b) of the Zoning Ordinance, which lists the various zoning classifications from least to most intensive. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">[T]he order of intensity of zones is listed as follows, beginning with the least intense zone and progressing to the most intense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">(1) R-O-S, O-S, R-A, R-E, V-L, R-L, V-M, R-R, R-S, R-80, R-55, R-M-H, R-35, R-20, R-M, R-T, R-30, R-30C, R-18, R-18C, R-U, R-10A, R-10, R-H, C-A, C-O, M-X-C, M-UTC....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">(Boldface added). The Tax Court noted, however, that although M-X-C is listed as being more intensive than R-R, the testimony demonstrated that the listing was \u201ca pretty arbitrary thing\u201d and that it was done for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">In its oral opinion, the Tax Court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-12\">[A]s far as I am concerned, [the Legislature was] looking at it from the standpoint that the property owner was taking an action to make something more valuable, and to be able to do something with a piece of property that they could not do before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-13\">... [S]eldom have I ever seen somebody requesting a rezoning of property if it wasn\u2019t going to end up being a financial benefit to them. This is generally what happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-14\">Now, in this particular situation, what has been ably presented to this Court, and done in a very detailed fashion, is that when I define intensive, I should do it and limit my definition of it to whether or not there are, for instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>more units that are created by this rezoning. And it\u2019s represented that it\u2019s actually less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">In other words, it\u2019s been shown here by various exhibits and testimony that by proceeding in the manner that [appellant] is allowed to do under the M-X-C zoning, that we actually end up with less units than we do under the R-R; that when we take all of the other factors that deal with intensities, that for the most part not all of them, but most of them come up less than R R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Unfortunately for [appellant], I do not feel that that alone is the criteria that has to be factored in in making a decision as to what is meant by the word intensive as used in 8 209. And I say that for this reason \u2014 it is undisputed that [appellant] is going to be able to do, as a matter of right, not as a matter of special exception, but as a matter of right more things than could be done under the R-R zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">For instance there\u2019s a whole laundry list of commercial type activities that a property owner with this type of zoning is entitled to do under this type zoning that they couldn\u2019t do under R-R. There is a difference in the type of residential units that they can have in this zoning that they couldn\u2019t have under R-R.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">Again, I\u2019m not losing sight of the fact about the densities and how they have to remain. But still for instance we know this, that under R-R you couldn\u2019t have an apartment house. Under this particular zoning that you can have an apartment house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\"><em>The bottom line is this </em>\u2014 is <em>that there is much more leeway exists [sic] as far as the zoning code goes to the property owner with this type zoning than with the leeway that the property owner had under an R-R zoning. And as far as I am concerned, that becomes a factor of making something more intensive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">And the reason there\u2019s not going to be a great number of [properties with this type of zoning] is that number one, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>have to have a minimum of seven hundred and fifty acres to even begin to quali[f]y for this.... There are parameters that are built into this and guidelines that have to be followed, but for all intents and purposes this property owner gets to structure this in such a manner that they can go ahead and do pretty much everything they want to do under \u2014 as far as developing this piece of property goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">In other words, we even had testimony here today that it may be ten to fifteen years before all of the things that are going to be done with this property are eventually done. And again I cannot ignore the fact, nor do I criticize it in any way, shape or form, that it appears that the property owner in this case, or [appellant] in this case, is really the one that nudged the county to turn around and create a zoning category such as this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u2756 * Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">...

So the Court will sign an order affirming the assessment that was made against this property by the Supervisor----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Accordingly, on February 21, 1996, the Tax Court issued an order affirming appellee\u2019s decision. Thereafter, appellant sought review in the circuit court. In an oral opinion issued March 28, 1997, the circuit court affirmed. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr\">I agree with the taxing authority. I see intensive \u2014 I picture this bucolic country side with horses and chickens and pigs and so forth. And we start there and we move toward the city. We start having our suburbs with sprawling ... homes and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">So, each time as we move in towards the big city, we are getting more and more intense use and I think that\u2019s what the tax judge found in this case, that in fact when we went from rural residential to this mixed use of this land in allowing light industry and so forth, it was a more intense use than when it was under rural residential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">I don\u2019t believe [the Tax Court] made [its] decision just on the fact that the value of land went up----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>I believe he was correct not just by the standard of review. I believe he was correct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Appellant subsequently appealed to this Court. In <em>Rouse I, </em>we essentially considered two issues: (1) whether the Tax Court erroneously interpreted the phrase \u201cmore intensive use\u201d in T.P. \u00a7 8-209(h)(l)(ii); and (2) whether the Tax Court erred by failing to consider Rouse\u2019s alternative position that the three declarations of intent, filed pursuant to T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(1), evidenced that the three parcels are distinct and require separate analysis in regard to the agricultural use assessment and Ag Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A central issue in <em>Rouse I </em>concerned the meaning of the undefined statutory term, \u201cmore intensive use,\u201d contained, at the relevant time, in T.P. \u00a7 8-209(h)(l)(ii). <em>Rouse I, </em>120 Md.App. at 686, 689, 708 A.2d 19. In construing that term, the Tax Court considered significant the minimum lot size of 750 acres needed to qualify for M-X-C zoning, the \u201cleeway\u201d afforded by such zoning, and the wide variety of commercial and residential uses permitted by M-X-C zoning and the PDP. We were satisfied that the Tax Court correctly construed the phrase. In our view, the rezoning authorized the \u201cpotential change in character, along the continuum toward an urban or industrial environment.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 708 A.2d 19. If the land was considered as a whole, we agreed with appellee that the subject properties were rezoned to a \u201cmore intensive use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As an alternative position, however, Rouse claimed that the three parcels were discrete units, and thus should have been evaluated separately to determine whether each declaration of intent was breached. That argument was largely grounded in T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(2)(i), which provides, in part: \u201cIf there is a failure to comply with a declaration of intent filed [under T.P. \u00a7 13-305] ... or there is a failure to qualify for the farm or agricultural use assessment under [T.P.] \u00a7 8-209 ... during the time that a declaration of intent is in effect, the agricultural land transfer tax, plus penalty, is due [only] <em>on that portion of the land </em>that fails to comply with the declaration of intent or to qualify for farm or agricultural use.\u201d (Emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Rouse observed that, under the PDP, 53 acres of Parcel 1 were designated for nonresidential development, but Parcels 2 and 3 were \u201ctargeted only for residential development and open space under the PDP.... \u201d Rouse <em>I, </em>120 Md.App. at 695, 708 A.2d 19. Accordingly, Rouse claimed that, at worst, only Parcel 1 failed to comply with the declaration of intent, but Parcels 2 and 3 of the subject properties were \u201cstill entitled to the agricultural tax assessment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">In response, appellee argued that the three parcels did not merit separate consideration as to intensity of use, because all three were combined to create a single property eligible for M X C zoning. Moreover, none of the parcels was large enough, by itself, to qualify for M-X-C zoning, which requires a minimum of 750 acres. Further, appellee contended that the rezoning was achieved through one zoning application, and approved by one ordinance, pursuant to a single PDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We recognized in <em>Rouse I </em>that none of the three parcels would have been large enough, by itself, to qualify for M-X-C zoning. But, we also acknowledged that, based on the plain language of T.P. \u00a7 13-305, it was arguable that the Ag Tax and penalty were due only on the \u201cportion\u201d of the land, or the particular parcel, that did not comply with the declaration of intent. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 708 A.2d 19. Because the Tax Court did not indicate whether its finding of more intensive use was predicated upon all three parcels considered collectively or separately, and because it did not specifically address Rouse\u2019s alternative argument that it was entitled to a separate intensity analysis for each parcel, we remanded to the Tax Court to explain whether and why the Ag Tax was due for all three parcels, rather than just the offending \u201cportions\u201d of the land. <em>Rouse I, </em>120 Md.App. at 697-98, 708 A.2d 19; <em>see United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994) (recognizing that an agency\u2019s decision may be affirmed only upon the agency\u2019s findings of fact and for the reasons stated by the agency.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Following our remand, the Tax Court heard oral argument on August 25, 1999. In an oral opinion, the Tax Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that the entire tract had been rezoned to M-X-C, a zoning classification that allowed for \u201cmore intensive use\u201d than the prior R-R zoning, and concluded that all three parcels were disqualified from the agricultural use assessment and subject to the Ag Tax and penalty. The Tax Court reasoned, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">[Although I may not have said it in crystal clear words, <em>I was considering all three parcels as one </em>unit.... In other words, if it were [a] circumstance where I had concluded factually, after hearing all the facts, and in accordance with the applicable statutes, that the tax should not have applied to one or more of the parcels described, I certainly would have said that in relation to the opinion that I dictated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">Now for a minute let me back up and I\u2019ll not intend to reiterate or even try to reiterate what I\u2019ve said in the oral opinion from the bench back [in] ... 1996. But part of the things that I\u2019ve said in that opinion was that the MXC zoning allowed a more intensive use than the RR, which stands for rural residential zoning, that existed on the property prior to it being changed to MXC. When that\u2014 when this case was originally before this Court, the Petitioner was disputing the implementation of the agricultural transfer tax penalty or assessment or whatever we want to call it, that is, the money that is ... called for to be paid under 13-305. They were disputing that it even applied to one. For instance, they were, in effect, saying that the ... MXC is not [a] more intensive use and that none of this property should be subjected to the tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">I know and we cleared it up this morning before we began this hearing that the Petitioner has changed her opinion as to Parcel 1 and apparently now concedes that [it] is subject to the tax, but they maintain that for the reasons they cite and are supposedly supported by the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, that this Court should make a different finding as to Parcels 2 and 3 for the reasons stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Well, again, let me read from the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals ... \u201cHad MXC zoning existed in 1972, we do not believe that Rouse could have maintained the agricultural use assessment and it would be illogical to. interpret the statute to permit such uses to day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">[T]his Court does not change its mind from the fact that Parcels Number 2 and 3 are, in fact, subject to the agricultural transfer tax. Just as I held and found back in 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">Now I say that for different reasons. One of them is that I think it is only sensible and I think common sense to a degree dictates that when one reads ... Tax Property Section 8-209 regarding the situations that can eliminate the agricultural assessment on properties, it specifically states, \u201cLand rezoned after July 1, 1972 to a more intensive use than the use permitted on or before July 1, 1972----\u201d <em>Number one, there is no dispute in this case that the present owner of the land is the one that requested the rezoning. </em>As a matter of fact, as was recognized in the opinion of this Court back originally ... [Rouse] apparently worked with the County to even create this type of zoning so they could do what they wanted to do in connection with this development. And so there isn\u2019t a question but that all the facts are such that this property falls squarely into this paragraph. <em>The only question being about the intensive use. </em>And I\u2019m going to say this that as far as I am concerned <em>for all the reasons that I stated in my original oral opinion, I think that the MXC zoning is more intensive than </em>RR----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\"><em>The way I read Section 8-209[,] if the rezoning is concluded to be of a more intensive use, then I think that triggers the agriculture transfer tax. </em>If I followed the logic and the argument being made by the taxpayer in this case ... it seems to me ... that the Maryland Legislature is going to have to change the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\"><em>* </em># H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">Please note that when one reads [T.P. \u00a7 13-305], that statute never uses the language more intensive use. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>section of the statute doesn\u2019t say a more intensive use. What that section of the statute says that if there is a portion that fails to comply. To me, the two sections are no way tied together in the fashion that is indicated by Petitioner or even [the] Court of Special Appeals. I don\u2019t think that we turn around and look at 8-209 and find the word \u201cintensive use\u201d in there and then somehow or another, carry that over into 13[-]305 when we are dealing with a portion of land that fails to comply. <em>I think ... Section 8-209 and 13[-]305 really function independent of each other....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\"><em>I found that the MXC zone for whatever reasons was more intensive than the RR zone. All three of these parcels were rezoned to a MXC zone. </em>I am not unaware of the fact of the arguments made by Petitioner\u2019s counsel that there is a preliminary development plans [sic], and that it\u2019ll take fifteen or twenty years for instance, before all this property is developed and I have taken all those things into consideration and yet, my opinion stays in the manner that I have outlined here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">The only thing is the Court of Special Appeals is, in effect, saying, you know, did it <em>apply </em>\u2014 were <em>you considering all three parcels when you made that decision and as I stated earlier, I have answered that as yes, I was. </em>And I, as far as additional reasons to be given for why 2 and 3 should be treated as the same way as 1 and as all one unit, I have done the best job I can in telling you all that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">On November 4, 1999, the Tax Court issued an order in which it ruled that the property \u201cshall be considered as one unit, and not three parcels\u201d, for purposes of T.P. \u00a7 8-209. Therefore, it affirmed the removal of the agricultural use assessment from the \u201centire subject property,\u201d and upheld the imposition of the Ag Tax and penalty under T.P. \u00a7 13-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Thereafter, Rouse sought judicial review in the circuit court, which affirmed in an oral opinion issued on May 12, 2000. The circuit court stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">I find that the determination by Judge Calvert as to the non-linking for purposes of his decision making process of 8-209 of the Tax Property Article and 13-305 of the Tax Property Article is accurate. I find that his decision that the zoning having been changed from RR to MXC on all of the property does not then require that each specific use within those properties be examined to determine whether there is a more intensive use here, there or anywhere. And that the loss of the classification under 8-209 as agricultural or farm property requires then that 13-305 kick in, and that the tax court and I do not have to examine each specific use within each specific piece of property. And for those reasons I will affirm the decision of the tax court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">This appeal followed. We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Preliminarily, it is important to set forth the statutory provisions in issue, and to review the statutory scheme. In general, the Ag Tax promotes the preservation of farms and agricultural land, because it \u201cinhibits property owners from transferring agricultural land to nonagricultural uses.... \u201d <em>DMH Joint Venture v.

Such property is entitled to the benefit of an agricultural use assessment, which provides for a property tax assessment based on agricultural or farm use, rather than actual market value. As a result, the owner of such land generally benefits from reduced property taxes, creating \u201cless pressure to convert the land to more intensive uses.\u201d <em>Agtransf. </em>In this way, the agricultural use assessment \u201cserves to remove some of the developmental pressure on the land by holding down the property tax burden.\u201d State Department of Assessments and Taxation, Real Property, <em>The Agricultural Use Assessment, </em>at http://www.dat.state.md.us/sdatweb/aguse.html (10/23/00) (hereinafter, <em>\u201cAguse </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Ordinarily, the Ag Tax is imposed on the instrument that conveys title to the property, and must be paid in order to record the deed. <em>Agtransf. </em>But, T.P. \u00a7 13-305(e)(l)(i) creates an exemption to the Ag Tax; the Ag Tax is waived if the purchaser agrees to maintain the agricultural use for five consecutive years, pursuant to a declaration of intent filed with SDAT. <em>Agtransf. </em>Property is disqualified for the favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>able agricultural use assessment, however, if the owner takes certain actions that result in a more intensive use of the land.

Rouse contends that the lower courts have continued to misunderstand PUD zoning and \u201cthe nature of the M-X-C zone as a PUD zone.\u201d In its view, the courts below erred by summarily concluding that because M-X-C is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>generally a more intensive zoning classification than R-R, and because all three parcels were rezoned to M-X-C, each parcel was necessarily disqualified for the agricultural use assessment. Appellant complains that the Tax Court failed to consider that the use under the earlier R-R zoning was actually more intense for parcels 2 and 3 when compared to the actual use permitted for those two parcels by the PDP. Rouse asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">The simplistic answer of both the Tax Court and the Circuit Court was that the Tax Court had found M-X-C to be a more intensive zoning classification than R-R and, since each parcel had been rezoned to M-X-C, each must have been disqualified under \u00a7 8-209. <em>That reasoning would have merit if the new zoning had been to a traditional Euclidean zoning classification, but it demonstrably lacks merit in this case and illustrates the lower courts\u2019 misunderstanding of the concept of PUD zoning.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">(Boldface added by Rouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The linchpin of Rouse\u2019s position is its mantra \u201cthat the zoning on the subject properties is that set forth in the legislatively adopted PDP, not the M-X-C text in the general zoning ordinance, which only contains general parameters that might be adopted in an M-X-C zone.\u201d Moreover, Rouse maintains that <em>\u201cthe legislatively approved PDP in a PUD zone constitutes the required basis for the intensity comparison.\u201d </em>In other words, with respect to PUD zoning and the M-X-C classification, Rouse asserts that the preliminary development plan for these particular parcels, rather than the general parameters of M-X-C zoning, is what governs the intensity of use analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Although Rouse recognizes that the rezoning of its properties to a more intensive use would violate the declarations of intent, it steadfastly contends that parcels 2 and 3 were not rezoned to a more intensive use under the PDP. According to Rouse, the hypothetical possibilities broadly sanctioned under M-X-C zoning are irrelevant because, once the. PDP was adopted by the County, only the uses specifically authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>by the PDP are permitted, and it is those uses that must be compared to the earlier R-R zoning. Rouse explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">The actual zoning is not to be found in the County zoning ordinance, which states only the limits within which zoning may be established on the property; rather, ... <em>it is that which is contained in the development plans that are approved and adopted by the County as part of the zoning process. </em>Therefore, the intensity of any M-X-C zone can only be determined by reference to <em>the uses actually permitted on that specific property or properties as reflected on those development plans.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">(Boldface added by Rouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In effect, Rouse claims that the Tax Court mixed apples and oranges in determining whether the rezoning resulted in a more intensive use of the land, because it erroneously compared the Euclidean R-R zone that formerly applied to all three parcels to the rezoned M-X-C classification for the PUD. Instead, Rouse asserts that the Tax Court should have compared the R-R zoning classification to the PDP adopted by the County when it approved the M-X-C zoning. In its brief, Rouse states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">In order to determine whether a property in a Euclidean zone has been rezoned to a more intensive use, one need only look to the general County zoning ordinance to see what uses are permitted in that zone. On the other hand, to determine whether a property that has been rezoned to a PUD zone such as M-X-C has been rezoned to a more intensive use, one must look to the specific zoning plan that has been adopted for <em>that </em>property-in this case, the legislatively-adopted PDP. In short, M-X-C zoning is not a single construct. Because the zoning regulations binding a parcel of land zoned M-X-C are those approved <em>for that parcel, </em>it is axiomatic that the actual M-X-C zoning of any particular parcel of land is different from the M-X-C zoning of every other parcel. Thus, the M-X-C zoning and the permitted intensity of use on each of the three separate properties in this case is different from the M-X-C zoning of the other two properties, and the intensity of use permitted on each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>separate property can only be determined by reference to the PDP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Whether M-X-C is generally a more intensive zoning classification than R-R is, according to Rouse, besides the point. Instead, Rouse maintains that what matters is how the property is actually used, and actual use is controlled by the PDP. Rouse asserts: \u201c[T]he intensity of use permitted on each separate property can only be determined by reference to the PDP.\u201d Rouse argues that, despite \u201call of the possible uses set forth in the general M-X-C zoning ordinance ... only specified residential and open space uses are permitted on Parcels 2 and 3\u201d under the PDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Although Rouse concedes here that Parcel 1 will be used more intensively under the PDP than under the prior R-R zoning, it insists that parcels 2 and 3 remain eligible for the agricultural use assessment, because they were not rezoned to a more intensive use under the PDP. Appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">[I]t appears clear that, when two of three separate properties are rezoned in such a way that the uses permitted by the new zoning of those parcels are actually <em>less </em>intensive than the prior zoning, the rezoning cannot be said to have disqualified the properties from agricultural use assessment under TP \u00a7 8-209 or, by extension, to have violated the applicable declarations of intent under TP \u00a7 13-305.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Rouse relies on T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(2)(i), which specifically provides that the Ag Tax and penalty are only imposed on-the non-complying \u201cportion\u201d of the land. In addition, Rouse emphasizes that T.P. \u00a7 8-209(h)(l)(ii) does not provide that property becomes ineligible for the agricultural use assessment if it is rezoned to a more intensive \u201czoning classification.\u201d Rather, the property is disqualified only if it is rezoned to a more intensive \u201cuse.\u201d Again, based on the legislatively approved PDP, which controls the use of each parcel, Rouse maintains that only Parcel 1 was rezoned to a more intensive use, and is therefore disqualified from the agricultural use assessment under T.P. \u00a7 8-209.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Because Rouse vigorously maintains that the courts involved throughout this case have not understood the concept of PUD zoning, and how it differs from traditional Euclidean zoning, we believe it is useful to discuss both concepts briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\u201cZoning is concerned with dimensions and uses of land or structures.... \u201d <em>Friends of The Ridge v.

Generally, by means of Euclidean zoning, a municipality divides an area geographically into particular use districts, specifying certain uses for each district. \u201cEach district or zone is dedicated to a particular purpose, either residential, commercial, or industrial,\u201d and the \u201czones appear on the municipality\u2019s official zoning map.\u201d 5 Rathkopfs, \u00a7 63.01, at 63-1-2.

Rouse suggests that the PDP is critical because the subsequent submissions must be consistent with the PDP. To be sure, each phase builds on what has already been submitted and approved.

In our -view, however, the question of whether the intensity analysis re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>quires a comparison of R-R zoning to the approved PDP, or, instead, a comparison of R-R to M-X-C zoning generally, is not dispositive of the issue that led to our remand in <em>Rouse I. </em>Even if, as Rouse urges, the intensity analysis requires a comparison of the R-R zone to the PDP, rather than to the MX-C generally, that does not resolve the pivotal question of whether the intensity of use analysis is conducted separately for each parcel as a discrete unit, or, instead, for all three parcels collectively, as a single \u201cpackage.\u201d Put another way, the central question that we must resolve is whether the R-R zoning must be compared to the PDP on a parcel-by-parcel basis or as a unitary tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In urging a parcel-by-parcel analysis with regard to the intensity issue, Rouse states: \u201c[T]he M-X-C zoning and the permitted intensity of use on each of the three separate properties ... is different from the M-X-C zoning of the other two properties, and the intensity of use permitted on each separate property can only be determined by reference to the PDP.\u201d Rouse also asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZq\">[T]he Tax Court failed to appreciate that the zoning on the subject properties is that set forth in the legislatively-adopted PDP, not the M-X-C text in the general zoning ordinance, which only contains general parameters that might be adopted in an M-X-C zone. Instead, the Tax Court held that the three parcels could not be evaluated separately because (a) it had been determined in <em>Rouse I </em>that M-X-C was a more intensive zone than R-R, and (b) all three parcels had been zoned M-X-C. Therefore, according to the Tax Court, each parcel must have lost its eligibility for an agricultural use assessment under TP \u00a7 8-209 and, <em>a fortiori, </em>had violated its declaration of intent. That, according to the Tax Court, ended the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">When Rouse purchased the three parcels in 1990, each was used for agricultural purposes as a sod farm, and assessed for agricultural use on that basis. In support of Rouse\u2019s contention that each parcel should be considered separately with respect to the agricultural use assessment and the Ag Tax, Rouse points out that each parcel was acquired from a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>transferor, was held under a separate deed, had its own individual tax account designation, was a discrete property on the assessment rolls, and is subject to its own declaration of intent. Rouse also relies on the text of T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(2)(i). As we noted, that provision states that if property subject to a declaration of intent fails to qualify for the agricultural use assessment under T.P. \u00a7 8-209, \u201cthe agricultural land transfer tax, plus penalty, is [only] due on <em>that portion of the land </em>that fails to comply with the declaration of intent or to qualify for farm or agricultural use.\u201d (Emphasis added). Additionally, Rouse argues that T.P. \u00a7 13-305 \u201creinforces\u201d the view that each parcel is a separate unit, because the Ag Tax is imposed upon an \u201cinstrument of writing.\u201d As there were three deeds to three separate parcels, each parcel, according to Rouse, must be separately considered to determine whether it qualifies for the agricultural use assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In analyzing the merits of Rouse\u2019s contention that each parcel must be separately analyzed, Rouse\u2019s position that the Ag Tax is due only on that part of the land that will be more intensively used derives largely from T.P. \u00a7 13-305. But, that provision cannot be analyzed in a vacuum. When we consider the statutory scheme as a whole, in light of the express legislative purpose, we do not believe that appellant\u2019s position comports with the clearly expressed public policy set forth in T.P. \u00a7 8-209, or with common sense. Moreover, T.P. \u00a7 13-305(c)(2)(i) is intertwined with T.P. \u00a7 8-209, and the language of T.P \u00a7 8-209 does not refer to a \u201cportion\u201d of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In regard to whether the Tax Court was required to undertake a separate analysis of intensity of use for each parcel, we are guided by <em>Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., supra, </em>352 Md. at 658, 724 A.2d 34. Although that case did not concern the Ag Tax, the Court\u2019s reasoning is helpful by analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In <em>Friends of the Ridge, </em>the Court considered the granting to BG &amp; E of a variance from side yard setback requirements. The Court concluded that no variance was needed, because BG &amp; E, which owned contiguous parcels, could combine them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>into a larger parcel without violating the zoning code. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 724 A.2d 34. In analyzing whether BG &amp; E had merged its contiguous lots, the Court recognized the importance of the owner\u2019s intent, and noted that intent is a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 724 A.2d 34. The Court said that a merger of contiguous lots may occur \u201cif the owner of contiguous parcels of land intends to form one tract. The owner\u2019s intent \u2018may be inferred from his conduct with respect to the land and the use which he makes of it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656-57, 724 A.2d 34 (citation omitted). Moreover, the Court observed that lots do not remain separate merely because they appear separately on a subdivision plan. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 724 A.2d 34. Writing for the Court, Judge Cathell concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">We shall hold that a landowner who clearly desires to combine or merge several parcels or lots of land into one larger parcel may do so. One way he or she may do so is to integrate or utilize the contiguous lots in the service of a single structure <em>or project ... </em>For title purposes, the plotted lines may remain, <em>but by operation of law a single parcel emerges for zoning purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 658, 724 A.2d 34. (Emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">As we previously indicated, to qualify for M-X-C zoning, the tract must consist of <em>at least </em>750 acres. Thus, not one of Rouse\u2019s parcels, standing alone, would have qualified for M-XC zoning.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, Rouse intentionally combined the three parcels of property into one for the purpose of obtaining approval from the County for the M-X-C zoning. To that end, Rouse also submitted <em>one </em>application and <em>one </em>PDP to rezone all three parcels to an M-X-C classification. The significance of Rouse\u2019s conduct in a case as thorny as this one cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Because Rouse used all three properties to obtain the desired M-X-C zoning, and submitted one PDP for the entire property, we are satisfied that Rouse intended to create one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>larger, unitary parcel. Indeed, Rouse cannot have it both ways. It sought to obtain the rezoning by aggregating the three parcels and submitting one PDP. By combining the three parcels to attain the M-X-C zoning, it follows that the intensity of use analysis should be made by analyzing the three parcels as if they were one. <em>Cf. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County v. Sloan, </em>57 Md.App. 286, 469 A.2d 915 (1984) (interpreting former Art. 81 (1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 14 and concluding that two parcels of adjoining, subdivided land owned by the same taxpayers were not to be assessed as one homestead, where one lot was used for residence and the other lot was used for recreation and a garden). This is also consistent with the zoning map, which did not separate the property into three parcels, but considered them as one larger piece of property for purposes of qualifying for the PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In reaching our conclusion, the recent case of <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County v. William Cardinal Keeler, </em>362 Md. 198, 764 A.2d 821 (2001), is instructive, although it did not involve the Ag Tax. There, the Court considered whether 16.5 acres of open space, which was part of a 27 acre parcel, should be included within the tax exemption afforded by T.P. \u00a7 7-204 for actual and exclusive religious worship. The Catholic Church had obtained a special exception in Baltimore County to construct a church on the property, but construction was limited to a 7.5 acre development envelope, except for storm water management and a septic system, which were installed outside the envelope. As the case made its way through the administrative process, the Church demonstrated that the entire parcel was considered as a \u201cpackage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 206, 212, 764 A.2d 821, because the whole site was used as the setting for the church, and the open space enhanced the religious experience. The appellee also argued that the findings that the entire site was an integral part of the church were supported by substantial evidence and entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 764 A.2d 821. In a four to three decision, the Court upheld the exemption for the entire property, with the exception of one acre of the land that was used for residential purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 764 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In sustaining the exemption, the majority agreed that the 16.5 acre portion of the parcel did not have a use different from the rest of the property, despite the fact that it consisted of open land, which could not be developed for 60 years. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 764 A.2d 821. Indeed, the Court said that the open space was not \u201cdivisible from the remaining exempt acreage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 213, 764 A.2d 821, or otherwise \u201cancillary\u201d to it. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 764 A.2d 821. Additionally, the Court was mindful of the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the County Board of Appeals \u201cstructured the property as a package, and that the church was effectively prohibited from using the open space for any residential or commercial purpose for the next 60 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 764 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the Court was satisfied that the Tax Court imderstood the legal and factual issues in the case, and properly considered the property as \u201ca unitary parcel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 764 A.2d 821. In words pertinent here, the Court said: \u201cWe believe that the determination of whether a parcel of land is tax exempt does not turn on the property\u2019s level of development. Rather, under \u00a7 7-204 the exemption depends on the actual use of the property and whether that religious worship is exclusive. In the present case, <em>it does not follow that, merely because the appellee has been required, or decided, to leave a large portion of the church property undeveloped, the property is not being used____to enrich its worship experience.\u201d Id. </em>at 220, 764 A.2d 821. (Emphasis added). Thus, the Court rejected the appellant\u2019s position \u201cthat a parcel of land consisting of more physical space than is minimally necessary to construct the main structure is, by default, subject to demarcation for taxing purposes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Bell reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">Where a portion of a parcel of real property on which a church has been constructed is, by virtue of zoning and covenants restricted to open space use, thus prohibiting any other use, that does not serve automatically to demarcate the parcel, nor does it necessarily serve to infringe, usurp, or preempt the primary use of the property. In the case sub judice, the 16.5 acres provide a natural setting for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>church and, thus, the religious worship use. As such, they are being actively used by the church for religious worship, as, by the way, the Order of the County Board of Appeals for Baltimore County directed. The decision that the 16.5 acre parcel is a part of a whole or entire package was found and reiterated by the Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board for Baltimore County, the Maryland Tax Court, and the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Each such decision, and in particular that of the Tax Court, is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court, which upheld the decision of the Tax Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 222, 764 A.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Applying the rationale of <em>Keeler </em>here, we are persuaded that the Tax Court properly determined that the contiguous parcels had to be considered as a single unit with respect to T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 8-209 and 13-305, even if parcels 2 and 3 contain large areas of open space and will not be as intensively used under the PDP as they could have been under the earlier R-R zoning. Clearly, the parcels are interrelated and are designed to function together. Moreover, a certain amount of open space is required to obtain M-X-C zoning, and therefore was included in the PDP. Put another way, to implement the goals of the PUD, a portion of the land had to be dedicated to open space. Because parcels 2 and 3 contain the areas designated for open space, Rouse was able to use Parcel 1 for more intense purposes. The overall plan, however, depends on an integrated use of all three parcels. Merely because portions of parcels 2 and 3 will not be intensely developed does not alter the reality that the project will result in more intense use of certain portions of the land, regardless of the particular uses of parcels 2 and 3. As in <em>Keeler, </em>parcels 2 and 3 are not divisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Although Rouse vigorously maintains that <em>Maisel v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>94 Md.App. 31, 614 A.2d 1333, has no application here, because it involved Euclidean zoning, we continue to find portions of it instructive. In <em>Maisel, </em>at the appellants\u2019 request, the county rezoned a 4.5 acre parcel from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>a single-family residential zone to a townhouse residential zone. The original zone permitted 5 or 6 dwelling units per acre, depending on the price of the housing, while the new zone permitted a maximum of 8 dwelling units per acre. Eventually, the owners obtained approval of a development plan that only contained 27 townhouse units; the number of residences was thus equal to the total number of dwelling units that could have been built under the prior zoning. Nevertheless, when the owners sold the property, they were assessed a rezoning transfer tax, because the subject property was considered to have been rezoned to a \u201cmore intensive use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35, 614 A.2d 1333. The taxpayers challenged the tax, claiming that the property was not rezoned to a more intensive use, because the maximum number of permitted dwelling units remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In a theme familiar here, the taxpayers contended that the \u201cbinding restrictive elements contained in the Council\u2019s approval of the rezoning amendment\u201d limited the number of dwelling units to what existed under the prior zoning, and should control the issue of liability for the transfer tax. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, the appellee contended that the \u201ceventual densities\u201d were irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the appellee argued that the proper comparison required a review of the \u201cstatutorily permitted densities in the various zones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on the definition in the County Code of the term \u201crezoned to a more intensive use,\u201d which included rezoning to a category that permitted a greater number of dwelling units per acre than had been previously allowed, appellee contended that the townhouses themselves, permitted under the rezoning, resulted in an \u201cinherently ... more intensive form of development____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 614 A.2d 1333. The Tax Court agreed, stating: \u201c[W]hat triggers this tax is not what you ended up with ... .when you move from one zoning classification to another ... whether or not you are able to utilize or get the benefit of each and everything that\u2019s permitted under that zone, I don\u2019t think it makes any difference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 614 A.2d 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>On appeal, this Court affirmed. After examining the legislative purpose, we determined that although the appellants agreed to \u201climit one aspect of this intensification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 37, 614 A.2d 1333, they nonetheless intensified the development of the property in several other respects. <em>Id. </em>Interestingly, we rejected the appellants\u2019 argument that the number of dwelling units permitted under the rezoning \u201cbecame a legislative act,\u201d because it was adopted by the County Council when it approved the rezoning. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 614 A.2d 1333. We agreed with the Tax Court that the requirements for the rezoning transfer tax had been met, because the new zone permitted a greater density, regardless of whether it was implemented. We said: \u201cThe Tax Court found that the rezoning transfer tax must be paid when a property is transferred after being rezoned to a residential zone which statutorily permits a greater number of dwelling units than the prior zone, without reference to the number of dwelling units that may be eventually built on the property.... [W]e hold that [the] Tax Court correctly interpreted the applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 614 A.2d 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In <em>Rouse I, </em>we stated: \u201cWe do not believe ... that the Tax Court was <em>required </em>to consider a decrease in density as dispositive in determining whether the property was rezoned to a more intensive use.\u201d <em>Rouse I, </em>120 Md.App. at 691, 708 A.2d 19. Thus, even if the density of Parcels 2 and 3 will be less than what was permitted under R-R, we said that this would not necessarily be dispositive of the issue; it merely represents one factor in the \u201cmore intensive use\u201d determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">As we see it, the logic of Rouse\u2019s position as to Parcel 1 compels the conclusion that all three properties were zoned to a more intensive use, when viewed as a single \u201cpackage.\u201d As we noted earlier, Rouse now acknowledges that Parcel 1 was rezoned to a more intensive use under the PDP, even though only 53 acres of Parcel 1, out of a total of 473, will actually be used more intensively. Rouse candidly concedes that an argument that the Ag Tax should apply only to the 53 acre portion of Parcel 1, rather than to the entire parcel, \u201cwould obviously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>fly in the face of the statute and should be given short shrift.\u201d Despite that forthright acknowledgment, Rouse insists that parcels 2 and 3 should be analyzed separately, by reference to the PDP\u2019s prescribed uses for each one, because \u201cthe zoning regulations binding a parcel of land zoned M-X-C are those approved <em>for that </em>parcel....\u201d If, as Rouse concedes, the 53 acres in Parcel 1 are not separate for purposes of the intensity analysis with regard to Parcel 1, then parcels 2 and 3 are not separate units, either. To the contrary, all the parcels are part of a larger whole, and the \u201cmore intensive use\u201d of Parcel 1 disqualifies the entire tract from the benefit of the agricultural use assessment. This view accurately reflects the interrelated nature of the three parcels in the context of the PUD, and squares with the purpose of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In this case, imposition of the Ag Tax on all three parcels is consistent with the policy of inhibiting property owners from making an end run around the statute, which was intended to favor continued agricultural use of land. By filing declarations of intent with the SDAT at the time of purchase, Rouse declared its intent to continue the agricultural use of all three parcels for a full five years, and thereby avoided payment of the Ag Tax. Rouse subsequently obtained the benefit of M-XC zoning for a PUD by use of all three parcels. It doing so, it crafted a PDP based on the broad parameters of that zoning category. The PDP is an integrated concept, and the artificial lines that appellant now seeks to engraft on the land, by use of the PDP, fly in the face of the legislative purpose in creating the statutory tax exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The expressed legislative intent evidenced in T.P. \u00a7 8-209(b) is an important underpinning of the agricultural use assessment. The Legislature sought to disqualify those owners who ultimately take an action inconsistent with a declaration of intent. Appellant\u2019s attempt to isolate and protect portions of the rezoned parcels by reliance on artificial lines of demarcation and the use of the PDP amounts to an attempt to camouflage what we described in <em>Rouse I </em>as \u201cthe continuum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>toward an urban or industrial environment.\u201d <em>Rouse I, </em>120 Md.App. at 691, 708 A.2d 19. If we were to adopt Rouse\u2019s position, we would surely exalt form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Our review of the Tax Court\u2019s opinion leads us to conclude that the Tax Court did not misapprehend the nature of the MX-C zone as a PUD, with an approved PDP specific to Rouse\u2019s property, when it determined that the three parcels constituted a single tract for purposes of the more intensive use analysis. In its opinion determining that the rezoning resulted in a more intensive use, the Tax Court expressly acknowledged Rouse\u2019s arguments and its memorandum regarding the actual uses of Parcels 2 and 3 as \u201cresidential and open space\u201d zones under the PDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Finally, we are satisfied that our ultimate conclusion is consistent with the long settled principle that, because the agricultural use assessment constitutes a tax exemption, it must be strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority. <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Commission, supra, </em>348 Md. at 17, 702 A.2d 690; <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v.

Third, in considering exterior open space, LUI distinguishes between space that is for people, called livability space, and the space that is used for cars. Fourth, it considers large recreation space as well as other outside livability space. The final two ratios relate the number of car storage spaces to the number of living units. One considers only long term parking spaces for occupants, while the other considers all spaces including short time spaces for guests.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. The parties dispute whether the difference \u2014 39 acres \u2014 should have been deducted under the R-R analysis. Kieffer acknowledged that, if he had deducted 60 acres under R-R zoning, instead of 21 acres, there would be 1,773 total residential units under R-R zoning, compared to 1,799 residential units under M-X-C zoning. Appellant argues that, because T.P. \u00a7 8-209 only requires comparison with the \"use permitted on or before July 1, 1972,\u201d the interchange should not be considered, because it was not on the 1972 master plan. We need not resolve this issue, however, because, as we shall explain, density is not the sole criterion in determining whether the rezoning results in a more intensive use of the land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b623-11\">. On October 17, 1972, the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County amended the zoning ordinance to prohibit attached dwellings from cluster development in an R-R zone. That amendment is not applicable to this case, however, because T.P. \u00a7 8-209 requires a comparison of zoning in effect on July 1, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">. To be sure, the General Assembly also recognizes the importance of planned developments. Md. Code (1998 Repl. Vol.), Art. 66B, \u00a7 10.01(a) states, in part: \"In order to encourage the preservation of natural resources or the provision of affordable housing and to facilitate orderly development and growth,\u201d the General Assembly encourages the enactment of local ordinances providing for, <em>inter alia, </em>\"Planned unit developments.\u201d Art. 66B, \u00a7 10.01(a)(b). Similarly, T.P. \u00a7 8-220(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Afj\">\u201cThe General Assembly states that it is in the public interest to provide for the development of lands in a planned manner.\u201d To that end, special taxing provisions have been enacted by the General Assembly. <em>See, e.g., </em>T.P. \u00a7\u00a7 8-222 \u2014 8-228.
