Halliday filed an action for wrongful death and a survivor\u2019s claim in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellee Sturm, Ruger <em>&amp; </em>Company, Inc., alleging strict liability for the self-inflicted shooting death of her three-year-old son, Jordan Garris.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">Subsequent to the dismissal of all claims against the retailer of the handgun, On Target, Inc., appellee moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, sought summary judgment. On October 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>1999, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Cannon, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, setting forth the basis for its ruling in a bench memorandum. From the grant of summary judgment, appellant filed this timely appeal, in which she asked questions that have been restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">I. Under Maryland law, is the \u201crisk-utility test\u201d applicable to handguns under a product liability claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">II. Was the grant of summary judgment appropriate, either because the misuse of the dangerous instrumentality involved precludes any factual determination of foreseeability or because the \u201crisk-utility test\u201d is inapplicable?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">III. When a product, by its very nature, is designed to inflict serious injury or cause death, were the appellee\u2019s warnings sufficient to establish, as a matter of law, that the handgun was misused?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In March 1999, Clifton Garris, Jordan\u2019s father, purchased a Ruger P89 pistol from On Target, Inc., a firearms retail store and shooting range located in Severn, Maryland. The P89 pistol is a center fire, double action, magazine-fit, automatic loading, recoil-operated handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In June 1999, three months after the purchase of the P89 pistol, Jordan discovered the handgun under his parents\u2019 mattress. The gun, stored separately from the ammunition magazine, had been kept there, unlocked, to be readily available to protect the home from intruders. Young Jordan allegedly was capable of loading the ammunition magazine into the handgun because he had seen similar semi-automatic weapons loaded and fired while watching television. As he played with the loaded pistol, it accidentally discharged and the young child suffered a fatal bullet wound to the head; he died two days later. Appellant, Jordan\u2019s mother and personal representative of his estate, brought this action, alleging that the handgun failed to include a safety device, i.e., a child-resistant trigger lock, and because the warnings and instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tions given to Garris were inadequate to prevent the fatal accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore. City delivered its oral opinion from the bench, in which it opined:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC\">THE COURT: This will be memorandum of opinion....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">And the simple fact is, as the [appellant] has said, if the gun manufacturer put onto the gun device they\u2019ve known about for a hundred years or so to make it certain that a three year old could not have fired it, the child would still be here. But they did not. So the question is really whether that failure to incert [sic] [safety device] made the gun defective under the products liability law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">There is much wrong if that\u2019s the case. Much wrong. The problem is that it\u2019s also clear the child\u2019s father knew this was also a very dangerous product. I must say my reaction to the warning argument is multiple. One, the suggestion the warnings provided were more than adequate were not impressive to me. I think the [appellant] has pointed out that this 35 paged [sic] booklet, with its warnings with respect to children, are relatively small, small type, and there is so much warning about so much; and, as I say that, I want to say I\u2019m also equally aware of defendant\u2019s 4, [sic] the youth handgun safety action notice, which I think plaintiffs also correctly point out one can tell why it is titled, it is not directed towards [sic] three year olds. So in many ways, it seems the warnings are far from adequate. On the other hand, this is a handgun we\u2019re talking about where there is a question of whether any warning whatsoever is necessary because guns are made to kill people. That simple. Particularly a handgun such as this was not made for hunting. It was made to kill people, pure and simple.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>And so there are two questions, and that is, one, was any warning necessary? And the second, if a warning was necessary, that maybe, in fact, all of these warnings that are in this 35 paged [sic] booklet are equally necessary. Because we are, again, talking about a gun designed to kill people, so the warning on page 8, for example, about ammunition that says that death, serious injury and damage can result in the use of wrong ammunition, is a warning. That arguably is warning about not keeping it around children. The warning on page 6 about manual safety says placing the safety in an intermedial position between safe and fired can result in the user thinking the pistol is in a safety or fired position when it is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">Likewise, the warning on page 10 about firing, the one on page 11 about handling, one on unloading and sliding, malfunctioning, there are lots and lots of warnings about what could go wrong ending up in the death of or a serious injury to someone because this is a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\"><em>Look at it that way, the warning with respect to the children, it\u2019s more than adequate. </em>In addition, with respect to the issue of warning and sense of danger and the sense of the need to keep the gun away from children, I think the allegations made by the [appellant], again, are relevant. The allegations made in paragraph 16 which states that [the] three year old [child] found the gun under his father\u2019s mattress, clearly an allegation that it was put there with the expectation that it would not be found by this three year old. Goes on to say his father had hidden the gun there and had removed the magazine clip containing the bullets from the gun for safety, which I think clearly is also some indication making some effort to make this inherently dangerous product safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">But on the issue of misuse, I think there are some things that lead me to conclude in this case that in terms of the misuse or superceding intervening cause or whatever, that I think makes a motion for summary judgement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>[sic] in favor of the [appellee] appropriate, and that is <em>that we\u2019re talking about a gun. And a gun, where clearly the person who purchased it knew it was dangerous by the way it was handled, and in response to the argument about the risk utility test, I think that what the Court of Special Appeals said in Keller (sic) veruss [sic] Archie Industries is that the risk utility test is applicable and only applied when something goes wrong with a product. And I think what they\u2019re talking about is not something going wrong in the sense of clearly [appellant] was right, something went wrong in the sense that a three year old was killed and that\u2019s very wrong, but not in the sense of the gun behaving the way one would predict the gun should behave, and in the sense the gun operated the way it should have, </em>I think also, really even stronger here, is that it is a misdemeanor for someone to possess a gun, to store or leave a loaded firearm in any location where an individual knew or should have known that an unsupervised minor child would have access to it. I say that realizing that is a heavy burden for the father of the child and the mother of the child also to be stuck with. And I say that because <em>that makes it different than the Klien [sic] case, relied upon by the [appellant], where the warning is putting one finger in the wrong place, which was not a criminal offense, </em>nor should it have been a criminal offense, but simply was a sense of sloppy use, similar to the <em>Elsworth </em>[sic] case involving the nightgown which might not even be termed sloppy use, but which is predictable; but with respect to <em>Klien </em>[sic], it can be described as sloppy use. And I say that because I do believe the [appellant] is right, <em>Klien </em>[sic] does make clear that a warning by itself doesn\u2019t obviate the problem. If that really was what this case turned on, I would reach a different result, but the problem here is something, as I said, the question is whether any warning was needed; second, whether, because of the type of product it was, you need to read the manual to get all the warnings, because it was so dangerous and so deadly; and third, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>is clear the child\u2019s father knew about all these dangers. And also, one way of dealing with this has to make it a criminal offense to put that gun in a place where the child would get to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On appeal, appellant does not pursue the claim of inadequate warnings and instructions regarding the operation of the handgun received by the elder Garris at the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">We summarized our appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment in <em>Bond v. NIBCO, </em>96 Md.App. 127, 134-36, 623 A.2d 731 (1993):</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">Any party may file at any time a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... The response to a motion ... shall identify \"with particularity the material facts that are disputed.... The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">... Thus, a moving party must set forth sufficient grounds for summary judgment. Although the movant is not required to support his [or her] motion with an affidavit unless he [or she] files it \u201cbefore the day on which the adverse party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is filed,\u201d ..., he [or she] must support his [or her] various contentions by placing before the court <em>facts that would be admissible in evidence or otherwise detailing the absence of evidence in the record to support </em>a cause of action. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Discussing the trilogy emanating from the Supreme Court, we continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have, in recent years, emphasized that a trial court should not be reluctant to grant a motion for summary judgment in an appropriate case. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986);.... In <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 242-45, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992), we discussed at some length these teachings, emphasizing that a motion for summary judgment, although not a substitute for trial, is nevertheless <em>not </em>disfavored. A proper summary judgment motion is to be granted unless the parties truly dispute a material fact, <em>i.e., </em>the evidence is such that a fair[-]minded jury could return a verdict for the nonmovant. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 603 A.2d 1357. For this reason, although a party opposing a proper motion for summary judgment need not file an affidavit unless \u201cthe motion ... is supported by an affidavit or other statement under oath,\u201d ..., the opponent cannot rely on formal denials or general allegations. ... Instead, an opponent must \u201cidentify with particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u201d ... Thus, <em>\u201c[w]hen a moving party has set forth sufficient grounds for summary judgment, </em>the party opposing the motion must show with \u2018some precision\u2019 that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact,\u201d ..., and place before the trial court facts that would be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">... That is, if the summary judgment motion is based on facts not contained in the record or papers on file in the proceeding it \u201cshall be supported by affidavit and accompanied by any papers on which it is based.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Moreover, as the Supreme Court noted in articulating its now famous <em>Celotex </em>holding, even when an affidavit is not necessary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">... a party seeking summary judgment <em>always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of \u201cthe pleadings, </em>depositions, answers to interrogatories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\u201d <em>which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, (emphasis added). \u201cTo satisfy the requirement that there be no genuine dispute as to any material fact, the moving party <em>must include in the motion the facts necessary to obtain judgment and a showing that there is no dispute as to any of those facts.\u201d ... Only </em>if a movant \u201cbears this initial responsibility\u201d or makes this \u201cshowing\u201d does the party opposing the summary judgment motion have the burden of identifying \u201cwith particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u201d ... Thus, a motion for summary judgment that simply asserts that the opponent has not identified disputed facts is not sufficient. A summary judgment movant usually is not required to file an affidavit, ..., but <em>if </em>the movant disputes facts alleged in the complaint (or answer if the movant is the plaintiff), the movant must himself [or herself] identify the portions of the record that \u201cdemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d ... Indeed, the movant must attach \u201cas an exhibit\u201d to his motion \u201cany document\u201d that he \u201cwishes the court to consider in ruling on the motion ... unless the document is adopted by reference as permitted by Rule 2-303(d) or set forth as permitted by Rule 2-432(b).\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">At the outset, it should be noted that appellant has abandoned any claim that the warnings provided by appellee were inadequate. The adequacy of the warnings is therefore pertinent only as a refutation of appellant\u2019s denial that Garris misused the subject firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Citing the Restatement of Torts (Third), Products Liability, and <em>Klein v. Sears, Roebuck </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>&amp; Co., </em>92 Md.App. 477, 486, 608 A.2d 1276 (1992), appellant initially asserts that this Court has \u201cmade clear that the risk-utility test applies to a claim that the absence of a safety device renders a design defective.\u201d She alludes to a statement in <em>Klein </em>that \u201cthe absence of a safety device may clearly be a design defect, even in a product that does not \u2018malfunction.\u2019 \u201d Ultimately, appellant contends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[t]he trial judge mistakenly applied the consumer-expectations test rather than the risk-utility test. While acknowledging plaintiffs argument that \u201cthere is certainly no reason that it should be easier for a three year old to use a handgun than ... to open an aspirin bottle,\u201d the court failed to weigh the risks from the absence of a child-resistant safety device against the utility of not incorporating it. Instead, the court observed that \u201cguns are made to kill people. That simple. Particularly a handgun such as this that was not made for hunting. It was made to kill people, pure and simple.\u201d The trial court mistakenly believed that the risk-utility test did not apply because \u201cthe gun behav(ed) the way one would predict the gun would behave,\u201d <em>ie. </em>the gun passed the consumer-expectations test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, appellant asseverates that \u201cthe trial court mistakenly relied on <em>dictum </em>in <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, </em>304 Md. 124, 138, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985), that said that the risk-utility test does not apply in the absence of a \u2018malfunction.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Appellee\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, after asserting that appellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the facts, as recited in the complaint, \u201cclearly exonerate [appellee],\u201d sets forth two \u201cfactually related, but distinct legal grounds,\u201d to wit: (1) \u201cthat the firearm was not in a defective condition or unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe pistol was used in a manner that was contrary to clearly worded instructions and warnings that accompanied the product when sold.\u201d The alleged undisputed material facts relied upon by appellee are:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>1. The instruction manual warned that firearms should always be stored securely and unloaded away from children and careless adults; firearms should only be loaded when ready to shoot; firearms should be locked in racks or cabinets when not in use; ammunition should be stored separate from firearms; firearms should be stored out of sight of visitors and children; it is the gun owner\u2019s responsibility to be certain that children and persons unfamiliar with firearms cannot gain access to firearms, ammunition, or components; and users should read the instructions and warnings in the manual carefully before using firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">2. Edward DeCarlo, the On Target salesman who sold the pistol to Garris, reviewed the manual with him and explained how to load and unload the gun and operate the manual safety. Garris signed a statement in which he acknowledged that DeCarlo had \u201cdemonstrated and/or explained\u201d how to load and unload the weapon, the purpose and function of the safety mechanism(s) and how to work it (them), that Garris understood that he should treat the weapon as if it were loaded until he personally made certain that it was not loaded, and that he intended to use the weapon in a lawful manner. Garris also received a \u201cYouth Handgun Safety Act Notice\u201d distributed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which read: \u201cSafety storing and securing firearms away from children will help prevent the unlawful possession of handguns by juveniles, stop accidents and save lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">3. Garris received from On Target a lockable box and padlock provided by appellee and he was offered a trigger lock<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which he could purchase as an additional safety precaution.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">4. The undisputed material facts, for purposes of the Motion for Summary Judgment, extracted from the complaint are that Garris stored the pistol under his mattress and stored the magazine containing bullets on a book shelf; that three-year-old Jordan found the gun and the loaded magazine and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201chaving seen semi-automatic pistols loaded and fired on television, was able to put the magazine clip in the gun\u201d and the gun discharged while Jordan \u201cplayed with the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The trial judge was, in the first instance, required to determine if the allegations set forth in the complaint stated a cause of action in strict product liability and, if so, whether appellant\u2019s claim, on the above material facts, if undisputed, survives the Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Appellant argued in her opposition to the motion that the handgun was defective and unreasonably dangerous under the risk-utility test, \u201c[bjecause the risk from excluding child safety features outweighs the utility of that exclusion, and because alternative safer designs could have been adopted economically....\u201d She also argued that, because it was reasonably foreseeable to appellee, \u201cany warning to store the gun locked and unloaded would not be followed by a significant proportion of gun owners,\u201d Garris\u2019s improper storage of the gun did not constitute misuse and thus could not defeat the design defect claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The opposition was accompanied by two affidavits, one of which was given by Garris. The contents of Garris\u2019s affidavit are consistent with the facts relied upon by appellee, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>for his assertion that \u201c[n]o one at On Target or elsewhere ever offered to sell me a trigger lock or explain the need for one. Indeed, the first time I ever saw a trigger lock was on August 20, 1999,\u201d three months after Jordan\u2019s death. Garris also stated that he \u201cglanced through the owner\u2019s manual\u201d when he purchased the gun, but did \u201cnot recall reading any warnings regarding storage of the gun.\u201d This statement is arguably in conflict with DeCarlo\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The affidavit of Stephen P. Teret also accompanied appellee\u2019s opposition. Teret is a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. In large part, the affidavit consists of a recitation of statistics on unintentional firearm deaths and unsafe firearm storage practices culled from a compendium of government compilations and articles in medical journals. Of the ten articles cited, two were co-authored by Teret. The affidavit also contains a number of unattributed factual assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">8. A recent study has found that boys will play with a gun they find in a seemingly safe environment, including pulling the trigger of the gun, as if it were a toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">9. For more than a century, gun manufacturers have been aware of the risk that handguns pose to children. Beginning in the late 1880[\u2019]s, Smith &amp; Wesson designed and marketed a handgun they said could not be operated by an ordinary child under the age of 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">11. A well-recognized and accepted tenet of the discipline of injury prevention is that a more effective method of preventing injuries to children is to design safety into products than to instruct the users and owners of the products to behave in a safe manner at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Teret\u2019s affidavit also contains several opinions. He attributes to an editorial that he co-authored the opinion that \u201cchildproof or personalized handguns, which are operable only by authorized users, are viable design options.... \u201d He also opines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Based upon the incidence of unintended gun-related deaths to children, the knowledge of prevalent unsafe gun storage by adults in homes with children, the existence of feasible design changes that could make guns more child resistant, and the relative ineffectiveness of warnings and instructions compared to product modifications for the protection of children, it is my opinion that the reliance by [appellee] on materials in its owner\u2019s manual and the provision of a lockable carrying case was inadequate to protect children from the risk of unintended gun death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">There was also a third exhibit attached to appellant\u2019s opposition, a picture of a handgun labeled, \u201cSmith &amp; Wesson childproof handgun, circa 1894.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The opposition to a motion for summary judgment must be supported by \u201cfacts that would be admissible in evidence....\u201d <em>Bond, </em>96 Md.App. at 134, 623 A.2d 731; <em>see Vanhook v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>22 Md.App. 22, 26, 321 A.2d 540 (1974) (\u201cEach opposing party is given ample opportunity to place before the court facts which, on the one hand, show that he [or she] is entitled as a matter of law to the ruling he [or she] seeks, or on the other hand, show that a fact, material to the opponent\u2019s position, is disputed.\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Vanhook, </em>we offered a list of methods of placing such facts before the court, including by affidavit, deposition transcript, answers to interrogatories, admissions of facts, stipulations, and, under some circumstances, pleadings. <em>Vanhook, </em>22 Md. App. at 26-27, 321 A.2d 540. Turning to the admissibility of the facts alleged by appellant, we first note that there is no basis for the admission of the purported photograph of the Smith &amp; Wesson handgun. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-901 (2001) (requiring \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims\u201d as a \u201ccondition precedent to admissibility.\u201d). Appellee did not raise this infirmity before us or the trial court, however, so we must treat the photograph as authentic.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">An affidavit submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment \u201cmust show that the person making it has personal knowledge of and is competent to testify to the facts stated.\u201d <em>Vanhook, </em>22 Md.App. at 26, 321 A.2d 540. \u201cAn affidavit suffices in the summary judgment context to place before the court a fact that, <em>if </em>testified to by the affiant at trial, would be admissible, even though the affidavit itself generally is not admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Imbraguglio v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>358 Md. 194, 207, 747 A.2d 662 (2000). Garris\u2019s affidavit meets these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The admissibility of Teret\u2019s affidavit is more problematic. The affidavit contains an affirmance that its contents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>are based on personal knowledge, but the admissibility of some of the statements is at issue. First, Md. Rule 2-311(c) (2001) requires a party to \u201cattach as an exhibit to a written motion or response any document that the party wishes the court to consider in ruling on the motion or response ...\u201d <em>See Bond, </em>96 Md.App. at 135, 623 A.2d 731 (confirming that a \u201cparty moving for summary judgment, like a party filing any other motion, must comply with Md. Rule 2-311.\u201d). Although the affidavit mentions eleven studies, ten of them by name, and one editorial, none of the documents were attached to appellant\u2019s opposition. This omission deprived the court of the opportunity to examine the details of the studies in order to assess the basis for Teret\u2019s expert opinion. Because a full citation and a short description were given for each study, however, appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the technical requirements would not have been a proper basis for the grant of summary judgment. <em>See Bond, </em>96 Md.App. at 141, 623 A.2d 731 (reversing grant of summary judgment where moving party \u201cdid not identify and attach any pleading, deposition, interrogatory answer, admission, affidavit, or other document\u201d demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact); <em>Brown v.

Sonnenleiter, </em>208 Md. 443, 447-48, 118 A.2d 509 (1955):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">The rule followed by the majority of the cases is that if the evidence as to past accidents, tendencies or defects is sufficiently relevant and illuminating because there is similarity of time, place and circumstance, it will be admissible \u2014 not as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>direct evidence of negligence but to show the existence of a danger or defect in the character of a place, method or appliance and <em>to show knowledge or notice of the danger or defect on the part of the defendant, </em>unless, in its discretion, the trial court believes it will cause an unfair surprise or confusion by raising collateral issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">(Citations omitted), <em>cited in Cutlip v. Lucky Stores, Inc., </em>22 Md.App. 673, 696, 325 A.2d 432 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 495 A.2d 348 (1985), the Court of Appeals discussed the admissibility of certain government reports on \u201cdeaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from accidental burning of products, fabrics, or related materials.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600 n. 15, 495 A.2d 348. The plaintiff in <em>Ellsworth, </em>who was injured when her nightgown caught on fire, brought a strict liability action against the clothing manufacturer. Although the fabric of the nightgown met federal flammability standards, the plaintiff alleged that the fabric\u2019s propensity to ignite rendered it unreasonably dangerous. The evidence in question was focused on \u201cthe incidence and severity of burns, caused by ignition of clothing that was subject to the Federal standard----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 495 A.2d 348. We held that the trial court erred in excluding this evidence because \u201c[t]he reports are material to the issues and tend to establish the proposition that the nightgown as sold was unreasonably dangerous to prospective users.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 495 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the government statistics cited by Teret have no relevance to the issues on summary judgment. He describes the documents as listing the number of children under five and under ten who suffered \u201cunintentional, gun-related deaths.\u201d Judging, as we must, solely from Teret\u2019s description, the statistics contain no information on how these deaths occurred, such as what types of guns were involved, where the guns were found, whether the guns were equipped with safety devices, or even whether the guns were in the possession of children when the shootings occurred. Unlike the evidence in <em>Ellsworth, </em>where the flammability of a fabric meeting the same government standard as those studied was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>directly at issue, these government statistics are of little probative value. The unnamed \u201crecent study\u201d finding that \u201cboys will play with a gun they find in a seemingly safe environment\u201d is likewise patently lacking in probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The published studies cited by Teret vary in their focus. One article co-authored by Teret studied 88 unintended gunshot deaths of children in California, finding that a substantial number were self-inflicted and involved handguns that were stored loaded and unlocked. Teret\u2019s other article studied 131 such deaths, finding that the majority involved handguns and that, of those handguns, nine were manufactured by appellee. These studies are slightly more similar to the case before us, but are still not sufficiently probative to be admissible. <em>See Locke, </em>208 Md. at 447-48, 118 A.2d 509 (discussing the danger that \u201cevidence as to past accidents\u201d may cause \u201cconfusion by raising collateral issues.\u201d). Appellee has not denied the foreseeability of young children playing with and being injured by handguns, or even of handguns being improperly stored. Its misuse argument focuses, rather, on the warnings it gave, and the foreseeability of a handgun owner improperly storing one of its handguns despite them. The four studies cited that give statistics solely on improper storage suffer from the same infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Two of the studies cited by Teret go beyond the recitation of statistics on unsafe gun storage in houses with children. One states that \u201c[sjafety instruction ... even if provided by the military or in a formal class, is not associated with safe gun-handling procedures as they relate to keeping guns loaded.\u201d The other study found that \u201c[individuals who received firearm training were significantly more likely to keep a gun in the home both loaded and unlocked,\u201d and concluded that \u201ccomplete reliance on the training strategy may be misplaced.\u201d It is unclear, however, what safety procedures were taught in these classes, or indeed whether the \u201cfirearm training\u201d in the second study included safety instruction at all. Moreover, appellee\u2019s misuse theory in this case relies on the warnings and instructions contained in its manual, not in a class. Appellant failed to establish sufficiently the relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>of any of these studies in her submission in opposition to the motion for summary judgment; they therefore were not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">At the summary judgment stage, the court was correct in assuming the truth of Teret\u2019s statement that, \u201c[f]or more than a century, gun manufacturers have been aware of the risk that handguns pose to children.\u201d The same is true of his statement that to design a product with safety features is a more effective method of preventing injuries to children than safety instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The two opinions contained in Teret\u2019s affidavit were dissimilar. The first, expressed as a summary of the contents of an editorial Teret co-authored, is that \u201cthe design of handguns can be modified to increase the safety of children,\u201d and that \u201cchildproof or personalized handguns ... are viable design options for handgun manufacturers.\u201d As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 741, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993), \u201can expert opinion derives its probative force from the facts on which it is predicated, and these must be legally sufficient to sustain the opinion of the expert.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation omitted.) Teret\u2019s opinion on the viability of safer design options is supported, albeit tenuously, by the factual assertion about the Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson handgun. In the absence of the studies he cited in the affidavit, whose relevance was not established, Teret\u2019s other, more comprehensive opinion may be restated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">Based upon the existence of feasible design changes that could make guns more child resistant, and the relative ineffectiveness of warnings and instructions compared to product modifications for the protection of children, it is my opinion that the reliance by [appellee] on materials in its owner\u2019s manual and the provision of a lockable carrying case was inadequate to protect children from the risk of unintended gun death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">If we assume Teret\u2019s remaining factual assertions to be true, this opinion, too, is supported by a sufficient factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>In summary, there were two main issues before the trial court as it considered the motion for summary judgment: (1) whether the handgun sold to Garris was in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous and (2) whether Garris\u2019s improper storage constituted an unforeseeable misuse of the handgun. The only facts in dispute were whether Garris was offered a trigger lock when he purchased the handgun and how thoroughly Garris and the On Target salesman reviewed the instruction manual on the day of the purchase. These areas of dispute were not sufficient to defeat summary judgment; however, neither was dispositive of the two issues outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The undisputed facts, including the warnings contained in the instruction manual, the delivery to Garris of a lockbox and padlock, and the circumstances of the accident, constituted a core of material facts upon which the lower court could properly determine the entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. For her part, undisputed were appellant\u2019s submissions that the gun manufacturers have been aware of the dangers of handguns to children for over a century, that childproof and personalized handguns are viable design options, that design improvements are more effective than safety instructions in preventing injuries to children, and that \u201cthe reliance of [appellee] on materials in its owner\u2019s manual and the provision of a lockable carrying case was inadequate to protect children from the risk of unintended gun death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The court, therefore, had facts which were material to the resolution of the controversy before it and upon which it could properly decide which party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, notwithstanding the disputed claim of appellee that it made a trigger lock available to Garris and that DeCarlo did not review the warnings and instructions with him. In other words, accepting as true the facts that DeCarlo had not offered a trigger lock and that he had not discussed the warnings and instructions with Garris, these assumed facts, in conjunction with the undisputed facts in support of appellant\u2019s opposition to the motion for summary judgment discussed, <em>supra, </em>represented the putative evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>light most favorable to appellant. Thus, from the undisputed facts and facts assumed to be true relied upon by appellant, for purposes of the motion, as well as the undisputed facts relied upon by appellee, the trial court had before it the material facts to rule on the motion for summary judgment. Specifically, it could make a determination as to whether, in contemplation of controlling legal authority, the handgun sold to Garris was in a defective, unreasonably dangerous condition and whether the improper storage of the handgun by Garris constituted an unforeseeable misuse of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Morever, appellant\u2019s attempt to create a factual dispute that DeCarlo offered a trigger lock is undermined by her position before us at oral argument, urging that the external trigger lock the salesman said he made available did not constitute the type of safety device that would have corrected the alleged defect. Appellant also maintained, at oral argument before us, that irrespective of how prominent or graphic the written warnings issued at the time of sale had been, they would not have operated to render Garris\u2019s violation of State law in the manner of storing the handgun, his negligence in storing the gun under the mattress and his lack of supervision of a three-year old unforeseeable. Thus, appellant\u2019s attempt to generate a factual dispute regarding whether DeCarlo reviewed the instructions and warnings is adverse to her stated position that Garris\u2019s course of conduct should have been foreseeable despite any warnings which may have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The dissenting opinion posits that our decision \u201cunjustifiably removes from the trier of fact\u201d (1) whether the incorporation of a safety device is a workable design option under the risk-utility test; (2) whether the storing of the handgun under a mattress is reasonably foreseeable and therefore not a misuse of the product; and (3) whether the warnings or instructions provided by appellee sufficiently warned against the reasonably foreseeable, yet unintended or incorrect use of the product. As we have noted, appellant insists that no warnings would have been sufficient, thereby removing the adequacy of those warnings as a factual issue for submission to the jury. Regarding whether the reasonable foreseeability of storage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the handgun under a mattress was a factual matter, we conclude, <em>infra, </em>that such storage of the handgun under the circumstances, <em>sub judice, </em>i.e., within the reach of an unsupervised three-year old in violation of State law, constitutes misuse as a matter of law. Even were we to determine whether improper storage of the handgun was reasonably foreseeable is a factual matter, appellee would nonetheless be entitled to summary judgment in the case at hand, given that Maryland law is that the risk-utility test is inapplicable to handguns which do not malfunction. No factual issue is generated because it is immaterial as to whether the incorporation of a safety device is a workable design option under a standard-the risk-utility test-that does not apply. For the reasons we set forth, <em>infra, </em>the undisputed facts which are material establish that the handgun did not malfunction and was, therefore, not defective and appellant\u2019s improper storage and failure to heed warnings constituted an unforeseeable misuse of the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>KELLEY v. R.G. INDUSTRIES: THE HOLDING OR OBITER DICTUM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Appellant characterizes as <em>dictum </em>the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Kelley </em>that the risk-utility test is inapplicable to a handgun unless it malfunctions. <em>See Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 138, 497 A.2d 1143. The term <em>dictum </em>is an abbreviated form of <em>obiter dictum, </em>which is translated as \u201ca remark by the way.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 454 (6th ed.1990). It refers to a statement made by a court \u201cincidentally or collaterally, and not directly upon the question before it, or upon a point not necessarily involved in the determination of the cause.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1072. <em>Obiter dictum </em>lacks the authority of adjudication. <em>Stover v. Stover, </em>60 Md.App. 470, 476, 483 A.2d 783 (1984); <em>see Bryan v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>115 Md.App. 707, 712-13, 694 A.2d 522 (1997). It is not entitled to the precedential weight afforded the holding because it does not receive \u201cthe deliberate and considered judgment\u201d used in phrasing the holding. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. 24, 36, 664 A.2d 1 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Kelley </em>came before the Court of Appeals on certification from the United States District Court. The Court rephrased the four certified questions as three new questions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and dealt with them <em>seriatum. Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 131, 497 A.2d 1143. The Court first addressed the question of whether a handgun manufacturer or marketer could be held liable under strict liability theories for injuries such as Kelley\u2019s. It found that liability could not be based on Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519 and 520 (1965) governing abnormally dangerous or ultrahazardous activity because this doctrine \u201cdoes not apply to the manufacture or marketing of handguns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 497 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Court next looked to the applicability of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A, which holds liable the seller of a product \u201cin a defective condition unreasonably dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 497 A.2d 1143. Applying the \u201cconsumer-expectation\u201d test, the Court found that a normally operating handgun is not in a defective condition. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. It then turned to the alternative \u201crisk-utility\u201d test, finding that it can only be used \u201cwhen something goes wrong with a product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 497 A.2d 1143. Because \u201ca handgun which injured a person in whose direction it was fired ... worked precisely as intended,\u201d the risk-utility test was \u201cinapplicable to the present situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then considered whether to extend the common law to make the manufacturers and marketers of handguns liable for gunshot injuries, but determined that this \u201cwould be contrary to Maryland public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>policy as set forth by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 497 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Turning to its second rephrased question, the Court found that the class of handguns known as \u201cSaturday Night Specials\u201d was intended for and suited to uses that were inconsistent with Maryland public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 147-53, 497 A.2d 1143. It also took notice of \u201cthe ever growing number of deaths and injuries due to such handguns being used in criminal activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 157, 497 A.2d 1143, and determined that \u201cthe manufacturer or marketer of a Saturday Night Special knows or ought to know that the chief use of the product is for criminal activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 156, 497 A.2d 1143. The Court thus recognized \u201ca separate, limited area of strict liability for the manufacturers, as well as all in the marketing chain, of Saturday Night Specials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 497 A.2d 1143. Finally, the Court answered the third rephrased question, whether the handgun that caused Kelley\u2019s injuries was a Saturday Night Special, in the affirmative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 159-61, 497 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Court\u2019s statement that the risk-utility test was inapplicable to \u201ca handgun which has not malfunctioned\u201d was not <em>obiter dictum. </em>Based on the structure and history of the decision, pellucidly, the Court made this finding not \u201cincidentally or collaterally,\u201d but in response to Kelley\u2019s contention that R.G. Industries was liable under \u00a7 402A. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>State v. Board of Education, </em>346 Md. 633, 641, 697 A.2d 1334 (1997), \u201c[a]n appellate court\u2019s rejection of a reason given by a litigant for the relief sought in the case is not \u2018dicta.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, the procedural posture of the case necessitated answering each of the questions certified by the U.S. District Court, making consideration of the applicability of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A absolutely necessary. Thus, the holding in <em>Kelley </em>that the risk-utility test is inapplicable to handguns is neither \u201cincidental\u201d nor \u201ceollater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>al\u201d to the decision and, indeed, the Court set forth an extensive explication in support of that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">None of the cases which have construed <em>Kelley </em>has overturned <em>Kelley </em>or have rejected its ultimate holding that \u201cthe risk[-] utility test cannot be extended to impose liability on the maker or marketer of a handgun which has not malfunctioned.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 138, 497 A.2d 1143. Although the Court of Appeals has cited to <em>Kelley </em>several times, none of its opinions has addressed this specific aspect of the decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">This Court has dealt with the issue in two opinions and, while we distinguished both cases from <em>Kelley, </em>we have neither questioned nor rejected it. In <em>C &amp; K Lord, Inc. v. Carter, </em>74 Md.App. 68, 536 A.2d 699 (1988), we applied the risk-utility test in finding that a conveyer belt in which the plaintiffs arm was injured was defective. We stated that, \u201calthough the <em>Kelley </em>language [on malfunction] is clearly applicable to instrumentalities such as handguns, it is inapplicable where as here, the design defect is the failure to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>a safety device____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 536 A.2d 699. We followed the <em>Kelley </em>malfunction requirement in the end, however, finding that the conveyer had malfunctioned before applying the risk-utility test. <em>Id. </em>We also applied the risk-utility test to find a product defective in <em>Ziegler v. Kawasaki Heavy Industries, </em>74 Md.App. 613, 539 A.2d 701 (1988), limiting the <em>Kelley </em>malfunction requirement to \u201cthe narrow context of handguns\u201d or possibly of other products whose \u201cnormal function ... [is] to bring about serious injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 539 A.2d 701. We stated, however, that \u201cthe <em>absence </em>of a safety device may clearly be a design defect, even in a product which does not \u2018malfunction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 539 A.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">This statement in <em>Ziegler </em>gave rise to a line of cases, each applying the risk-utility test to a product which had not malfunctioned but which allegedly had the design defect of failing to include a safety device. <em>See Klein, </em>92 Md.App. at 486, 608 A.2d 1276 (1992); <em>Nicholson v. Yamaha Motor Co., </em>80 Md.App. 695, 717-19, 566 A.2d 135 (1989). In one case, we extended this doctrine by applying the risk-utility test to a product whose design flaw was not the absence of a safety feature but nonetheless had \u201can indirect ... influence on safety ... [by] mak[ing] it less likely that the safety feature [would] be utilized.\u201d <em>Valk Mfg. Co. v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 317, 537 A.2d 622 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Montgomery County v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 562 A.2d 1246 (1989). Nevertheless, neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has applied the risk-utility test to a handgun, nor has either Court questioned the holding in <em>Kelley </em>that the risk-utility test is inapplicable to a handgun that has not malfunctioned. <em>See Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 138, 497 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>MALFUNCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">A handgun that has performed as expected cannot be said to have \u201cmalfunctioned\u201d within the ambit of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A, as construed by <em>Kelley. </em>A handgun is a unique product in that \u201cits normal function is to propel bullets with deadly force.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 136, 497 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>1143. Not every fatal accident caused by a handgun can be considered a malfunction, then, because a handgun is \u201cdangerous[ ] by its very nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. As the <em>Kelley </em>Court stated, \u201cIn the case of a handgun which injured a person in whose direction it was fired, the product worked precisely as intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 497 A.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We discussed the concept of malfunction in <em>C &amp; K Lord, </em>when an employee in a chicken rendering plant was injured by a conveyer. The stick with which he was cleaning the conveyer was caught in a pinch point and his arm drawn up into the belt\u2019s roller. For guidance, we looked to <em>Duke v. Gulf &amp; Western Mfg., </em>660 S.W.2d 404 (Mo.App.1983), a case cited in <em>Kelley </em>as an example of a malfunctioning product. \u201cIn <em>Duke, </em>the plaintiff was operating a die-press when \u2018something struck him in the head and the next thing he knew, his hands were in the press.\u2019 \u201d <em>C &amp; K Lord, </em>74 Md.App. at 85, 536 A.2d 699 (quoting <em>Duke, </em>660 S.W.2d at 407). The press descended on the plaintiffs hands, causing serious injuries. We concluded that <em>Duke </em>was \u201cextremely analogous\u201d to the case before us and reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">the subject conveyer\u2019s \u201cnormal function\u201d is to transport feathers to cookers. The conveyer did not work \u201cprecisely as intended\u201d when it caught Carter\u2019s hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 86, 536 A.2d 699. We held that the conveyer had malfunctioned and that the trial court \u201cdid not err in instructing the jury on the risk[-]utility test.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The <em>Kelley </em>Court also cited <em>Barker v. Lull Engineering, Inc., </em>20 Cal.3d 413, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978), and <em>Back v. Wickes Corporation, </em>375 Mass. 633, 378 N.E.2d 964 (1978), as examples of malfunctioning products. <em>See Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 138, 497 A.2d 1143. In <em>Barker, </em>a motor home was involved in a highway accident and ran off the road. When the vehicle struck a roadside fence, it burst into flames, killing all four of its passengers. The <em>Back </em>plaintiffs injuries occurred when the construction loader he was operating became unbalanced and tipped over. As the plaintiff scurried away from the loader, he was struck by a piece of falling lumber and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>seriously injured. In both cases, the injuries were caused by something other than the normal function of the product involved. The normal function of a motor home is to convey passengers along roadways. The normal function of the lift in <em>Back </em>was to remain stationary while lifting a load.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">To be sure, the question is partially one of definition. The outcome of the malfunction inquiry is largely determined by how narrowly or broadly the normal function is defined. For example, had we defined the normal function of the conveyer in <em>C &amp; K Lord </em>more broadly as \u201ccarrying objects in the direction in which the belt is moving,\u201d we would have found no malfunction. But when the product in question is a handgun, we are not left to our own devices. The Court of Appeals has already defined the normal function of a handgun \u2014 \u201cto propel bullets with deadly force.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the fact that the gunshot resulted in the tragic death of a young boy does not transform the propulsion of the bullet into a malfunction. Appellant would have us define the normal functions of a gun as \u201claw enforcement, sport, and home and business protection,\u201d citing the exceptions to the crime of wearing, carrying, or transporting a firearm contained in Md.Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 36B(c) (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.). Each of these suggested functions, however, relies on the more basic function that renders a handgun useful \u2014 the propulsion of a bullet with great force. In reliance on the <em>Kelley </em>Court\u2019s definition, we conclude that the handgun in this case did not malfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The strict liability concepts of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A were never intended to apply to instrumentalities, such as handguns, whose normal functions are to cause death or inflict serious injury. Section 402A was rooted in the ancient common law concept holding \u201cthose engaged in the business of selling food intended for human consumption ... to a high degree of responsibility for their products.\u201d Restatement \u00a7 402A cmt. b. The drafters of the Restatement followed more modern cases that \u201cextended this special rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>strict liability beyond the seller of food for human consumption ... to cover the sale of any product which, if it should prove to be defective, may be expected to cause physical harm to the consumer or his [or her] property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Because the products liability concept began with foods, many of the illustrations used in the comment to \u00a7 402A refer to products intended for human consumption. These illustrations are instructive nonetheless. For example, comment i focuses on the provision that the product must be \u201cunreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.\u201d The comment explains that \u201c[t]he article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,\u201d offering the following illustrations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">Good whiskey is not unreasonably dangerous merely because it will make some people drunk, and is especially dangerous to alcoholics; but bad whiskey, containing a dangerous amount of fusel oil, is unreasonably dangerous. Good tobacco is not unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harmful; but tobacco containing something like marijuana may be unreasonably dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\"><em>Id. </em>at cmt. i. The propensity of whiskey to make one drunk and of tobacco to harm one\u2019s lungs are well known and expected; such dangers do not go \u201cbeyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case of a handgun, \u201c[a] consumer would expect [it] to be dangerous, by its very nature, and to have the capacity to fire a bullet with deadly force.\u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. The danger that a handgun might injure someone through its normal operation, then, is not the type of hazard intended to be covered by Restatement \u00a7 402A. <em>See generally </em>Note: Manufacturers\u2019 Strict Liability for Injuries From a Well Made Handgun, 24 Wm. <em>&amp; </em>Mary L.Rev. 467 (1983) (noting agreement among \u201cmost authorities ... that the definitions [of \u2018defective condition\u2019 and \u2018unreasonably dangerous\u2019 in \u00a7 402A] outline a liability device known as the consumer expectation test,\u201d but discussing the \u201cnovel legal theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>risk-utility balancing\u201d advanced by <em>Barker v.

It extends to any product sold in the condition ... in which it is expected to reach the ultimate user or consumer. Thus the rule stated applies to <em>an automobile, a tire, an airplane, a grinding wheel, a water heater, a gas stove, a power tool, a riveting machine, a chair, and an insecticide.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. d. The reporter also lists in his notes the \u201cproducts to which liability has been extended\u201d by case law: animal food, automobiles, tires, steering gear, airplanes, airplane instruments, grinding wheels, cinder building blocks, electric cable, insecticide sprays, herbicide, combination power tools, power golf carts, children\u2019s playground equipment, chairs, riveting machines, water heaters, and gas stoves. <em>Id. </em>at reporter\u2019s note 3. A handgun is inherently different from each of these products in that it is \u201cdangerous[ ] by its very nature.... \u201d <em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. A handgun is designed for the sole purpose of \u201cpropel[ling] bullets with deadly force,\u201d <em>id., </em>a purpose that has the necessary result of endangering human life. This attribute is shared by only a few manufactured products, none of which is included in the list of products to which Restatement \u00a7 402A was intended to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The Court of Appeals was unequivocal in <em>Kelley </em>when it said, \u201cWe believe, however, that the risk-utility test is inapplicable to the present situation. This standard is only applied when something goes wrong with the product.\u201d As we have noted, none of the decisions which have emanated from the Court of Appeals construing <em>Kelley </em>has overturned or rejected its ultimate holding that \u201cthe risk-utility test cannot be ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tended to impose liab\u00f1ity on the maker or marketer of a handgun which has not malfunctioned.\u201d Although we think it almost too elemental to mention, when there has been a clear and unambiguous pronouncement issued by the Court of Appeals, we are bound to abide by that decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not believe that the Court of Appeals could have spoken with any greater clarity than it did in its decision in <em>Kelley. </em>Until and unless the Court of Appeals revisits the issue, we are bound by <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\n<em>MISUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellant has asserted that \u201cthe risk-utility test applies to a claim that the absence of a safety device renders a design defective.\u201d Notwithstanding that assertion, the firearm in question, more precisely, was not equipped with an \u201cexternal\u201d safety device, but did have a safety design to prevent it from discharging. The fatal event could have been prevented by the inability of the young victim to disengage the manual safety, use of the lockbox, proper storage of the weapon pursuant to the warnings provided, or proper supervision of the young child. Counsel for Garris acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>I\u2019m in no way trying to excuse Mr. Garris\u2019s actions. We are not. Mr. Garris was negligent in the way he stored this gun. Mr. Garris will suffer the consequence of that negligence for the rest of his life. He knows he was responsible for the death of his son.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Although negligence of the parent may not be imputed to the child, it is relevant on the question of whether the elder Garris misused what is undeniably a dangerous instrumentality-</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Thus, even were we to conclude that appellee\u2019s failure to include a child safety device on the handgun was a design defect, appellee would still be entitled to summary judgment because of his misuse of the gun. Comment h of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">A product is not in a defective condition when it is safe for normal handling and consumption. If the injury results from abnormal handling, as where a bottled beverage is knocked against a radiator to remove the cap, or from abnormal preparation for use, as where too much salt is added to food, or from abnormal consumption, as where a child eats too much candy and is made ill, the seller is not hable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The misuse doctrine is based on the same principle, because if a product \u201cis not unreasonably dangerous when used for a purpose and in a manner that is reasonably foreseeable, it simply is not defective, and the seller will not be liable.\u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>303 Md. at 596, 495 A.2d 348. Misuse therefore negates a design defect claim and it occurs when the product in question is used in a manner not reasonably foreseeable to the seller. <em>Id. </em>at 595-96, 495 A.2d 348; <em>see Simpson, </em>72 Md.App. at 206, 527 A.2d 1337. The \u201cforeseeability\u201d test, however, must be applied with caution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au9\">because, with the benefit of hindsight, any accident could be foreseeable. Without care, the imposition of strict products liability could result in a manufacturer\u2019s becoming an insurer for every injury that may result from its product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Simpson, </em>72 Md.App. at 206, 527 A.2d 1337 (citing <em>Phipps v.

The purchasers of the container stored it in the basement of their home, where they allowed two four-year-old children to play unsupervised. The children removed the cap from the container and spilled or poured gasoline onto the basement floor. When the resulting gasoline vapors ignited, one of the children died and the other was severely burned. The gasoline container had warnings written on two of its four sides reading \u201cKeep Out of Reach of Children\u201d and \u201cDo Not Store in Vehicle or Living Space.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 527 A.2d 1337. With respect to the issue of misuse, we said in <em>Simpson, id. </em>at 205-06, 527 A.2d 1337:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">In <em>Ellsworth, </em>the plaintiff was severely burned when the flannelette nightgown she was wearing ignited after she came in close proximity to a front burner on the electric stove in her kitchen. The plaintiff sued the seller and manufacturer of the nightgown on three grounds: strict liability, negligence, and breach of implied warranty of fitness. The verdicts were for the defense and the plaintiff appealed, claiming the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions on misuse of a product as a defense to the strict liability claim. The Court of Appeals eventually reversed the trial court, stating that there was insufficient evidence of misuse to generate an issue for the jury to consider but not before thoroughly discussing misuse and other defenses to strict liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">The Court pointed out that problems arise in understanding the issue of misuse because of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arp\">the absence of agreement as to the meaning of the word. Misuse has been defined as: a use not reasonably foreseeable ... a use of the product in a manner which defendant could not reasonably foresee ... a use of a product where it is handled in a way which the manufacturer could not have reasonably foreseen or expected in the normal and intended use of the product and the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>could foresee an injury as the result of the unintended use ... a use or handling so unusual that the average consumer could not reasonably expect the product to be designed and manufactured to withstand it-a use which the seller, therefore, need not anticipate and provide for ... use of the product which constitutes wilful or reckless misconduct or an invitation of injury. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>Ellsworth, </em>303 Md. at 594-595, 495 A.2d 348. The Court concluded that \u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d was the appropriate test. \u201c[T]hus a seller is required to provide a product that is not unreasonably dangerous when used for a purpose and in a manner that is reasonably foreseeable----[I]f the product is not unreasonably dangerous when used for a purpose and in a manner that is reasonably foreseeable, it simply is not defective, and the seller will not be liable.\u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>303 Md. at 596, 495 A.2d 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We ultimately held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">In this case, the [purchasers] stored the gasoline can in the basement of their home, ignoring the admonitions on the sides of the can not to store it in living areas. The [purchasers] stored the can in an area which allowed two unsupervised four-year-olds access to the can. The gasoline can was not being used for the purpose and in a manner that was reasonably foreseeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 527 A.2d 1337.

Ryobi America Corporation, </em>181 F.3d 608 (4th Cir.1999). There, the miter saw that the plaintiff was using had two blade guards shielding the saw blade. <em>Id. </em>at 609. Despite clear warnings both in the owner\u2019s manual and on the saw itself, the plaintiff removed the blade guards and continued to use the saw. About twenty minutes later, \u201cthe spinning saw blade flew off the saw\u201d and seriously injured the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 610. The trial court granted summary judgment as to his defective design claim and the Fourth Circuit affirmed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The <em>Hood </em>court stated that \u201cMaryland law imposes no duty to predict that a consumer will violate clear, easily understandable safety warnings____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612. It distinguished between warnings, such as those in <em>Simpson, </em>that guard against \u201caffirmative consumer misuse,\u201d and those that are \u201caimed simply at avoiding consumer carelessness,\u201d noting that the latter should not be-and in Maryland have not been-sufficient to defeat a defective design claim. <em>Id. </em>at 612 (citing <em>Klein, </em>92 Md.App. at 490-91, 608 A.2d 1276). The court found that the plaintiffs affirmative misuse of the product \u201cin violation of clear, unmistakable, and easy-to-follow warnings\u201d caused his injuries, and that this misuse \u201cdefeats any claim that the saw is defective in design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In the present case, the instruction manual provided by appellee stated, in relevant part, \u201cFirearms should always be stored securely and unloaded, away from children and careless adults\u201d and \u201cFirearms should be securely locked in racks or cabinets when not in use.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These warnings were not generalized, but were \u201cclear, unmistakable, and easy-to-follow.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 612. Moreover, had they been followed, the tragic accident in this case would not have occurred. <em>See Mazda Motor of America, Inc. v.

Instead, however, Garris stored the handgun under his mattress, evidently within reach of his son. There can be no debate that this was an affirmative action on Garris\u2019s part that clearly contravened the warnings contained in the instruction manual. Garris\u2019s improper storage of the handgun was misuse, thus defeating appellant\u2019s defective design claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Appellant contends that storing the handgun under the mattress was not misuse because it was reasonably foreseeable, pointing out that \u201cstudy after study has demonstrated that a significant proportion of gun owners do not lock up their guns ..., even when children are in the household.\u201d As noted above, however, these studies were not properly before the court on summary judgment. Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit stated in <em>Hood, </em>\u201cMaryland imposes no duty to predict that a consumer will violate clear, easily understandable safety warnings.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611. The presence of the warnings transforms the foreseeability inquiry; the proper question is, could appellee have reasonably foreseen that Garris would not use the lockbox provided or that he would commit acts in violation of the law or ignore clear warnings and instructions provided when he purchased the firearm? <em>See id. </em>In this case, we conclude as a matter of law that this behavior was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">.

Garris\u2019s affidavit disputes this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">. Appellant advanced two further legal arguments. First, she asserted that Garris's actions could not bar recovery because \"[t]he negligence of a parent may not be imputed to an infant....\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 10-910. Under this provision, a parent's negligence cannot preclude recovery by an infant unless it is an \"independent and superseding cause of the child's injuries.\u201d <em>Caroline v. Reicher, </em>269 Md. 125, 130, 304 A.2d 831 (1973). The relevant inquiry is \"whether what occurred reasonably was to have been anticipated as a result of ... the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 304 A.2d 831 (quoting <em>Farley v.

Standard Container Co., </em>72 Md.App. 199, 206, 527 A.2d 1337 (1987), so that actions constituting misuse are necessarily a superseding cause of the injury. Because we determine that Garris\u2019s actions constituted misuse as a matter of law, we do not reach this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Second, appellant argued that the warnings accompanying the gun were defective, a contention that has been abandoned on appeal. <em>See supra </em>note 2 and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">. The standard for reviewing an evidentiary determination made during a court\u2019s consideration of a summary judgment motion is unclear. <em>Compare Imbraguglio v.

Here, our holdings regarding Garris's affidavit and the purported photograph of the Smith &amp; Wesson handgun would be the same under either standard.

Appellant argues that the warnings were defective because they \"do not inform a consumer of the specific danger at issue here \u2014 the fact that young children are attracted to guns and can fire them, even at very young ages.\u201d An effective warning, however, need only warn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>user not to engage in the dangerous behavior; it need not inform the user of the consequences that may result from that behavior. <em>See Hood, </em>181 F.3d at 611 (finding that a specific warning that removing the blade guards would lead to blade detachment was unnecessary).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Dissenting opinion by SONNER, Judge, in which HOLLANDER, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Because I understand the majority\u2019s opinion to create a \u201cgun exception\u201d to Maryland strict products liability law, I respectfully dissent. The majority\u2019s opinion affirms the circuit court\u2019s decision to apply the <em>consumer expectation test, </em>and reject the <em>risk-utility test, </em>as the standard to determine whether the P89 pistol was defectively designed because of its failure to include a safety device. I believe the application of the consumer expectation test is flawed because it fails to recognize the evolution of the law from 1985, when the Court of Appeals decided <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985), to the present. The application of <em>current </em>Maryland strict products liability law reveals that the circuit court applied the incorrect standard to determine defective product design.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Maryland courts have applied the consumer expectation test in all strict products liability design defect claims, unless the product either malfunctions or the alleged design defect is a failure to include a safety device. Under those two very particular circumstances, a plaintiff is entitled to the application of the risk-utility test. The genesis of this rule can be traced to <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976), when the Court of Appeals adopted \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), and the consumer expectation test standard. The <em>Phipps </em>Court, however, stated that \u201cin some circumstances the question of whether a particular design is defective may depend upon a balancing of the utility of the design and other factors against the magnitude of the risk.\u201d <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 348, 363 A.2d 955. Although the <em>Phipps </em>Court gave no examples of the \u201csome circumstances\u201d when the risk-utility test is applicable, the Court of Appeals in <em>Kelley </em>did. The <em>Kelley </em>Court announced that the risk utility test</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">is inapplicable to the present situation. This standard is only applied when something goes wrong with the product. In <em>Barker [v. Lull Eng. Co., Inc., </em>20 Cal.3d 413, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443 (1978) ], an unbalanced machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>tipped over. In <em>Back v. Wickes Corp. </em>[375 Mass. 633, 378 N.E.2d 964 (Mass.1978) ], a motor home exploded, and in <em>Duke v. Gulf &amp; Western Mfg. Co. </em>[660 S.W.2d 404 (Mo.App. 1983) ], a power press caught the plaintiffs hands. These products malfunctioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 138, 497 A.2d 1143. Thus, after <em>Kelley, </em>the Maryland test for determining whether a product was defectively designed was the consumer expectation test, <em>unless the product malfunctioned. </em>The majority opinion in the instant case begins and ends its analysis of appellant\u2019s claim at this point. The majority\u2019s opinion entirely overlooks the last sixteen years of strict products liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Since the Court of Appeals decided <em>Kelley </em>and announced the first exception to the consumer expectation test, three noteworthy trends continue to question our defective product design standard. First, because of the continued legal criticism of the consumer expectation test, at least twenty-four states have adopted some form of the risk-utility test for determining strict products liability design defects. <em>See </em>John F. Vargo, <em>The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: The American Law Institute Adams a \u201cNew Cloth\u201d for Section lp02A Products Liability Design Defects </em>\u2014 A <em>Survey of the States Reveals a Different Weave, </em>26 U. Mem.L.Rev. 493 (1996). Second, the Restatement (Third) of Torts rejects the consumer expectation test as an independent standard for judging defectiveness of product designs. Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability, \u00a7 2, cmt. g (1998). Third, and most important, this Court, beginning in 1985, began to expand the \u201csome circumstances\u201d of <em>Phipps </em>to include, in addition to malfunction, <em>the absence of a safety device, </em>the very same claim made by appellant. <em>See Troja v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 101, 107, 488 A.2d 516, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 471, 494 A.2d 939 (1985); <em>C &amp; K Lord, Inc. v. Carter, </em>74 Md.App. 68, 86, 536 A.2d 699 (1988); <em>Valk Mfg. Co. v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 313, 537 A.2d 622 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d an other grounds, Montgomery County v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 562 A.2d 1246 (1989); <em>Ziegler v. Kawasaki Heavy Indus., Ltd., </em>74 Md.App. 613, 623, 539 A.2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 32, 542 A.2d 858 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(1988); <em>Klein v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>92 Md.App. 477, 486, 608 A.2d 1276, <em>cert. denied </em>328 Md. 447, 614 A.2d 973 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim is distinguishable from <em>Kelley </em>because, although the products are similar, the claim is different. The majority\u2019s opinion creates a \u201cgun exception\u201d to the line of cases, <em>decided after Kelley, </em>that created the second exception to the consumer expectation test. The majority apparently justifies this \u201cgun exception\u201d because of the overtly dangerous propensities of a handgun. I cannot subscribe to a strict products liability formula that assigns the least liability to the manufacturers of the most dangerous products. The majority\u2019s opinion freezes the technological advancements of handgun safety devices at 1985 levels. Handgun users and their children should not be deprived of the same standards of quality and safety afforded to users of <em>every other product, </em>because of this Court\u2019s reluctance to hold the appellee liable for the P89 pistol it placed within the stream of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s opinion unjustifiably removes from the trier of fact (1) the question of whether, under the risk-utility test, the incorporation of a safety device into the P89 pistol is a workable design option, (2) whether the storing of the P89 pistol under a mattress is reasonably foreseeable and therefore not a misuse of the product, and (3) whether the warnings or instructions provided by the appellees sufficiently warned against the reasonably foreseeable, yet unintended or incorrect use of the product. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Fenwick Motor Co., Inc. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 138, 265 A.2d 256 (1970), \u201c[e]ven where the underlying facts are undisputed, if those facts are susceptible to more than one permissible inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law, but should be submitted to the trier of fact.\u201d The balancing of the risk-utility test and the question of product misuse as an intervening and superseding cause should be determined by the trier of fact. I believe the proper disposition of the instant case should have been to vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
