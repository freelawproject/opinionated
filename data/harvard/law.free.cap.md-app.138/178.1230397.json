As to Jeannette\u2019s residence, Jones was found guilty of housebreaking. With regard to Michelle, he was convicted of robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon. The jury did not reach a verdict against Jones as to Johnson\u2019s murder, and those charges were subsequently nol prossed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On January 31, 1997, the trial court sentenced Jones to life without parole for Gulston\u2019s murder, and imposed consecutive sentences of twenty years each for the handgun offense and the armed robbery of Michelle. The other convictions were merged for sentencing purposes. In an unreported opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>authored by Judge Harrell, we affirmed Jones\u2019s convictions. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 817 (1998) <em>(\u201cJones I </em>\u201d). Jones did not seek certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">On November 12, 1998, Jones filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief (the \u201cPetition\u201d) pursuant to the Act, claiming numerous errors that constituted ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellate counsel, as well as trial court error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A primary issue concerned the admission at trial of an inculpatory written statement that Derrick Smith provided to police, which included an incriminating declaration attributed to Don Lowell Gutrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">After a hearing held on May 20, 1999, the court granted Jones\u2019s Petition on August 19, 1999, based on findings of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, as well as trial court error. Accordingly, the court granted Jones a new trial and a belated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Thereafter, the State filed an Application for Leave to Appeal, which was granted by Order dated April 12, 2000. On appeal, the State presents one issue for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">Did the post conviction court err in granting Jones a new trial and a new appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Appellee subsequently moved to strike a portion of the State\u2019s reply brief, claiming that the State belatedly raised an argument to support the admission of Gutrick\u2019s statement. We shall address the motion to strike, and the State\u2019s response to it, in the course of our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall neither affirm nor reverse the post-conviction court. Instead, we shall remand to the post-conviction court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">A. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">On July 16, 1993, sixteen-year-old Jamal Johnson and Gary Gulston, who was twenty-three years of age, were brutally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>murdered in Prince George\u2019s County. Johnson\u2019s body was found by Prince George\u2019s County Police Officer Etiene Jones, who responded at 1:54 p.m. to Michelle\u2019s apartment in District Heights, where she lived with her cousin, Gary Gulston. Johnson\u2019s body was on the floor of a bedroom, face down in a pool of blood, with a blanket nearby that contained bullet holes and powder burns. Ballistics analysis revealed that he had been shot in the back with a .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun, and in the head with a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">After speaking with Mi \u2018\u00bflie, the police proceeded to the single family home of Jeannette, the mother of Gary Gulston, who resided in Forestville. Gulston\u2019s body was found in the basement. He suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the back of his head. Although the police observed that the front door to the residence was ajar, there was no sign of forced entry. A washtub in the basement was found to contain Gutrick\u2019s fingerprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">We shall continue our factual summary by setting forth the \u201cFacts\u201d as summarized by the Court in <em>Jones I. </em>We will then supplement those facts with information pertinent to this appeal. In <em>Jones I, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">FACTS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">Michelle Gulston testified that on 16 July 1993 she was in her apartment at 6804 Alpine Street in District Heights, Maryland, with her son. On that day her cousin, Gary Gulston, who also lived in the apartment, received a page on his beeper. Ms. Gulston heard him respond in his return telephone call that he was on his way. Mr. Gulston then left the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">Ms. Gulston was in her bedroom watching television with her son when she heard Mr. Gulston return eight or ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>minutes later. Ms. Gulston overheard several people talking, then two men burst into her room yelling that it was a \u201cstick-up.\u201d Ms. Gulston testified that she did not see the men\u2019s faces clearly because her face was in a pillow and their faces were covered with hoods. The men tied her hands together with a phone cord, and then asked her for money. The men also asked questions about Mr. Gulston, including where he kept his money. She said that she did not know, and the men ransacked her room, taking keys and jewelry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Ms. Gulston heard other men in the living room asking Mr. Gulston questions about money and drugs. She heard Mr. Gulston say that there was money at his mother, Jeannette Gulston\u2019s, house, and that he knew how to disable the alarm at her house. The men took Mr. Gulston with them and left Ms. Gulston\u2019s apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">Before they left, the men put Jamal Johnson on the bed next to Ms. Gulston\u2019s son. Two men remained in the apartment while the others took Mr. Gulston to his mother\u2019s house. Fifteen to twenty minutes later, the men returned without Mr. Gulston. Ms. Gulston, whose hands were still restrained by a phone cord, heard someone come into the bedroom, take Mr. Johnson into the living room, turn up the volume on the television, and fire what sounded like two gunshots. Ms. Gulston could not see who fired the shots or how many people were in the apartment because she was still restrained in the bedroom. After the men left the apartment Ms. Gulston freed herself and called police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">After the incident, Mr. Gulston\u2019s car, which had been parked in front of the apartment, was found one block away. Ms. Gulston testified that the men had taken Mr. Gulston\u2019s car keys and her house keys when they left to go to Jeannette Gulston\u2019s house. In addition, a .25 caliber pistol belonging to Ms. Gulston was stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">When officers responded to 6804 Alpine Street, they found Mr. Johnson\u2019s body with bullet wounds to his back and to the back of his head. At trial, evidence showed that Mr. Johnson was killed by bullets from a .25 caliber pistol. Officers also recovered .25 caliber bullets and shell casings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>a scale, 179 grams of suspected crack cocaine, a shoe box containing plastic baggies and razor blades, a pager, and $2,500.00 cash from Ms. Gulston\u2019s apartment. Officers checked Mr. Gulston\u2019s car for fingerprints but did not recover any prints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Officers who responded to 6508 Cricket place, Jeannette Gulston\u2019s house, discovered Mr. Gulston\u2019s body in the basement. Mr. Gulston was lying on his stomach with a pillow over his head, concealing a gunshot wound to the head. At trial, the State introduced evidence that the bullet recovered from Mr. Gulston\u2019s body was fired from a .9mm pistol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Jeannette Gulston testified regarding the condition of her house. She was out of town at the time of the shooting and returned to find her house ransacked and her previously locked safe unlocked. The contents of the safe, including certificates of deposit, $10,000.00 in savings bonds, and approximately $4,000.00 in cash, were missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">On 2 August 1993, at approximately 7:00 p.m., appellant was arrested after officers stopped the car in which he was a passenger. Appellant was acting strangely; one officer testified that appellant seemed \u201cvery hyper.\u201d Officers took appellant to the police station and placed him in an interview room. Detective Kenneth O\u2019Berry read appellant his rights and had appellant sign a waiver form. Appellant wrote on the form that he had used POP and weed (marijuana). Shortly thereafter, Detective Brian Hickey called Detective O\u2019Berry, who had been questioning appellant, out of the interview room and told him that his supervisor wanted to stop questioning appellant until he slept off the effects of the PCP. Detective O\u2019Berry testified that appellant became loud and boisterous several times while in the interview room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">Detective Andrew Rostich testified that he,was in the interview room next to appellant\u2019s the night of 2 August 1993. Detective Rostich heard appellant causing several disturbances. At one point, the detective removed all the chairs in appellant\u2019s interview room because appellant had been throwing them around. Later, at approximately 2:15 a.m. on 3 August, Detective Rostich hear [sic] another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>disturbance. He discovered appellant trying to climb into the ceiling panels from the table in the interview room. The detective pulled appellant down from the table. As he was falling, appellant hit his head on the table, thereby injuring his left eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">Detective Hickey testified that at 4:00 a.m. on 3 August 1993, he returned to the interview room with some food for appellant. Appellant stated that he wanted to sleep. Detective Hickey noticed that appellant\u2019s left eye was red and swollen. Although appellant refused medical treatment the detective took him to the hospital. When appellant returned to the police station from the hospital at approximately 6:45 a.m., Detective Hickey stated that appellant appeared calm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">Detective Richard Delabrer testified that at 7:30 a.m. he entered the interview room to talk to appellant. Detective Delabrer stated that he knew appellant from past cases and had a good rapport with him. The detective read appellant his rights. Appellant indicated that he understood his rights and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Appellant gave a statement implicating himself in the murders of Gary Gulston and Jamal Johnson and the robberies of Michelle Gulston and Jeannette Gulston. Detective Delabrer testified that appellant wrote a statement, then the detective asked appellant a series of questions, and had appellant \"write down his answers. Appellant reviewed the statement and signed it. The statement was completed by approximately 2:00 p.m. on 3 August 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">Derrick Smith, a convicted co-defendant in the case, testified that he made a statement to police regarding the night of 16 July 1993. Mr. Smith, however, denied participation in the murders and testified that the police coerced him into giving a statement implicating himself and appellant. Nevertheless, Mr. Smith\u2019s statement was admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Jones I, </em>slip op. at 2-6 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">On the evening of August 2, 1993, Jones was arrested in connection with the murders. At the time of his arrest, Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>was apparently under the influence of PCP, and was later taken to an area hospital for an eye injury. Several hours after Jones\u2019s arrest, when the effects of the PCP had evidently worn off, he gave a written statement to the police. Prior to trial, Jones unsuccessfully moved to suppress that statement. In connection with the suppression motion, Jones was represented by William H. Murphy, Jr. and Joseph Niland, the Public Defender for Prince George\u2019s County. At trial, Jones was represented only by Niland.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Detective Richard Delabrer testified at Jones\u2019s trial concerning Jones\u2019s statement to police, which was introduced in evidence. The statement provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">A few weeks ago I was over this girl named T\u2019s house getting high talking when all of a sudden don [sic] [Gutrick] called me back to the bedroom and asked me was I trying to get some quick money so I said yes then he told me that we were going to rob some dude named Gary [Gulston. S]o me, Don [Gutrick], Jason [Pinkney] and Derrick [Smith] waited until the next morning and went to hill top apartments and parked[.][s]o me and Don went in some woods waiting for [G]ary while Jason and Derrick was in the car, and [G]ary pulled up and went in the house[. S]o me and Don went to get Jason and Derrick but by [the] time we got back to his building he was leaving so we waited in his building until he came back and when he came back we took him into the apartment and laid everyone down and asked wheres [sic] the money and drugs and [G]ary told us it was over his mothers [sic] house but he said he would have to take us there because there was a[sic] alarm on the door [s]o me and Don took him there and found a safe and four thousand[. S]o Don kept on saying this aint [sic] all the money and [G]ary [kept] on saying its [sic] some more but I dont [sic] know where its [sic] at because my brother hid it and Don thought he was lying and went and got a pillow and we is about to kill you and I told Don no let\u2019s take him back and call his brother and Don said no give me the gun[.] I\u2019ll do it[J Just put the pillow over his head[. S]o I did it and Don shot him once in the head[. S]o we left and went back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to hilltop and I told Don 111 [sic] get the car ready while he go get them and when he upstairs I heard two shots and they came running out to the car and we went over to Jasons [sic] house in Seat Pleasant and split the money 4 ways and Derrick had a 25 that he got.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Jones also said that Gutrick had a .45 caliber weapon, and Smith found a .25 caliber gun in the apartment. Jones added that he wore a hood over his face while in the apartment. Moreover, he denied that he participated in the shooting of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">By the time of Jones\u2019s trial, Derrick Smith had already been convicted. Accordingly, the State called Smith as a witness at Jones\u2019s trial. The following colloquy at the outset of Smith\u2019s testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Smith, where are you presently residing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">[SMITH]: Prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">[SMITH]: Prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Department of Corrections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">[SMITH]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you have previously been convicted in this case; is that correct, Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\">[SMITH]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">When the State questioned Smith about the events in issue, he unexpectedly denied knowledge of or participation in the murders, to the surprise of both the prosecutor and Jones\u2019s defense counsel. Consequently, the prosecutor referred Smith to the written statement that he provided to Detective Rostich after his arrest, which was eventually admitted in evidence. We shall discuss, <em>infra, </em>the circumstances culminating in its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">According to Smith\u2019s statement, the robbery had been planned the day before it occurred, and the group arrived at Gulston\u2019s apartment in appellant\u2019s car. Smith recounted that Gutrick and appellant were the ones who first approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Gulston outside the apartment. Further, Smith admitted in his statement that he shot Johnson, because \u201che seen everybody [sic] face.\u201d Additionally, Smith wrote, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">Me and Don [Gutriek], T.J. [i.e., appellant], and Jason meet [sic] over Tee\u2019s house and then Don called T.J. in the back room. * * * *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> So we went to Gary [sic] house and robbed him. We was looking for some drugs and money. But there was no money there so Don and T.J. left the apartment with Gary and they did not come back with him. So me and Jason was waiting for them to come back. So went [sic] they came back Don came up stairs and said are you ready to go and we said yes, but before we left we asked him did they get anything and he said yes so we rolled. And then we went over Jason\u2019s house to count the money. We counted about 5000 dollar [sic] and we all got about 1100 dollars a peace [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The following portion of Smith\u2019s statement is central to this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">[DETECTIVE ROSITCH]: Did Don [Gutriek] or T.J. [i.e., appellant] say anything when they came back [to Michelle\u2019s residence]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">[SMITH]: When Don came back upstairs Jason asked him where the other person was at and <em>he said we </em>[i.e. Gutriek and appellant] <em>killed him </em>[i.e., Gulston].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">After Jones\u2019s trial, he filed an appeal to this Court, and was represented by Leonard L. Long, Jr. Long raised three issues: the denial of Jones\u2019s motion to suppress, the sufficiency of evidence, and the adequacy of the State\u2019s Notice of Intention to Seek Life Without Parole. We affirmed in <em>Jones I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">As to the suppression motion, Long raised several grounds to support his claim that the trial court erred in denying the motion. Following a thorough consideration of the contentions, the Court concluded that the \u201ctrial court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>denied\u201d the suppression motion. Moreover, in finding the evidence sufficient, we recognized the importance of Smith\u2019s statement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\"><em>Although Michelle Gulston was not able to identify the robbers, and no fingerprints were recovered from the crime scenes, appellant\u2019s statement and Mr. Smith\u2019s statement corroborate Ms. Gulston\u2019s testimony </em>and provide sufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant kidnapped Gary Gulston, robbed Michelle Gulston, and broke into Jeannette Gulston\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">Furthermore, as to appellant\u2019s use of a handgun, in his statement he admits that he had a gun, which he handed to Don so that Don could kill Gary Gulston while appellant held a pillow over his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">Finally, as to the question of whether Gary Gulston was killed while in the process of committing a felony, we find ample evidence that Gary Gulston was killed during the commission of his kidnapping and robbery with a deadly weapon. Appellant claims that because Don killed Mr. Gulston after the robbery, it was an independent and separate act. Appellant\u2019s argument has no merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">Finally, we note that although a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was a principal offender in the robberies and murder, appellant\u2019s convictions could also stem from his participation as an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><em>Jones I, </em>slip op. at 24-25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">B. Post-Conviction Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">On November 12, 1998, Jones filed the underlying Petition, which he supplemented on May 7, 1999, asserting numerous grounds to support his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and prejudicial errors by the trial court. On May 20, 1999, the court held an evidentiary hearing, at which Jones was represented by Fred Warren Bennett. Murphy, Niland, and Long, Jones\u2019s prior attorneys, all testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In questioning Niland, Bennett focused on various portions of Smith\u2019s trial testimony. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARA\">[BENNETT]: Is there any tactic or strategy that you can relate to the Court at this time as to why you would not have objected to a prior conviction of a severed co-defendant for the same crime for which the defendant was on trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1b7\">[NILAND]: Well, I think at the time I thought that this man, Smith, admitting that he was convicted of both of these homicides tended to reenforce my theory that alienated the defendant from these homicides or alienated the defendant from participation in these homicides and so I didn\u2019t think it was harmful. I thought it was probably \u2014 I think my thinking at the time \u2014 well, there were a number of things caught up in all of this. Smith surprised me by not testifying. I had been informed before this trial started \u25a0that both Smith and Gulston [sic] were going to testify against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">[BENNETT]: Derrick Smith and Don Gulston?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY9\">[NILAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">[BENNETT]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">[NILAND]: And of course I was prepared to \u2014 I assume they were going to testify in the most unfavorable possible ways that I could imagine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">[BENNETT]: Now, let me stop you there. Such as implicating the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">[NILAND]: Yeah. I was there and saw the defendant and saw the defendant participate in killing this guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">[BENNETT]: Now, you said a minute or so ago one of the reasons you may not have objected is the fact that he admitted, that is, Derrick Smith for being convicted of the same crime that the defendant was on trial might give some distance between the defendant and Derrick Smith, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>[NILAND]: Yes, and conclusions you might reach about who really were the killers in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Bennett then inquired about Smith\u2019s written statement to police, and Niland\u2019s failure to object to the hearsay within hearsay portion of Smith\u2019s statement, in which Smith quoted Gutrick as saying \u201cwe killed him.\u201d The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">[BENNETT]: All right. Now, so far we\u2019ve identified from the transcript that your objection was based on you did not want a written statement to go in front of the jury, correct? That\u2019s as far as we got so far?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">[NILAND]: I think I objected because I didn\u2019t want any of the statement to go in front of the jury. <em>I don\u2019t know that I ever was given an opportunity to go into whether the statement conformed to admissibility based on the rule. I don\u2019t even know if he let me get into that. </em>The judge \u2014 I started on this statement. I did say what you said which is if you\u2019re going to let any of this in it should be testimonial. It shouldn\u2019t be the document itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">[NILAND]: You\u2019re characterizing it by saying that my objection was limited to me \u2014 to the written part not coming in as opposed to me indicating that it\u2019s OK to leave, to have the \u2014 I think that was a secondary objection I made. <em>I think I objected to the statement coming in. </em>And then when I saw the writing on the wall, that is that the statement was coming in, I tried to get my half a yard instead of my whole yard, and I asked for him not to let the written part in. So I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s all I did. Now, you\u2019re right. <em>In retrospect you have shown me some things in the statement that I could have specifically objected </em>to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">[BENNETT]: And that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to next.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\"><em>[NILAND]: </em>\u2014 and <em>I didn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t think that means I didn\u2019t object to this whole statement coming.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">[BENNETT]: I agree that you clearly objected to the statement coming in. You\u2019re saying that was a fall back. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Your first objection was the statement shouldn\u2019t come in at all, but if it does, it should be in a Q and A form and not in the document itself; is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">[NILAND]: Yes, that\u2019s a fair statement, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The following testimony is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">[BENNETT]: <em>Would you not agree that that statement was a direct out-of-court statement implicating the defendant in the crime for which he was ultimately convicted?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am0\">[NILAND]: Yes, <em>it was.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">[BENNETT]: Now, you were aware, were you not, of the <em>Nance </em>case at the time of this trial, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">[NILAND]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-11\">[BENNETT]: And were you aware in footnote nine in the <em>Nance </em>decision where it says \u201cassuming that a prior inconsistent statement can come in, you have a separate objection to a line-by-line statement to portions of the prior inconsistent statements that are hearsay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">[NILAND]: To tell you \u2014 I can only say that I had probably by that time read <em>Nance </em>a dozen times, reviewed it, given seminars on it, discussed it, considered various ramifications of <em>Nance </em>because it was a problem in the defense case at the time. Now, it\u2019s maybe a problem in the State\u2019s case. But the \u2014 I guess the bottom line answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">I think that the case indicates that if there is extraneous hearsay that the whole thing is based upon hearsay, the whole statement is hearsay. But if there is extraneous or as you say second-hand hearsay or double hearsay or triple hearsay, then that\u2019s objectionable because it loses the reliability of being subject to cross[-]examination of the person who it\u2019s being attributed to on the part of the defendant. So yes \u2014 and that would fall \u2014 this would fall clearly into that category. No question about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-14\">[BENNETT]: Now, you\u2019ve testified a few minutes earlier that your goal is to keep this out generally. You objected. First, don\u2019t let it in under <em>Nance </em>and don\u2019t let in the written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>statement. So your goal at trial was to keep the statement out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">[NILAND]: My goal \u2014 when it came up at trial, <em>this wasn\u2019t part of my pretrial preparation because I didn\u2019t think it would happen. But once it happened my goal was to keep it out if I could.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">[BENNETT]: <em>That would include a goal of keeping out a portion of the statement that would be multiple hearsay had you recognized it, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">[NILAND]: <em>I would think so, especially this piece of hearsay.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[BENNETT]: So is it fair to say that it was an oversight on your part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">[BENNETT]: It was an oversight on your part in not recognizing the last question on page six to be multiple hearsay, i.e., [fit\u2019s multiple hearsay, Your Honor. It doesn\u2019t qualify even under\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">[NILAND]: <em>I can\u2019t attribute it to anything other than an oversight on my part </em>that I wouldn\u2019t have objected to that on that basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">[BENNETT]: Is it also accurate to say evidence against the defendant at trial consisted generally \u2014 that is, the harmful evidence at trial of his statement and the statement of Derrick Smith. They had no fingerprints, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aub\">[NILAND]: No, I don\u2019t think so. <em>I don\u2019t think there was any kind of physical evidence that tied the defendant to either one of the homicides </em>that I can recall, not that I can recall. So yeah, his statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">[BENNETT]: And the [Smith] statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">[NILAND]: And this <em>statement </em>\u2014 frankly, <em>overall I didn\u2019t consider this statement as particularly harmful. </em>I mean, I guess I was looking at it in its totality at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">Appellee\u2019s attorney also inquired as to why Niland did not refer the trial court to the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>v. Matusky, </em>343 Md. 467, 682 A.2d 694 (1996). The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">[BENNETT]: ... From what we\u2019ve gone over so far, you did not object to the document, that is, the physical document or a Q and A on the basis that it was hearsay since it included portions that were not contrary to the penal interests of Derrick Smith, didn\u2019t you? That was based on the <em>Matusky </em>case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">[NILAND]: Right. I didn\u2019t raise that, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">[NILAND]: I\u2019m certain I was aware of the <em>Matusky </em>case by the time this case came to trial. Now, did I consciously analyze this statement in light of the <em>Matusky </em>opinion? I can\u2019t say I did, but I might have considered it. But I don\u2019t have any recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">[BENNETT]: Now, would there be any trial tactic or strategy involved not to object based on a recent Court of Appeals case <em>[.Matusky </em>] that would be favorable to your client that you\u2019re aware of since you were trying to keep it out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">[NILAND]: Well, I think you would have to ask me about any particular thing that\u2019s in here before I can answer that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">With respect to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel, the question of hearsay within hearsay was also examined. In response to the State\u2019s inquiry to Long about his preparation for the appeal, Long said: \u201cI read the transcript, the suppression hearing transcripts as well as the trial transcripts, researched and reviewed relevant case law, visited Mr. Jones, had a conversation with Mr. Jones and prepared the appeal.\u201d Long also stated that, with regard to Smith\u2019s statement, he \u201chad no basis to raise [the issue of Gutrick\u2019s assertion] as an issue on appeal.\u201d On cross-examination, however, Long indicated that he did not recall whether he ever reviewed Smith\u2019s statement, and he conceded that he did not speak with Niland before preparing the appeal. The following testimony is noteworthy with regard to Bennett\u2019s inquiry as to why Long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>failed to raise on appeal the issue of Gutrick\u2019s assertion, which was contained within Smith\u2019s statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">[BENNETT]: And ... I take it from your not mentioning it, you did not review the State exhibits that were introduced into evidence at trial, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">[LONG]: I don\u2019t recall whether I did or I didn\u2019t____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">[BENNETT]: To the extent that evidence was introduced that wasn\u2019t read into the record verbatim in a question and answer form in the statement, you would have to see \u2014 in order to see the contents of that exhibit, you would have to review the exhibit; is that right, Mr. Long?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">[LONG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">[BENNETT]: Now, I\u2019m showing you Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 6 for purposes of this hearing. This is a statement of Derrick Smith. This was introduced into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 50 at trial. <em>You indicated on direct that you did not raise as an issue on appeal anything in regard to the statement of Derrick Smith; is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">[LONG]: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">[BENNETT]: You said you didn\u2019t do so because after review of the motions hearing and the trial transcript <em>you found that there was no merit to that issue, correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akh\">[LONG]: <em>Yes, in my understanding of the law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adf\">[BENNETT]: Your understanding of the law. How could you make a determination that there was no merit to the question of the admissibility into evidence as a physical exhibit, the statement in toto without having reviewed the substance of the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">[LONG]: I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t review it. I said I don\u2019t recall reviewing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">[BENNETT]: But on direct you were asked what you did and it did not include reviewing the exhibits and talking to the trial attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-15\">[LONG]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>[BENNETT]: And the best you said is you don\u2019t recall; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">[LONG]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">[BENNETT]: Sir, in reaching that determination that the issue had no merit, that is, the question of the admissibility of the Derrick Smith statement, are you basing that on a Maryland evidence rule or case law or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">[LONG]: Maryland evidence rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">[BENNETT]: Is that the rule dealing with the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements that is codified after the <em>Nance </em>case, <em>Nance </em>versus State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">[LONG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">[BENNETT]: Sir, ... [a]re you aware in <em>Nance </em>that even if [a] portion of the statement came in a portion may not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlD\">[LONG]: Yes. And I was satisfied that the portion that came in did not contain any opinions or conclusions of the declarant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">[BENNETT]: <em>Sir, the redacted version according to the record which has been introduced never took out that portion [of Smith\u2019s statement containing Gutrick\u2019s assertion.] That statement with that Q and A that I just read to you came in front of the jury. Are you aware of that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfE\">[LONG]: <em>No, I\u2019m not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">[BENNETT]: Had you been aware of it, that would have been a basis to raise on an appeal, wasn\u2019t it? That is, the statement contained inadmissable hearsay and, therefore, the Court\u2019s ruling in its entirety was not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">[LONG]: I\u2019m not prepared to say that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">[BENNETT]: Hypothetically, had you been aware of that statement and the fact that it directly referred to him by a person who wasn\u2019t on the stand, i.e. Don, and aware of footnote nine in <em>Nance, </em>you would have raised that on appeal, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>[LONG]: I can\u2019t say that I would and I can\u2019t say that I would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">[BENNETT]: And the reason you can\u2019t say that, is it not fair to say, sir, is because you didn\u2019t review the statement, you didn\u2019t review the exhibit and you didn\u2019t talk to Joe Niland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">[LONG]: <em>Well, I didn\u2019t review [Smith\u2019s] statement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au1\">[BENNETT]: Didn\u2019t review the statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">[LONG]: I don\u2019t have any recollection of reviewing the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[BENNETT]: Wouldn\u2019t you say, sir, that in fairness to Mr. Jones as part of a duty as an appellate attorney, that if a statement comes in that implicates your client, that would be something to see if you can raise that on appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3B\">[LONG]: <em>My own understanding of when it came in is that it did not implicate my client.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">(Emphasis added). Long conceded that his failure to raise the hearsay within hearsay issue amounted to a \u201cpossible\u201d oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">On August 19, 1999, the post-conviction court issued a written opinion and order, amended on August 25, 1999. Relying on <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the court granted Jones\u2019s Petition, based on ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, as well as error by the trial court. With regard to ineffective assistance of counsel, the court found various errors that amounted to deficient performance, and concluded that the errors \u201cdid result in prejudice to the defendant.\u201d The post-conviction court also found prejudicial error by the trial judge in failing to redact Gutrick\u2019s hearsay within hearsay assertion from Smith\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Although Jones asserted numerous errors with respect to the performance of his trial counsel, the court below essentially found Niland ineffective for two reasons. First, the court found that Niland failed to object to the evidence of Smith\u2019s conviction arising from the same case. Second, the court found that \u201cdefense counsel probably should have objected\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the admission of Smith\u2019s statement to police, in which Smith claimed that Gutrick said, \u201cwe killed him.\u201d Elsewhere in its opinion, the court said that Niland \u201cdid object to [Smith\u2019s] entire statement,\u201d but \u201cdid not specifically object\u201d to Gutrick\u2019s comment. The post-conviction court also determined that the \u201ccumulative\u201d effect of trial counsel\u2019s errors amounted to ineffective assistance, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">With the benefit of hindsight, the Court agrees with [Jones] that certain mistakes were made ... Counsel\u2019s trial performance, although generally excellent, did fall below a standard of reasonableness when he failed to object to the admission of the multiple hearsay statement. This, when combined with the cumulative effects of the other, more minor mistakes did result in prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">With respect to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Petitioner argues that there are three things that an appellate attorney should do, as a matter of course: 1) review the transcripts, 2) review the trial exhibits, and 3) confer with tr[ia]l counsel---- Appellate counsel ... testified that after reading the transcripts, he did not see a basis for raising the issue of the inadmissibility of the redacted statement of Derrick Smith. Appellate counsel admitted that he did not review the exhibits, and did not speak to trial counsel---- The Court agrees that appellate counsel was deficient, said deficiency excuses Petitioner\u2019s failure to raise allegations on direct appeal, and that, at a minimum, Petitioner is entitled to a new appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">The post-conviction court granted relief under the Act based on its finding that Jones received ineffective assistance from his trial and appellate attorneys. The right to effective assistance of counsel in a criminal trial is guaranteed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). <em>Strickland </em>is regarded as \u201c[t]he fountainhead\u201d in post-conviction claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Gross, </em>134 Md.App. 528, 550, 760 A.2d 725 (2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>362 Md. 623, 766 A.2d 147 (2001). The \u201cbenchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court established the applicable standard to determine whether the legal representation afforded to a defendant comports with the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 389-394, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). To assess the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s representation under the Sixth Amendment, the <em>Strickland </em>Court created a two-pronged test, consisting of a \u201cperformance component\u201d and a \u201cprejudice component.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993); <em>Nix v. Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986). A reviewing court \u201cneed not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Maryland has consistently applied the <em>Strickland </em>test in deciding whether counsel has rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance. <em>See, e.g., Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 310, 768 A.2d 656 (2001); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>352 Md. 580, 602-05, 724 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 832, 120 S.Ct. 90, 145 L.Ed.2d 76 (1999); <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>L.Ed.2d 681 (1997); <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>331 Md. 651, 665-66, 629 A.2d 685 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1077, 114 S.Ct. 891, 127 L.Ed.2d 84 (1994); <em>Williams v. State, </em>326 Md. 367, 373, 605 A.2d 103 (1992); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 170-73, 599 A.2d 1171 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 917, 113 S.Ct. 2359, 124 L.Ed.2d 266 (1993). Under <em>Strickland, </em>we must focus on whether counsel\u2019s errors were so \u201cserious as to deprive [Jones] of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 393 n. 17, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>Lockhart, </em>506 U.S. at 369, 113 S.Ct. 838; <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284, 681 A.2d 30; <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 427 (1990). Thus, the defendant must demonstrate that defense counsel\u2019s errors were of such a magnitude that his lawyer was \u201cnot functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">To establish that trial counsel\u2019s representation \u201cwas so deficient as to undermine the adversarial process,\u201d <em>Gross, </em>134 Md.App. at 551, 760 A.2d 725, a defendant must show that: (1) under the circumstances, counsel\u2019s acts resulted from unreasonable professional judgment, meaning that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) that the defendant was prejudiced, because \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 391; <em>Lockhart, </em>506 U.S. at 369, 113 S.Ct. 838; <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 80, 741 A.2d 1162 (1999). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To be sure, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case,\u201d and \u201c[e]ven the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Thus, the review \u201cmust be highly deferential,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d as measured by \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In that calculation, a defendant \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201cevery effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Cirincione v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 471, 492, 705 A.2d 96, <em>cert. denied, </em>350 Md. 275, 711 A.2d 868 (1998). Accordingly, under <em>Strickland, </em>a reviewing court must consider defense counsel\u2019s performance \u201cas of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As we noted, defense counsel\u2019s deficient performance is not enough to entitle a defendant to relief. <em>Strickland </em>also requires the defendant to establish actual prejudice caused by the deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Redman, </em>363 Md. at 309-10, 768 A.2d 656. In other words, even if counsel made \u201ca professionally unreasonable\u201d error, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, this alone does \u201cnot warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding [unless] the error had [an] effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, prejudice is rarely presumed. Ordinarily, the defendant must prove that actual prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Redman, </em>363 Md. at 311-12, 768 A.2d 656; <em>see United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 662, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">To establish the requisite degree of prejudice in Maryland, the defendant must demonstrate \u201ca substantial possibility that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. But, \u201ca defendant need not show that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Nor must \u201cthe prejudicial effect\u201d satisfy \u201ca preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>326 Md. at 375, 605 A.2d 103. As we said in <em>State v. Purvey, </em>129 Md.App. 1, 10, 740 A.2d 54 (1999), the focus is not merely on the effect of error on the \u201coutcome.\u201d Rather, a \u201c\u2018proper analysis of prejudice\u2019\u201d includes consideration of \u201c \u2018whether the result ... was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is also bound by the <em>Strickland </em>standard. <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000); <em>Gross, </em>134 Md.App. at 556, 760 A.2d 725. Nevertheless, as this Court observed in <em>Gross, </em>\u201c[although the basic principles enunciated by <em>Strickland </em>remain the same, whether applied to a trial performance or an appellate performance, the juridical events to which those principles apply obviously differ somewhat depending on the operational level being scrutinized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 760 A.2d 725. For example, in <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983), the Supreme Court emphasized \u201cthe importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752, 103 S.Ct. 3308. Similarly, in <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>477 U.S. 527, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986), the Supreme Court underscored as \u201cthe hallmark of effective appellate advocacy\u201d the role of appellate counsel in \u201c \u2018winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on\u2019 those more likely to prevail____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 106 S.Ct. 2661 (quoting <em>Barnes, </em>463 U.S. at 751-52, 103 S.Ct. 3308).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The standard of review of the lower court\u2019s determinations regarding issues of effective assistance of counsel \u201cis a mixed question of law and fact----\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see Gross, </em>134 Md.App. at 559-60, 760 A.2d 725. We \u201cwill not disturb the factual findings of the post-conviction court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 348, 768 A.2d 675 (2001). But, a reviewing court must make an independent analysis to determine the \u201cultimate mixed question of law and fact, namely, was there a violation of a constitutional right as claimed.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 699, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985). In other words, the appellate court must exercise its own independent judgment as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice, if any. <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 285, 681 A.2d 30. As we said in <em>State v. Purvey, </em>129 Md.App. 1, 10, 740 A.2d 54 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 483, 745 A.2d 437 (2000): \u201cWithin the <em>Strickland </em>framework, we will evaluate anew the findings of the lower court as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice suffered.... As a question of whether a constitutional right has been violated, we make our own independent analysis by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See Cirincione, </em>119 Md.App. at 485, 705 A.2d 96 (stating that \u201cwe will defer to the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of historical fact, absent clear error,\u201d but \u201cwe [will] make our own, independent analysis of the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The post-conviction court found that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to damaging evidence of Smith\u2019s conviction in the same underlying case. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Smith, where are you presently residing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">[SMITH]: Prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: And you have previously been convicted in this case; is that correct, Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[SMITH]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In <em>Clemmons v. State, </em>352 Md. 49, 55, 720 A.2d 1170 (1998), the Court of Appeals said that, ordinarily, \u201cthe conviction or guilty plea of a co-perpetrator may not be used as substantive evidence of another\u2019s guilt.\u201d Although there are exceptions to the general rule, these have been \u201cnarrowly confined to situations where the evidence has a special relevance presented by the circumstances ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 720 A.2d 1170. Subsequently, in <em>Casey v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 331, 722 A.2d 385 (1999), we determined that the admission of a co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea constituted reversible error; the \u201cState is not entitled to present evidence of an alleged co-conspirator\u2019s guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 722 A.2d 385. This is because such evidence might be misused by a jury and could contribute \u201cto the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Carr v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 209, 211, 437 A.2d 238 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Relying on <em>Casey, </em>the court below found that \u201cthe State improperly offered the fact of [Smith\u2019s] conviction, and that it was not harmless error. Defense counsel should have objected.\u201d The State disagrees, contending that Niland\u2019s failure to object constituted reasonable trial strategy, rather than a constitutionally defective performance. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Although the State elicited that Smith was convicted in the same underlying case for which Jones was on trial, Smith did not offer direct testimony implicating Jones. Additionally, although Smith\u2019s statement to police was admitted in evidence after he unexpectedly recanted, Smith insisted in his testimony that the police fabricated portions of the statement and that he lied as to other portions. In any event, Smith\u2019s guilt did not necessarily mean that appellant was also one of the murderers.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">It is also noteworthy that, at trial, the defense conceded that Jones was involved in the robbery of Gulston, but denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>he was a participant in either murder. In his opening statement to the jury, Jones\u2019s attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">[B]ut the involvement of Thomas Jones in this robbery ceased before any killing took place in this case totally unconnected to the carrying out of force that was exerted during the robbery by Mr. Gutrick. And in the case of Mr. Jamal Johnson, Thomas Jones was not even present when Mr. Johnson was killed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Further, defense counsel asserted to the jury: \u201c[Y]ou may well find him guilty of some offenses in this case including robbery or possibly kidnapping, but you cannot find him guilty of either of these murders.\u201d Similarly, in closing, Jones\u2019s lawyer argued that the robbery of Gulston was over before the killing occurred, Gutrick killed both men, and \u201cThomas Jones did not kill anybody in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In his post-conviction testimony, Niland was unwavering that he had evaluated the evidence of Smith\u2019s conviction and considered it helpful to his effort to concede involvement in the robbery, but to separate Jones from the two homicides. As Niland stated, his strategy was to \u201cdistance him, Thomas Jones, as much as I could from these other hoodlums.\u201d At the hearing, Niland explained his strategy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Well, I think at the time I thought that this man, Smith, admitting that he was convicted of both of these homicides tended to reenforce my theory that alienated the defendant from these homicides or alienated the defendant from participation in these homicides and so I didn\u2019t think it was harmful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We are satisfied that Niland\u2019s performance represented a reasonable trial strategy. Based on defense counsel\u2019s strategy, appellant was not tainted by Smith\u2019s conviction, because appellant admitted some degree of culpability, but contended that he was not involved in the murders. Therefore, in this respect, defense counsel\u2019s representation was not constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Jones complained to the post-conviction court that Niland\u2019s performance was deficient because he did not object to the admission of Gutrick\u2019s incriminating hearsay statement (\u201cwe killed him\u201d), contained within the written hearsay statement of Smith. He argued that Gutrick\u2019s remark constituted inadmissible hearsay within hearsay. The post-conviction court found that Niland \u201cprobably should have objected\u201d to the statement. The court also said that Niland had objected to \u201cthe entire statement,\u201d but did not \u201cspecifically object to the above statement.\u201d Further, it determined that Smith\u2019s statement contained \u201cmultiple hearsay,\u201d and that trial counsel\u2019s performance \u201cdid fall below a standard of reasonableness when he failed to object to the admission of the multiple hearsay statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The State maintains that Niland did, in fact, object to the admission of Smith\u2019s entire written statement, and therefore the post-conviction court was clearly erroneous in finding to the contrary. According to the State, if Niland objected, his performance was not deficient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to the merits, the State seems to contend that, even if Niland failed to object, he was not ineffective, because Smith\u2019s entire statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under the rationale of <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), and Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Rule 5-802.1(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, in the State\u2019s reply brief, it asserts for the first time that Gutrick\u2019s statement was admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, codified in Md. Rule 5-803(a). That rule provides that a \u201cstatement by a co-conspirator of the party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d is not excluded by the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We begin by exploring the threshold question of whether Niland objected to the admission of Gutrick\u2019s comment, contained within Smith\u2019s statement. Because of the State\u2019s contention that Niland objected, we must review in detail the events that culminated in the admission of Smith\u2019s written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">As we noted earlier, the prosecutor first questioned Smith about his statement (State\u2019s Exhibit 50) only after Smith surprised both the State and the defense by denying knowledge of the murders. Although Smith acknowledged his hand writing and his signature, he claimed at trial that the statement was coerced by the police. At the bench, the prosecutor then offered Smith\u2019s statement in evidence. Niland responded: \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re a ways from that yet.\u201d A lengthy discussion ensued, at which the State argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Smith had already authenticated the document. Niland observed that Smith denied the truth of the content of his written statement, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">He hasn\u2019t been asked any questions about any purported admission made to him by the defendant or perhaps more importantly any observation that he made with respect to the defendant that\u2019s contained in this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">I think the only things that would be admissible from the statement, if any of it was admissible ... is it either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>admissible hearsay exception to the hearsay [sic] or I believe in this statement there\u2019s someplace where he says he was involved with others with regard to one of these shootings and that \u2014 and then the only thing, only other thing, he says I think is that the' defendant, he may have some observations that he actually personally made with regard to the defendant that wouldn\u2019t ordinarily be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">So I think the next thing that has to happen here is that there be an isolation and a denial on his part or refusal on his part with regard to admissible areas of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The court essentially agreed with the defense. The judge said to the prosecutor: \u201cYou\u2019re offering [the statement] en mass and I\u2019m rejecting [it] en mass.\u201d \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Thereafter, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>undertook a review of Smith\u2019s statement to determine whether there was any need for redaction. Although neither the State nor the defense made any suggestions or requests to the court, the judge concluded that the following portion of Smith\u2019s statement constituted inadmissible \u201chearsay within hearsay\u201d: \u201cSo Don [Gutrick] told TJ [i.e., appellant] about some guy named Gary [Gulston] that he [i.e., Gutrick] had robbed before.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other than that statement, the court indicated that \u201cthe rest of the statement certainly would be admissible....\u201d Nevertheless, in an obvious attempt to exercise care and caution, the trial court asked Niland his \u201cposition\u201d about the rest of the statement. Niland responded: \u201cIf the witness wrote this, then I don\u2019t have any objection to the contents of it period.\u201d Niland added that he wanted \u201cto clarify\u201d and \u201cmake sure\u201d that Smith actually wrote the text of the statement, as well as the questions and answers that were included in the statement. Subsequently, Niland asked the court to redact an exchange between Smith and the detective. According to the transcript, it read: \u201c[Question]: Did TJ and Don say what happened when they were gone? [Answer]: That they left him [i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Gulston] over his mother\u2019s.\u201d The court readily agreed to Niland\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Thereafter, the court again invited counsel to identify any other concerns, stating: \u201cNow let\u2019s deal with any other issues you wish to deal with.\u201d Niland responded: <em>\u201cThe document itself should not be admitted. The contents, if you\u2019re going to admit, should be read to the jury </em>.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Niland explained his con\u00e9erns, stating that if the document itself were admitted the jury might place \u201cgreater weight\u201d on it, because it is a document. Niland did not voice any objection to the admission of the <em>content </em>of the statement, however. The court opted to defer ruling until after the voir dire of Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Out of the jury\u2019s presence, Smith was questioned about his role in providing the statement. Smith acknowledged that, with respect to the question and answer portion, he wrote the answers that appeared in the statement, but he claimed that the answers to the questions and the content of his statement were inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The court then raised the matter of Niland\u2019s earlier request that the statement, if admissible, \u201cshould only be read, but not physically admitted.\u201d Niland then renewed his request that the court only permit the prosecutor to read the statement, but bar the State from \u201cphysically\u201d admitting the document. He explained: \u201cYou\u2019re giving a lot greater emphasis by giving a prior statement he made and the opportunity for [the jurors] to read it and re-read it and put more emphasis on it than by simply reading it to them and placing it in evidence, and I think this is ... very important. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a technical issue I\u2019m raising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The State disagreed. When the State then offered Smith\u2019s redacted statement, Niland objected only \u201c[o]n the grounds previously stated.\u201d The judge reserved ruling and, at the bench, told the State that it had \u201cto explore a little further an evidentiary basis to show there is an inconsistency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In his trial testimony, Smith maintained that he did not participate in the murders and was not a witness to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>occurred. He also denied talking to Jones about the matter. When the State again offered Smith\u2019s statement into evidence, the court said it would rule \u201cafter cross.\u201d On cross-examination, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">[NILAND]: Your testimony now is that you did not participate in either one of these shootings that took place at Alpine Street and Cricket Place that is the subject of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">[SMITH]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">[NILAND]: And you\u2019re the same Derrick Smith who was convicted in a trial by jury of both those murders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">[NILAND]: Well, how is it that on December the 2nd, 1993, when the police took this statement from- you that you were able to tell them all these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">[SMITH]: They forced me to write a statement. They told me what to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">[NILAND]: <em>The last question on page 6 says, \u201cDid Don or TJ say anything when they came back?\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\"><em>The answer says, \u2018When Don came back upstairs Jason asked him where the other person was at and he said we killed him. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">See that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-15\">[NILAND]: That\u2019s in your writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-16\">[SMITH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-17\">[NILAND]: <em>Did the policeman tell you to write that?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqR\">[SMITH]: <em>No, I heard that somewhere.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-18\">[NILAND]: You heard that somewhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-19\">[SMITH]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-20\">[NILAND]: <em>You heard that Don had killed the guy?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>[SMITH]: <em>Yeah.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">On redirect examination, Smith insisted that the police had tried to \u201cframe\u201d him. He also claimed that the police dictated half his statement and he fabricated the other half. Thus, Smith maintained that the content of the statement was not true, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201d Later, the judge said to the prosecutor: \u201cYou have offered [the statement], I\u2019ll reserve ruling. We\u2019ll discuss it at a later time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">After the State recalled Detective Rostich, who took Smith\u2019s statement, the State again offered Smith\u2019s written statement into evidence. Before Niland uttered any objection, the court instructed counsel to approach the bench, and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">[THE COURT]: Other than the objection you have placed on the record do you have any additional objections? Any reasons why we should not receive [the written statement]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">[THE COURT]: Objection is overruled. [The statement] is admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">The foregoing exchanges clearly demonstrate that the trial judge asked defense counsel on several occasions to identify any objectionable portions of Smith\u2019s statement, with an eye toward redaction, and even alerted Niland to a concern about \u201chearsay within hearsay.\u201d Moreover, while questioning Smith, Niland actually highlighted Gutrick\u2019s comment, because he specifically asked Smith about it. Most important, contrary to the State\u2019s contention, Niland did <em>not </em>object to the portion of Smith\u2019s statement containing Gutrick\u2019s assertion, nor did Niland generally object to the admission of the <em>content </em>of Smith\u2019s statement. Instead, Niland made a specific and limited challenge to the physical admission of Smith\u2019s statement, and expressly advanced as his sole reason his concern that it would receive undue weight from the jury because it was a document.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>It is well established that a party opposing the admission of evidence \u201cshall\u201d object \u201cat the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d Md. Rule 4-323(a); <em>see Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 545, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999); <em>Hill v.

A proper objection is required so that the proponent of the evidence has an opportunity to \u201crephrase the question or proffer so as to remove any objectionable defects, if possible.\u201d <em>Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 389, 705 A.2d 50 (1998). A timely objection also enables the trial court to attempt to cure any error, which helps to avoid unnecessary appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 705 A.2d 50. Thus, an appellate court may review the admissibility of evidence only when an objection is properly made. <em>Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 545, 735 A.2d 1061; <em>Conyers v.

Rather, the only issue preserved for appellate review on direct appeal concerned the physical admission of Smith\u2019s written statement. Nevertheless, if Smith\u2019s entire statement was properly admitted, as the State maintains, then Niland\u2019s failure to object would not amount to deficient performance. We turn to explore that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Smith\u2019s statement was unmistakably hearsay under Md. Rule 5-801(c) and Maryland case law. It was a \u201cstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Ali v. State, supra, </em>314 Md. at 304, 550 A.2d 925; <em>see Tyler v. State, </em>342 Md. 766, 773, 679 A.2d 1127 (1996). Moreover, in Smith\u2019s hearsay statement, he referred to Gutrick\u2019s out-of-court statement, which incriminated Jones. Therefore, Gutrick\u2019s statement constituted hearsay within hearsay. The question, then, is whether Smith\u2019s entire statement was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-802. Put another way, the question is whether a timely objection by defense counsel would have had merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In its opening brief, the State devoted about one page to this issue. It summarily argued that the \u201ccontested hearsay [i.e. Gutrick\u2019s statement] was part of\u2019 Smith\u2019s statement, and that Smith\u2019s entire statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement under <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), and Md. Rule 5-802.1(a), because Smith recanted, his statement was reduced to writing and signed by him, and he was present at trial and subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In propounding that argument, however, the State never sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>stantively addressed the matter of Gutriek\u2019s hearsay within hearsay statement, apart from citing Rule 5-805. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arv\">Rule 5-805. Hearsay within hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">If one or more hearsay statements are contained within another hearsay statement, each must fall within an exception to the hearsay rule in order not to be excluded by that rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The landmark case of <em>Nance v. State, supra, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633, was decided in August 1993, about one month after the murders in this case, but more than three years before the trial. There, the Court of Appeals \u201ccarved out an important exception to the general rule against the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 237, 674 A.2d 944 (1996). The <em>Nance </em>Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the factual portion of a witness\u2019s prior signed statement is admissible at trial as substantive evidence when inconsistent with the witness\u2019s in-court testimony, as long as the witness is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 570-71, 629 A.2d 633; <em>see Tyler, </em>342 Md. at 775, 679 A.2d 1127; <em>Stewart, </em>342 Md. at 237, 674 A.2d 944; <em>Makell v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 334, 339, 656 A.2d 348 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Nance and Hardy were convicted of murder and, on appeal, the Court considered various evidentiary issues that arose because of three \u201cturncoat\u201d witnesses who recanted at trial \u201cby disavowing\u201d their prior statements or by lapses of memory. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 656 A.2d 348. In that context, the Court addressed the admissibility, as substantive evidence, of signed statements given to police, grand jury testimony, and out-of-court identifications, all provided by witnesses who had implicated the defendants prior to trial but then repudiated their statements at trial. We focus here on the discussion concerning the signed statements given to police. '</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In <em>Nance, </em>the statements to the police were in the form of questions and answers, in which the witnesses identified the defendants as the assailants in the context of \u201clarger descriptions of what happened____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 629 A.2d 633. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Court observed that a prior statement of a witness is inconsistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony if repudiated either by \u201cpositive contradictions\u201d or \u201cclaimed lapses of memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 5. Although the Court acknowledged that the prior statements given by the witnesses to the police were hearsay, the Court determined that they were admissible as substantive evidence, stating: \u201cWe hold that the factual portion of an inconsistent out-of-court statement is sufficiently trustworthy to be offered as substantive evidence of guilt when the statement is based on the declarant\u2019s own knowledge of the facts, is reduced to writing and signed or otherwise adopted by him, and he is subject to cross-examination at the trial where the prior statement is introduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 629 A.2d 633 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Of particular significance here, the Court clarified in a footnote that it had not sanctioned a blanket admission of a prior inconsistent statement. The Court admonished that the prior statement \u201cmay contain inadmissible opinions or conclusions of the witness, or <em>hearsay, </em>in addition to a recitation of the facts about which the witness claimed first-hand knowledge.\u201d <em>Id., </em>n. 9. In that circumstance, the Court cautioned that the \u201cinadmissible portions of the statement should be redacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s admonition guides us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) codifies the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Nance. </em>It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">Rule 5-802.1. Hearsay exceptions \u2014 Prior statements by witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">(a) A statement that is inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement was (1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Applying <em>Nance </em>and Md. Rule 5-802.1, it is apparent that even if Smith\u2019s signed statement to police was substantively admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, the State could not introduce through Smith\u2019s statement what it could not have elicited from Smith had he cooperated in his te\u00e1timony on the witness stand. In other words, if Smith could not have testified in court to what Gutrick said, neither could his statement be used to do it for him. As the Court said in <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL-\">A fundamental principle of the law of evidence is that inadmissible evidence does not become admissible simply by being clothed within evidence that is admissible. The rule that applies to hearsay within hearsay is a prime example____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 813-14, 724 A.2d 111 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Because <em>Nance </em>was decided more than three years before trial, defense counsel certainly should have been aware of its content, particularly in light of its importance to the development of the law in this State. Therefore, with respect to trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the multiple hearsay within Smith\u2019s statement, we agree with the court below that Niland\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Under <em>Strickland, </em>of course, deficient performance does not give rise to a presumption of prejudice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Therefore, Jones had to demonstrate prejudice; he had to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s unreasonable errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. That issue was only summarily addressed by the post-conviction court, and requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The State asserts that, in light of the \u201coverwhelming evidence of Jones\u2019s guilt,\u201d defense counsel\u2019s performance in regard to the hearsay statement \u201cdid not impact on the outcome of Jones\u2019s trial.\u201d In its reply brief, the State adds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>that, even if defense counsel could have precluded the admission of Gutriek\u2019s remark, the rest of Smith\u2019s statement was admissible and \u201cimplicated Jones in the robbery, and thus, the felony murder.... It also served to corroborate the version of events contained in Jones\u2019s statement to police.\u201d In characterizing the State\u2019s case as \u201coverwhelming\u201d, the State points to the following: Jones\u2019s statement, in which he admitted placing a pillow over Gulston\u2019s head while Gutrick shot Gulston; Michelle\u2019s eyewitness account of the robbery, although she was unable to identify anyone; and \u201cphysical evidence corroborating\u201d the statements of Jones and Smith. We reject the State\u2019s characterization of the strength of its case. Moreover, in the context of this case, we are of the view that if Gutrick\u2019s hearsay statement was inadmissable, then its admission in evidence \u201c \u2018so upset the adversarial balance between the defense and prosecution that the trial was unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 87, 741 A.2d 1162 (citations omitted). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The case was certainly a close one with respect to appellant\u2019s guilt in the felony murder of Gulston. Jones\u2019s defense was, in essence, an acknowledgment of his participation in a robbery; he claimed, however, that his involvement in the crime ended prior to Gulston\u2019s murder. In opening statement, Jones\u2019s lawyer said: \u201c[T]he defense in this case contends that there was a robbery ... of Mr. Gulston of his drug money and possibly some of his drugs, that there was a kidnaping of Mr. Gulston, but the involvement of Thomas Jones in this robbery ceased before any killing took place.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">No physical or forensic evidence ever linked Jones to Gulston\u2019s murder or established his presence at Jeannette\u2019s home at the relevant time. To the contrary, as the Court noted in <em>Jones I, </em>appellant was tied to the murder of Gulston based primarily on two critical pieces of evidence: his own statement <em>and </em>Smith\u2019s statement. Although Smith\u2019s statement to police was a central part of the State\u2019s case against Jones, Smith never said in his statement that <em>he </em>knew who killed Gutrick, or even the circumstances of the murder. Rather, the evidence showed that at the time of Gulston\u2019s murder, Smith was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>at Michelle\u2019s residence, guarding her and Johnson, while Jones and Gutrick were at Jeannette\u2019s home with Gulston. Consequently, Smith had no personal knowledge of what happened at Jeannette\u2019s home. Nevertheless, Smith included in his statement a damaging admission attributed to Gutrick: \u201cwe killed him.\u201d In context, Gutrick meant that he and Jones killed Gulston. Absent that portion of Smith\u2019s statement, the jury would have been left only with Jones\u2019s confession, along with corroboration of other aspects of the crimes, but no corroboration directly linking Jones to the felony murder of Gulston.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor relied on both Smith\u2019s statement and Jones\u2019s statement. The prosecutor explained Smith\u2019s reluctance to testify by saying that \u201cpersons that testify in the courtroom such as this against another defendant are not favorably regarded in the Department of Corrections, but nonetheless you will have his statement and you can consider that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">To be sure, Jones could have been convicted on the basis of his confession. But, it was not so impregnable as to diffuse an erroneous admission of Gutrick\u2019s assertion. Again, we explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As our factual summary revealed, prior to trial Jones unsuccessfully sought to suppress his confession. At trial, however, the issue of voluntariness remained a matter for the jury to resolve. The detectives recounted that, in the period following Jones\u2019s arrest, he was under the influence of PCP, and therefore the detectives did not question him immediately, because they wanted to \u201callow the effects of the PCP to wear off.\u201d Because of the drugs, they described Jones as \u201cagitated,\u201d \u201cincoherent,\u201d \u201cboisterous,\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d and, at other times, \u201clucid.\u201d At one point, Jones tried to escape and was eventually taken to the hospital. When he was finally interviewed by police the next morning, he did not appear to the detectives to be under the influence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Jones\u2019s lawyer objected to the admission of Jones\u2019s confession at trial, based on \u201cthe prior litigation concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>statement.\u201d Although the judge overruled the objection, the question of voluntariness was not specious, and the jury was specifically instructed to consider the matter. In its instructions to the jury, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">Evidence has been introduced that the defendant made a statement to the police about the crime charged. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was freely and voluntarily made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">A voluntary statement is one that under all the circumstances was given freely. To be voluntary it must not have been compelled or obtained as a result of any force, promises, threats, inducements, or offers of reward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">In deciding whether the statement was voluntary, consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement including the conversations, if any, between the police and the defendant, whether the defendant was warned of his rights, the length of time that the defendant was questioned, who was present, the mental and physical condition of the defendant, whether the defendant was subjected to force or threat of force by the police, the age, background experience, education, character and intelligence of the defendant, whether the defendant was taken before a District Court Commissioner without unnecessary delay following arrest and, if not, whether that affected the voluntariness of the statement, any other circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In our view, the admission of Smith\u2019s entire statement was prejudicial, as defined by the Supreme Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals. Under the circumstances attendant here, Gutrick\u2019s comment, included in Smith\u2019s statement, may well have been a decisive factor in persuading the jury to conclude that Jones\u2019s confession was both voluntary and accurate. Conversely, without Gutrick\u2019s comment, the jury might have reached a different conclusion as to the reliability, accuracy, or voluntariness of Jones\u2019s confession. Although the evidence of Jones\u2019s guilt surely was legally sufficient to warrant submission of the case to the jury, and a jury may well have been persuaded of Jones\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>doubt, based on his confession alone, we would hardly characterize such a case as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We recognize that in <em>Jones I </em>the Court said that even if Smith was not a witness to the murder of Gulston, he could be found liable as an accomplice. That remains as true now as it was then. But, that potentiality does not obviate the palpable prejudice here. As we see it, there is a substantial possibility that, if the hearsay within hearsay portion of Smith\u2019s statement was inadmissible, and had not been admitted, the outcome as to the verdict for Gulston\u2019s murder might have been consistent with the verdict concerning Johnson\u2019s murder. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 353, 768 A.2d 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We agree with the court below that defense counsel generally provided excellent legal representation. But, we must analyze the occasional lapses that occur in the heat of battle. If Gutrick\u2019s assertion was erroneously admitted as part of Smith\u2019s statement to police, it was prejudicial to Jones, because it provided an important piece of corroborating evidence that the jury undoubtedly could consider to convict Jones of Gulston\u2019s murder. Therefore, unless Smith\u2019s statement was admissible in its entirety, Jones was surely prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Gutrick\u2019s hearsay within hearsay comment contained in Smith\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Based on our conclusion that the double hearsay was not admissible under <em>Nance </em>or Md. Rule 5-802.1(a), we next explore the State\u2019s contention that Gutrick\u2019s assertion was admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. In this regard, we must also consider Jones\u2019s motion to strike the State\u2019s reply brief, the State\u2019s opposition to that motion, as well as the State\u2019s Motion to Reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">When the State advanced the co-conspirator exception in its reply brief, Jones was prompted to file a motion to strike. He vigorously urged us to find waiver with respect to the State\u2019s belated contention, because the State never raised the co-conspirator argument at the post-conviction hearing or in its opening brief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In its initial brief, the State argued only that Smith\u2019s hearsay statement was admissible under <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633, and Md. Rule 5-802.1(a), Although the State opposed appellee\u2019s motion to strike, it did not dispute that it failed to present in its opening brief the issue of the co-conspirator exception. Nor did the State offer any reason for its failure to raise the issue until the reply brief. Instead, the State urged us to overlook its omission, claiming the State merely amplified in its reply brief<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> an argument that it previously presented to the post-conviction court, and which it included in its Application for Leave to Appeal (the \u201cApplication\u201d), filed on September 17, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In support of the State\u2019s position that the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule was raised below, it refers us to two pages from the transcript of those proceedings. The following excerpt appears on the pages cited by the State, and is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[THE STATE]: I see no prejudice from any of the ... acts by Mr. Niland. I think there was ample evidence for conviction here, and Mr. Niland did a heck of a job, and I would submit that any \u2014 the case, the statement by Mr. Jones, the defendant, went up on appeal____ It was a good statement, and that was the agency, and that statement you know, convicted him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>And if he had kept out the statement by ... Mr. Smith[, Jones] still would have been convicted, because the one statement and all the other corroborating evidence ... [THE COURT]: Does what you say fly in the face of <em>Carr [v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 209, 437 A.2d 238 (1981) ], which was the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[THE STATE]: <em>Carr </em>has some qualifications to it, Your Honor. It indicates that if the State can prove that it was harmless or the evidence was cumulative, then the State can prevail. <em>Carr </em>\u2014 it\u2019s qualified, it\u2019s a qualified case, and it was a conspiracy case also. The difference is this; in a conspiracy case you have to conspire with somebody, and if one person is convicted of conspiracy, then normally the jury will say, well, if he\u2019s been convicted of conspiracy he must have conspired with everybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">It\u2019s logical to conclude that the defendant is guilty, but that\u2019s not true____ <em>[TJkis is not a conspiracy </em>case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">As we see it, the foregoing colloquy does not even remotely establish that the State presented the issue of the co-conspirator exception at the post-conviction hearing. Moreover, it is equally clear that the post-conviction court never addressed the issue. It is true, however, that, in its Application, the State argued that Gutrick\u2019s statement was admissible under the co-conspirator exception. There, the State asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">It is clear from the context of this statement and the other evidence presented at trial that Donald Gutrick\u2019s remark to Derrick Smith was made before the criminal enterprise that started at 6804 Alpine St. was over ... The remark was clearly admissible as a statement of a coconspirator made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Nevertheless, the State has not referred us to any authority that suggests it may preserve an issue for appellate review merely by including it in an Application. In our view, the State\u2019s reference to the co-conspirator exception in its Application is not an adequate substitute for the State\u2019s failure to raise the argument below or in its opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>We are left with several unassailable facts. The State did not raise the co-conspirator hearsay exception at the post-conviction hearing and, as a result, the post-conviction court did not address the merits of that argument. Moreover, the State did not raise the issue in its opening brief with this Court. Rather, it was raised for the first time in the State\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Ordinarily, if an argument is not raised at trial or in proceedings below, it is not preserved for appellate review. Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(a); <em>See, e.g., Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 692, 759 A.2d 764 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 864, 148 L.Ed.2d 776 (2001) (recognizing that appellant waived appellate review of jury instruction because appellant \u201cnever objected to the instruction\u201d); <em>Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 148, 729 A.2d 910 (acknowledging that Maryland Rule 8-131(a) limits appellate review to those issues \u201c \u2018raised in or decided by the trial court\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Walker v.

Maryland Rule 4-325(e) expressly confers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>discretion on an appellate court, acting \u201con its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party [to] take cognizance of any plain error in the [jury] instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\u201d The same concept applies with respect to \u201c \u2018errors of law generally....\u2019 \u201d <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 587, 602 A.2d 677 (1992) (citation omitted). But, even if we were inclined, in our discretion, to overlook the State\u2019s failure to raise the co-conspirator exception at the post-conviction hearing, we would expect the State to raise the issue in its opening brief.

Land Bank, </em>43 Md.App. at 459, 406 A.2d 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Purvey, supra, </em>129 Md.App. 1, 740 A.2d 54, does not support its position. There, the State appealed a decision granting post-conviction relief. In reviewing the issue regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we considered whether to address certain matters raised by the State in its <em>opening </em>brief, which the appellee claimed were not preserved for appeal because they were not raised during post-conviction proceedings. The Court determined that the \u201cnew\u201d arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>were not really new; they were merely an expansion or \u201cfleshing-out ... of the skeletal theories\u201d that had been raised below. <em>Id. </em>at 12, 740 A.2d 54. In contrast to this case, the <em>Purvey </em>Court was satisfied that, on appeal, the State had merely amplified an argument that had been previously raised. Significantly, even if the State in <em>Purvey </em>had asserted a new argument on appeal, it clearly did so in its <em>opening </em>brief, not in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Based on all of the foregoing, in our initial opinion we granted appellee\u2019s motion to strike that portion of the State\u2019s reply brief concerning the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, and declined to address the admissibility of Gutrick\u2019s statement on that basis. In doing so, however, we made clear that, in the event of a re-trial of Jones, our ruling was without prejudice to the State\u2019s right to assert the co-conspirator hearsay exception as a basis to support the admission in evidence of Gutrick\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">After we filed our initial opinion, the State submitted its Motion to Reconsider, contending that we erred in failing to consider the co-conspirator exception. It also propounded yet another new argument, claiming, in effect, that its belated argument was not waivable, because the issue is whether defense counsel was or was not ineffective, regardless of whether the State proposes a valid basis to justify defense counsel\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The State asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">[I]n the context of appellate review of post conviction claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, a deficiency in the pleadings does not foreclose this Court\u2019s consideration of the constitutional issues raised by the claims of error. This is so because, in the ease of claimed failure on the part of trial counsel to object to certain evidence, if there is any theory of admissibility supporting admission of the evidence, then counsel\u2019s failure to object to that evidence cannot be deemed prejudicial under the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington. </em>This Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>stating \u201cwe decline to discuss the issue\u201d of the co-conspirator\u2019s exception to the rule against hearsay (Slip op. at 28). This Court\u2019s failure to conduct the analysis, based on the timing of the State\u2019s argument, does not comport with the required constitutional analysis, which requires resolution of the question whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In his response to the Motion to Reconsider, Jones characterizes the State\u2019s argument as \u201coutrageously hypocritical.\u201d He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">There is no sound legal or policy basis for applying one set of appellate rules to post-conviction cases and other principles to all other cases. Essentially, the State is asking that it be forgiven and exempted for its errors in this case and presents an inane argument seeking an exception to the general waiver rules. This Court should reject the State\u2019s arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">Defendants in all courts are routinely punished for procedural defaults, particularly in the setting of post-conviction and habeas corpus litigation with the State early and often pushing such arguments. Largely, any default attributed to a defendant is the result of an error by his or her attorney. In this case, the procedural default is due to the errors of the attorneys for the State. No exception for the State\u2019s error and its seeking of a double standard is warranted in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Although the State has acknowledged that, on direct appeal, a party\u2019s failure to argue a specific theory \u201cwill ordinarily constitute waiver,\u201d <em>see Klauenberg, </em>355 Md. at 552, 735 A.2d 1061, it seems to suggest that the same standard does not apply in a post-conviction appeal by the State. In its view, the dispositive question is whether the defense lawyer was constitutionally ineffective, regardless of whether the State has asserted a viable ground to establish the adequacy of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>counsel\u2019s performance. As we construe the State\u2019s position, it maintains that even if it did not timely offer a valid reason to show that defense counsel was not ineffective, an appellate court has an independent obligation to determine whether the defense attorney\u2019s performance was, in fact, constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In our view, the logical extension of the State\u2019s position is that there are no time constraints that apply with respect to a claim by the State that defense counsel was not constitutionally ineffective. If the State is permitted to raise a new but valid argument for the first time in its reply brief, or in a motion to reconsider after an appellate ruling is issued, then it could also raise an argument for the first time long after the Court has ruled. Moreover, applying the State\u2019s reasoning, it would be incumbent upon the Court to consider the possible universe of reasons justifying a lawyer\u2019s strategy or course of action, even if the State never raises such a point. In the extreme, the State\u2019s position means that its failure to justify defense counsel\u2019s representation is virtually irrelevant, because it is incumbent on the appellate court to determine whether there is any basis to sustain the representation afforded by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The State has not referred us to any legal authority to support its contention that the rules and practices that generally apply with respect to waiver, or that govern the content of reply briefs, do not apply to the State in the circumstances of this case. Our effort to uncover relevant cases that might shed light on this issue leads us to conclude that the State is, indeed, held to the same rules of practice and procedure as other litigants. Even in the face of an appellate reversal of a conviction, the State can be found to have waived or abandoned an argument that might have led to the affirmance of that conviction if the appropriate argument had been timely made. It follows that the State is wrong in suggesting that we cannot find waiver under the circumstances attendant here. On the other hand, as we noted, an appellate court generally has discretion to consider an argument that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>neither preserved nor presented, and logically that discretion would extend to an argument that is belatedly raised. <em>Cf. Rubin v. State, supra, </em>325 Md. at 587, 602 A.2d 677; Md. Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">In <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981), the Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider whether, under the Fourth Amendment, a law enforcement officer may lawfully conduct a warrantless search \u201cfor the subject of an arrest warrant in the home of a third party....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 101 S.Ct. 1642. The Court observed that, at prior proceedings, the government had acquiesced to statements that the defendant\u2019s residence had been searched; belatedly, it advanced an expectation of privacy issue two years later. Because the government argued for the first time in the Supreme Court that the record did not show that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the house that was searched, <em>id. </em>at 208, 101 S.Ct. 1642, the Supreme Court expressly declined to consider that contention. It recognized that the government \u201cmay lose its right to raise factual issues of this sort before this Court when ... it has failed to raise such question in a timely fashion during the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 101 S.Ct. 1642. Thus, the Court said: \u201cWe conclude ... that the government, through its assertions, concessions, and acquiescence, has lost its right to challenge petitioner\u2019s assertion that he possessed a legitimate expectation of privacy in the searched home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 101 S.Ct. 1642.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Rose v. United States, </em>629 A.2d 526 (D.C.1993), is also noteworthy. There, on direct appeal, the defendant challenged his drug conviction, claiming the trial court erred in upholding on exigency grounds a warrantless entry into the apartment of the defendant\u2019s relatives. The government argued only that the defendant lacked standing to object to the warrantless entry. Because the panel majority concluded that the defendant had standing, the court reversed the conviction. In doing so, it declined to consider the validity of the search based on arguments previously raised by the government at the trial level, including consent and exigency, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>determined that the government abandoned those contentions on appeal. In its view, the government made a \u201ctactical\u201d decision, <em>id. </em>at 534, \u201cto rest its argument in support of the trial court\u2019s ruling solely\u201d on the defendant\u2019s lack of \u201cstanding to object to the officers\u2019 warrantless entry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 530, and conceded that suppression was appropriate if the defendant had standing. <em>Id. </em>at 532. The court saw no reason to \u201csecond-guess the government\u2019s appellate strategy by invoking and examining, <em>sua sponte, </em>various arguments the government\u201d did not make, or to question its decision not \u201cto advocate what it perceives to be losing arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We consider particularly illuminating the court\u2019s discussion of whether to address on its own the validity of the trial court\u2019s finding of exigency as a basis to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision. The court initially distinguished the situation before it from those cases in which the government confesses error; in the latter situation, the court indicated that the public interest requires the appellate court to undertake a review of the case in order to- be satisfied of the error. That practice reflects that the court is the \u201cinstitution performing the evaluative function that announces the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533 n. 17. But, when the government confesses error,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYH\">there is a kind of role reversal. The prosecutor or the defense counsel, relying on his or her responsibility as an officer of the court, expresses an opinion of a kind that ordinarily would be made by a judge, whereas the appellate court, acting on its responsibility to be sure counsel has not defaulted, acts to assure that the rights of the government or the defendant, as the case may be, are duly respected, a function ordinarily performed by counsel. The policy justifying this approach is the belief that the prosecutor or defense lawyer should not completely give up the government\u2019s or the client\u2019s cause \u2014 which that lawyer should be advocating \u2014 -without a judicial check on such behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In contrast to the confession of error situation, however, the court observed that the government in the case before it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cvigorously argued for affirmance,\u201d relying only on standing, a point that it had \u201cselected\u201d and believed was \u201cbest suited to achieve that end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the government \u201cassumed its traditional role of advocate\u201d, the court determined that \u201cthe adversary system should be allowed to function as such; the court no longer is needed ... to act as an institutional failsafe to make sure that the government has not compromised its prosecutorial responsibility.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In the court\u2019s view, if it were \u201cto scrutinize\u201d whether the government was doing its job \u201cwell enough\u201d, the court would come \u201cperilously close to exercising an executive branch function. .. inconsistent with the neutrality expected of the judiciary in our adversary system of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535. Therefore, the court declined to assume \u201cthe role ordinarily assigned\u201d to the prosecutor. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court only reviewed the single argument presented by the government, reasoning that \u201c[i]t is a basic principle of appellate jurisprudence that points not urged on appeal are deemed to be waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Of particular significance here, the court expressly said that the waiver principle \u201capplies to the government no less than to the defendant in a criminal case,\u201d even if \u201cthe waived point\u201d would have led to a different result. <em>Id. </em>at 536. As the court explained, the \u201cpublic is entitled to have valid judgments of conviction sustained,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 537, but the public is also generally \u201cbound by the actions of its counsel, just as a criminal defendant normally is. That is how the adversary system works.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. <em>But see id. </em>at 540, 542 (Wagner, J., dissenting) (claiming appellate court must not \u201cignore applicable precedents which determine the validity of the trial court\u2019s ruling even if overlooked by the parties,\u201d because \u201cit would be an abdication of [court\u2019s] responsibility to reverse a correct ruling;\u201d even if counsel did not identify all legal arguments, appellate court is \u201cnot precluded from supplementing the contention of counsel <em>through </em>[its] <em>own </em>deliberation and research.\u201d) (emphasis in dissent) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\"><em>United States v. Giovannetti, </em>928 F.2d 225 (7th Cir.1991), is also quite helpful, because the government claimed that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>belated argument was \u201cnonwaivable.\u201d There, the government filed a motion for rehearing after the appellate court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction. In that motion, the government argued harmless error for the first time, contending that harmless error is \u201cnonwaivable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. In a per curiam opinion, a panel of the Seventh Circuit (Posner, Ripple, and Manion, J.J.), found the government\u2019s \u201cnonwaivable\u201d contention \u201cnovel and interesting____\u201d Moreover, the court considered the government\u2019s position, in effect, as a claim that even if it had not timely argued harmless error, the court, before reversing, \u201cmust search the record \u2014 without any help from the parties \u2014 to determine if the errors\u201d found by the court are prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>The court disagreed, noting that the government offered no authority for that proposition. The court recognized that such a view \u201cwould place a heavy burden on the reviewing court, deprived as it would be of the guidance of the parties on the question whether particular errors were harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it would invite \u201csalami tactics,\u201d <em>id., </em>because the government could pursue one position in its brief and, if that failed, contend later \u201cthat it should win anyway because the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201charmless-error arguments can be waived.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The reasoning of the court in <em>Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171 (D.C.Cir.1983), is also useful, although it is a civil case. There, an important constitutional issue was presented, but the D.C. Circuit (Scalia, J.) declined to consider the issue, because \u201cit was not adequately briefed or argued on appeal .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172. What the court said is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">We will not resolve that issue on the basis of briefing and argument by counsel which literally consisted of no more than the assertion of violation of due process rights, with no discussion of case law supporting that proposition ... relevant to the central question....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">The premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">Of course not all legal arguments bearing upon the issue in question will always be identified by counsel, and we are not precluded from supplementing the contentions of counsel through our own deliberation and research. But where counsel has made no attempt to address the issue, we will not remedy the defect, especially were, as here, \u2018important questions of far-reaching significance\u2019 are involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 177 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Numerous other cases are equally noteworthy with respect to the issue of waiver by the State. <em>See, e.g., Bailey v. Duckworth, </em>699 F.2d 424, 425 (7th Cir.1983) (concluding in a federal habeas action that when a state appellate court initially reversed a conviction but subsequently affirmed based on an argument raised by state for first time in petition for rehearing, criminal defendant was denied \u201cright to a full and fair opportunity to litigate\u201d that issue; because the issue was neither raised at trial or briefed or argued on appeal, defendant \u201cwas justified in assuming the issue had been waived.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Leichtnam, </em>948 F.2d 370, 375 (7th Cir.1991) (reversing conviction that could have been affirmed if government had made proper argument on appeal); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>942 F.2d 1125, 1127 (7th Cir.1991) (reversing a conviction and declining to consider an argument not raised by government on appeal); <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>911 F.2d 768, 772 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>898 F.2d 705, 711 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 962, 110 S.Ct. 2574 (1990); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>888 F.2d 653, 654 (10th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1006, 110 S.Ct. 1301, 108 L.Ed.2d 478 (1990); <em>United States v. West, </em>723 F.2d 1, 2 n. 1 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">With respect to an appellate court\u2019s discretion to consider issues that have been waived by the prosecution, <em>Rose, </em>629 A.2d 526, also provides guidance. There, the court expressly acknowledged that an appellate court is not \u201cprecluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>reaching an issue <em>sua sponte </em>... \u201d, <em>id. </em>at 537, even if not raised by the government. Therefore, the court \u201ccould choose <em>sua sponte </em>to examine\u201d the merits of the trial court\u2019s exigency ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 535. Nevertheless, the court opted not to do so, for several reasons: the government made a deliberate tactical decision to pursue only the standing issue, rather than an inadvertent error; appellant had no opportunity to address the alternative grounds, absent supplementary briefing; resolution of the issues would be difficult and close. Thus, the court declined to look beyond the government\u2019s unsuccessful standing argument, <em>id. </em>at 537, stating: \u201c[T]here may be occasions when an appellate court should bail out the government by raising <em>sua sponte </em>an argument on appeal that the government has failed to raise. But this is not such a case.\u201d <em>.Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Similarly, the court in <em>Giovannetti, supra, </em>928 F.2d 225, recognized that \u201c[i]t is a separate question whether such a waiver [by the government] always binds the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. Although the Seventh Circuit recognized that an appellate court is not obligated \u201cto scour a lengthy record\u201d on its own, with no guidance from the parties, <em>id., </em>it also said that a court has \u201cdiscretion to overlook a failure to argue harmlessness ----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. The court took that position, at least in part, because of its concern that an unfounded reversal \u201cwill hurt others,\u201d including \u201cthe adverse party\u201d and \u201cinnocent third parties ... \u201d, <em>id. </em>at 226, whose access to the courts will be \u201cimpaired\u201d due to the additional litigation that an inflexible stance would generate. <em>Id. </em>It also recognized that \u201creversal may be an excessive sanction for the government\u2019s having failed to argue harmless error,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 227, particularly \u201cif the harmlessness of the error is readily discernible without an elaborate search of the record.\u201d <em>Giovannetti, </em>928 F.2d at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In determining whether to exercise such discretion the court identified several factors, including \u201cthe length and complexity of the record, whether the harmlessness of the error or errors is certain or deliberate and whether a reversal will result in protracted, costly, and ultimately futile proceedings\u201d in the trial court. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the court declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201crelieve the government from the consequences of its failure to raise the issue of harmless error in its brief on appeal,\u201d <em>id., </em>because it concluded that the \u201ccertainty of harmlessness\u201d did not appear with \u201cclarity from an unguided search of the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The cases cited above elucidate for us that, in a criminal case, the State can be found to have waived a valid claim, even if the waiver leads to the reversal of a conviction. On the other hand, when the State fails to raise an important argument, an appellate court ordinarily has discretion to review the record or the trial judge\u2019s ruling in its effort to reach a sound result. Similarly, the appellate court generally retains discretion to consider an argument that is belatedly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In light of the importance of the issue presented with regard to the co-conspirator exception, we have determined, in the exercise of our discretion, that a remand is appropriate, so that the parties will have an opportunity to fully litigate before the post-conviction court the question of whether Gutrick\u2019s statement was admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. Moreover, we believe a remand is appropriate because resolution of the issue in the context of a post-conviction proceeding will require careful analysis of the entire record, appropriate briefing, and, perhaps, further examination of defense counsel and appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In reaching our decision to remand, we perceive that this is not a case in which the State made a tactical decision to forego raising the co-conspirator exception. Instead, it seems to have inadvertently omitted the argument from its initial brief after including it in the Application. Further, in contrast to some of the cases we have considered, the State eventually raised the co-conspirator issue in its reply brief; it did not fail altogether to raise the matter until after we ruled, as happened in some of the cases that we cited. Nor did it make the kinds of damaging or misleading concessions below that we saw in other cases that we discussed. To the contrary, the State has steadfastly maintained that Smith\u2019s entire statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>was admissible and has persisted in its claim that Jones\u2019s conviction should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">To be sure, a \u201ccriminal defendant! ], as a matter of constitutional right, sometimes can prevail on collateral attacks on their convictions based on ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>Rose, </em>629 A.2d at 537, and there is \u201cno constitutional counterpart justifying affirmance of a conviction based on ineffective ... advocacy\u201d by the State. <em>Id. </em>at 537-58. Nevertheless, \u201c[j]ustice is not a one-way street.\u201d <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>326 Md. 502, 534, 606 A.2d 225, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 894, 113 S.Ct. 269, 121 L.Ed.2d 198 (1992). Indeed, \u201c[a] fair trial is the entitlement of the \u2018People\u2019 as well as of an accused.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>322 Md. 62, 74, 585 A.2d 222 (1991). Therefore, we believe that a failure to consider the State\u2019s belated argument would constitute \u201can excessive sanction\u201d under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Giovannetti, </em>928 F.2d at 227. In sum, we believe the issue of appellee\u2019s entitlement to post-conviction relief in this important case ought to be decided on the merits, and not on the basis of the kind of inadvertence that may have occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We next consider whether appellate counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective, because he failed to raise on direct appeal a claim of error based on the inadmissibility of the double hearsay in Smith\u2019s statement. The State contends that the post-conviction court erred in finding that Jones\u2019s appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Conversely, appellee asserts that the post-conviction court correctly found ineffective assistance based on Long\u2019s failure, <em>inter alia, </em>to challenge on direct appeal the admissibility of Gutrick\u2019s hearsay within hearsay statement, and his failure to review the trial exhibits, including Smith\u2019s statement, which was central to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">In his testimony, Long acknowledged that he did not review Smith\u2019s statement. His failure to review that statement, a critical component of the State\u2019s case, or to raise an issue on appeal about Gutrick\u2019s statement, might well constitute defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>dent performance. The question remains, however, as to whether Jones was prejudiced by any dereliction of Long, given trial counsel\u2019s failure to adequately object to Gutrick\u2019s statement, so as to preserve for review on direct appeal the admission of that statement. In other words, if Niland\u2019s performance resulted in a waiver, the question is whether appellate counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally defective based on his failure to raise an issue that was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Notwithstanding trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Gutrick\u2019s statement, a zealous appellate advocate might well have attempted to challenge its admission. An appellate attorney could have attempted to construct an argument that the issue was preserved on the basis of Niland\u2019s objection to the physical admission of the document. Indeed, the State made that argument to us. Alternatively, appellate counsel might have considered whether this was one of the rare cases in which a plain error argument might prove viable. <em>See Rubin, </em>325 Md. at 587, 602 A.2d 677 (stating that, \u201c \u201cwith respect to errors of law generally, an appellate court may in its discretion in an exceptional case take cognizance of plain error even though the matter was not raised in the trial court.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 141-42, 355 A.2d 455 (1976)); <em>see also State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 210-11, 582 A.2d 521 (1990) (\u201c[A]n appellate court may recognize <em>sua sponte </em>plain error, that is, error which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Resolution of the issue regarding appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is premature, however. If Gutrick\u2019s statement was admissible under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, then obviously appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue would not have been prejudicial. On the other hand, if it was not admissible under that exception, appellate counsel\u2019s course of conduct may have been constitutionally deficient. On remand, the court should re-consider appellate counsel\u2019s performance in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Finally, we note that the State does not contend that the post-conviction court erred on the ground that its ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>applied across the board to all of Jones\u2019s convictions, including those related to Michelle and Jeannette, and the robbery and kidnaping of Gulston, which Jones\u2019s defense counsel virtually conceded. As we see it, the alleged errors of trial counsel and appellate counsel relate primarily to Jones\u2019s conviction with respect to Gulston\u2019s murder. Therefore, on remand, the post-conviction court should make clear the particular convictions to which its rulings apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY NEITHER AFFIRMED NOR REVERSED.

On January 19, 2001, the State filed a \"Motion for Reconsideration, Clarification, and Stay of Mandate,\u201d (\"Motion for Reconsideration\u201d), to which Jones subsequently responded. In light of the State\u2019s motion, we recalled our original opinion. We have now determined to grant the State\u2019s motion, in part, and to deny it, in part. Accordingly, this amended and substituted opinion is filed to address in one opinion the various issues raised by the State in its original appeal and in its Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">. Jones was one of several persons charged with the murders and related crimes. We do not have the entire court record from Jones\u2019s criminal trial, however. Nor did we have any information about the criminal proceedings against Don Lowell Gutrick, Derrick Smith, or Jason Pinkney, who were also charged in the underlying matter. In the indictment charging Jones, Gutrick is named as the sole co-defendant. Neither Smith, Gutrick, nor Pinkney was tried with Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">We shall refer to Michelle and Jeannette Gulston by their first names, in order to avoid confusion. We note that throughout the record and the briefs, the first name of Jeannette Gulston is spelled alternately as \"Jeannette\u201d and \"Jeanette.\u201d Moreover, at trial, she only provided the spelling of her last name. Therefore, we shall use the same spelling employed by this Court in the opinion issued with regard to Jones's direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-14\">.

Although the post-conviction court found prejudice, we observe that it did not explain why or how appellee was prejudiced by the deficient performance of either his trial or appellate counsel, or by any errors of the trial court. Nevertheless, on appeal, the State has not asserted that the finding of the lower court as to prejudice was improper because it was conclusory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">. In its opening brief and in its reply, the State refers us to three places in the record to support its claim that Niland objected to the admission of the statement. In our view, those references do not support the State\u2019s claim. Moreover, we have combed the record to verify the State\u2019s assertion, and cannot find support for the State's contention. In any event, we observe that if the State is correct that Niland did object, this would seem to strengthen Jones's argument that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Curiously, in his brief, appellee seems to agree with the State that Niland \"objected to the introduction of the statement in its entirety.\u201d But, he complains because Niland did' not specifically object to Gutrick\u2019s statement. Jones has not provided us with any citation to the record to support his contention that Niland objected to the statement in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. The Maryland Rules of Evidence took effect on July 1, 1994, about one year after the occurrence of the crimes in this case. Thus, the rules were in effect at the time of Jones\u2019s trial in December 1996. In any event. Rule 5-802.1(a) is merely a codification of the holding in <em>Nance, </em>which was decided prior to appellee\u2019s trial. <em>See Tyler v. State, </em>342 Md. 766, 775, 679 A.2d 1127 (1996); <em>Corbett v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 408, 419, 746 A.2d 954, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 31, 753 A.2d 3 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\">. The record only contains the redacted copy of Smith\u2019s statement. Therefore, we have relied on the transcript to ascertain the wording of those portions of Smith's statement that were redacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b241-6\">. The State does not contend that Jones adopted or ratified Gutrick\u2019s statement. Nor does the State contend that Gutrick\u2019s statement was admissible based on the exception to the hearsay rule for a declaration against penal interest. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-804(b)(3); <em>State v. Matusky, </em>343 Md. 467, 682 A.2d 694 (1996); <em>see also Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994); <em>State v.

Although the post-conviction court also attributed error to the trial judge based on the admission of Gutrick\u2019s statement, it is difficult for us to fault the trial judge for what transpired. As the record reflects, the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>reviewed Smith\u2019s statement to ferret out any improper portions, repeatedly invited counsel to identify potential problems, was quick to strike anything that appeared problematic, and alerted counsel to the issue of multiple hearsay. Defense counsel never asked the court to redact Gutrick's statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b249-11\">.
