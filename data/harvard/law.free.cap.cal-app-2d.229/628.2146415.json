BATES, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. FREDERICK G. STOEHR, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Frederick G. Stoehr, in pro. per., for Defendant and Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b651-7\">Little, Curry &amp; Hagen, F. Edward Little and Stanley Rogers for Plaintiff and Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b651-8\">ROTH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApF\">Respondent Bates (Bates) recovered a money judgment for approximately $7,900 and attorney\u2019s fees against appellant Stoehr (Stoehr) predicated upon a written contract wherein Bates as seller sold his manufacturing business to one Aghajanian as purchaser (Purchaser). The contract was negotiated by Stoehr as attorney for Purchaser and the promissory notes representing installment payments under the contract and the contract were guaranteed by Stoehr concurrently with the execution of the contract and the installment notes. There was no judgment against Purchaser since he was adjudicated a bankrupt before the trial had proceeded to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The relevant portions of the contract provided that Purchaser would receive all work in progress; accounts receivable ; all bills of lading for goods shipped; a list of all orders taken and orders filled; and an exclusive license to manufacture ornamental fountains under a pending patent application. Bates also agreed that he would pay salesmen\u2019s commissions for sales made prior to March 30, 1960, out of the first payment made by Purchaser, and that he would not engage in competition with Purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">It was provided in the agreement that the amounts stated therein were subject to correction and that any adjustment would be made in the second and third notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">In reply to the complaint, Purchaser and Stoehr filed separate answers and cross-complaints. In each answer, there were alleged, in addition to other defenses, general representations amounting to fraud. Purchaser, in his cross-complaint, in addition to other claims comprising offsets and defenses to the contract, alleges six specific representations of material fact and ends up with the allegation: \u2018 \u2018 The foregoing representations were false and fraudulent, and the promises and agreement were made by cross-defendant without any intention of performing them. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Purchaser then proceeds to allege specifically the facts showing the untruth of some of the representations and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>failure to perform others and/or the nonintention of Bates from the beginning to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Stoehr, in his cross-complaint, in addition to other claims comprising offsets and defenses to the contract, alleges three specific material representations and concludes with the allegation : \u201cSaid representations were false and said promises were fraudulently made, without any intention of keeping and performing them, and were made for the purpose of inducing this cross-complainant to guarantee payment of said promissory note. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Stoehr then proceeds to specifically allege the manner in which the promises were false and fraudulent and facts in respect of the intent of seller from the beginning not to keep or perform certain of the promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In a pretrial conference an order was made, which among other things, recited: \u201cThe parties have signed a \u2018Joint PreTrial Statement\u2019 which is attached hereto and made a part of this order. The contentions of the parties and the issues are set forth therein, with the exception of the contentions of the defendants and cross-complainants. The contentions of the defendants and cross-complainants are set forth in separate documents entitled \u2018Pre-Trial Statement of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Harry Aghajanian\u2019 and \u2018Pre-Trial Statement of Defendant and Cross-Complainant Frederick G. Stoehr.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The joint pretrial statement referred to in and made a part of the pretrial order, among other things, recited all of the contentions of Bates as plaintiff and cross-defendant specifically, then listed under the heading of \u201cIssues\u201d items 1-10, both inclusive. Immediately following item 10 in the center of the joint pretrial statement is the legend \u201cContentions of Defendants and Cross-Complainants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">(To be filed under separate cover.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The joint pretrial statement then concludes with a description of \u201cStatus of the Case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">It is apparent from the foregoing recital that all of the documents referred to were made a part of the pretrial <em>order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">In the enumeration of the issues in the joint pretrial statement, items 6 and 9 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">\u201c6. Whether or not the cross-complainant Stoehr\u2019s guarantee on the promissory note be rescinded because of the cross-defendant\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations. .. . 9. The amount, if any, of the damages, including liquidated, consequential, etc., which the cross-complainant Aghajanian may recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>from the cross-defendant by reason of the cross-defendant\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">Under separate cover as specifically provided for by the joint pretrial statement, Purchaser lists specifically his defenses. Item 2 thereof is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>In his cross-complaint Aghajanian prays for the rescission of the agreement on the grounds of the fraudulent representations and conduct of Bates;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">Stoehr, in his pretrial statement, also under separate cover, as specifically provided in the \u201cJoint Pre-Trial Statement\u201d lists as his defenses, among others, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">\u201c1. He received no consideration for his guarantee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">\u201c2. He was induced to become guarantor by the false representations of plaintiff, alleged in Stoehr\u2019s cross-complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-11\">\u201c3. He rescinded his guarantee, and gave notice of rescission as soon as he discovered the false representations; that he gave written notice of rescission on June 6, I960;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">It seems patently obvious from the above that fraud was the orbital issue in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-13\">On many occasions during the trial, Stoehr attempted to introduce evidence of fraud, but on each occasion was completely barred from so doing by the trial judge. The trial judge asserted and reiterated that there was no issue of fraud presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-14\">A few excerpts from the record will illustrate what occurred: \u201cWhere is the issue [of fraud] presented in the pleadings or in your pre-trial statements ? . . . The Court : I find nothing in the statement of issues that embraces this inquiry and the objection is sustained. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-15\">Stoehr did not forthwith find items 6 and 9 listed on page 4 of the pretrial statement under the heading \u201cIssues.\u201d After a recess, the following took place:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-16\">\u201cMr. Stoehr: I believe the point at which the Court recessed was whether the question of fraud and misrepresentation was within the issues as framed in the pre-trial statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-17\">\u201cSince then I have examined the pre-trial order and the pre-trial statements and ... if your Honor wishes I can read . . . those portions to which I have referred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-18\">\"The Court : Point them out to me, if you will. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-20\">\u201cThe Court: Now, turn to page 3 of the pre-trial statement, the joint pre-trial statement and turn to issues. We are controlled by the issues, not by the contentions. Contentions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>are merely what counsel think about an issue. Contentions are not admissible. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">At another point during the trial, the following took place: \"The Court : All right. To what issue is this addressed to <em>1 </em>\u201cMr. Stoehr: That of fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cThe Court; Where is that fraud set out in the pre-trial statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201cMr. Rogers : Your Honor, if I may assist the Court, on page 4-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : No. Let counsel assist himself. He is entitled to indicate what he is trying to prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">\u201cMr. Stoehr : In the pre-trial statement of Frederic <em>(sic) </em>G. Stoehr: 'Stoehr\u2019s defenses are: 1. He received no consideration for his guarantee. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : Where are you reading from ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">\u201cMr. Stoehr : From my pre-trial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">\u201cThe Court; I will ask you to point out to me which issue under the pre-trial statement covers the introduction of this evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">\u201cMr. Stoehr: All right. \u2018 Stoehr\u2019s defenses are: 1. He received no consideration for his guarantee. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-14\"><em>\"</em>The Court : Where will this be found ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-15\">\u201cMr. Stoehr \u2022. That is on line 28 of page 1 of Stoehr\u2019s pretrial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-16\">\u201cThe Court: No. I call your attention to the issues that are set forth in the joint pre-trial statement and there only. \u2019 \u2019 Defense counsel had not as yet pointed out to the court the exact page of the joint pretrial statement which under the definition \u201cIssues\u201d made fraud an \u201cissue\u201d rather than a \"contention. \u2019 \u2019 However, counsel did finally find, in ample time to have evidence of fraud received, the paragraphs 6 and 9 already referred to and the following took place:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-17\">\u201cMr. Stoehr : First I wish to apologize to the Court for something which took place at Monday\u2019s session. Your Honor gave me the opportunity to point out in the joint pre-trial statement where the subject of fraud was indicated as an issue. I was taken by surprise and did not have the joint pre-trial statement before me. Since then I obtained a photostatic copy from the files and I would like to read-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-19\">\u201cThe Court; That won\u2019t be necessary. It is all in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-20\">\u201cMr. Stoehr : \u2014paragraph 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-21\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The Court : I am familiar with it. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-22\">However, the court\u2019s statement that he was \u201cfamiliar with\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>(paragraph 6) did not change the court\u2019s mind in respect of the issue of fraud, although a number of efforts were made by Stoehr, he was not at any stage of the trial thereafter permitted to introduce evidence of fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Manifestly, it was prejudicial error for the trial court to deny appellant the opportunity to introduce evidence upon a recognized issue in the case. <em>(California Home Extension Assn. </em>v. <em>Hilborn, </em>37 Cal.2d 459, 465 [235 P.2d 369]; <em>Schubkegel </em>v. <em>Gordino, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 667, 673 [133 P.2d 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In spite of the exclusion of the issue of fraud from the trial, the trial judge did nevertheless, as part of its findings, specifically Finding X, make a finding on the issue of fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cIt is not true that defendant Frederick G. Stoehr was induced to or did execute said note by false and fraudulent representations, promises and agreements, or any of them, made by plaintiff. It is true that said Frederick G. Stoehr executed said note as guarantor freely and in consideration of plaintiff\u2019s execution of the agreement Exhibit 1, whereby plaintiff sold all his right, title and interest in the business to Stoehr\u2019s client Aghajanian.' \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">Respondent in his effort to defend this finding made several explanations thereof in his brief. We select the one which appears to be the least fallacious. Respondent says: \u201cIn the instant cause the main substantive error of which appellant complains is that evidence that he wished introduced on the issue of fraud was improperly excluded by the Court and that if such evidence had been admitted, the Court would have found for the appellant in that he would have been justified rescinding his guarantee. The evidence, however, to which appellant refers are the two letters which were heretofore discussed and attached to the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial as exhibits. Nothing in those letters even approaches the type and nature of evidence which would have to be present before a Court could rule that the respondent was guilty of fraud. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Wholly aside from the fact that we do not agree with the conclusions of respondent on his construction of the factual matters asserted by Stoehr on motion for a new trial, assuming such matters could be proved, respondent cites no authority for this novel position that such error was nonprejudicial.  We feel, in light of the court\u2019s Finding X, that such error was inherently prejudicial. <em>(Shippey </em>v. <em>Shippey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>58 Cal.App.2d 174 [136 P.2d 86]; <em>Mashbir </em>v. <em>Mashbir, </em>29 Cal.App.2d 733, 737 [85 P.2d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Herndon, Acting P.
