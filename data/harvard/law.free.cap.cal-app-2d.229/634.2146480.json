He alleged that defendants wrongfully arrested him, confined him in the Long Beach jail and committed violent assaults and batteries upon him, and he sought recovery of damages for same. Defendants raised inter alia the affirmative defense that the action was barred by failure to file a claim as required by sections 2710-2710.6 of the Long Beach Municipal Code enacted on December 13, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">At pretrial conference plaintiff\u2019s complaint was amended by adding a prayer for punitive damages and it was stipulated that \u201cissue No. 5 in the Joint Pre-Trial Statement shall be tried first by the court sitting without a jury.\u201d Issue 5 was stated to be \u201c [W]hether plaintiff is barred by the provisions of sections 2710 and 2710.6, inclusive, of the Long Beach Municipal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The complaint did not aver that defendants were police officers or that they were any type of municipal employee engaged in the course and scope of such employment. It plainly was intended to come within the doctrine of <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>McCollister, </em>37 Cal.2d 203 [231 P.2d 48], which holds that section 1981, Government Code, then in effect, required the filing of a verified claim only when the injured person claimed that he had been injured as a result of a public employee\u2019s negligence occurring during the course of his employment, and in the absence of such an allegation by plaintiff, defendant, by making such an allegation himself, could not invoke the statute to defeat the action. (This ease has been criticized and explained in the light of later legislation in such manner that it is now doubtful whether its holding is presently the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>law. See Prof. Arvo Van Alstyne on <em>Claims Against Public Employees: More Chaos in California Law, </em>8 U.C.L.A. L. Rev., pp. 497, 500, 514; <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 101, 105-107 [25 Cal.Rptr. 603].)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Plaintiff placed himself beyond the purview of <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>McCollister </em>by stipulating with his opponent at the pretrial that \u201cdefendants were duly appointed police officers of the City of Long Beach.\u201d Prior to that time the allegations of the complaint were consistent with a citizen\u2019s arrest and assault and imprisonment committed by the arresting citizens. But this stipulation (incorporated by reference into the judge\u2019s order) became a part of the complaint.  \u201cIt is settled that, when filed, a pretrial conference order, unless modified at or before trial, supersedes the issues raised by the pleadings and controls the subsequent course of the ease. . . . Until presented with a request for its modification, the trial judge has a right to rely on the posture of the ease defined by the pretrial conference order.\u201d <em>(Feykert </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>213 Cal. App.2d 67, 74 [28 Cal.Rptr. 510].) To the same effect see <em>Fitzsimmons </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 5, 8 [3 Cal.Rptr. 373]. So we have an action for willful torts committed by Long Beach policemen and are confronted with the question whether the filing of a claim was requisite to perfection of a cause of action either under general law or under the municipal code of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The trial court held that noneompliance with the city ordinance was fatal to the maintenance of plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The date of these torts was June 13, 1961, at which time the claim statutes of 1959 were in effect, as were the above cited sections of the municipal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">For many years prior to 1959 section 1981, Government Code, required the filing of a claim where damages were sought against an officer or employee of a municipality for injuries caused by \u201cnegligence or carelessness\u201d of such officer or employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1951 section 2003<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was enacted (which is said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>to have been intended to put an end to the rule of the <em>Stewart </em>case; see <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Sprague, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 101, 106). Both of these sections were repealed in 1959; section 801, Government Code, was enacted in place of 1981 and section 803 replaced 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">All of these sections\u20141981, 2003, 801 and 803\u2014were restricted by their terms to claims based upon negligence of the public employee. The appellate courts have held with uniformity that the omission of any mention of willful torts meant that no claim need be filed in such instances. (See <em>Whitson </em>v. <em>LaPay, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 584, 589 [315 P.2d 45]; <em>Chappelle </em>v. <em>City of Concord, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 822, 825 [301 P.2d 968]; <em>Sarafini </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 570, 574 [300 P.2d 44]; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Lerman, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 586, 591, 594 [292 P.2d 559]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Shears, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 360, 364-365 [299 P.2d 986] ; <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Jansen, </em>208 Cal.App. 2d 222, 231 [25 Cal.Rptr. 184]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>52 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>517, 520 [341 P.2d 673]; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>39 Cal.2d 756, 760 [249 P.2d 246].) However, these state statutes are not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\">The field has not been preempted by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In the case of <em>Whitson </em>v. <em>LaPay, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 584, 589, this court said: \u201cAppellant contends that inasmuch as this action is not based on negligence, the filing of a claim is unnecessary by reason of the provisions of Government Code, section 1981. It is well settled that section 1981 embraces only negligence actions and not intentional torts such as alleged in the complaint herein. However, the necessity of the filing of a claim in this action for an alleged intentional tort is governed by the Long Beach City ordinance and not by Government Code, section 1981. We have concluded that the rule announced in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Beville, </em>47 Cal.2d 852 [306 P.2d 789], dealing with the necessity of filing claims under city ordinances or charters for compensation for damages for inverse condemnation, is not applicable to the matter before us as it does not appear that the state has preempted the field in the matter of filing claims as a condition precedent to suit in the case of intentional torts. \u2019 \u2019 It was held that the filing of a claim arising from an intentional tort was necessary under Long Beach Ordinance No. C-1436 the terms of which, quoted at page 586, are, with two small and inconsequential exceptions, identical with the sections of the municipal code here involved\u2014quoted at page 8 of the clerk\u2019s transcript. The Supreme Court denied a hearing in the <em>Whitson </em>ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The pertinent sections of the municipal code are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>199 Cal.App.2d 762 [19 Cal.Rptr. 45], was an action for trespass, false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and conspiracy to commit such torts. At page 769 the court said: \u201cAppellant further contends that his actions against certain police officers were erroneously dismissed by the court at the commencement of the trial. At that time appellant stipulated that he had not filed any claim against Officers Higgins, Haynes, Hill, Bieri, Carabine or Workman prior to filing suit as required by section 2710.4 and within the time specified by section 2710.6 of the Long Beach Municipal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cThe court properly construed these municipal code provisions to be controlling and appellant was required to comply therewith as a condition precedent to the filing of an action against such officers. Under such circumstances the order of dismissal was entirely proper. In the ease of <em>Whitson </em>v. <em>LaPay, </em>153 Cal.App.2d 584 [315 P.2d 45], the very provisions of the municipal ordinances under consideration here were before the court in an action for false arrest and battery. In that case appellant contended that inasmuch as his action was not based on negligence the filing of a claim was unnecessary by reason of the provisions of Government Code section 1981. The appellate court pointed out, however, that the latter section embraces only negligence actions and not intentional torts. The court held that the necessity of the filing of a claim for an alleged intentional tort was nonetheless governed by the Long Beach ordinance and not by the Government Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\u201cAppellant contends the claims provisions of the Long Beach Municipal Code are unconstitutional because the state has preempted the field. However, the court disposed of that issue in the case of <em>Whitson </em>v. <em>LaPay, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.2d at page 589, '. . .it does not appear that the state has preempted the field in the matter of filing claims as a condition precedent to suit in the case of intentional torts. \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It will be noted that the <em>Farnsworth </em>ease involved the same sections of the Long Beach Code as the cause at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">To same effect see <em>Slavin </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 407, 410 [217 P.2d 984]; <em>Klimper </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, </em>99 Cal. App.2d 446, 451 [222 P.2d 49],</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The fact of absence of state preemption of the field is re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>fleeted in section 730, Government Code, enacted in 1959 (Stats. 1959, ch. 1724, p. 4138) which, though not applicable to claims against the public employee, does recognize existing jurisdiction in local agencies such as cities to govern these matters by charter, ordinance or regulation adopted by the local public entity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The phrasing of section 2710.4, municipal code, \u201cNo suit for damages or money\u201d and of section 2710.6 \u201cAny claim for damages or money,\u201d contrasts with Government Code sections 801 and 803 which carefully confine the right of recovery to damages caused by negligence or carelessness of the employee. It is apparent that the municipal code goes beyond the state statute and requires the filing of a claim based upon willful torts as well as those growing out of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As no claim was filed by plaintiff and no attempt made to comply with the Long Beach Code, the court correctly decided that he has no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Herndon, Acting P. J., and Roth, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 10, 1964.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\"> Retired Justice of the District Court of Appeal sitting under assignment hy the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 1981.
