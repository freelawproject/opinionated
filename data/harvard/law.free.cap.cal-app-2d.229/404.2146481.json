There were no oral proceedings before the trial court except argument. Determining the issues in favor of defendant, the judge concluded: \u201cArticle XI, section 12, of the California Constitution does not prohibit the assessment of taxable property by a county at a uniform fraction of its full cash value.\" Plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment comes to this court on an agreed statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">The sole issue before this court is whether locally assessable tangible property may be legally assessed at a uniform fraction of its full cash value. Appellant contends that all property must be assessed at full cash value; respondent claims that constitutional and statutory provisions permit assessment of property subject to taxation at a uniform fraction of its full cash value as long as full cash value is the standard or basis of each assessment. In support of his position appellant has advanced extended argument based pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>marily upon discussions found in numerous out-of-state eases; wMle it might be apposite and reasonable enough in the absence of controlling authority in California, or as an original proposition in the early stages of the administration of our revenue law, it is hardly persuasive now when, for almost a century, administrative, legislative and judicial authorities in this state have been in accord in the administration of our system of raising revenues to support local government. We seek neither to defend nor indict the property tax and its administration; our sole concern is with the legality of fractional assessments. It should be noted that while he criticizes at length the practice of assessing all property at a fraction of its fair market value, plaintiff has neither pleaded nor offered to prove that he has suffered or might suffer any detriment or discrimination as a result of assessment at 25 per cent or any other uniform fraction of the full cash value of his property. He claims that the only true way to achieve equality in assessment is by assessment at full cash value, but he has not complained of lack of equality in the assessment of his or any other property.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The following constitutional and statutory provisions set up the standard of valuation of property for assessment purposes for taxation in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Section 1, article XIII (previously contained in Const, of 1849, art. XI, \u00a7 13) adopted in 1879, provides: \u201cAll property . . . shall be taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law. ...\u201d Section 12, article XI, adopted in 1933, reads: \u201cAll property subject to taxation shall be assessed for taxation at its full cash value.\u201d Similarly, section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code, enacted in 1939, provides: \u201cExcept as provided in this part, all taxable property shall be assessed at its full cash value.\u201d Section 110, Revenue and Taxation Code, (once contained in Pol. Code, \u00a7 3617) defines \u201cvalue,\u201d \u201cfull cash value\u201d or \u201ccash value\u201d as \u201cthe amount at which property would be taken in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor.\u201d \u201cPull cash value\u201d is synonymous with \u201cmarket value.\u201d (De <em>Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>45 Cal.2d 546, 561-562 [290 P.2d 544); <em>Michael Todd Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>57 Cal.2d 684, 686 [21 Cal.Rptr. 604, 371 P.2d 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Section 3627, Political Code, predecessor of section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code, was enacted in 1872 and, except for the addition of the word \u201ctaxable\u201d (1881), remained unchanged until it became section 401 in 1939 and \u201cshall\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>was substituted for the word \u201cmust.\u201d While section 3627 specifically provided that \u201cAll taxable property must be assessed at its full cash value,\u201d during its 67 years of existence, administrative and legislative authorities uniformly held to the view that it permitted property to be assessed at a uniform fraction, rather than 100 per cent of cash value, as long as full cash value was the standard or basis of each assessment.  This view, acknowledged and accepted by appellate courts in this state, grew out of the early consistent practice of those administering our revenue law\u2014the State Board of Equalization and assessors of each county\u2014of assessing property at a uniform fraction of cash value, as reflected in biennial reports (since 1878) made by the State Board of Equalization to the Governor under section 3692, Political Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in annual reports of results of certain studies (since 1921) by the State Board of Equalization to the California Legislature,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of which we take judicial notice. <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Los Altos School Dist., </em>149 Cal.App.2d 768, 772 [308 P.2d 872].)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Legislative approval followed the administrative practice of fractional assessments. At least since 1921 the California Legislature had been directly aware of the administrative interpretation section 3627 had uniformly received; and in 1933, as part of the \u201cRiley-Stewart Tax Plan,\u201d it proposed the incorporation in the California Constitution of a provision based upon, and almost identical with, section 3627. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>this amendment, article XI, section 12, provides: \u201cAll property subject to taxation shall be assessed for taxation at its full cash value.\u201d (Senate Constitutional Amendment 30, Stats. 1933, eh. 63, pp. 3072-3073.) This amounted to an inclusion in the Constitution of what had been the law since 1872; it is apparent that no change in assessment procedure was intended or contemplated. The Legislature carried over into the constitutional amendment the substantially identical language of section 3627, under which it knew that market value was being used as a standard for fractional assessments. (See footnote 2.) Moreover, since 1890, numerous judicial opinions had recognized and recited the practice being employed under the administrative construction of section 3627. <em>(San Jose, etc. R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Mayne </em>(1890) 83 Cal. 566, 570 [23 P. 522]; <em>Southern Pacific Land Co. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 543, 545 [191 P. 931] ; <em>Birch </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 736, 740 [200 P. 647]; <em>Wild Goose Country Club </em>v. <em>County of Butte </em>(1922) 60 Cal.App. 339, 343 [212 P. 711] ; <em>Birch </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1927) 88 Cal.App. 82, 87 [262 P. 788]; <em>Hammond Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 235, 244 [285 P. 896] ; <em>L. W. Blinn Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>216 Cal. 474, 477, 479 [14 P.2d 512, 84 A.L.R. 1304].)  In the absence of contrary indication in a constitutional amendment, terms used therein must be construed in the light of their statutory meaning or interpretation in effect at the time of its adoption. <em>(Forster Shipbuilding Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>54 Cal.2d 450, 456 [6 Cal.Rptr. 24, 353 P.2d 736].) Persuasive, too, is the absence of mention of any basic change in the administrative practice of assessing at a fraction of full cash value in the \u201caddress\u201d to the voters printed on the ballots used in the election in which this amendment was adopted. (Proposed Amendments to Constitution, Special Edition, June 27, 1933; <em>Pasadena </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>182 Cal. 171, 174 [187 P. 418].) Shortly after the adoption of article XI, section 12, but on facts arising prior thereto, the case of <em>Rittersbacher </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 535 [32 P.2d 135] (cert. den. 293 U.S. 592 [55 S.Ct. 107, 79 L.Ed. 686]) was decided, and therein no mention of any contemplated change was made by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">That the Legislature four years later, in 1939, again intended no change in the administrative practice of fractional assessments under section 3627, Political Code, and article XI, section 12, California Constitution, is reflected in its adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of section 3627 as section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code. At this time administrative authorities, as before, were construing article XI, section 12, as permitting the use of market value as the standard or basis for assessment.  Continuous, consistent and contemporaneous administrative interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions is a persuasive force in their construction <em>(Pearson </em>v. <em>State Social Welfare Board, </em>54 Cal.2d 184, 210 [5 Cal.Rptr. 553, 353 P.2d 33] ; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Rancho Homes, Inc., </em>40 Cal.2d 764, 770, 771 [256 P.2d 305]) and, while not necessarily controlling, \u201cis entitled to great weight, and courts generally will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.\u201d <em>(Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>25 Cal.2d 918, 921 [156 P.2d 1].)  In the face of the many decisions in this state herein referred to, we cannot say that the administrative construction resulting in the assessment of taxable property by a county at a uniform fraction of its full cash value is <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>erroneous or unauthorized. \u2019 \u2019 Similarly, contemporaneous construction of the Constitution by those charged with the duty of collecting taxes has been given great weight in <em>Select Base Materials, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, </em>51 Cal.2d 640, 647 [335 P.2d 672]; and <em>Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>25 Cal.2d 918, 921 [156 P. 2d 1]. The practice continued as before,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and today, throughout California assessors assess property for tax purposes at a fraction of its market value\u2014they determine the market value of the property subject to taxation and apply to that value a common ratio.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Further indicative of the legislative interpretation of article XI, section 12, and section 401, clearly contemplating fractional assessments, is the adoption of sections 1815-1832.5 Revenue and Taxation Code, in 1957. Under present sections 1818, 1821, 1822 and 1822.5, the State Board of Equalization must annually ascertain within each county the average ratio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of assessed value to full cash value and determine the statewide average; and is empowered thereunder and by article XIII, section 9, to change the entire assessment roll of counties so that it will conform with the state-wide average.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellant, citing numerous cases both in and out of this jurisdiction, argues that article XI, section 12, is mandatory, does not sanction enforcement at the discretion of county assessors, is clear and requires no interpretation, does not legally permit the practice of fractional assessments, and for years has been erroneously construed by administrative authorities and, even though its construction has been approved by the Legislature, is void and of no effect. We do not question the authorities upon which appellant relies, but the administrative practice condemned by him is not the sole authority for fractional assessments in California. In the face of the specific provision in section 3627, Political Code, and now, article XI, section 12, California Constitution, and section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code, that all property shall be assessed at its \u201cfull cash value,\u201d the practice of assessing at a uniform fraction of full cash value on a standard of full cash value based on the administrative construction of constitutional and statutory provisions, has been consistently followed from 1872 to the present with the knowledge and permission of not only the California Legislature but the courts. While the issue of its legality has never been squarely presented to them, for well over 70 years the practice of assessors of using a ratio of market value to assessed valuation has been repeatedly and consistently recognized, referred to, permitted and accepted by appellate courts in this state. As early as 1890 <em>(San Jose etc. R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Mayne, </em>83 Cal. 566 [23 P. 522]) and as late as 1960 <em>(Pearson </em>v. <em>State Social Welfare Board, </em>54 Cal.2d 184 [5 Cal.Rptr. 553, 353 P.2d 33]) the Supreme Court acknowledged that assessed valuation is not the equivalent of market value of property. In <em>San Jose etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Mayne </em>(1890) 83 Cal. 566 [23 P. 522], it held that in condemnation proceedings the assessment of property for taxation is inadmissible as evidence of its value because it is made \u201cnot usually at the market value of the property. \u201d (P. 570.) In numerous subsequent cases the practice of assessing land \u201cat a percentage of true value\u201d <em>(Southern Pacific Land Co. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 543, 545 [191 P. 931]), has been described, referred to, relied upon and acknowledged. <em>(Birch </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 736, 740 [200 P. 647]; <em>Wild Goose </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Country Club </em>v. <em>County of Butte </em>(1922) 60 Cal.App. 339, 343 [212 P. 711]; <em>Birch </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(1927) 88 Cal.App. 82, 87 [262 P. 788] ; <em>Hammond Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 235, 244 [285 P. 896] ; <em>L. W. Blinn Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>216 Cal. 474, 477, 479 [14 P.2d 512, 84 A.L.R. 1304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In 1934 the Supreme Court decided <em>Rittersbacher </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>220 Cal. 535 [32 P.2d 135] (cert. den. 293 U.S. 592 [55 S.Ct. 107, 79 L.Ed. 686]); while the facts arose prior to the 1933 constitutional amendment (art. XI, \u00a7 12), the ease was subsequently at issue. Respondent claims that the court \u201cspecifically stated\u201d therein that Political Code, section 3627, permitted fractional assessments; appellant says that any suggestion to that effect is pure dicta inasmuch as it is an equalization ease, simply refers to the rule that the taxpayer need not be assessed at 100 per cent of full cash value to claim discrimination, and no one therein contended that the taxpayer should be assessed at full cash value. An analysis of the case reflects less than that advanced by respondent but more than claimed by appellant. Therein plaintiffs alleged that the assessor had deliberately pursued an erroneous and discriminatory method of assessing different classes of property resulting in inequitable valuations of their property. In upholding the assessment the court stated that if plaintiffs were to prevail they must show that the assessor acted arbitrarily or in wilful disregard of the law and that it constituted a constructive fraud upon them; but that the documentary evidence attached to their petition counteracted such showing. A written report of the assessor made to the Board of Equalization (attached to the petition) showed the tremendous volume of work involved and the necessity for the assessor to promulgate certain rules and formula to secure uniformity in valuation. The court said: \u201cIn arriving at the value of all property for the purposes of assessment the assessor is guided generally by section 3617 of the Political Code which defines the term \u2018value\u2019 as \u2018the amount at which the property would be taken in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor. \u2019 This value is expressed in section 3627 of the Political Code as the \u2018full cash value\u2019 for purposes of assessment. It is the assessor\u2019s recognized duty to see that the valuation placed on the various kinds of property shall be in proportion to the worth of such properties. If it is proportional and all are treated alike, no one contends that the taxpayer must be charged at full one hundred per cent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>for such is not required by lato.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) (Pp. 543, 544.) While this was an equalization case and the validity of fractional assessments was not in issue, the court nevertheless indicated that there was no requirement by law that property be assessed at full 100 per cent of market value as long as the assessments were in proportion to the other of such property and all were treated alike.  This conforms to the general view adhered to by the courts in this state that equality and uniformity are the constitutional and statutory goals in property taxation, rather than rigid adherence to 100 per cent of market value; and that these goals are achieved by means of using market value as a standard or basis and applying a uniform fraction to that standard. Apposite is the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Switz </em>v. <em>Township of Middleton, </em>23 N.J. 580 [130 A.2d 15, at p. 22] : \u201c. . . It is a mathematical truth in this regard there can be no essential difference between true value and a common ratio of true value applicable alike to all in the same class. In either event, the base is true value, and the assessments are in fact made according to the same standard of value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The above quoted language in <em>Bittersbacher </em>was cited with approval by this court in 1960 in <em>A. F. Gilmore Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 471, at page 476 [9 Cal.Rptr. 67]. This too was an equalization case wherein plaintiffs asserted that the County Board of Equalization had arbitrarily, discriminatorily and fraudulently refused to reduce their land assessment. More relevant is the court\u2019s clear recognition, in its discussion at pages 477 and 478, of the practice of ratio assessments where market value is used as a standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">While the validity of fractional assessments has never been at issue before the appellate courts, we have found no California ease in which it has been declared or even suggested that the practice of applying a uniform county-wide ratio to market value as determined by the assessor was violative of constitutional and legislative provisions, or in which the concept of fractional assessment has been rejected, criticized or disapproved. To the contrary, decisions from 1933 to the present have permitted the practice to continue under article XI, section 12, California Constitution and section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code. In most instances the court has held \u201cfair market value\u201d to be the equivalent of \u201cfull cash value, \u2019 \u2019 discussed the formula employed by the local assessor, and approved his use of a uniform ratio in the assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>practice. Nor have we found any case law in California supporting appellant's position; <em>Eisley </em>v. <em>Mohan </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 637 [192 P.2d 5], called to our attention by both parties, is, and appellant concedes it is, no authority for his contention herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Subsequent to <em>Rittersbacher </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1934) <em>supra, </em>numerous decisions recognized the practice of proportional assessment of property at less than full market value; in each instance the market value was used as the standard or basis for the assessment and all taxpayers similarly situated were treated alike. In <em>Michael Todd Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 684 [21 Cal.Rptr. 604, 371 P.2d 340], the court approved the method of valuation employed by the county assessor in the assessment of negatives of a motion picture. The methods used in computing their valuation were described in detail; each resulting figure \u201cwas then reduced to 30 per cent and the remaining balance multiplied by 50 per cent to produce the assessed value.\u201d (Footnote 5, p. 697.) The court found \u201c. . . the method of valuation here employed by the Los Angeles County Assessor was proper.\u201d (P. 697.) In a series of cases decided by the Supreme Court in 1955, involving assessments in Solano, San Bernardino, San Diego and Orange Counties, the assessor\u2019s method of valuation and assessment, approved in each case, showed assessment of property at a fraction of its market value. In each, the court acknowledged the ratio applied to market value by the assessor; and, in holding \u201cfull cash value\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cmarket value\u201d and that it is the \u201cstandard of valuation\u201d <em>(De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>45 Cal.2d 546, 561 [290 P.2d 544]), recognized that fair market value provided the test or basis for the assessor in the assessment process, and, once the market value is determined by him, the use of a uniform county-wide ratio in arriving at the figure of assessed valuation. In <em>Fairfield Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Solano </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 575, 577 [290 P.2d 562], a 25 per cent ratio of assessed value to market value was used in Solano County (p. 577) ; in <em>Victor Valley Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>County of San Bernardino, </em>45 Cal.2d 580 [290 P.2d 565], the method used by the assessor included the reduction of the value of certain property \u201cto 20 per cent thereof to allow for the ratio of assessment value to market value . . .\u201d (p. 583); in <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546 [290 P.2d 544], assessment was made at a ratio of 35 per cent of market value (p. 559); and in <em>El Toro Bev. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>County of Orange, </em>45 Cal.2d 586 [290 P.2d 569], assessments were made at \u201cmarket value less 30 per cent thereof to allow for the ratio of assessment value to market value.\u201d (P. 588.) An assessment in which the assessor\u2019s computation formula gave \u201c. . . the sum of $1,612,500, as the present value of plaintiff\u2019s one-year possessory interest; and 50 per cent of this amount, or $806,200, was fixed as the assessment figure,\u201d was upheld in <em>Kaiser Co. </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 610, 615, 616 [184 P.2d 879]. In 1927, 1928 and 1929 real property in the County of Los Angeles was assessed at 50 per cent of its market value. Of this the court, in <em>Orpheum, Circuit, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1936) 12 Cal.App.2d 257 [55 P.2d 901], said: \u201cThe figure thus obtained [after computation] was taken as the \u2018appraised value\u2019 and thereafter the \u2018assessed value\u2019 or \u2018full cash value\u2019 was fixed by the assessor at fifty per cent of said \u2018appraised value.\u2019 \u201d(P. 258.) The court was aware of the local practice of assessing property at less than its fair market value, for at page 261 it quoted from a Los Angeles City Ordinance confirming and ratifying the practice of the assessor \u201cof determining the <em>actual cash vahie </em>thereof by first determining the fair market value of such taxable property and by using an amount not exceeding fifty per centum of such fair market value as determined by said Assessor. ...\u201d (P. 261.) Other cases referring to the practice of assessors of using a ratio of market value to assessed valuation, are <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 77, 78, 81 [98 P.2d 495]; <em>McClelland </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 124, 134 [180 P.2d 676]; <em>Rancho Santa Margarita </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1932) 126 Cal.App. 186, 200 [14 P.2d 588]; <em>Southern Cal. Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 111, 122, 126-127 [113 P.2d 773]; <em>Eastern Columbia, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 734, 739, 740 [143 P.2d 992]; <em>Crothers </em>v. <em>County of Santa Cruz </em>(1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 219, 221 [311 P.2d 557]; <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 119, 123 [24 Cal.Rptr. 316].) In <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>State Social Welfare Board </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 184 [5 Cal.Rptr. 553, 353 P.2d 33], plaintiffs sought to qualify for old age benefits under section 2164, Welfare and Institutions Code, on the ground that they owned property with an assessed valuation of less than $5,000. The property consisted of 1,000 acres of land with estimates of market value ranging from $65 to $150 an acre. While the difference between the assessed valuation and the market value of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>was clearly apparent, the Supreme Court did not question the assessed value of the property, but accepted the assessed valuation as less than its full cash or market value in deciding the issue of eligibility for old age assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">That most of the above cited cases are equalization cases is no answer to the judicial recognition therein of the use and propriety of the practice of fractional assessments. Further, appellant says that the most they hold is that \u201cmarket value\u201d is equivalent to \u201cfull cash value.\u201d But it is still the fact that therein the court referred to and considered the constitutional and statutory provisions in question in recognizing the use of ratio assessments where fair market value is used as a standard, and in connection therewith, use of the term \u201cstandard\u201d of valuation. The language in these eases suggests that \u201cstandard\u201d was used therein in the sense that \u201cmarket value\u201d (equivalent to \u201cfull cash value\u201d) provided the criterion, test, rule or measure of value for the assessor, and that he is permitted, in meeting this standard, to fix the assessment at less than fair market value. (See for example, <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>45 Cal.2d 546 [290 P.2d 544]; and <em>Michael Todd Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>57 Cal.2d 684, 697 [21 Cal.Rptr. 604, 371 P.2d 340].) \u201cStandard\u201d in its common usage means \u201ctest,\u201d \u201crule\u201d or \u201cmeasure\u201d; it is so defined in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, volume 2, page 2223, \u201cStandard applies to any authoritative rule, principle, or measure used to determine the quantity, weight, or extent, or esp. the value, quality, level or degree of a thing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Relying heavily upon certain cited language in numerous decisions out of this jurisdiction, mainly, Iowa, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey, appellant argues that the term \u201cfull cash value\u201d means exactly what it says and there is no room for interpretation in article XI, section 12.  While his argument might have been controlling in 1872 when section 3627, Political Code, was enacted, or even in 1933 or 1939, the present posture of article XI, section 12, California Constitution, and section 401, Revenue and Taxation Code in our revenue system admits of almost a century of administrative construction permitting the practice of fractional assessment, which has been scrutinized by tax commissions, sanctioned by the Legislature and acknowledged and accepted by appellate courts in this state. Thus we see no application of the foreign cases cited; they would be pertinent only in the absence of some judicial acknowledgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>or approval of the assessment process used in this state in the past 90 years. Even then, legislation differed from constitutional and legislative provisions in California; while equality and uniformity of taxation seem to be the common goal, the action taken and the means employed to achieve it differ with the several states. In some cases the practice of assessing property at a fraction of full cash value was discussed and, in a few instances, held .not to be consistent with existing legislation, but the concept of fractional assessments was not rejected; in fact, in New Jersey and Connecticut legislation providing for the same was adopted. (Conn. Rev. Stats., \u00a7\u00a7 12-64 and 12-77, adopted by the General Assembly, 1957 Session by Public Act No. 673 (\u00a7\u00a7 6, 7) effective June 21, 1957; N.J. Stats., ch. 51, Law of 1960.)

The sections of the Constitution and statutes particularly pertinent to this matter are as follows: Section 1 and 9 of article XIII; section 12 of article XI; section 22 of article I, and sections 110 and 401 of the Revenue &amp; Taxation Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>It is Hornbook law that the provisions of the Constitution are mandatory and prohibitory and self-executing.

It is clear to me from what is stated, what is meant. Nowhere is it stated or indicated that the assessor has the right to determine whether property shall be assessed at full cash value or at his favorite fractional percentage of full cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The meaning of \u201cfull cash value\u201d has been determined by both legislative and judicial fiat. It has been held that \u201cfull cash value\u201d is synonomous with \u201cmarket value.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Western Union Oil Co., </em>161 Cal. 204, 207 [118 P. 720]; <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>149 Cal. 575, 585 [87 P. 102] ; see also <em>Michael Todd Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>57 Cal.2d 684, 696 [21 Cal.Rptr. 604, 371 P.2d 340] <em>; De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>45 Cal.2d 546, 561-562 [290 P.2d 544] ; <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>207 Cal.App.2d 119,128 [24 Cal.Rptr. 316],</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">This court should not attempt to put a non-existent or imaginary ambiguity into the matter of assessments and taxes by holding in effect that the assessor may juggle the placement of certain taxes on certain holders of certain property.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The majority in this particular case in effect hold that the long continued, systematic and intentional violation of the law somehow constitutes or has developed into a right in the assessor to violate the specific provisions of the law. As counsel for appellant has stated\u2014\u201cThe Constitution is not such a slender reed that it can be destroyed by a mere twist of the bureaucratic hand.

They are commands of the legislature. The defendants have no discretion in the matter, with respect to obeying those commands. Since the statute requires that all property shall be assessed and taxed at its actual value, they have no right to disregard this legislative injunction, because they deem it unwise or inexpedient, or because others in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>position in the past have so violated the law.\u201d <em>(Pierce </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1940) 229 Iowa 22 [294 N.W. 237, 248, 131 A.L.R. 335].)

If the rule were otherwise no one could ever rely upon his rights under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Our courts have held in the past that failure upon the part of an administrative body properly to tax a trust does not constitute an administrative construction and it has been said: \u201cMoreover, an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the interpretation of a statute, even though the statute is subsequently re-enacted without change. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Estate of Madison </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 453, 463 [159 P.2d 630], \u201cDelayed action on the part of those charged with the execution of laws will not be permitted to annul the law.\u201d <em>Painless Parker </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners, </em>216 Cal. 285, 299 [14 P.2d 67], And statutes cannot be held to be repealed by virtue of changed conditions. <em>People </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>54 Cal.2d 9, 26 [4 Cal.

There have been, it is true, cases which were concerned with the right to equalize assessments, without making a full cash value assessment, but as I read the decisions in no sense did the courts in those particular cases ever hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in the face of the problem here presented that the Constitution does not mean what it states. Those cases must be read in the light of the questions which were presented and passed upon at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">It would seem that full cash value is the only standard that is just and uniform and the one whereby each citizen can be required to support the government according to the value of his property. But whether or not it is a proper standard or not is not before this court\u2014the command of the Constitution is clear and we should not put our stamp of approval upon any evasive actions. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jimmer son, </em>222 F. 489, 495 [L.R.A. 1918B 1102] (cert, denied 239 U.S. 641 [36 S.Ct. 163, 60 L.Ed. 482]) and <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Green, </em>229 Iowa 22 [294 N.W. 237, 244,131 A.L.R. 335, 344], where it is said: \u201cOf this matter Prof. James C. Bonbright, of Columbia University in his late work \u2018The Valuation of Property,\u2019 Volume I, pages 497, 498, says: \u2018Theoretically the taxpayers\u2019 pocket is not in the least affected by uniform undervaluation or overvaluation. Systematic undervaluation diminishes the tax base, and the rate must therefore rise in order to supply the required government revenue. .. . The objections to the practice of undervaluation are patent. In the first place, except where sanctioned by statute, it involves a generally known and sanctioned disregard by officials of the law requiring them to assess property at its full and fair value. The other great vice is that the percentage of undervaluation is rarely a matter of common knowledge so that it is extremely difficult to ascertain whether there is uniformity in the proportion, or whether, through incompetence, favoritism or corruption of the assessors, some portions of the taxing body are bearing the others\u2019 burdens, as between either individuals or local groups.' \u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The majority of the court in this instance indicates that appellant here has neither pleaded nor offered to prove that he has suffered or might suffer any detriment as a result of assessments at 25 per cent of the full cash value of his property. Surely a citizen, resident, elector and property owner does not have to show a detriment before he can compel the officers of his government to comply with the Constitution. It was appropriately stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>106 U.S. 196, 220 [1 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed. 171, pages 181-182] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cNo man in this country is so high that he is above the law.

The agreed statement before this court sets forth that plaintiff is an honorably discharged veteran, ineligible for the veterans\u2019 exemption because he owns property worth over $5,000 and is a widower and that \u201c(e) the Los Angeles Unified School District, within which plaintiff resides and to which he pays taxes, has a maximum property tax limit by reason of certain provisions of the Education Code, (f) by reason of section 450 through 455 of the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code, applicants for public assistance may retain real property producing income, reasonably consistent with its value, which is used for the support of the applicant, not to exceed an assessed valuation of $5,000 as assessed by the county assessor, (g) the bonding capacities of the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles and other taxing districts within which plaintiff resides are in direct proportion to the assessed value of property located within the limits of said city, said county and said districts.\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The assessed valuation of property is the valuation used in applying the provisions of section 1% of article XIII of the Constitution (veterans\u2019 exemptions).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>apparent that persons (veterans) owning approximately four times the permitted maximum amount of property set forth in the Constitution ($5,000) are now exempt from taxation when they otherwise would have to pay. In other words a veteran\u2019s property, the actual cash value of which is $19,950, is presently assessed at $4,987.50. The veteran under the present administration of the law is entitled to a $1,000 exemption whereas in fact he is legally and constitutionally not entitled to any exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Section 455 of the Welfare and Institutions Code provides as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u2018 \u2018 \u00a7 455. Real property owned by the appellant or in combination with his spouse which is producing income, reasonably consistent with its value, which is used for the support of the applicant, may be retained in an amount not to exceed an assessed valuation of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as assessed by the county assessor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In other words, a recipient of public assistance as defined in the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code (\u00a7\u00a7 450-455) can continue to draw such assistance and have property of the actual cash value of $19,950 because such property will be assessed at $4,987.50 and not at its actual cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Under the circumstances it does not require a pencil and paper to calculate that fractional assessments are of a decided detriment to many taxpayers and a windfall to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>In 1957 the then legislative counsel (Ralph Kleps, presently the director of the administrative office of the California courts) was asked (1) whether there was any legally specified standard for the assessment of property for tax purposes, (2) whether in the event a county assessor assesses property at less than its full cash value for tax purposes there is any way in which the assessment could he corrected to conform to that value and (3) whether an assessor who assesses property at less than full cash value thereby subjects himself to any liability. The legislative counsel\u2019s answer to the first question was that the standard is the \u201cfull cash value\u201d and he then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201cOur State Constitution states that all taxable property \u2018shall be taxed in proportion to its value\u2019 (art. XIII, \u00a71), and provides that all \u2018property subject to taxation shall be assessed for taxation at its full cash value\u2019 (art. XI, \u00a7 12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">\u201c \u2018Full cash value\u2019 has been defined as \u2018the amount at which property would be taken in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor\u2019 (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7110). As our Supreme Court recently described it, it is \u2018the price that property would bring to its owner if it were offered for sale on an open market under conditions in which neither buyer nor seller could take advantage of the exigencies of the other. It is a measure of desirability translated into money amounts . . . and might be called the market value of property for use in its present condition\u2019 (De <em>Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546, 562 [290 P.2d 544]). The Supreme Court of the United States has stated unequivocally that it is synonymous with \u2018market value\u2019 <em>(San Francisco National Bank </em>v. <em>Dodge </em>(1904) 197 U.S. 70, 80 [25 S.Ct. 384, 49 L.Ed. 669, 674]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201cAs thus defined, \u2018full cash value\u2019 is the standard of value for property tax purposes (see <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, </em>above, at pp. 561-562).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cIn concluding this analysis, we direct your attention to the case of <em>Eisley </em>v. <em>Mohan </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 637 [192 P.2d 5], in which the court considered the constitutionality of former section 987 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, which read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">\u201c \u2018The cash value of a possessory interest in real estate of the Veterans Welfare Board is the following percentage of the cash value of the property during the following periods of the life of the contract covering sale of the property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">\u201c \u2018(a) Thirty percent during the first quarter period of the life of the contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201c \u2018(b) Forty-five percent during the second quarter period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQKQ\">\u201c \u2018(c) Sixty-five percent during the third quarter period; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201c \u2018(d) Eighty-five percent during the fourth quarter period. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cThe possessory interests involved were those of veterans in property being purchased for them by the State pursuant to the Veterans' Farm and Home Purchase Act (Mil. &amp; Vet.

But the Legislature cannot set aside the constitutional provision declaring that\" \u2018 [a] 11 property . . . shall be taxed in proportion to its value\u201d ... by requiring the assessment of property at less than its full cash value. Section 987 is, therefore, invalid as being in conflict with the constitutional provision.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cBefore <em>Eisley </em>v. <em>Mohan, </em>the courts had evidently countenanced the practice of assessing property at less than its market value (e.g. <em>Rittersbacher </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 535 [32 P.2d 135] ; <em>Southern Cal. Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 111, 126-127 [113 P.2d 773]). In none of the cases, however, was there any issue as to the propriety of the practice. The question almost invariably was whether the action of the assessor or board of equalization in assessing a particular class of property at a percentage of market value different from that used in assessing other classes resulted in a violation of the constitutional provision in section 1 of article XIII for taxation in proportion to value; and, more particularly, whether, since the latter necessitates uniformity in imposing the burdens of taxation <em>(Joint Highway District No. 13 of the State of Cal. </em>v. <em>Hinman </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 578 [32 P.2d 144]), there was any discrimination as to any of such other classes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">\u201cIn the <em>Rittersbacher </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court stated (at pp. 543-544) : \u2018. . . It is the assessor\u2019s recognized duty to see that the valuation placed on the various kinds of property shall be in proportion to the worth of such properties. If it is proportional and all are treated alike, no one contends that the taxpayers must be charged a full hundred percent, for such is not required by the law. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201cWhile the last clause of this statement is clearly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>point that an assessment may be made on the basis of a percentage of market value, it has the effect only of dictum, since there was no issue whatever in the case as to whether property might be assessed at anything less than market value. The primary question was whether there had been any discrimination in the assessment of the plaintiff\u2019s property at a particular percentage of its market value, when it appeared from the evidence that other categories of property had been assessed at smaller percentages of their market value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The legislative counsel\u2019s answer to the second query was that a correction could be made either by the Board of Supervisors on equalization or by subsequent court order. He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cThe law provides for the assessment of common property for tax purposes by the county assessor between the first Mondays in March and July (Bev. &amp; Tax.

Code, \u00a7 1603).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201cIn equalizing, the board of supervisors \u2018may increase or lower any assessment on the local roll\u2019 (Bev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1605), for the purpose of adjusting the value of the property listed \u2018to conform to its real and true value\u2019 (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1881) 59 Cal. 328, and <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1941) 48 Cal.App.2d 1, 6 [119 P.2d 197]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201cThe functions of an assessor are considered judicial in nature; hence, when he has acted within the limits of a reasonable discretion, his judgment, even though erroneous, usually will not be interfered with in the absence of actual or constructive fraud <em>(Eastern-Columbia, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 734 [143 P.2d 992]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201cEvidence of the constructive fraud may be found in a systematic and intentional undervaluation of property <em>(Mahoney </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 388 [245 P. 189]), and this apparently might consist of a practice of assessing property at less than its full cash value. Nonetheless, in consideration of presently applicable court decisions, if all taxpayers similarly situated are affected alike by such practice, it is doubtful that the board of equalization or the courts would increase the assessments or order an increase therein (see <em>Rittersbacher </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County </em>(1934) 220 Cal. 535, 543, 544 [32 P.2d 135], and see discussion of this case in analysis of first question). In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>absence of a type of discrimination creating unfair tax burdens, the courts have shown no inclination to upset assessments concededly made at less than full cash value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In answering the third question, it was stated: \u201cSection 1365 of the Revenue and Taxation Code provides for the prosecution of an assessor by the district attorney on the request of the State Board of Equalization when the latter \u2018is satisfied that an assessor or deputy assessor has knowingly . . . assessed any property at less than cash value.\u2019 The section read in its entirety as follows: \u2018Whenever the State Board of Equalization is satisfied that an assessor or deputy assessor has knowingly, fraudulently, or corruptly assessed any property at less than cash value, it shall immediately inform the district attorney of his county in writing of the facts within its knowledge, requesting that the assessor or deputy assessor be prosecuted. The district attorney shall at once comply.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u201cApparently also applicable is section 1222 of the Government Code, which provides that every \u2018willful omission to perform any duty enjoined by law upon any public officer, or person holding any public trust or employment, where no special provision is made for the punishment of such delinquency, is punishable as a misdemeanor.\u201d (1959 Assembly Journal, vol. 4, pp. 5670, and following.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">As heretofore indicated our task in this case is limited solely to determining whether the People meant what they said when they adopted the constitutional provisions in question\u2014-I think they said what they meant and that they meant what they said.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">I would reverse the judgment and grant the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by .the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 1964. Mosk, J., did not participate therein.
