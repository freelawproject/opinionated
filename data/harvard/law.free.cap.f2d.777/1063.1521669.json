Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982), that a facial vagueness challenge to a statute not reaching constitutionally protected conduct should be upheld \u201conly\u201d if the law \u201cis impermissibly vague in <em>all </em>of its applications\u201d (emphasis added). Appellees assert that this standard was modified in <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983), and that the quoted statement is really directed to over-breadth rather than vagueness challenges. Appellees also assert that we have failed to follow our own admonition in <em>United States v. Batson, </em>706 F.2d 657, 680 n. 35 (5th Cir.1983), that <em>Kolender </em>\u201cmay caution against literal application of the <em>Hoffman Estates </em>language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">We do not rely on a \u201cliteral application\u201d of <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>as we do not have before us a statute that is impermissibly vague in all but a minuscule number of its applications. Rather, as we observed in our original opinion, there is a very substantial core of applications in which the challenged enactment is plainly not impermissibly vague. 773 F.2d at 628-29. The record reflects that appellees sell a not insignificant number of items whose sale on Sunday the statute clearly forbids. We also observed that the only relief appellees requested was the invalidation of the statute <em>in to to; </em>and this indeed was the theory on which the case was tried below and was the relief granted by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 629.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Appellees want the baby thrown out with the bathwater. This we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">Thus, our case is similar to <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>where the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-16\">\u201c[W]e conclude that <em>at least some of the items sold </em>by Flipside are covered. Thus, Flipside\u2019s facial challenge is unavailing. <em>(t</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-18\">\u201cThe ordinance and guidelines do contain ambiguities. Nevertheless, the \u2018designed for use\u2019 standard is sufficiently <em>clear to </em>cover <em>at least some of the items that Flipside </em>sold____ <em>Whether </em>further guidelines, administrative rules, or enforcement policy <em>will clarify the more ambiguous scope </em>of the standard <em>in other respects is of no concern in this facial challenge. U</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1116-22\">\u201c... Testimony of the Village Attorney who drafted the ordinance, the village President, and the Police Chief revealed <em>confusion over whether the ordinance applies to certain items, </em>as well as extensive reliance on the \u2018judgment\u2019 of police officers to give meaning to the ordinance and to enforce it fairly. At this stage, however, <em>we are not prepared to hold that this risk jeopardizes the entire ordinance.\u201d </em>102 S.Ct. at 1194, 1195, 1196 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>Here La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 51:194 clearly applies to \u201cat least some of the items sold by\u201d appellees, and its \u201cmore ambiguous scope ... in other respects\u201d as well as \u201cconfusion over whether\u201d it \u201capplies to certain [other] items\u201d is insufficient in the present context to \u201cjeopardize[ ] the entire\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">We likewise reject the suggestion that the quoted <em>Hoffman Estates </em>language was directed at overbreadth rather than vagueness. The words of that opinion speak for themselves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-6\">\u201cIn a facial challenge to the over-breadth and vagueness of a law, a court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the over-breadth challenge must fail. The court should <em>then examine </em>the <em>facial vagueness </em>challenge and, assuming the enactment implicates no constitutionally protected conduct, should uphold the challenge <em>only </em>if the enactment is impermissibly vague in <em>all of its applications. </em>A plaintiff who engages in <em>some </em>conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-7\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals in this case did not explicitly consider ... whether the ordinance is vague in all of its applications. Instead, the court determined that the ordinance is void for vagueness because it is unclear in <em>some </em>[emphasis in original] of its applications to the conduct of Flipside and of other hypothetical parties. Under a proper analysis, however, the ordinance is not facially invalid. <em>U</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1117-9\"><em>\u201cA </em>law that does not reach constitutionally protected conduct and therefore satisfies the overbreadth test may nevertheless be challenged on its face as <em>unduly vague, </em>in violation of due process. To succeed, however, the complainant must demonstrate that the law is impermissibly <em>vague in all of its applications.\u201d </em>102 S.Ct. at 1191-92, 1193 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">Finally, we do not believe that <em>Kolender </em>substantially modifies <em>Hoffman Estates. </em>In <em>Kolender, </em>the Court was not faced with a purely economic regulation, such as section 51:194 and the ordinance considered in <em>Hoffman Estates. See </em>102 S.Ct. at 1193. Perhaps more importantly, in <em>Kolender </em>the Court particularly noted that \u201c[o]ur concern here is based upon the \u2018potential for arbitrarily suppressing First Amendment liberties\u2019 [quoting <em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, </em>382 U.S. 87, 86 S.Ct. 211, 213, 15 L.Ed.2d 176 (1965) ] ... [and on the fact that the statute] implicates consideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 1859. No such substantive constitutional considerations are present here, nor were they in <em>Hoffman Estates. </em>These two factors\u2014 whether conduct substantively protected by the Constitution was reached and whether the regulation was purely <em>economic </em>\u2014 were the grounds on which <em>Kolender </em>expressly distinguished <em>Hoffman Estates. See Kolender, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1859 n. 8. Under these criteria, the present case necessarily falls within the rule of <em>Hoffman Estates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">Applying <em>Hoffman Estates </em>in a commonsense rather than a literal spirit, we remain of the view that the district court erred in its ruling herein that section 51:194 is void for vagueness on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">Appellees\u2019 remaining contentions are adequately addressed in our original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">Treating the suggestion for rehearing en banc as a petition for panel rehearing, it is ordered that the petition for panel rehearing is DENIED. No member of the panel nor judge in regular active service of this Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35), the suggestion for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-14\">The mandate shall now issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">This is made plain by the prayer for relief in appellees' complaint, which requested invalidation as to the sale or offer to sell anywhere by any appellee of <em>\u201cany </em>product on a Sunday\" (emphasis added). The only other request or statement of entitlement to declaratory relief is contained in the allegation of paragraph 19 of the complaint that appellees \u201care entitled to a declaratory judgment in the form set forth in the prayer below.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
