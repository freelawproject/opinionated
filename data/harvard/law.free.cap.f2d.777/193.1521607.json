Transworld Drilling Co., Ltd., </em>648 F.2d 1015 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1019, 102 S.Ct. 1714, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982). It therefore remanded to the trial court to ascertain (1) how long the defendants\u2019 barge had been operating in the Persian Gulf area; (2) whether it was assigned there on a long- or short-term basis; and (3) what functions it was capable of performing. With this information, the court was to decide whether American law was applicable, and whether dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens </em>was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-27\">On remand, the McDermott defendants renewed their motion to dismiss. In conjunction with the motion, they submitted the affidavit of Timothy Zimmerman, McDermott\u2019s Manager of Equipment Coordination. The affidavit stated that the barge was based in the Arabian Gulf from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>1976 to 1982 and used to carry building supplies to offshore drilling sites. R. 686. Apparently satisfied that dismissal was proper under <em>Chiazor, </em>the district court granted the motion, conditioned upon defendants\u2019 amenability to suit in a more convenient forum. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The district court has broad discretion to dismiss an action for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>particularly if it determines that American law does not apply. An appellate court will review the choice of law determination <em>de novo, </em>but, finding no legal error, may disturb the dismissal only upon a clear showing of abuse. <em>E.g., Bailey v. Dolphin International, Inc., </em>697 F.2d 1268, 1274 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Chiazor, </em>648 F.2d at 1017-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that this case is legally indistinguishable from <em>Bailey, </em>697 F.2d 1268. Contrary to James\u2019 assertion that the death resulted from a collision of two ships on the high seas, the two vessels here were relatively stationary, working in the oil fields in the shallower waters off the U.A.E. coast. In addition, no substantial nexus exists between the forum and the suit: as <em>Bailey </em>establishes, defendants\u2019. American base of operations alone is not enough. <em>See id. </em>at 1275, and cases cited therein. Thus, we agree with the trial court\u2019s tacit conclusion that American law does not apply, and find no abuse of discretion in its decision to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On appeal, James, for the first time, points to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights, Dec. 7, 1927, <em>as amended, </em>Dec. 18,1935, United States\u2014 Honduras, 45 Stat. 2618, T.S. No. 764. This treaty guarantees Honduran nationals access to American forums, <em>inter alia, </em>to litigate wrongful death actions on the same footing as American citizens. <em>Id. </em>arts. III. James argues essentially that, as a result of the treaty, the district court should have considered her as an American citizen for purposes of the choice of law and <em>forum non conveniens </em>balancings.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">This court has never considered the effect of forum-access treaty provisions in this context.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not decide the question here, however, because James failed to raise it before the trial court. As an appellate court, we cannot consider new issues which raise factual questions not argued below. <em>E.g., Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Robertson, </em>713 F.2d 1151, 1166 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see also Cheng v. Boeing Co., </em>708 F.2d 1406, 1411 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1017, 104 S.Ct. 549, 78 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983) (appellate court would not consider fact that Taiwanese courts did not admit suits by foreign plaintiffs where American appellants failed to raise issue to trial court weighing <em>forum non conveniens </em>factors). Here, James had ample opportunity to call the trial court\u2019s attention to the treaty provisions on any of the three occasions when that court was ruling on the choice of <em>law/forum non conveniens </em>motions. The record is bare of any reference to it. Moreover, she has not even attempted to explain or excuse this omission. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of her suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-19\">. The opinion sets out in detail the facts and long procedural history of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">. We note that courts in other circuits have partially accepted James\u2019 interpretation of the provisions, <em>e.g., Pain v. United Technologies Corp., </em>637 F.2d 775, 795-99 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1128, 102 S.Ct. 980, 71 L.Ed.2d 116 (1981); <em>Alcoa Steamship Co., Inc. v. M/V Nordic Regent, </em>654 F.2d 147, 152-53 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 890, 101 S.Ct. 248, 66 L.Ed.2d 116 (1980); <em>Farmanfarmaian v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>588 F.2d 880, 882 (2d Cir.1978); nevertheless, despite such provisions, these courts have dismissed the suits where the balance weighs in favor of another forum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
