EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">The petitioner, Mary Jane Ruderman Hirschey, seeks an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the prevailing party in a case against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the Federal Power Act (\u201cFPA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to her initial petition for fees and costs, we held that Ms. Hirschey is eligible for an award of fees, but not costs, for \u201cproceedings at the judicial level.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now determine the amount of fees due.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">The case underlying this fee petition concerned Hirschey\u2019s claim for an exemption from the licensing requirements of the FPA in order to develop a small hydroelectric project. Petitioner filed an application for an exemption in December, 1981, which became effective on June 7, 1982. On July 20, 1982, the Commission, <em>sua sponte, </em>issued an order vacating the petitioner\u2019s exemption. Hirschey subsequently filed a petition for review with this court, which was dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a futile attempt to file a petition for rehearing with the Commission, Hirschey filed a second petition for review with this court. On this second attempt, we upheld her claim to an exemption in <em>Hirschey </em>7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner then applied in a timely fashion for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-22\">Due to a paperwork error in the Court Clerk\u2019s office, consideration of the petitioner\u2019s EAJA claim was greatly delayed. In <em>Hirschey </em>77,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we held that attorneys\u2019 fees may be granted under EAJA in a case arising under the FPA, although section 317 of the FPA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> bars an award of costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>We also determined that the petitioner is eligible for a fee award under EAJA<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for proceedings at the judicial level and established a timetable for additional filings and for discovery by the Government. We remanded the petitioner\u2019s request for fees for proceedings at the agency level for consideration and initial determination by the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">A. <em>Eligible Hours</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The petitioner requests this court to assess fees against the Government for four separate stages of the proceedings in this case. First, she claims that certain aspects of her representation before the agency were necessarily related to the issues successfully raised on appeal and that she is entitled to recover for this portion of the proceedings before FERC. We clearly rejected this claim in <em>Hirschey II </em>when we remanded the matter for initial determination by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Second, the petitioner submits the hours spent on her first unsuccessful appeal to this court. Because this appeal was dismissed as premature, petitioner was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the action. Petitioner thus fails to meet the EAJA requirements <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for an award of fees for her initial appeal. The Commission concedes that some of the legal research done for the unsuccessful appeal was useful in <em>Hirschey I </em>and should be compensated. We agree, and find that, of the hours in question, 35.55 hours of research (21.5 partner and 14.05 associate) are related to <em>Hirschey I </em>and eligible for a fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">Third, Hirschey has documented the hours spent on the appeal in <em>Hirschey I </em>between September 20, 1982, and March 1, 1983. In discovery, the Commission identified certain hours that were related to proceedings before the agency and to Hirschey\u2019s unsuccessful effort to oppose intervention by Long Lake Energy Corporation. We have eliminated those hours and determine that 319.5 partner hours and 8.6 associate hours are reasonably compensable for this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">Fourth, the petitioner requests fees for work connected with the EAJA fee application. Cases in this Circuit have routinely awarded reasonable fees incurred in requesting fees under fee-shifting statutes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we find that Hirschey should receive fees for expenses incurred in her successful EAJA action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Commission does not challenge the accuracy of the time claimed, it argues that the fee award for this work should be limited to the litigation of <em>Hirschey II. </em>On this point, the Commission suggests that petitioner\u2019s supplemental fee application was made necessary only because her initial fee application was inadequate. However, no such implication should be drawn from our opinion in <em>Hirschey II. </em>The Commission overlooks the fact that the litigation on fees was extended because <em>it </em>requested discovery. In addition, the focus in <em>Hirschey II </em>was not on whether the petitioner\u2019s claims for fees were reasonable, but on whether Hirschey was entitled to an award at all. If the fee application has been bifurcated, it is because of the Commission\u2019s opposition to Hirschey\u2019s EAJA claim. Accordingly, since the hours claimed are not otherwise in dispute, we find that the petitioner is entitled to include 319.25 partner hours and 82.7 associate hours for work on the fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">B. <em>The Appropriate Rate</em></p>\n<p id=\"Af\">The appropriate rate for \u201cfees or other expenses\u201d under EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), is defined in subsection 2412(d)(2), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">(2) for the purposes of this subsection\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">(A) \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d includes ... reasonable attorney fees (The amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that ... (ii) attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The petitioner claims that the $75 per hour statutory cap should be adjusted upward for cost-of-living increases and for special factors in the litigation. We agree that the statutory maximum on fees should be increased to reflect changes in the cost-of-living. We also note that this court has held in EAJA claims that we may look beyond the single factor stipulated in the statute to special factors, such as \u201cthe contingent nature of success, delay in payment or quality of representation,\u201d in determining whether to adjust the statutory cap.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find that delay in payment is the only special factor that warrants an increase in the statutory rate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">The petitioner urges that an additional increase in the fee award is appropriate because the delay caused by the Commission\u2019s illegal conduct has added to her costs for developing her hydropower project. This argument misconstrues the purposes of EAJA. The fee limitation reflects an attempt to provide reasonable compensation for successful litigants, while simultaneously containing costs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> EAJA does not provide general indemnification against the consequences of litigation or of agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">We likewise find inapposite the petitioner\u2019s claim that <em>ex parte </em>contacts between a FERC Commissioner and parties with interests opposed to petitioner\u2019s on the issue of FPA exemptions constitutes bad faith by the Commission which justifies a rate increase. Bad faith sometimes may be a consideration under subsection 2412(b), but the question of impermissible <em>ex parte </em>contacts was not an issue in either <em>Hirschey I </em>or <em>Hirschey II, </em>and the belated attempt to raise the question now is unavailing. The award to petitioner is therefore limited to a recovery of fees under 2412(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">We also reject the petitioner\u2019s invo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cation of a special factor for contingency.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An upward adjustment of an award to compensate for the risk of losing a lawsuit \u201cis permissible only in an exceptional case.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Here the petitioner has conceded that the risk in her case was far from exceptional by stating that \u201cthe probability of ultimately prevailing on the issue was not seriously in doubt to Counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We agree that the result in <em>Hirschey I </em>was hardly surprising.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">As noted above, petitioner\u2019s request for a cost-of-living increase in the $75 rate is an appropriate adjustment as authorized by subsection 2412(d)(2) of EAJA. We reject the Commission\u2019s argument that recent amendments to EAJA,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which did not alter the $75 fee limit, compel us to regard that amount as fully compensatory and deny a cost-of-living increase.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> First, the original enactment of EAJA applies to this case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, even if the amendments applied, they do not alter any aspect of 28 U.S.C. section 2412(d)(2)(A). The provision for a cost-of-living increase remains unchanged and therefore applies as it did originally. Consequently, we approve a cost-of-living increase in the statutory cap to $89.73.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We should emphasize here that the statutory cost-of-living adjustment authorized by subsection 2412(d)(2) increases the maximum rate designated in the same subsection, not the attorneys\u2019 prevailing market rate. The $89.73 reflects this adjustment. In the instant case there is no dispute that both the actual billed rate and the prevailing market rate for partners\u2019 hours exceeded $89.73 throughout the entire period of this litigation. Hence the petitioner is entitled to compensation for partners\u2019 hours at a rate of $89.73. Associates\u2019 hours were billed at $85 throughout the litigation. The government concedes this fact, and the petitioner has submitted documentation that the $85 rate was within the range of prevailing market rates for associates of comparable experience.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cIn almost every case, the firms\u2019 established billing rates will provide fair compensation,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and there has been no showing that this case is an exception. Therefore we find that $85 is an adequate rate for associates\u2019 time. Because this rate is lower than the $89.73 maximum allowed by subsection 2412(d)(2) following cost-of-living adjustment, the statutory cap does not come into play in determining compensation for associates\u2019 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">We recognize that there is arguably a question whether we should limit the fees for the hours billed each year by the adjusted statutory maximum applicable <em>for that year, </em>or rather limit them only by the <em>current </em>statutory maximum. We will adopt the latter approach, in order to compensate petitioner for delay, as we are authorized to do under the \u201cspecial factors\u201d criterion in EAJA.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">Pursuant to the foregoing findings and conclusions, the petitioner is due a total of $68,198.98 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>C. <em>Expenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Under the category of expenses, the petitioner seeks payment for work performed by paralegals, consultant fees, a portion of secretarial expenses and office overhead and \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d expenses such as photocopying, postage, taxi fares and secretarial overtime. EAJA provides that awardable expenses \u201cincluded the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, [and] the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We have previously found that expenses such as postage and taxi fares are not compensable under EAJA,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and in <em>Hirschey II </em>we held that the FPA precludes an award of costs, which include photocopying and filing fees.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> These claims do not merit further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We also reject the petitioner\u2019s claim for overhead and secretarial expenses, which are traditionally covered by attorneys\u2019 fees and not charged separately. The engineering consultant fees for which Hirschey seeks reimbursement were not relevant to the resolution of either <em>Hirschey I </em>or <em>Hirschey II; </em>therefore, no expenses may be awarded for the consultant\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The Commission does not object to compensation for work by paralegals as an expense item or to the rate the petitioner suggests, which we find reasonable. When the hours performed by paralegals on the first appeal are reduced to those related to the successful appeal, the petitioner is entitled to an award for 285.6 hours at $30 per hour. In addition, a charge of $142.61 for computer research is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In sum, we award the petitioner a total of $8710.61 in expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">For the reasons discussed above, we award the petitioner a total of $76,909.59 in attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-14\">. <em>See Hirschey </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>701 F.2d 215 (D.C.Cir.1983) (hereinafter cited as <em>Hirschey I).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b72-15\">. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a <em>et seq. </em>(1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-16\">. <em>Hirschey v.

I join the court\u2019s opinion with the exception of the dictum discussed below. I write separately principally to clarify several points in the current opinion related to my earlier dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">I agree that the petitioner can be compensated for the attorneys\u2019 fees expended in litigating her right to attorneys\u2019 fees, even though the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d defense to the assessment of EAJA fees, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (1982), literally applies to the conduct of the fee litigation as well as to the conduct of the substantive suit, and even though in my view (as my earlier dissent suggests) FERC\u2019s litigation of the fee issues was amply justified. The defense of substantial justification for the fee litigation was not asserted by the government, and as I understand the opinion, Maj. op. at 3 n. 15, we have declined to resolve the applicability of that defense here, just as we have declined to resolve it in other cases where the point was not argued, <em>see Cinciarelli v. Reagan, </em>729 F.2d 801, 810 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Martin v. Lauer, </em>740 F.2d 36, 44-45 n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1984). I further note that there was not argued, and we have not considered, the effect of the fact that in the present case the fees awarded for litigating fee issues substantially exceeded the value of the litigated fees themselves \u2014 or, to put it another way, the fees awarded for litigating fees substantially exceeded the fees awarded for litigating petitioner\u2019s substantive grievance. The Supreme Court currently has before it the analogous question of whether there must be some proportionality between the fees awarded and the recovery in the underlying case. <em>See City of Riverside </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>v. Rivera, </em>763 F.2d 1580 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 244, 88 L.Ed.2d 253 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">While not contesting that <em>Hirschey II </em>is now the law of this circuit, I must nonetheless dissociate myself from the dictum of the court \u2014 which may be given effect in other circuits \u2014 that the legislative history of the 1985 EAJA amendments \u201cratifies the holding of the majority opinion in <em>Hirschey II.\u201d </em>Maj. op. at 2 n. 9. <em>Hirschey II </em>and the three decisions of other circuits reaching the same result (two of which, like <em>Hirschey II </em>itself, were accompanied by dissents), present a conflict with the contrary holding of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Tulalip Tribes v. FERC, </em>749 F.2d 1367, 1369 (9th Cir.1984), rather than the sort of uniform judicial interpretation that Congress, by unamended reenactment of the subject provision, may be deemed to have approved. <em>See, e.g., Lorillard.v. Pons, </em>434 U.S. 575, 580-81, 98 S.Ct. 866, 869-70, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978). The entire case for the majority\u2019s asserted \u201cratification\u201d of <em>Hirschey II </em>rests upon the following statement in the House Committee Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-18\">The language of section 2412(d)(1)(A) expresses the view that prevailing parties shall be awarded attorney\u2019s fees and, when available, costs as well. This interpretation ratifies the approach taken by four circuits. [Citing, <em>inter alia, Hirschey II. </em>] ... Thus, the Committee rejects the interpretations of the statute by the 9th Circuit. See <em>Tulalip </em>Tribes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">H.R. Rep. No. 120, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1985), 1985 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 132, 145. It is most interesting that the House Committee rejected the interpretation of the Ninth Circuit, and perhaps that datum should be accorded the weight of an equivalently unreasoned law review article. But the authoritative, as opposed to the persuasive, weight of the Report depends entirely upon how reasonable it is to assume that that rejection was reflected in the law which <em>Congress </em>adopted. I frankly doubt that it is ever reasonable to assume that the details, as opposed to the broad outlines of purpose, set forth in a committee report come to the attention of, much less are approved by, the house which enacts the committee\u2019s bill.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And I think it time for courts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>become concerned about the fact that routine deference to the detail of committee reports, and the predictable expansion in that detail which routine deference has produced, are converting a system of judicial construction into a system of committee-staff prescription. But the authority of the committee report in the present case is even more suspect than usual. Where a committee-generated report deals with the meaning of a committee-generated text, one can at least surmise that <em>someone </em>selected these statutory words to convey this intended meaning. The portion of the report at issue here, however, comments upon language drafted in an earlier Congress, and reenacted, <em>unamended </em>so far as is relevant to the present point, in the 1985 law. We are supposed to believe that the legislative action recommended by the Committee and adopted by the Congress, in order to resolve a difficult question of interpretation that had produced a conflict in the circuits and internal disagreement within three of the five courts that had considered it, was <em>reenactment of the same language unchanged). </em>Such a supposition is absurd on its face; and doubly absurd since the precise section <em>was </em>amended in 1985 on such a point of minute detail as changing an \u201cand\u201d to \u201cor.\u201d Pub.L. No. 99-80, \u00a7 2(a)(1), 99 Stat. 183, 184 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In sum, even if the 1985 EAJA amendments had been relevant to our determination in <em>Hirschey II, </em>I think the question should still have been resolved, as it was, not on the basis of what the committee report said, but on the basis of what we judged to be the most rational reconciliation of the relevant provisions of law Congress had adopted. I was disappointed that the court did not reconcile them as I would have, but I at least had the comfort, which implementation of the dictum here under discussion would deny me, of thinking that the court was wrong for the right reason.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">. Several years ago, the following illuminating exchange occurred between members of the Senate, in the course of floor debate on a tax bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. ... My question, which may take [the chairman of the Committee on Finance] by surprise, is this: Is it the intention of the chairman that the Internal Revenue Service and the Tax Court and other courts take guidance as to the intention of Congress from the committee report which accompanies this bill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, will the Senator tell me whether or not he wrote the committee report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-12\">Mr. DOLE. Did I write the committee report? Mr. ARMSTRONG. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-13\">Mr. DOLE. No; the Senator from Kansas did not write the committee report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-14\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. Did any Senator write the committee report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-15\">Mr. DOLE. I have to check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-16\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. Does the Senator know of any Senator who wrote the committee report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-17\">Mr. DOLE. I might be able to identify one, but I would have to search. I was here all during the time it was written, I might say, and worked carefully with the staff as they worked____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-22\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, has the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Finance Committee, read, the committee report in its entirety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-23\">Mr. DOLE. I am working on it. It is not a bestseller, but I am working on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-24\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, did members of the Finance Committee vote on the committee report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-25\">Mr. DOLE. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-26\">Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. President, the reason I raise the issue is not perhaps apparent on the surface, and let me just state it: ____ The report itself is not considered by the Committee on Finance. It was not subject to amendment by the Committee on Finance. It is not subject to amendment now by the Senate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-29\">... If there were matter within this report which was disagreed to by the Senator from Colorado or even by a majority of all Senators, there would be no way for us to change the report.
