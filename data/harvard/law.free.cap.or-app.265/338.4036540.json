In a supplemental restitution judgment, the juvenile court ordered youth to pay restitution in the amount of $1,054.22 to the Oregon Department of Justice and $292 to the victim\u2019s parents. <em>See </em>ORS 419C.450(l)(a) (restitution awarded when a youth offender \u201ccaused another person any physical, emotional or psychological injury or any loss of or damage to property\u201d). On appeal from that supplemental judgment, youth asserts that the court erred in ordering him to pay $152 of restitution for costs incurred by the victim\u2019s parents in restoring their cellular phone service and obtaining phone records. According to youth, \u201c[t]he juvenile court erred as a matter of law in finding that the state proved, by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d that he caused the victim\u2019s parents to incur those damages. (Boldface omitted.) The state concedes that \u201cthe award of restitution for costs incurred by the victim\u2019s parents in restoring their cell phone service and obtaining cell phone records is not supported by sufficient evidence that those costs were required as the result of youth\u2019s conduct toward the victim.\u201d We agree and accept the concession. <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Dickerson, </em>100 Or App 95, 97, 784 P2d 1121 (1990) (\u201cThere are three prerequisites for an award of restitution: (1) criminal activity, (2) pecuniary damages and (3) a causal relationship between the two.\u201d). Accordingly, the supplemental judgment must be reversed and remanded for the juvenile court to enter a judgment awarding restitution in the amount of $1,054.22 to the Oregon Department of Justice and $140 \u2014 rather than $292 \u2014 to the victim\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment awarding victim\u2019s parents $140 in restitution; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
