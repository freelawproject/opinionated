The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the board) upheld that denial under ORS 656.262(15), determining that claimant failed to prove that her failure to cooperate was \u201cfor reasons beyond [her] control.\u201d ORS 656.262(15). On review of the board\u2019s order under ORS 656.298, we affirm, concluding that the board\u2019s decision rests on a correct interpretation of ORS 656.262 and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Claimant injured her lower back at work in September 2011 and filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation for the injury. Shortly after claimant filed the claim, SAIF sent claimant a letter explaining the claims process and informing claimant of her obligation under ORS 656.262(14) to cooperate with that process. Around the same time, SAIF contacted claimant by phone to alert her that she would need to make a statement about her claim to a SAIF investigator. Claimant did not take any affirmative steps to contact SAIF\u2019s investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">A few weeks later, on October 17, SAIF sent a letter to claimant stating that she had an appointment for an interview on October 21. Claimant did not attend the interview or otherwise contact SAIF. On November 2, SAIF sent a letter to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division (WCD) of the Department of Consumer and Business Services and requested that claimant\u2019s benefits be suspended based on her failure to participate in an interview. That letter was copied to claimant. Two days later, on November 4, WCD sent claimant a letter by certified mail stating that her benefits would be suspended within five working days unless she cooperated with SAIF or demonstrated to WCD that her failure to cooperate with SAIF was reasonable. A member of claimant\u2019s household signed for the letter upon delivery, but claimant did not follow up with either WCD or SAIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Four days later, on November 8, SAIF sent claimant a letter stating that she had 30 days from the date of WCD\u2019s November 4 letter to cooperate with its interview request, or claimant\u2019s claim would be denied. On November 16, claimant\u2019s benefits were suspended in accordance with WCD\u2019s letter, effective November 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">On November 21, claimant left a phone message with a SAIF claims adjuster. The adjuster returned claimant\u2019s call and told claimant that her claim had been suspended and would remain suspended and, ultimately, be denied, if claimant did not contact one of SAIF\u2019s investigators. The adjuster gave claimant the number for the investigator on her claim. Claimant did not follow up with the investigator or otherwise, and, on December 5, SAIF denied claimant\u2019s claim for failure to cooperate with the claims process.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">More than a month later, claimant requested, and was granted, an expedited hearing under ORS 656.262(15) and ORS 656.291 on SAIF\u2019s denial. Claimant\u2019s theory as to why the denial should be set aside was that claimant \u201cdid completely and fully cooperate with the investigation and that if she didn\u2019t, it was for reasons beyond her control.\u201d In support of that theory, claimant testified that her brother died unexpectedly on October 9, and that two days later, her mother discovered her brother\u2019s body at his apartment while claimant waited outside the apartment. Claimant further testified that she was depressed as a result of her brother\u2019s death and that she had not opened the letter notifying her of the October 21 interview until after the date had passed. Claimant acknowledged that she had received the other communications from SAIF regarding the need for an interview, but had not followed up. Claimant also reported that she had been in a motor vehicle accident on November 3 in which she sprained her spine. Claimant did not miss any work because of the accident; claimant reported that she had missed one day of work in connection with her brother\u2019s death. Claimant also testified that, after she had her motor vehicle accident, she had contacted her insurance company, and the company had been paying her medical bills incurred as a result of the accident. Claimant\u2019s mother also testified that claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s death had been \u201creally hard\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>claimant \u201cbecause it was the first death in her immediate family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Following the hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an order setting aside SAIF\u2019s noncooperation denial. The ALJ found that claimant had not proved that she cooperated with SAIF\u2019s request for an interview or that SAIF\u2019s request for an interview was unreasonable. However, the ALJ found that claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s death and claimant\u2019s motor vehicle accident, which the ALJ found were both beyond claimant\u2019s control, were the reasons for claimant\u2019s failure to comply with SAIF\u2019s interview request.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">SAIF requested review before the board. On <em>de novo </em>review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the board determined that claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s death and claimant\u2019s motor vehicle accident were circumstances beyond her control that could, in theory, excuse her noncooperation if they were, in fact, the reasons for her noncooperation. The board found, however, that it was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that those circumstances were the reasons for claimant\u2019s noncooperation. Instead, the board found that claimant\u2019s \u201clack of diligence\u201d was the reason that she failed to comply with SAIF\u2019s interview request. Based on that finding, the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order and reinstated SAIF\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s claim. One board member dissented, stating that she would have found that claimant was overwhelmed by her brother\u2019s death and her motor vehicle accident, and that those events were the reasons that claimant did not cooperate with SAIF\u2019s interview request. Claimant timely petitioned this court for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">ORS 183.482(7) and (8) supply the standards of review applicable for our review of board orders. ORS 656.298(7). On review, claimant assigns error to the board\u2019s determination that she did not demonstrate that her failure to cooperate was \u201cfor reasons beyond [her] control\u201d within the meaning of ORS 656.262(15). To the extent that assignment of error implicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the board\u2019s interpretation of ORS 656.262(15), we review to determine whether the board \u201cerroneously interpreted\u201d that provision. ORS 183.482(8)(a). To the extent that assignment of error contests the board\u2019s factual finding that the reason for claimant\u2019s noncooperation was her lack of diligence\u2014 not her brother\u2019s death and the motor vehicle accident \u2014 we review for substantial evidence. ORS 183.482(8)(c). \u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are not permitted to substitute our judgment for that of the board with respect to any issue of fact. ORS 183.482(7). The issue before us is not whether we \u2014 or another reasonable factfinder \u2014 reasonably could have found the facts differently; the issue is whether the board found the facts reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">ORS 656.262(15) governs the denial of a workers\u2019 compensation claim based on a claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate with the investigation of the claim. It provides that, when an insurer or self-insured employer denies a claim for failure to cooperate, a claimant may request a hearing for the purpose of demonstrating that the denial should be set aside. ORS 656.262(15). To prevail, the claimant must prove one of three things: (1) that claimant, in fact, \u201cfully and completely cooperated with the investigation\u201d; (2) that claimant \u201cfailed to cooperate for reasons beyond the [claimant\u2019s] control\u201d; or (3) that SAIF\u2019s \u201cinvestigative demands were unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On review, claimant contends that the board erred in sustaining SAIF\u2019s denial because, in her view, she proved (1) that she fully and completely cooperated with SAIF\u2019s investigation; (2) that SAIF\u2019s investigative demands were unreasonable; and (3) that any failure to cooperate was due to reasons beyond her control. However, claimant did not challenge the ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant had failed to cooperate with SAIF\u2019s investigative demands before the board. In addition, claimant did not contest the reasonableness of SAIF\u2019s investigative demands before either the ALJ or the board. As a result, claimant did not exhaust those arguments before the board, and they accordingly provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>no grounds for us to review (or reverse) the board\u2019s order because the board did not have the opportunity to rule on them. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-4\">\u201c[t]he workers\u2019 compensation scheme reflects the well-established principle that a party must exhaust his or her administrative remedies before seeking further review. * * * [A] party does not exhaust his or her administrative remedies \u2018simply by stepping through the motions of the administrative process without affording the agency an opportunity to rule on the substance of the dispute.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Everett v. SAIF, </em>179 Or App 112, 118-19, 38 P3d 952, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 76 (2002) (quoting <em>Mullenaux v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>293 Or 536, 541, 651 P2d 724 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">That leaves claimant\u2019s contention that the board erred when it determined that claimant had not proved that her failure to cooperate was \u201cfor reasons beyond [her] control.\u201d ORS 656.262(15). To the extent that claimant argues that the board\u2019s order rests on a misinterpretation of the statute, we disagree. The board\u2019s order reflects that it interpreted the statute to require claimant to show that reasons beyond claimant\u2019s control were the cause of claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate with SAIF\u2019s investigation. That interpretation is consistent with the plain text of the statute. ORS 656.262(15) states that a worker must show that any failure to cooperate was <em>\u201cfor </em>reasons beyond the worker\u2019s control.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cfor\u201d in this context is \u201cbecause of\u2019 or \u201con account of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>886 (unabridged ed 2002). The statute thus, by its terms, requires a worker to prove that any failure to cooperate was <em>because of </em>\u2014 in other words, causally connected to \u2014 reasons beyond the worker\u2019s control. That is how the board interpreted it, as evidenced by the board\u2019s factual inquiry into whether claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s death and the motor vehicle accident (circumstances beyond claimant\u2019s reasonable control) were the cause of claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate, or if, instead, claimant\u2019s lack of diligence was the cause of her failure to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">To the extent that claimant challenges the board\u2019s factual finding that claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate was because of her lack of diligence, and not because of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>brother\u2019s death and the motor vehicle accident, our standard of review is dispositive. That is so because the whole record in this case does not <em>compel </em>a particular finding regarding the reason for claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate with SAIF\u2019s request for an interview. True, a reasonable factfinder could infer on this record, as the ALJ and dissenting board member did, that claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate stemmed from the traumatic events that she confronted and, thus, was for reasons beyond her control. However, the record also permits the contrary inference reached by the board: that claimant\u2019s lack of diligence, rather than those events beyond her control, caused her failure to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In particular, as the board observed, claimant testified only that she was depressed around the time that SAIF\u2019s October 17 letter arrived and did not open that letter promptly. But claimant provided no explanation for why she did not contact SAIF after she did open the letter and for why she otherwise failed to follow up on SAIF\u2019s request for an interview over the ensuing month and a half. With respect to SAIF\u2019s subsequent communications regarding the interview, claimant\u2019s only explanation was that she \u201cjust never followed up on it.\u201d Claimant also testified that she had missed only one day of work as a result of her brother\u2019s death and that she had not missed work at all as a result of her motor vehicle accident. She further testified that she was able to initiate the claims process with her insurance company in connection with the motor vehicle accident, and that, as a result, her insurance company was paying her medical bills. Based on that testimony, a reasonable fact-finder could infer that claimant\u2019s brother\u2019s death and her motor vehicle accident did not interfere with her ability to cooperate with SAIF\u2019s interview request, and that, instead, claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate with SAIF resulted from her own lack of diligence. As a result, the board\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s failure to cooperate was \u201cfor\u201d lack of diligence, rather than \u201cfor reasons beyond [her] control,\u201d is supported by substantial evidence. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the board as to that supported factual determination, ORS 183.482(7), and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> <em>See </em>OAR 438-011-0015(1) (\u201cReview by the board is de novo upon the entire record.\u201d); <em>Grinstead v.
