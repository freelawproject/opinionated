We write only to address defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which she argues, under OEC 404(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the trial court erred by excluding evidence that the complainant had assaulted defendant 10 years previously. We review for errors of law, conclude that the trial court erred in excluding that evidence, and further conclude that that error was not harmless. <em>See State v.

Defendant and the complainant met in 1999, were married for a period of time, and had lived together for approximately 10 years. On the night in question, they were both intoxicated and were arguing at home. They had had problems before. The complainant was scared and left the home. He returned after \u201cmaybe a half hour, or not even that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">When the complainant returned, defendant tried to lock him out of the home, and he forced his way back in; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>stuck his hand in the door and forced it open. He pushed defendant, she \u201ccame at\u201d him, and he pushed her again. The complainant then sat on a chair that he regularly used in the combined kitchen/living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Defendant \u201cthrew to the side or tossed off the counter or the stove\u201d a pot of beans. She then began \u201cthrowing objects and striking the [complainant]\u201d; the objects included a frying pan and a glass ashtray. The complainant sustained injuries to his forehead, head, and neck. He \u201cended up in the bedroom, curled up on the floor with his hands up over his head[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Defendant was charged by indictment with two counts of second-degree assault for causing injury to the complainant by means of a dangerous weapon: the frying pan (Count 1) and the ashtray (Count 2). She was also charged with two counts of unlawful use of a dangerous weapon: the frying pan (Count 3) and the ashtray (Count 4). Defendant raised the defense of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">At trial, to support her defense of self-defense, defendant sought to elicit testimony from the complainant that he had previously assaulted defendant. The trial court excluded that evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cBY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cQ.

But the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014relevance for something ten years ago is sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Defendant was convicted as noted above, and defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On appeal, defendant contends that testimony that the complainant had assaulted defendant 10 years previously was admissible under OEC 404(1) as evidence of the complainant\u2019s character or trait of character. The state responds that \u201cevidence of one fight, ten years earlier, did not demonstrate the victim\u2019s character for violence and thus was not relevant.\u201d The state also contends that, even if the trial court erred in excluding that evidence, that error was harmless because \u201cdefendant\u2019s defense was meritless\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201c [e] ven if the court would have admitted the disputed testimony, defendant could not have thrown the ashtray in self-defense\u201d because defendant attacked the complainant after any potential threat had passed, while the complainant was sitting in his chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">A defendant who has been \u201ccharged with a crime for using physical force against another person may raise the defense of self-defense.\u201d <em>Beisser, </em>258 Or App at 334. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>person\u2019s right to self-defense is governed by ORS 161.209, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-4\">\u201c[A] person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self-defense * * * from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">ORS 161.209 \u201cestablishes that, in general, a person\u2019s right to use force in self-defense depends on the person\u2019s <em>own </em>reasonable belief in the necessity for such action, and not on whether the force used or about to be used on [her] actually was unlawful.\u201d <em>State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 191, 218 P3d 1281 (2009) (emphasis in original). When a defendant raises the defense of self-defense, \u201cevidence of the alleged victim\u2019s prior violent acts toward the defendant is admissible under OEC 404(1).\u201d <em>Beisser, </em>258 Or App at 334 (citing <em>State v. Lunow, </em>131 Or App 429, 885 P2d 731 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In <em>Lunow, </em>the defendant was charged with assault and harassment, and he raised the defense of self-defense. To support that defense, the defendant sought to testify that, a few days before the incident that gave rise to the charges against him, the complainant had hit him three times with her cast, knocking him to the floor. We reversed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that evidence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201cThe plain language of OEC 404(1) permits evidence of a person\u2019s character when it is an essential element of a defense. \u2018Reasonable belief is an element of the defense of self-defense. To the degree that defendant\u2019s belief that he needed to defend himself depended on [the victim\u2019s] character, that character was placed \u2018in issue.\u2019 The incident when [the victim] hit defendant three times with her cast, knocking him to the floor, was probative of the conduct against which defendant would have reasonably believed it necessary to protect himself. It was error to exclude defendant\u2019s testimony of the specific incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><em>Lunow, </em>131 Or App at 435-36 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Applying <em>Lunow </em>to the facts of this case, we conclude that evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior assault on defendant was admissible under OEC 404(1) because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>was relevant to an essential element of the defense of self-defense. Specifically, that evidence was relevant to whether defendant reasonably believed, as she claimed, that she needed to defend herself from the complainant\u2019s aggressive actions \u2014 sticking his hand in the door, forcing the door open, and repeatedly pushing defendant. To the degree that her belief depended on the complainant\u2019s character, his character was placed in issue, and evidence of his previous assault on defendant was probative of that character. Thus, the trial court erred by excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s argument that testimony concerning the complainant\u2019s 10-year-old assault on defendant is inadmissible because it was not relevant to defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense. To support that argument, the state cites <em>State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001), in which the defendant argued that the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence that the defendant claimed was relevant to his defense of self-defense. In <em>Lotches, </em>the victim was a security officer and former police officer, and the defendant claimed that the victim had initiated a gunfight with the defendant that resulted in the victim\u2019s death. In an offer of proof by the defendant, the victim\u2019s previous supervisor testified about two instances, five years earlier, in which the victim \u201chad been called to a situation that had called for an arrest, but either had failed to request backup or to make an arrest [,]\u201d and he \u201calso testified that he had no reason to believe that [the victim] was a violent or aggressive person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. The defendant argued that that testimony about the two instances was relevant to his defense of self-defense because it tended to show that the victim \u201cwas reckless and dangerous, and acted outside of established rules and procedures for police work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rejecting that argument, the Oregon Supreme Court agreed with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that that testimony \u201cdid not establish a character trait for acting in a reckless, erratic, or dangerous manner and, therefore, was not relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Unlike the evidence in <em>Lotches, </em>which the defendant claimed \u201ctended to show that [the victim] was reckless and dangerous, and acted outside of established rules and procedures for police work[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 488, the evidence in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>speaks to defendant\u2019s knowledge of the claimant\u2019s dangerousness because it relates to a specific act of violence and aggression \u2014 the complainant\u2019s previous assault on defendant. The evidence also speaks directly to the nature of the relationship between defendant and the complainant. As defendant argues, defendant and the complainant had been in a long-term relationship, and they brought a mutual history to the charged incident that colored their perceptions of that incident. Because <em>\u201ca </em>person\u2019s right to use force in self-defense depends on the person\u2019s <em>own </em>reasonable belief in the necessity for such action, and not on whether the force used or about to be used on [her] actually was unlawful [,]\u201d evidence that the complainant had assaulted defendant before was relevant to the reasonableness of <em>defendant\u2019s own belief </em>that the complainant was going to assault her again. <em>Oliphant, </em>347 Or at 191 (emphasis in original). Contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, the fact that that assault occurred 10 years previously did not make that evidence not relevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Because we conclude that the trial court erred by excluding defendant\u2019s proffered evidence, we must now determine whether that error was harmless. Evidentiary error is harmless if \u201cthere was little likelihood that the error affected the *** verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). When determining the likelihood that a trial court\u2019s error in excluding evidence affected the verdict, we review the record and consider the \u201ccontent and character of [the] evidence, as well as the context in which it was offered.\u201d <em>State v. Klein, </em>352 Or 302, 314, 283 P3d 350 (2012). If erroneously excluded evidence involves \u201ca central factual issue in the case, it is more likely to have affected the jury\u2019s determination than if it deals with a tangential issue.\u201d <em>Beisser, </em>258 Or App at 337 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">After reviewing the record and considering the content and character of the evidence, as well as the context in which it was offered, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s error in excluding the evidence was harmless. As we have explained, the trial court erred by excluding testimony of the complainant that he had assaulted defendant 10 years previously. Defendant attempted to elicit that testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to support her defense of self-defense \u2014 that she was afraid of the complainant and believed that she was justified in using physical force against him for self-defense from what she reasonably believed to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force against her. Thus, the erroneously excluded evidence went to a central factual issue in the case: the reasonableness of defendant\u2019s own belief that she needed to defend herself from the complainant. Further, the error occurred in the context of a criminal trial in which the state bore the burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and defendant bore no burden of proof. <em>See </em>Oliphant, 347 Or at 190-91 (once a defendant raises self-defense, \u201cthe state has the burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Thus, we cannot say that \u201cthere was little likelihood that the error affected the * * * verdict.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In so concluding, we reject the state\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless because \u201cdefendant\u2019s defense was meritless\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201c[e]ven if the court would have admitted the disputed testimony, defendant could not have thrown the ashtray in self-defense.\u201d To the extent that the state contends that defendant\u2019s defense was meritless because there was <em>not enough </em>evidence to support it, we decline to consider that argument. When conducting a harmlessness analysis, we focus on \u201cthe possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32. In other words, \u201cwe do not determine, as a factfinder, whether the defendant is guilty. That inquiry would invite this court to engage improperly in weighing the evidence and, essentially, retrying the case, while disregarding the error committed at trial, to determine whether the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">To the extent that the state contends that defendant\u2019s defense was meritless because there was <em>not any </em>evidence to support it, that contention fails. The record contains evidence to support defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense: the complainant testified that he and defendant had had problems in the past; that they were fighting; that he was intoxicated; that he shoved his hand in the door and forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the door open while defendant was trying to keep him out of the home; and that he repeatedly pushed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Accordingly, a factfinder could conclude that defendant attempted to lock the complainant out of the home because she was afraid of him, and that, when he forced his way into the home and pushed defendant, she reasonably believed that physical force was necessary to defend herself. The additional fact that the complainant was seated in his chair when defendant began throwing objects and striking the complainant does not compel the conclusion that defendant \u201ccould not have\u201d acted in self-defense, and we reject the state\u2019s argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Conviction on Counts 1, 2, and 4 reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> The trial court merged Counts 1 and 4 with Count 2. It also acquitted defendant of unlawful use of a weapon (Count 3), ORS 166.220.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> OEC 404(1) provides, in part, \u201cEvidence of a person\u2019s character or trait of character is admissible when it is an essential element of a charge, claim or defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> Our analysis and disposition obviate the need to address the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
