J.</author>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In this partition action under ORS 105.205, plaintiff sought to partition a ranch property that she and defendant hold by a deed. The trial court concluded that, according to that deed, she and defendant hold the property as tenants in common in a life estate with cross-contingent remainders. The trial court determined that, as a result of that cotenancy, for a period of more than three years during which defendant excluded plaintiff from the property, plaintiff was entitled to a one-half share of the reasonable rental value for portions of the property, along with a one-half share of the profits from cattle grazing and hay production, less expenses for costs and labor. The trial court ruled that partition was \u201cimpossible,\u201d however, because no evidence had been presented as to the value of either party\u2019s life estate. Plaintiff now argues that the trial court erred by deducting expenses from the ranch\u2019s profits and by denying her claim for partition. Although we conclude that the trial court did not err in dividing the profits and expenses of the property for the period during which plaintiff was excluded, we conclude that the trial court erred when it denied plaintiffs partition claim. Accordingly, we reverse and remand on plaintiffs claim to partition real property and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We set forth the relevant facts in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings, and we review for errors of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Eagles Five, LLC v. Lawton, </em>250 Or App 413, 415, 415-16 n 2, 280 P3d 1017 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(2012). Defendant lived on and operated a ranch comprising several hundred acres that he inherited from his parents. He lived in a house on the property, which was otherwise primarily used as a pasture for cattle grazing and hay production. In 2001, defendant deeded to himself and plaintiff, with whom he had a son, the ranch property \u201cwith rights of survivorship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In 2004, defendant and Bell \u201cA\u201d Grazing Cooperative (Bell) entered into a lease agreement, with an option to purchase, for 160 acres of the ranch property. The agreement provided that Bell would pay defendant $5,000 per year to lease the property and that \u201c[e]ach five year increment of $25,000.00 will be applied toward the total purchase price of $125,000.00.\u201d At the end of any five-year term, Bell could \u201crenew the lease or pay the remaining balance in full for the purchase of said property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Several years later, plaintiffs relationship with defendant broke down. Beginning in 2009, defendant excluded plaintiff from the property. Plaintiff filed suit, seeking partition of the real property \u2014 a partition in kind\u2014 with one half to plaintiff and one half to defendant, after protecting Bell\u2019s interests. In the alternative, plaintiff requested that the \u201cproperty be sold at public sale.\u201d Plaintiff also brought a claim for \u201cone half of the rental moneys collected [f]rom [Bell] and one half of the fair rental value of the remaining real property.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In his answer, defendant stated that \u201cthe partition requested by Plaintiff would be unjust because of the discrepancy in the amount of contribution to the original property and the money, improvements and labor which Defendant has expended on the property.\u201d Defendant also brought a counterclaim for accounting and contribution. In support, he alleged that he \u201cpaid all the expenses regarding the property including but not limited to mortgage payments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>interest payments, taxes, licenses, insurance, maintenance and repairs.\u201d He further alleged that he was \u201centitled to the value of his labor to operate and maintain\u201d the ranch \u201cin the amount of $3,000 a month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The parties presented evidence in support of their claims at a bench trial, and the court later issued a letter opinion and general judgment. As to the agreement with Bell, the trial court concluded that \u201cboth Plaintiff and [defendant] have ratified [that agreement] and they are bound by the terms and conditions thereof.\u201d The court ruled that all future rent payments were to be split equally between plaintiff and defendant, and, upon paying the remaining balance of $75,000, Bell \u201cshall be entitled to a proper deed\u201d from plaintiff and defendant \u201cfree of all encumbrances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The trial court then turned to the claims for accounting and contribution for the years that plaintiff was excluded from the property. The court reasoned that, \u201c[a]bsent the forcible exclusion by one party of the other or other agreement, there is no right or obligation to share profits and expenses between them\u201d and, until the time defendant excluded plaintiff, \u201cneither party had the right to seek compensation from the other for the use of the property.\u201d However, because defendant had excluded plaintiff from the property from 2009 to June 2012, the court determined that plaintiff was entitled to reasonable rent and profits of the property. The court found that the reasonable rental value of the house, separated from the other real estate, was $650 per month; each party was entitled to half that amount. The court also ruled that each party was entitled to one-half of the net profit <em>(i.e., </em>income less expenses) of the pasture and hay production of the property. The real property\u2019s net profit, \u201cafter proper deductions for costs and labor,\u201d was $4,700 in 2009, $4,000 in 2010, and $5,000 for 2011. Further, although the court rejected defendant\u2019s claim that he should be awarded an additional $3,000 per month for his work as a \u201cranch manager,\u201d the court awarded defendant $325 per month \u201cfor labor to manage and maintain the property.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, those values represented an \u201cequitable and just\u201d result, given that plaintiff \u201cmakes no labor contributions and is paid this amount based upon her life estate,\u201d and defendant \u201cmaintains and manages the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>property, and provides the labor, and some non-joint equipment to hay the property.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Finally, with respect to plaintiffs request to partition the property, the trial court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201c[pllaintiff and [defendant] have been the owners as tenants in common in the life estate with cross contingent remainders since 2001 in the real property described in Plaintiffs Complaint. Due to the lack of any evidence as to the value of either [party\u2019s] life estate, nor their life expectancies, partition of the life estate is impossible to perform and Plaintiffs claim to partition the real property is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In its letter opinion, the court acknowledged that, \u201cConcerning future years, ongoing litigation will result in attorney fees and costs that exceed payments to be made or received.\u201d The court then offered a \u201csuggestion of how to address future years\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cI suggest a splitting of the pasture income, and that the parties assign a value for a ton of hay standing in the field after making a reasonable deduction for the cost of growing the hay and maintaining fences, etc. on the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">On appeal, plaintiff first claims that, regarding the time that she was excluded from the ranch, the trial court erred in deducting the expenses of the ranch operation from the ranch profits, half of which were awarded to her. At the start of trial, plaintiff filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>asking the court to prohibit the introduction of evidence regarding those expenses because \u201cordinary expenses are not available as an offset in a partition action.\u201d The trial court did not rule on the motion, explaining that it would allow presentation of the evidence and would later decide how to calculate any division of profits and expenses between the parties. Ultimately, the trial court awarded plaintiff the profits from the pasture and hay production, with \u201cdeductions for costs and labor,\u201d and separately awarded defendant $325 per month \u201cfor labor to manage and maintain the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Generally, \u201cone or more of several tenants in common may occupy realty without incurring liability for payment of rent for use and occupation so long as they do not exclude other cotenants from the exercise of similar rights.\u201d <em>Hanns v. Hanns, </em>246 Or 282, 310, 423 P2d 499 (1967). But where, as here, \u201cone cotenant\u2019s use of the property in fact excludes the others from enjoyment of their interest, the occupying cotenant will be required to reimburse the others for the rental value of their interest.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Protrka, </em>257 Or 23, 33 n 12, 476 P2d 185 (1970). Accordingly, for the time plaintiff was excluded from the property, she was awarded half of the rental value for the house on the property, and she was awarded half of the rental payments that Bell paid to lease 160 acres of the property. With respect to her required contribution, plaintiff correctly notes that she was responsible for any expenses to maintain the property in good repair, as well as expenses such as property taxes, encumbrances on the land, and necessary insurance. <em>See Tri-County Center Trust v. Martin, </em>225 Or App 417, 429, 201 P3d 293, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 258 (2009) (so stating) (citing <em>Palmer, </em>257 Or at 31). And she acknowledges that she was responsible for permanent improvements to the extent and amount they increased the sale value of the property. <em>Palmer, </em>257 Or at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">As for the award of profits from the pasture and hay production of the property,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, plaintiff argues that it was error to deduct costs and labor expenses of the ranch operation. Defendant disagrees, asserting that, for this \u201cincome producing property,\u201d there \u201care only profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>because of labor and money expended to operate the ranch.\u201d We agree with defendant that the award of profits from this part of the ranch operation is subject to a deduction for costs and labor expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">At trial, defendant presented evidence that to keep the land in an appropriate condition for cattle grazing and hay production, he contributed his labor, paid for the labor of others, and incurred other costs; for example, defendant dragged and irrigated fields and repaired cattle fences. Because that work led to an increase in profits from the land, plaintiff, as the beneficiary of those profits for the years she was excluded, is responsible for those efforts to the extent they increased the profits. The Supreme Court has endorsed that kind of equitable division in a case with similar facts, and we have done the same. In <em>Currey et al. v. Smith, </em>105 Or 82, 89-90, 209 P 232 (1922), for example, the court concluded that a nonoccupying cotenant was \u201cnot entitled to damages for rents and profits,\u201d where \u201c[h]e stood by and allowed [the occupying cotenant] to pay the taxes for all those years, to ditch and irrigate the land, to build two miles of fencing, and otherwise to improve the property under a mistaken belief that he was the owner, and such improvements ought to be a fair recompense for any meager profits * * * received from rent.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Albright v. Albright, </em>73 Or App 410, 412-13, 699 P2d 195 (1985), we concluded that a tenant in common who managed property had a common-law duty to account to his cotenant for rents received, and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the managing cotenant was entitled to deduct reasonable expenses that were in line with \u201can industry average evidenced by expert testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, here, the trial court properly took into account defendant\u2019s expenses to generate income from the property, and it did not err in deducting those expenses when awarding plaintiff her share of the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred when it \u201crefused to follow the statutory procedure for partition and refused to appoint referees to partition the property.\u201d Plaintiff asserts that, as a tenant in common of the life estate of the property, she has a right to partition, and the trial court did not have discretion to deny her that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We begin with the statutory framework \u2014 the \u201chierarchy of dispositional alternatives\u201d \u2014 that governs plaintiffs partition action. <em>Fike v. Sharer, </em>280 Or 577, 580, 571 P2d 1252 (1977). ORS 105.205 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cWhen several persons hold real property as tenants in common, in which one or more of them have an estate of inheritance, or for life or years, or when several persons hold as tenants in common a vested remainder or reversion in any real property, any one or more of them may maintain a suit for the partition of the real property according to the respective rights of the persons interested therein, and for a sale of all or a part of the property if it appears that a partition cannot be had without great prejudice to the owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Thus, a person holding real property as a tenant in common\u2014 including a person who holds an \u201cestate * * * for life\u201d in that property \u2014 may bring a suit for partition in <em>kind </em>\u2014 i.e., the physical division of the property into separate portions. <em>Id.; see also Church v. Woods, </em>190 Or App 112, 117, 77 P3d 1150 (2003) (explaining that, where the parties hold \u201can undivided life estate in the real property with a cross-contingent remainder,\u201d each \u201cinterest is divisible, in that it may be partitioned and sold, even though neither co-owner can force the sale of the estate in fee simple before the other dies\u201d). Where that partition in kind cannot be had \u201cwithout great prejudice,\u201d the court may order a public sale. ORS 105.205. And if the court finds great prejudice would result from a public sale, it may order a private sale. ORS 105.210. In short, the statutes \u201ccontemplate [] only two outcomes to a partition suit: partition in kind or sale.\u201d <em>Maupin v. Opie, </em>156 Or App 52, 62, 964 P2d 1117, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 194 (1998). Under that framework, plaintiff seeks the partition of the property for life or, in the alternative, the sale of the parties\u2019 life estates. As she explains, \u201c[i]f the property is partitioned in kind, then on the death of the first to die, his or her life estate ends and the survivor owns the entire property,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and \u201c[i]f the property is sold, the party buying the property acquires the right to use the entire property until the death of the first to die.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We start with the threshold question in any partition action: whether plaintiff is entitled to a partition in kind of the property. <em>See Miller v. Miller, </em>101 Or App 371, 377, 790 P2d 1184 (1990) (stating that the partition statutes express \u201ca statutory preference for partition in kind\u201d). Here the trial court determined that, because plaintiff holds an undivided one-half interest for life in the property as a tenant in common, plaintiff had a right to a partition in kind.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ORS 205.240 (\u201cThe rights of the plaintiffs and defendants may be put in issue, tried and determined in the suit.\u201d). Having made that determination, the trial court could then order a partition, ORS 105.205, and appoint referees to \u201cdivide the property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights of the parties as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>determined by the court.\u201d ORS 105.255. The trial court did not take those steps, however, concluding that partition was \u201cimpossible\u201d because there was no evidence of the value of the parties\u2019 life estates or life expectancies. In light of the dispositional alternatives set out in the partition statutes, that ruling was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">To be sure, the value of each party\u2019s life estate\u2014 determined in part by each party\u2019s life expectancy \u2014 is relevant to determine whether a sale, rather than a partition in kind, should be ordered because the partition will cause \u201cgreat prejudice\u201d to the party. ORS 105.205; <em>Fike, </em>280 Or at 581 (explaining that the partition statutes lay out the remedies of partition in kind, public sale, and private sale \u201cin order of preference\u201d). The \u201cestablished test\u201d for great prejudice is \u201cwhether the value of the share of each [owner] in case of a partition would be materially less than his share of the money equivalent that could probably be obtained from the whole.\u201d <em>Fike, </em>280 Or at 582 (internal quotation marks omitted). And to make that determination in this case, the trial court would need to determine the value of each party\u2019s life estate in two separate parcels of the ranch property and compare the sum of those values to the market value of the entire ranch property subject to each party\u2019s life estate. That inquiry, in turn, would require the court to determine the life expectancies of the parties. <em>See </em>ORS 105.320 (\u201cAny person entitled to an estate for life or years in any undivided part of the property, whose estate has been sold, shall be entitled to receive such sum in gross as is, deemed, <em>upon principles of law applicable to annuities, </em>a reasonable satisfaction for the estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">But the <em>absence </em>of that evidence is not a basis to <em>deny </em>plaintiffs request for a partition in kind. Just the opposite is true. Where there is no evidence that a partition in kind would cause great prejudice to the owners and a cotenant has shown entitlement to relief under ORS 105.205, ORS 105.245 requires the court to order the partition in kind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cIf it * * * appears <em>by the evidence to the satisfaction of the court </em>* * * that the property or any part of it is so situated that partition cannot be made without great prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>to the owners, the court may order a sale of the property ***. <em>Otherwise, </em>upon the requisite proofs being made, it <em>shall </em>enter a judgment requiring a partition according to the respective rights of the parties, as ascertained by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">(Emphasis added.) Put a different way, evidence that a partition would cause great prejudice enables the court to order a sale rather than a partition in kind, but the lack of that evidence is not a basis to deny plaintiffs request for a partition in kind. For that reason, we have described the right of tenants in common to partition as \u201cabsolute,\u201d even though there are a range of possible remedies in a partition action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Maupin, </em>156 Or App at 61. Where, as here, plaintiff established her right to partition and neither party presented evidence that a partition in kind would cause great prejudice to the parties, ORS 105.245 required the trial court to enter a judgment ordering partition in kind and to appoint referees to partition the property. It follows that the trial court erred when it denied plaintiffs partition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Reversed and remanded on plaintiffs claim to partition real property; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> Plaintiff asserts that our review in this case is <em>de novo. </em>Under the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415(3), Or Laws 2009, ch 231, \u00a7 2, we have discretion to review <em>de novo </em>in this type of case. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (\u201cUpon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, [this court], acting in its sole discretion, may try the cause anew upon the record[.]\u201d); <em>Berger v. Stephan, </em>241 Or App 399, 402, 402 n 5, 250 P3d 954, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 716 (2011) (applying <em>de novo </em>review in a partition action under previous version of statute, but recognizing that 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415 changed standard of review).

An appellant seeking <em>de novo </em>review \u201cshall concisely state the reasons why the court should do so.\u201d ORAP 5.40(8)(a).

Accordingly, we consider only the partition or sale of the life estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\"> On appeal, defendant does not respond to plaintiff\u2019s argument regarding the trial court\u2019s partition ruling and instead asserts that \u201c[t]hese parties are not cotenants as required by the statute\u201d and \u201cOregon\u2019s statutory scheme for partition requires a present co-tenancy[.]\u201d Defendant appears to argue either that (1) the trial court erred in construing the deed and concluding that the parties own the property as tenants in common in the life estate with cross-contingent remainders; or (2) the trial court erred in ruling that plaintiff, as a tenant in common in the life estate of the property, could seek partition or sale of the life estate under ORS 105.205. Neither argument is cognizable because defendant has not filed a cross-appeal. A respondent\u2019s argument must be raised in a cross-appeal when, \u201cif successful, it would yield relief different from that afforded under the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Samuel v. King, </em>186 Or App 684, 690, 64 P3d 1206, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 443 (2003). To the extent that defendant seeks to alter the judgment rather than sustain it, we do not consider defendant\u2019s contentions as to the trial court\u2019s partition ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\"> In <em>McMillan v. Follansbee, </em>194 Or App 145, 151, 93 P3d 809 (2004), we observed that \u201ca cotenant is entitled to obtain a partition of commonly owned property as a matter of right and not merely at the discretion of the court.\u201d Although we also recognized that the right to partition is \u201csubject to limitations\u201d in certain situations, such as when the parties agree that real property will be held in cotenancy and not partitioned, those limitations are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
