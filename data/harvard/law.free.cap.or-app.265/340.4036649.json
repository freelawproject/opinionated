In this consolidated appeal, he first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial during <em>voir dire. </em>We reject that assignment without further discussion. In his second and third assignments of error, he maintains that the trial court erroneously denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal on one count of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of first-degree unlawful sexual penetration. The issue that defendant raises in his second and third assignments is whether a victim who is asleep when the sexual abuse occurs is incapable of consent by reason of being \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 163.427(l)(a)(C) (sexual contact when the victim is incapable of consent \u201cby reason of being * * * physically helpless\u201d is first-degree sexual abuse); ORS 163.411(l)(c) (penetration of \u201cthe vagina * * * with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor\u201d is first-degree unlawful sexual penetration if the victim is \u201cincapable of consent by reason of * * * physical helplessness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Defendant argues, as he did in the trial court, that merely being asleep does not render the victim physically helpless. After the completion of briefing and oral argument in this case, we decided <em>State v. Marker, </em>263 Or App 669, 674, 329 P3d 781 (2014), which rejects the same argument that defendant now makes. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
