J.</author>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Defendant challenges his conviction for unlawful possession of a controlled substance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his car. He maintains that the police officer who stopped him for a traffic violation unlawfully extended the duration of that stop by asking a second officer to finish writing the traffic citation while the first officer sought and received defendant\u2019s consent to search his car. Defendant suggests that the delay caused by the handoff of the citation \u2014 even if only a few seconds \u2014 violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, thus requiring the trial court to suppress the evidence that resulted from the search. The state disagrees that there was an unlawful extension of the stop, noting that the officers \u201cexpeditiously proceed [ed] with the steps necessary to complete the stop.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s suppression motion for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). In doing so, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit factual findings if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>Id. </em>We state the facts consistently with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Officer Haugen stopped defendant for failure to obey a traffic control device and an unsignaled lane change. Defendant presented Haugen with his driver\u2019s license. Haugen radioed for a cover officer as he returned to his patrol car. Haugen conducted a records check, which came back \u201cclear and valid.\u201d He then decided to issue a citation to defendant for an unsignaled lane change. After Haugen began writing the citation, Officer Corning arrived, and Haugen asked him to complete the citation. Corning took over processing the citation, and Haugen approached defendant and asked him to get out of the car. Haugen then asked for and received defendant\u2019s consent to pat him down for weapons. Haugen\u2019s pat-down did not produce any weapons, but he then asked defendant if he could search his car. Defendant consented, and the search revealed two Oxycodone pills. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Defendant admitted to illegally possessing the Oxycodone, and he was ultimately charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence obtained in connection with the search of his car, arguing, among other things, that Haugen unnecessarily extended the traffic stop by asking Corning to complete the citation. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Haugen\u2019s request for consent occurred while Corning was still filling out the citation and that there was no unlawful extension of the traffic stop. The trial court found defendant guilty after a stipulated facts trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Defendant appeals the resulting judgment, reprising his argument from below. He asserts that Haugen, by asking Corning to finish the citation, unlawfully extended the duration of the stop \u201cbecause physically exchanging the citation delayed the completion of the citation.\u201d Defendant recognizes that the exchange between Haugen and Corning \u201cmay have added only a few seconds to the duration of the stop\u201d but asserts that <em>State v. Dennis, </em>250 Or App 732, 740, 282 P3d 955 (2012), controls and that, in that case, we held that the rule against extending the duration of a stop \u201capplies regardless of the length of the extension.\u201d Defendant argues that \u201cHaugen did not need to ask Corning to finish the citation, and thus did so as an alternative to going forward with his duty to expeditiously complete the stop.\u201d Accordingly, defendant maintains that the citation \u201chandoff\u201d between Haugen and Corning extended the duration of the stop, thus subjecting defendant to an unlawful seizure under Article I, section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The state counters that <em>Dennis </em>does not control and that the officers did not unlawfully extend the stop in this case. The state proposes that the proper inquiry is whether the officers were \u201cexpeditiously proceeding with the steps necessary to complete the stop,\u201d not whether the stop was completed in the <em>most </em>expeditious time humanly possible. The state contends that the officers expeditiously moved the investigation and citation process along, such that the traffic stop was not unlawfully extended. The state distinguishes <em>Dennis, </em>complaining that that case occurred in a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>context \u2014 where an officer inquired about a criminal matter unrelated to the traffic stop <em>instead of </em>proceeding with the steps necessary to complete the stop \u2014 whereas here, Haugen\u2019s inquiry occurred while Corning was expeditiously completing the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">We begin with the general framework that governs whether a traffic stop is unlawfully extended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c[A]\u00a1though an officer is free to question a motorist about matters unrelated to the traffic infraction during an unavoidable lull in the investigation, such as while awaiting the results of a records check, that officer is not similarly free to question the motorist about unrelated matters <em>as an alternative </em>to going forward with the next step in processing the infraction, such as the writing or issuing of a citation. When an officer has all of the information necessary to issue a citation but instead delays in processing it or in telling the motorist that he or she is free to go, the stop is no longer lawful unless the officer has reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\"><em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 372, 182 P3d 209 (2008), <em>aff'd sub nom State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Our decision in <em>Dennis </em>was a relatively straightforward application of that framework in the context of whether an officer questioned a motorist about unrelated matters instead of going forward with processing the traffic citation. In <em>Dennis, </em>a police officer stopped the defendant for jaywalking. 250 Or App at 733. The officer radioed dispatch to confirm the defendant\u2019s identification and check for warrants. While waiting for dispatch to respond, the officer asked for consent to search the defendant\u2019s pockets. <em>Id. </em>at 734. The defendant consented, and, among other things, the officer discovered a small container. The officer asked for consent to open it, which the defendant granted, and the officer discovered methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>The defendant moved to suppress the methamphetamine, arguing that the officer had unlawfully extended the stop. The question at the suppression hearing was whether the officer\u2019s request to open the container occurred during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>whether the request occurred at a point when the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>was unable to go forward with the next step in processing the jaywalking violation. <em>Id. </em>at 735. The trial court found that it took 30 seconds for dispatch to respond. However, the officer testified at the suppression hearing that he could not remember if dispatch had responded to his \u201cwarrants check\u201d by the time that he had asked for consent to open the container. The court decided that, even though it could not determine if the officer\u2019s request for consent to open the container occurred before or after dispatch responded, the request was permissible even if the request occurred \u201cright after\u201d dispatch responded, because it was \u201cso close in time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On appeal, first, we explained that an officer can question a motorist about unrelated matters during an unavoidable lull in the stop, but is not similarly free to question a motorist about unrelated matters as an alternative to going forward with the next step in processing the infraction. <em>Id. </em>at 737. We also noted that the state had the burden to prove that a request unrelated to the reason for the stop \u2014 in <em>Dennis, </em>the request to open the container \u2014 occurred during an unavoidable lull. <em>Id. </em>Given that framework, we concluded that the state had failed to prove that the officer\u2019s request to open the container occurred during an unavoidable lull. <em>Id. </em>at 738. Dispatch had taken 30 seconds to respond to the officer\u2019s inquiry, and the officer could not remember if his request for consent had occurred before or after that 30 second \u201cunavoidable lull.\u201d Accordingly, we concluded that there was no evidence from which the trial court could find that the request occurred before dispatch had responded; therefore, the state had failed to carry its burden to prove that the unrelated inquiry had occurred during an unavoidable lull. <em>Id. </em>In doing so, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the stop was not extended \u201cin a constitutionally significant way\u201d because we concluded that unrelated inquiries, \u201cno matter how long,\u201d that occur outside of the unavoidable lull unlawfully extend the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Defendant asserts that <em>Dennis </em>stands for the proposition that any \u201cunjustified\u201d act of an officer that extends the duration of a traffic stop for any amount of time is an unlawful seizure under Article I, section 9. We disagree. In <em>Dennis, </em>we simply held that a traffic stop is unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>extended if an officer inquires into matters unrelated to the stop outside of an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d \u2014 no matter how long the unrelated inquiry takes. The Article I, section 9, problem that we identified in <em>Dennis </em>was that the officer began making unrelated inquiries instead of processing the traffic citation. In short, <em>Dennis </em>stands for the unremarkable proposition that an officer unlawfully extends a traffic stop if the officer ceases to process the citation and instead, without justification, begins making inquiries unrelated to the traffic stop. It does not support defendant\u2019s assertion that Article I, section 9, is implicated every time there is a delay in an officer\u2019s processing of a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Moreover, <em>State v. Nims, </em>248 Or App 708, 713, 274 P3d 235 (2012), illustrates the proper analysis when \u2014 like in this case \u2014 two officers are on the scene of a traffic stop. In that case, we held that where two officers were present on the scene of a traffic stop and one officer sought consent to search the defendant\u2019s car while the other officer processed the traffic citation, there was no unlawful extension of the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 714. There, two officers pulled over the defendant for a traffic infraction. <em>Id. </em>at 710. The first officer acquired the defendant\u2019s identification and returned to his patrol car to write a citation. In the meantime, the second officer asked the defendant about drugs and weapons, and requested consent to search the defendant\u2019s car. The subsequent search revealed illegal drugs. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that the police had unlawfully extended the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We reversed, noting that whether an officer unlawfully extends a stop depends on whether the officer makes the unrelated inquiry <em>instead of expeditiously proceeding </em>with the steps necessary to complete the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 713. In <em>Nims, </em>we noted that the first officer \u201cwas continuing, without delay, toward the completion of the traffic stop\u201d and, because the second officer requested consent to search while the first officer was writing the citation, the request did not unlawfully extend the traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Here, Haugen did not question defendant about matters unrelated to the traffic stop \u201cas an alternative\u201d to processing the traffic citation. There is no dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Haugen properly stopped defendant for a traffic violation and then proceeded with standard procedure \u2014 he obtained defendant\u2019s identification and returned to his patrol car to run a \u201crecords check.\u201d When the check came back \u201cclear\u201d he began to write a citation for the traffic violation. As the trial court found, Corning arrived before Haugen finished writing the citation, and Haugen asked Corning to finish the citation while he spoke to defendant. Corning, without delay, continued writing the citation, and, before he completed it, Haugen had performed the consent search that led to the discovery of the Oxycodone. Therefore, defendant consented to the search of his car while the officers were expeditiously conducting the traffic stop. The trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Defendant was convicted under <em>former </em>ORS 475.840 (3)(b) (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 475.752(3)(b) (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
