Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Defendant did not argue to the trial court that the challenged special conditions of probation were overly restrictive. Instead, without reference to the argument that he now makes on appeal, he inquired about the reasons for the imposition of those conditions at the hearing, noting that, in the court\u2019s \u201cprohibition on the contact\u201d between the boys and Grill, their mother, the court included a provision permitting Grill to have contact with H and L if allowed by DHS and approved by the court, and he subsequently filed an objection referencing that argument. Defendant does not persuasively explain how his arguments below satisfy preservation requirements, and we conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Defendant alternatively argues that we should exercise our discretion to review the trial court\u2019s imposition of the challenged special conditions of probation as plain error. To constitute plain error, the claimed error must meet three criteria; one of those criteria is that the error is apparent, meaning that \u201cthe legal point is obvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Defendant does not cogently develop an argument that the legal point is obvious in this case, and we conclude that it is not. Thus, the alleged error is not reviewable as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We nevertheless note that we are troubled by the trial court\u2019s imposition of the second challenged special condition of probation \u2014 that the \u201cprohibition of no contact with [H and L] will exist <em>regardless of any kind of contrary recommendation that may be made by DHS and/or by any order or judgment by a different Judge in the juvenile dependency case[s.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In a future dependency proceeding involving H or L, a judge may be charged with determining, among other things, whether any contact (including, for example, contact by letter that is approved by a child therapist) between defendant and H or L is in the child\u2019s best interests. We observe that it is generally inadvisable for a judge to impose a special condition of probation restricting a parent\u2019s contact with his or her child in a way that purports to preclude another judge, in a future dependency proceeding, from taking actions that the latter judge determines to be in the child\u2019s best interests. Cf<em>. Oregonian Publishing Co., LLC v. Waller, </em>253 Or App 123, 134, 293 P3d 1046 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013) (stating that \u201ccircuit court judges have the power to review the decisions of lower tribunals, but they have no authority to review the decisions of other circuit court judges \u2014 let alone the decisions of circuit court judges on whom a particular decisional authority has been exclusively conferred \u2014 in the absence of some overriding statutory or constitutional authority\u201d). We express no opinion about whether, in the future, a juvenile court judge would conclude that it is in H\u2019s or L\u2019s best interests to allow contact with defendant; however, we highlight the issue because of the importance of protecting the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>court\u2019s role in determining what actions are in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> The boys\u2019 mother, Grill, who was also involved in the abuse, was convicted of first-degree criminal mistreatment, and the juvenile court took jurisdiction over H and L.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> Those conditions are (1) that defendant refrain from knowingly having any contact with H and L or anyone with whom they reside; (2) that the \u201cprohibition of no contact with [H and L] will exist regardless of any kind of contrary recommendation that may be made by DHS and/or by any order or judgment by a different Judge in the juvenile dependency easels]\u201d; and (3) that defendant \u201cshall not be in the immediate presence of any female or male under the age of 18 years, even if that male or female\u2019s parent or legal guardian is in the same room, car, or location</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
