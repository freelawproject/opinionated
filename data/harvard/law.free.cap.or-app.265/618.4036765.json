He contends that the prosecutor\u2019s statements had the effect of impermissibly misleading the jury about the applicable burden of proof in the case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The state charged defendant with one count of fourth-degree assault, ORS 163.160, and two counts of harassment, ORS 166.065. The charges stemmed from allegations that defendant had punched the victim, his wife, on two separate occasions. At trial, the defense theory was that the victim had fabricated the allegations in order to obtain a restraining order against defendant that would allow her to pursue \u2014 unfettered by defendant\u2019s presence \u2014 her romantic interest in another man, Dupree. Defendant did not call any witnesses or otherwise put on a case. In closing argument, his attorney attacked the credibility of both the victim and Dupree, whose testimony tended to corroborate the victim\u2019s account. In a summation of the defense theory, defense counsel asked the jury, \u201cAnd how did she get that Restraining Order? She had to get that Restraining Order by taking what was in reality a verbal argument, and transforming it into a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">During rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">\u201cSo, in a way, what you\u2019re doing, really, is it\u2019s much like a \u2018he said/she said.\u2019 We happened to have another person there, but it\u2019s still the same way. <em>You have to believe one story or the other. Two stories to choose from. And you have to decide which one actually makes sense. </em>Which one do the puzzle pieces point go? [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">At that point, defense counsel objected, contending that the prosecutor had \u2014 through the emphasized language above \u2014 improperly characterized the state\u2019s burden of proof. The trial court overruled the objection. The prosecutor continued with closing argument, again asserting that the jurors would \u201cget to decide which story [they] believe,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the jury subsequently convicted defendant of the harassment charges and acquitted him of the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">On appeal, defendant reiterates the points he made below, advancing a two-part argument for reversal. First, defendant argues that the prosecutor misstated the law during her rebuttal argument. Pointing to decisions from other jurisdictions, he maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s statements about the parties\u2019 competing \u201cstories\u201d impermissibly suggested that the jury could find defendant guilty based solely on a determination that the state\u2019s witnesses were credible, as opposed to being able to convict only if the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the charged offenses. That argument presents a question that we review for legal error. <em>See State v. Worth, </em>231 Or App 69, 75-76, 218 P3d 166 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 718 (2010) (applying that standard of review to a defendant\u2019s argument that a prosecutor misstated the law during closing argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Second, defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to recognize the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the law and sustain his objection to it. Specifically, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u201clikely misled the jury,\u201d resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, defendant concludes, we should reverse his convictions because the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to recognize that the prosecutor misstated the law was harmful.\u201d Our assessment of that argument is guided by a single question: \u201cIs there little likelihood that the [asserted] error affected the verdict?\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) (articulating the \u201csingle inquiry\u201d that constitutes \u201cOregon\u2019s constitutional test for affirmance despite error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We start by addressing the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. \u201cThe law presumes every defendant upon trial charged with crime to be innocent, and it devolves upon the prosecution to prove by evidence to the satisfaction of the trial jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed the crime charged * <em>* State v. Rosasco, </em>103 Or 343, 357, 205 P 290 (1922). In arguing that it has met that burden, the state permissibly may attempt to persuade the jury that it should believe one version of events and not another. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>306 Or 599, 604, 761 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>1300 (1988) (\u201c[I]t is the jury\u2019s task *** to weigh evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of their testimony, and to resolve conflicts in the evidence.\u201d); <em>State v. Monsebroten, </em>106 Or App 761, 766, 809 P2d 1366, <em>rev den, </em>311 Or 482 (1991) (prosecutor\u2019s comment in rebuttal argument, explaining the lack of evidence to support \u201ca number of speculations\u201d that defense counsel made about the victim\u2019s testimony during the defendant\u2019s closing argument, \u201cdid not imply that defendant had the burden to prove anything, only that the state had met its burden of proof and that there was no contradictory evidence\u201d). However, in making that kind of argument, the state must not inappropriately characterize the jury\u2019s fact-finding function in a manner that raises some realistic possibility-of confusing the jurors about the ultimate standard or burden of proof. <em>Covington v. Florida, </em>842 So 2d 170 (Fla Dist Ct App 2003), cited by defendant, makes that point. <em>See id. </em>at 172-73 (prosecutor improperly invited the jury to convict by telling the jury, \u201cIf you believe he did not tell you the truth, that he made up a story, that\u2019s it, he\u2019s guilty of First Degree Murder\u201d and, \u201cIf you believe his story, he\u2019s not guilty. If you believe he\u2019s lying to you, he\u2019s guilty. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In this case, the specific part of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument to which defendant objected came close to crossing the line between permissible argument about the jury\u2019s need to assess the witnesses\u2019 credibility, in conjunction with assessing whether the state proved defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and incorrectly describing the jury\u2019s task as choosing which of two versions of events the jury finds more believable (a description that omits the possibility, among others, that the jury would find the state\u2019s version more plausible, yet not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt). However, we need not determine in the abstract whether the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u2014 standing alone \u2014 actually crossed that line, as the prosecutor did not make those statements in a vacuum. As we explain below, considered in context, the challenged statements would not have misled the jury about the state\u2019s burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, if the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to those statements, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>First, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury \u2014 at the beginning of the trial, at the conclusion of evidence, and at least four times in total \u2014 that the state had the burden to prove that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, \u2018absent an overwhelming probability that they would be unable to do so.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>256 Or App 173, 300 P3d 228, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 62 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 26, 791 P2d 836 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Second, the context in which the prosecutor made the challenged statements is significant. Defendant does not contend that the prosecutor mischaracterized the law in any way during her initial closing argument. To the contrary, after discussing the evidence presented at trial, the prosecutor reiterated the state\u2019s burden of proof, telling the jury that it was \u201cgoing to be asked to look at all this evidence and make a decision about what you believe occurred, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The prosecutor made the challenged statements only later, in her rebuttal argument, after defense counsel suggested during her own closing argument that the victim was an \u201cover-the-top exaggerator\u201d whose claim that defendant assaulted her was motivated by her desire to get a restraining order that would give her freedom to pursue a relationship with Dupree. In our view, it is unlikely that the jury would have understood the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent statements about the parties\u2019 competing \u201cstories\u201d as anything other than advocacy about how the jury should assess the credibility of the witnesses, including the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Put differently, defendant has shown neither that the jurors would have understood the prosecutor\u2019s statements as suggesting that they could convict defendant even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>if they were not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, nor an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d that the jurors would have followed any such suggestion, disregarding the trial court\u2019s repeated instructions about the state\u2019s burden of proof. In short, we conclude that, even if the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statements, there is no likelihood that the error affected the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-6\"> For example, the trial court\u2019s final instructions stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cThe defendant is innocent unless and until the defendant is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden is on the State to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cReasonable doubt is doubt based on common sense and reason. Reasonable doubt means an honest uncertainty as to the guilt of the defendant. Reasonable doubt exists when, after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case, you are not convinced that the defendant is guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
