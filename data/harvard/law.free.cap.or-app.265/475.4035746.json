Defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of court-appointed attorney fees in Case Number C120454CR. We write only to address the issue of attorney fees and otherwise affirm without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">After defendant was convicted in Case Number C120454CR, he asked the court not to impose court-appointed attorney fees under ORS 151.505. Defendant explained that he was unemployed, homeless, and struggling to pay medical bills, and that he was \u201cbasically destitute.\u201d The trial court nevertheless imposed $600 in attorney fees, without making any findings regarding defendant\u2019s ability to pay that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing attorney fees because there was legally insufficient evidence that he had the ability to pay them. <em>See State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 715-16, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (explaining that, under ORS 151.505 and ORS 161.665, a trial court may order a defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees and other costs, and that the state bears the burden of proving that a defendant is or may be able to pay those fees). The state concedes that the record does not support a finding that defendant is or may be able to pay the $600 in attorney fees imposed by the trial court. <em>See State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 634, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (\u201c[A] court cannot impose attorney fees based on a record that is silent regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees.\u201d). We agree, accept the concession, and reverse that portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In Case Number C120454CR, portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed. In Case Number C120210CR, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
