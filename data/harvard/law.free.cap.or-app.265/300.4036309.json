We affirmed petitioner\u2019s convictions on direct appeal. Petitioner then sought post-conviction relief on the ground that his trial counsel was inadequate. The post-conviction court accepted the petition and reversed petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction in its entirety. The state appeals, assigning error to that ruling. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The facts pertinent on appeal are undisputed. In September 2007, the victim, F, was invited by her friend, S, to attend a birthday party for S\u2019s father. Petitioner, who is S\u2019s uncle, was also at the party. At the time, F was 16 years old; petitioner was 48. After the party, petitioner invited F and S to his home to see his taxidermy collection. When they arrived, petitioner prepared margaritas. F and S each drank at least six margaritas. Petitioner later served other mixed drinks and shots of alcohol. The girls accepted all of the drinks that petitioner gave them, although F poured out some of the shots on the ground because she was worried about having had \u201cseverely too much\u201d to drink. After several hours, petitioner began to dance with F. S was alarmed because she realized that F was \u201cvery drunk,\u201d and S thought that the dancing was inappropriate. By the end of the night, F was slurring her words and having trouble walking. Petitioner called S\u2019s parents and told them that, because S and F had been drinking, they were going to stay overnight at his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">At about 2:00 a.m., F and S decided to go to bed. Petitioner told them that they could sleep in his spare bedroom. Before going there, F went to get a glass of water. As she was returning, petitioner stopped, her in the hallway, took her into his bedroom, laid her on his bed, and removed her pants and underwear. F testified that she attempted to stand up but could not because she was \u201cseverely intoxicated.\u201d She testified that petitioner performed oral sex on her and then attempted to penetrate her vagina with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>penis. F felt a \u201csharp shooting pain\u201d that jolted her out of her \u201cextremely drunken state.\u201d F ran out of the room screaming for S.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">S found F in the hallway and brought her back to the guest bedroom. S retrieved F\u2019s pants and underwear and helped her get dressed. F was \u201ccrying frantically.\u201d S drove them back to S\u2019s parents\u2019 house. The next day, S\u2019s father took S and F to the police station, where they were both interviewed by police. Later, S\u2019s mother took S and F to the hospital. F was interviewed by Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Kathy Wade. A SANE is an emergency room nurse who specializes in examining victims of sexual assaults. S was present during the interview. During her examination of F, Wade observed \u201ca small, linear * * * skin tear, that was about a centimeter long * * * between [F\u2019s] hymen and her labia minora.\u201d Wade attempted to photograph F\u2019s injuries, but the camera she was using failed. Instead, Wade drew the location of the injury on a printed diagram of a woman\u2019s genital area that was included in a standardized documentation form. On that same form, Wade wrote \u201csmall skin tear, non-bleeding, approx 1 cm long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Petitioner was charged with two counts of rape in the first degree, ORS 163.375 (Counts 1 and 2); two counts of sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.405 (Counts 3 and 4); two counts of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427 (Counts 5 and 6); two counts of sexual abuse in the second degree, ORS 163.425 (Counts 7 and 8); and two counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor, ORS 471.410 (Counts 9 and 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">As charged in this case, the crimes alleged in Counts 2, 4, and 6 required the state to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that F was \u201cincapable of consent by reason of mental incapacitation.\u201d At the relevant time, \u201c[m]entally incapacitated\u201d was defined in ORS 163.305(4) (2007), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 770, \u00a7 1, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201c\u2018Mentally incapacitated\u2019 means that a person is rendered incapable of appraising or controlling the conduct of the person at the time of the alleged offense because of the influence of a controlled or other intoxicating substance <em>administered to the person without the consent of the person </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>or because of any other act committed upon the person without the consent of the person.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">(Emphasis added.) The state\u2019s theory at trial was that, at the time of the sexual contact, F was mentally incapacitated because petitioner \u201cadministered\u201d alcohol to her without her \u201cconsent\u201d; that is, although F had voluntarily consumed the drinks, her age made her legally unable to consent to drink alcohol. Consistently with that theory, the state argued during its opening statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u201c[F] was mentally incapacitated as a result of the alcohol *** that the [petitioner] administered to her, essentially. And that \u2014 so this mental incapacitation, it means something maybe a little bit different than what we would think of in layperson\u2019s terms. The actual definition is that a person becomes mentally incapacitated as a result of any intoxicating substance, drugs or alcohol, administered to them without their consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cAnd while [F] might have agreed to take some of these drinks, she cannot legally consent to do that in this situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">At trial, Wade testified for the state about her examination of F. She testified that a tear of the skin like what she found on F is \u201cusually caused by a blunt force trauma.\u201d Wade also testified that her observations during her examination of F were consistent with the account that F gave during the interview at the hospital. In particular, she explained that similar skin tears can be caused by the penetration of the vagina by a penis. On cross-examination by petitioner\u2019s trial attorney, Wade acknowledged that the tear could have been caused by something other than sexual penetration. Petitioner\u2019s attorney also cross-examined Wade about her protocols for interviewing sexual assault victims, recording their responses, and documenting forensic evidence. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>not, however, specifically question Wade about the camera failure or the hospital\u2019s protocols for documenting evidence of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In its instructions to the jury, the trial court explained that the charges in Counts 2, 4, and 6 were based on the state\u2019s theory that F was unable to \u201clegally consent\u201d to the consumption of alcohol. For example, with respect to Count 2, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cIn this case, the defendant is charged with * * * Count 2, Rape in the First Degree, that said defendant *** did unlawfully and knowingly engage in sexual intercourse with [F], a female who was incapable of consent by reason of mental incapacitation caused by the defendant administering alcohol to [F], [F] being unable to legally consent to the consumption of alcohol because she is sixteen years old and a minor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">At a later point during the jury instructions, the court explained what the state was required to prove in order to obtain convictions on Counts 2, 4, and 6. Those explanations tracked the language of the relevant criminal statutes. For example, the court informed the jury that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c[i]n this case, to establish the crime of Rape in the First Degree, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following four elements (1) that the act occurred in Deschutes County, Oregon (2) that the act occurred on or about September 8th, 2007 (3) that [defendant] knowingly had sexual intercourse with [F]; and (4) that [F] was incapable of consent by reason of mental incapacitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The court further explained to the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201cmentally incapacitated means a person is rendered incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct at the time of the alleged offense because of the influence of a controlled or other intoxicating substance administered to the person without his or her consent or because of any other act committed on the person without his or her consent\u00ed.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel did not challenge the jury instructions or otherwise contest the state\u2019s theory that the absence of \u201cconsent\u201d under the statute could be established by the mere fact of F\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The jury acquitted petitioner on Counts 1, 3, and 5, which alleged, respectively, first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and first-degree sexual abuse on the ground that F had been \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury convicted petitioner of the remaining counts, including Counts 2, 4, and 6 (the three \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d counts). Petitioner appealed; we affirmed his conviction without issuing an opinion. <em>State v. Burcham, </em>239 Or App 362, 246 P3d 520 (2010). Petitioner then filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that his trial counsel provided inadequate assistance that deprived petitioner of his due process rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The post-conviction court reversed petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction in its entirety. The state now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel involves a two-part inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cFirst, we must determine whether petitioner demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that [petitioner\u2019s lawyer] failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment. Second, if we conclude that petitioner met that burden, we further must determine whether he proved that counsel\u2019s failure had a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\"><em>Lichau v. Baldwin, </em>333 Or 350, 359, 39 P3d 851 (2002). The Supreme Court has observed that evaluating the constitutional adequacy of an attorney\u2019s trial performance is necessarily a fact-specific endeavor; thus, \u201c[t]he search for a single, succinctly-stated standard, objectively applicable to every case, is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d <em>Krummacher v. Gierloff, </em>290 Or 867, 873-74, 627 P2d 458 (1981). Without question, however, \u201cadequate\u201d assistance requires an attorney to \u201cinvestigate the facts and *** law to the extent appropriate to the nature and complexity of the case so that [counsel] is equipped to advise his [or her] client, exercise professional judgment [,] and represent the defendant in an informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875. \u201cIn reviewing the decision of the post-conviction court, we are bound by its findings of historic facts that are supported by evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Lichau, </em>333 Or at 359 (citing <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The post-conviction court reversed petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction on two grounds. First, the court concluded that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had been inadequate for failing to challenge the state\u2019s interpretation of the terms \u201cadminister\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d in the relevant criminal statutes. Second, the court concluded that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had been inadequate for failing to retain a qualified medical expert. According to petitioner\u2019s post-conviction petition, hiring a qualified medical expert would have allowed him to present evidence to rebut the state\u2019s explanation for the skin tear and to more effectively cross-examine Wade. The court entered a judgment allowing the petition for post-conviction relief, reversing the judgment of conviction, and remanding the case \u201cfor retrial or other appropriate proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the post-conviction court correctly ruled that petitioner was entitled to relief with respect to Counts 2, 4, and 6, all of which involved the state\u2019s novel theory about the meaning of the term \u201cconsent\u201d in the statute defining mental incapacitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The post-conviction court erred, however, in reversing petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10, because the record does not support a conclusion that the inadequacy of petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had a tendency to affect the result of the trial on those four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A. <em>The State\u2019s Mental Incapacitation Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In its first assignment of error, the state argues that the post-conviction court erred in concluding that petitioner\u2019s trial attorney was inadequate for failing to challenge the state\u2019s theory that F was mentally incapacitated at the time of the sexual assault. That theory relied on a novel interpretation of the term \u201cconsent\u201d as used in ORS 163.305(4) (defining \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d); the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>argued that F\u2019s age rendered her unable to consent to the consumption of alcohol. The petition for relief alleged, in relevant part, that the state\u2019s theory that F was \u201cmentally incapacitated because she was under 21 years old and could not legally consent to consume the alcohol * * * did not state a crime under statutes in effect at the time of the alleged offenses [.]\u201d The post-conviction court agreed and concluded that a competent defense attorney would have recognized the state\u2019s interpretation as pure \u201csilliness\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201cTo me, it just seems the clear and easy, straightforward reading of the statute is, you give somebody something without their knowledge or consent, meaning, * * * well, in the old days, it was the vodka in the fruit punch at the fraternity party. Today it\u2019s some sort of drugs in something. At first the person doesn\u2019t consent because they don\u2019t know it\u2019s there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cTo me, that\u2019s the only rational reading of this statute ***.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201c[A]nybody, I think, who would sit down and spend the time to look at the statute would realize that the state, in offering their instruction and claiming this to be the way the statute reads, given reading the statute on its face, any lawyer who was competent would raise [an] objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On appeal, the state argues that the interpretation of ORS 163.305(4) that the state advanced at petitioner\u2019s trial was reasonable. The state explains that the statute did not have \u201ca clearly understood meaning at the time\u201d because \u201c[n] either Oregon statutes nor case law provide that \u2018consent,\u2019 as used in [that statute], means only consent as a matter of fact.\u201d Those observations, however, beg the real issue in this case. As the Supreme Court has held, \u201c[i]t is the \u2018reasonable professional skill and judgment\u2019 standard, and not generalized and imprecise rules of thumb such as \u2018unsettled questions of law,\u2019 that determines whether counsel rendered inadequate assistance.\u201d <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 500, 112 P3d 320 (2005). Thus, the first step in our analysis requires us to determine whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201ca lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have recognized the statutory ambiguity, would have seen an interpretation that could benefit the defendant, and would have concluded under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>that the potential benefits of advancing that interpretation exceeded any risks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">If we determine that a reasonable exercise of professional skill and judgment should have led petitioner\u2019s counsel to challenge the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4), we also must decide whether petitioner was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to do so. <em>Lamb v. Coursey, </em>238 Or App 647, 652, 243 P3d 139 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 230 (2011). Here, petitioner argues that he was prejudiced because, among other reasons, his trial counsel failed to challenge the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4) by moving for a \u201cjudgment of acquittal, directed verdict [,] or an arrest of judgment.\u201d Whether or not defendant was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to make those motions depends on whether those motions would have been successful. <em>See Lamb, </em>238 Or App at 652 (whether the petitioner was prejudiced by his trial attorney\u2019s failure to argue that a three-year statute of limitations applied to one of his felony charges depended upon whether a hypothetical motion to dismiss on that ground would have been successful).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In short, the two-step inquiry into whether petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was inadequate requires us, in the context of this case, to determine (1) whether petitioner\u2019s counsel, in the exercise of reasonable professional skill and judgment, should have challenged the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4) at trial; and (2) whether, if such a challenge had been made, it would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Following the methodology explained in <em>Burdge, </em>we conclude that petitioner\u2019s trial attorney should have challenged the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4). The state\u2019s theory was that F was \u201cunable to legally consent to the consumption of alcohol because she is 16 years old and a minor.\u201d The text of ORS 163.305(4), however, does not include the phrase \u201clegal consent\u201d or any other term that would indicate that the legislature intended the term \u201cconsent\u201d to mean anything other than factual consent. An attorney who is reasonably competent to practice law in this state should be aware that Oregon courts follow a methodology of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>statutory interpretation that makes the \u201ctext and context\u201d of a statute the most persuasive evidence of its intended meaning. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009); <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Here, it should have been obvious that the state\u2019s theory of criminal liability was at significant variance from the text and context of the statute on which the state relied. That, in turn, should have prompted petitioner\u2019s attorney to \u201cinvestigate the facts and * * * law\u201d to determine whether it would be prudent to challenge the state\u2019s theory. <em>Krummacher, </em>290 Or at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In light of the foregoing, the state\u2019s argument on appeal that petitioner\u2019s trial attorney was not inadequate because the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4) (2007) was \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cplausible\u201d misses the mark. Even assuming, without agreeing, that the state\u2019s interpretation was reasonable or plausible, the issue is whether petitioner\u2019s counsel could have urged a different plausible interpretation that would have benefitted petitioner at trial. The answer is plainly yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We also conclude that, under the circumstances, the potential benefits of challenging the state\u2019s interpretation exceeded any risks. <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 497. Because the state\u2019s theory of criminal liability was embedded in the language of the indictment itself, a successful motion for a directed verdict or for a judgment of acquittal would have resulted in the dismissal of Counts 2, 4, and 6. An unsuccessful motion would have presented no risk to petitioner. Those motions would have raised a pure question of law and would have been decided by the trial court. For all of those reasons, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment by not challenging the state\u2019s construction of ORS 163.305(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We also conclude that, had petitioner\u2019s trial counsel challenged the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4), that challenge would have been successful. When interpreting a statute, we apply the framework established in <em>PGE, </em>317 Or 606, and subsequently modified by <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or 160. Under that framework, the goal of statutory interpretation is to discern the intent of the legislature that enacted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>statute. <em>Id. </em>at 171. The most persuasive evidence for determining the legislature\u2019s intent is the \u201ctext and context\u201d of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>A statutory term\u2019s \u201ccontext\u201d includes both its immediate context (the \u201cphrase or sentence in which the term appears\u201d) and the \u201cbroader context,\u201d which includes other statutes \u201con the same subject.\u201d <em>State v. Stamper, </em>197 Or App 413, 417-18, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005). We also will consider any \u201cpertinent legislative history.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172. If the legislature\u2019s intent remains unclear, we will resort to \u201cgeneral maxims of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Here, the text of ORS 163.305(4) required the state to prove that a person was under the \u201cinfluence of a controlled or other intoxicating substance\u201d and that that substance was \u201cadministered to the person without the consent of the person.\u201d Thus, the statute refers to simple \u201cconsent.\u201d We typically assume that the legislature intends words of common usage to be \u201cgiven their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. The ordinary meaning of \u201cconsent\u201d is \u201cto give express agreement.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>197 Or App at 417 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>482 (unabridged ed 2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Nothing in the plain text or immediate context of the statute injects <em>capacity </em>to consent into the analysis. The state, however, cites <em>Stamper </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe word \u2018consent\u2019 includes both actual and legal capacity to consent.\u201d In <em>Stamper, </em>the defendant challenged his conviction for second-degree sexual abuse, the elements of which are set out in ORS 163.425. <em>Id. </em>at 415. Reviewing that conviction required us to interpret the statutory phrase \u201cthe victim does not consent thereto [.]\u201d 197 Or App at 415. We interpreted that phrase with reference to \u201cother related statutes\u201d including ORS 163.315(l)(a), which provides that a person lacks the ability to consent to a sexual act if the person is \u201c[u]nder 18 years of age[.]\u201d Ultimately, we concluded that, with regard to ORS 163.425, \u201cour best judgment is that the legislature intended the phrase \u2018the victim does not consent\u2019 to apply either to actual lack of consent or incapacity to consent because the victim was under the age of 18.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Relying on <em>Stamper, </em>the state here cites several other statutes as \u201cexamples of instances in which \u2018consent\u2019 means more than actual acceptance or willingness.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 163.315(1) (\u201cA person is considered incapable of consenting to a sexual act if the person is * * * [u]nder 18 years of age[.]\u201d); ORS 163.197(3) (providing that, for the purposes of the crime of hazing, the \u201c[c]onsent of the person who is hazed is not a defense\u201d); ORS 163.215(1) (in the context of kidnapping and related offenses, providing for an alternative definition of the term \u201cwithout consent\u201d when the victim \u201ca person under 16 years of age or who is otherwise incapable of giving consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The statutes cited by the state do not aid our analysis. Although ORS 163.315 can be said to be \u201crelated\u201d to ORS 163.305(4) in that both statutes deal with the subject of criminal sexual conduct, the other statutes on which the state relies are not related to ORS 163.305(4) in any meaningful sense. There is a problem with the state\u2019s reliance on ORS 163.315 as well. In drafting ORS 163.305(4), the legislature used the term \u201cwithout the consent of the person\u201d in reference to the phrase \u201ca controlled or intoxicating substance [being] administered to the person.\u201d By contrast, ORS 163.315 does not use the term \u201cconsent\u201d in reference to the consumption of intoxicating substances; ORS 163.315 deals with when \u201c[a] person is considered incapable of consenting <em>to a sexual act\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, the meaning of the term \u201cconsent\u201d in ORS 163.315 does not help us to understand what the legislature intended the term \u201cwithout the consent of the person\u201d to mean in ORS 163.305(4). The immediate contexts in which those terms appear are simply too different. Because nothing convinces us otherwise, we assume that the legislature intended to give the term \u201cconsent,\u201d as it appears in ORS 163.315(4), its ordinary meaning. That is, we assume the legislature meant \u201cto give express agreement.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>197 Or App at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Having determined that the state\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(4) was erroneous, we easily conclude that petitioner was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge that interpretation. That failure allowed petitioner to be convicted on Counts 2, 4, and 6 when those counts should have been dismissed. Even if the trial court had accepted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>state\u2019s theory, petitioner\u2019s statutory construction argument would have been preserved and could have been brought before this court on direct appeal. Had that occurred, we would have done precisely what we do now; for the reasons set forth above, we would have concluded that the legislature intended the term \u201cconsent\u201d in ORS 163.305(4) to have its ordinary meaning. We would, accordingly, have rejected the state\u2019s argument that absence of consent could be established by a victim\u2019s age alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">B. <em>The Expert Medical Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In his first and second claims, petitioner alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201c1. Trial counsel failed to conduct a complete investigation into the medical evidence of a tear between [F\u2019s] hymen and her labia minora and failed to retain and consult with a qualified medical expert in order to prepare a defense and present evidence at trial on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201c2. Trial counsel was not prepared to respond to the medical evidence of the reported tear between [F\u2019s] hymen and her labia minora and failed to effectively cross-examine the nurse, Kathy Wade, called as the state\u2019s medical witness regarding this evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">On appeal, the state does not challenge the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was inadequate in both of those respects. Therefore, the only question before us is whether the post-conviction court erred when it found that petitioner had been prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failures. For federal constitutional purposes, proving prejudice requires a petitioner to prove that it is \u201creasonably likely\u201d that the result of the trial would have been different had counsel acted differently. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 US 86, 131 S Ct 770, 792, 178 L Ed 2d 624 (2011) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984)). Under the Oregon formulation, a defendant is prejudiced by his or her counsel\u2019s inadequate representation when the counsel\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions * * * [had] a tendency to affect <em>the result </em>of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Krummacher, </em>290 Or at 883 (emphasis added). \u201cWhether a petitioner has demonstrated prejudice is a legal question\u201d and answering it \u201cmay depend on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>post-conviction court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Logan v. State of Oregon, </em>259 Or App 319, 327, 313 P3d 1128 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 142 (2014) (citing <em>Wyatt v. Czerniak, </em>223 Or App 307, 311, 195 P3d 912 (2008)). We will defer to the post-conviction court\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by evidence in the record. <em>Logan, </em>259 Or App at 327 (citing <em>Derschon v. Belleque, </em>252 Or App 465, 466, 287 P3d 1189 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 208 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We begin by noting that the post-conviction court\u2019s resolution of this issue has placed us in a tenuous position. Our standard for reviewing a decision by a post-conviction court requires us to give great deference to the court\u2019s factual findings; we are prohibited from reweighing the evidence in the record or speculating about \u201cwhether the evidence might have supported other factual findings than those made by the trial court.\u201d <em>Pratt v. Armenakis, </em>201 Or App 217, 220, 118 P3d 821 (2005). Here, however, the post-conviction court entered a judgment that does not articulate the factual bases for its ultimate conclusion that petitioner was prejudiced. Rather, it merely refers us to the \u201cfindings on record.\u201d Moreover, the court\u2019s only express finding on the issue of prejudice appears to <em>reject </em>the idea that the Fitzgerald affidavit would have made any difference. In the course of granting petitioner relief, the post-conviction court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t find the Fitzgerald affidavit very helpful, as I indicated earlier, because, you know, to me these cases, they boil down to if the jury believes the woman. Unless there\u2019s some gross findings of coaching or some other real possibility, rather than all the guesswork that goes into guessing about how else this injury could have occurred, juries just don\u2019t buy it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cAnd part of this is prejudice stuff. So, you know, I\u2019ve really had difficulty around this, because there\u2019s no question in my mind that he should have consulted a medical expert and gotten prepared to testify. I think it\u2019s really a close question whether there\u2019s prejudice shown here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cI think since he so utterly failed, I think one has to come down on the side of prejudice, but that\u2019s a close question, quite frankly, I have to admit. So I think he\u2019s entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to prevail on Counts 1 and 2 \u2014 Claims 1 and 2 in regard to not being prepared and adequately cross-examining the medical[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In short, the post-conviction court concluded that petitioner had been prejudiced without linking that conclusion to the factual record. That makes it more challenging to review the court\u2019s decision in a way that gives appropriate deference to the court\u2019s factual findings. Accordingly, we begin our analysis by explaining certain principles that help to define the proper scope of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The first such principle is that, in the post-conviction context, \u201c[t]he allegations of the petition frame the issues that a post-conviction court can consider, and a petitioner who fails to raise a claim in a petition for post-conviction relief has waived it and is foreclosed from making arguments on claims not raised in the petition.\u201d <em>Hale v. Belleque, </em>255 Or App 653, 660, 298 P3d 596, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 597 (2013). Here, Claims 1 and 2 in petitioner\u2019s second-amended petition are specifically directed at \u201cthe <em>medical evidence </em>of a tear between [F\u2019s] hymen and her labia minora.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We, thus, confine the scope of our review of those portions of the record that are relevant to petitioner\u2019s claims about the medical evidence of the skin tear observed by Wade. During trial, Wade testified that her observation of that skin tear was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the allegation that petitioner had penetrated F. Because we have already concluded that the post-conviction court did not err by granting petitioner relief on Counts 2, 4, and 6, the only remaining count that required the state to prove penetration is Count 7, which required the state to prove that petitioner subjected F to \u201csexual intercourse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The second principle is that, when a petitioner\u2019s claim for relief involves an argument about how a witness might have testified at trial, it is incumbent on the petitioner to provide \u201cevidence by affidavit, testimony or otherwise as to what [the] testimony would have been so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>allow an evaluation of the likely effect of that testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Carias v. State of Oregon, </em>148 Or App 540, 547, 941 P2d 571 (1997). Here, petitioner provided such evidence in the form of an affidavit by Fitzgerald.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Fitzgerald\u2019s affidavit presents two categories of evidence that are relevant to the question before us. First, the affidavit suggests that, had petitioner\u2019s defense counsel obtained a qualified medical expert, that expert would have been able to testify that the trauma observed by Wade \u201ccould easily result from any number of causes, such as self-stimulation, sex play or wearing tight blue jeans with no underwear.\u201d Second, the affidavit claims that the medical evidence that Wade collected \u201cwas not properly documented and may not have been properly performed in accordance with the Oregon Sexual Assault Response Team [(SART)] protocols.\u201d According to Fitzgerald, those protocols \u201crequire a full-length, fully clothed photo of the patient for purposes of identification prior to commencing the actual examination, in addition to photographs of each and every identifiable injury to include a color reference scale and a measurement scale.\u201d Fitzgerald also averred that she would have also told petitioner\u2019s trial attorney to familiarize himself with the hospital\u2019s procedures for sexual assault exams.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As quoted above, the post-conviction court found that Fitzgerald\u2019s testimony about other possible causes for F\u2019s skin tear would not likely have made a difference to the jury. Evidence in the record supports that finding. Significantly, the Fitzgerald affidavit never claimed that an expert witness would have been able to testify that the skin tear observed by Wade could <em>not </em>have been caused by sexual intercourse. Moreover, Wade did acknowledge on cross-examination that an alternative explanation for F\u2019s skin tear was possible. Thus, because the jury had already been informed that the skin tear was not conclusive evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>penetration, it was reasonable for the post-conviction court to conclude that additional testimony on that point would not have discredited Wade. We also note that calling an expert witness to testify on behalf of petitioner would not have been a risk-free proposition. As the original prosecuting attorney testified to the post-conviction court, she would have asked Fitzgerald \u201cif it was possible that the victim\u2019s injury was caused by forcible sexual intercourse, and she would be forced to concede that it was at least possible.\u201d The force of that concession may very well have ended up harming petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">As to the second subject covered in Fitzgerald\u2019s affidavit \u2014 Wade\u2019s documentation of F\u2019s injuries \u2014 the post-conviction court made no explicit findings. Consistently with our standard of review, we presume that the court made findings with respect to the weight of that evidence that were consistent with its ultimate conclusion. <em>Chew v. State of Oregon, </em>121 Or App 474, 476-77, 855 P2d 1120, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 24 (1993). That is, we assume that the trial court found that a more effective critique of Wade\u2019s examination procedures would have been helpful to petitioner. Turning to the question of whether there is evidence to support that implicit finding, we consider specifically whether there is evidence of how Wade <em>would </em>have testified had she been cross-examined in the manner in which Fitzgerald suggested. <em>Carias, </em>148 Or App at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Petitioner did not take Wade\u2019s deposition in order to ascertain what her responses to those questions might have been. The issue, therefore, is whether there is evidence in Fitzgerald\u2019s affidavit that permits a reasonable inference about how Wade would have responded to Fitzgerald\u2019s suggested cross-examination strategies. With respect to whether Wade\u2019s examination was done in accordance with SART protocols, it is not possible to infer that Wade would have given answers that would have been helpful to petitioner. Rather, the record indicates that medical guidelines at the time specifically provided that alternative methods of documenting injuries include \u201ccareful drawings using body diagrams.\u201d Attorney General\u2019s Sexual Assault Task Force, <em>SART Handbook </em>81 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The record does indicate that St. Charles Hospital\u2019s own procedures for sexual assault examinations contemplate photographic documentation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence in this case, however, does not permit an assumption that a cross-examination highlighting that fact would have been helpful to petitioner. Notably, Wade testified that she initially attempted to photograph F\u2019s injuries and that the camera failed, so she decided to document her observations by diagramming F\u2019s injuries by hand. Petitioner presented no evidence that that was an unreasonable decision under the circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, although the Fitzgerald affidavit asserts that the lack of photographic documentation made it \u201cimpossible * * * to properly verify or rebut Ms. Wade\u2019s testimony,\u201d Fitzgerald was still able to opine later in her affidavit that Wade\u2019s description of F\u2019s injury would have enabled a medical expert to testify that there were plausible alternative explanations for the skin tear other than sexual penetration. Fitzgerald does not explain how Wade\u2019s decision to diagram, rather than photograph, F\u2019s injuries affected the <em>integrity </em>of Wade\u2019s examination in this case. And the record is also silent as to what information, if any, could be gleaned from a photograph of F\u2019s injury that could not be gleaned from Wade\u2019s diagram and description.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">To illustrate the point, we turn to a case relied upon by petitioner. Although that case, <em>State v. Hites-Clabaugh, </em>251 Or App 255, 283 P3d 402 (2012), is not a post-conviction relief case, its analysis of a claim about erroneously excluded expert testimony is relevant here. In <em>Hites-Clabaugh, </em>the investigators who interviewed the alleged victim had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to follow \u201cthe child abuse investigation protocols * * * adopted by Marion County\u2019s multidisciplinary child abuse team and *** promulgated by the Oregon Department of Justice.\u201d 251 Or App at 262. At trial, the defendant attempted to call a psychologist as an expert witness. <em>Id. </em>at 259. The state objected and, in accordance with OEC 103(l)(b), the defendant made an offer of proof. The defendant stated that the psychologist was prepared to testify \u201cas an expert on the necessity to use protocols that have been promulgated by the State of Oregon in sex abuse cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262. The trial court excluded the testimony, in part, because it reasoned that the failure to follow those protocols was not a proper topic for expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 260. The court further explained that, \u201cif counsel could provide statutory authority for the use of the protocols in question, then it would consider giving a jury instruction concerning them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we concluded that that exclusion was reversible error. We reasoned that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201cdefendant was entitled to present evidence not only of the existence and details of those protocols, but also to adduce expert testimony concerning <em>why </em>adherence to such protocols is important. To the extent that the trial court excluded the proffered evidence on the ground that the subject could be addressed by means of a jury instruction, but not evidence, the court erred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 266 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In short, one of the critical factors in <em>Hites-Clabaugh </em>was that the excluded expert testimony would have helped the jury understand the importance of adherence to the protocols. That is not to say that a petitioner must always present such evidence. We conclude only that, in this case, petitioner had to do more than simply present evidence that Wade departed from her hospital\u2019s policy regarding photographs. That is so because the record demonstrates that Wade had a ready response: the camera did not work. Thus, to permit a reasonable inference that cross-examining Wade about the hospital\u2019s investigatory protocols would have yielded responses that were helpful to petitioner\u2019s case, petitioner was required to present some evidence suggesting that Wade\u2019s decision was unreasonable given the circumstances. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In short, the record does not support a finding \u2014 if the post-conviction court indeed made it \u2014 that petitioner would have benefitted at trial by cross-examination of Wade regarding the hospital\u2019s protocols. Moreover, other findings made by the post-conviction court (specifically, the explicit finding that the court did not \u201cfind the Fitzgerald affidavit very helpful\u201d) militate against a conclusion of prejudice, rather than for it. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that petitioner was prejudiced was not supported by evidence in the record. Thus, the post-conviction court erred in concluding that petitioner demonstrated that his trial counsel\u2019s failures alleged in Claims 1 and 2 had the tendency to affect the outcome of the prosecution. For purposes of petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional claims, we also conclude that the evidence in the record does not support a determination that it was \u201creasonably likely\u201d that the result of petitioner\u2019s trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">C. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A petitioner is entitled to have a conviction reversed only after demonstrating that his or her trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate and that counsel\u2019s failure \u201chad a tendency to affect the result of his trial.\u201d <em>Lichau, </em>333 Or at 359. A necessary corollary to that rule is that, when a petitioner is convicted of multiple counts, a petitioner is not entitled to relief on those counts that his or her counsel\u2019s constitutional inadequacy had no tendency to affect. <em>Galloway v. Nooth, </em>247 Or App 164, 186, 268 P3d 736 (2011). Here, petitioner was convicted of seven counts: one count of first-degree rape (Count 2), one count of first-degree sodomy (Count 4), one count of first-degree sexual abuse (Count 6), two counts of second-degree sexual abuse (Counts 7 and 8), and two counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor (Counts 9 and 10). The jury found petitioner not guilty of Counts 1, 3, and 5. As explained above, the post-conviction court correctly ruled that petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to challenge the state\u2019s interpretation of \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d in ORS 163.305(4). We disagree, however, with the court\u2019s similar conclusion with regard to the trial attorney\u2019s failure to more thoroughly prepare for and cross-examine the state\u2019s medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The state argues that, under those circumstances, only the convictions for Counts 2,4, and 6 should be reversed because the remaining counts were unaffected by the \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d error. Petitioner counters that the state failed to preserve the argument that a new trial is required only for some counts, not all counts on which petitioner was convicted. We disagree. At the close of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction relief hearing, the parties and the court held an extended discussion about how to properly dispose of the case. It is clear from the transcript that all of the parties understood that petitioner\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d issue applied only to Counts 2, 4, and 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The state made that point both in its memorandum and during the hearing. In short, because the state clearly raised, and the trial court clearly considered, the argument that the \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d issue applied only to Counts 2, 4, and 6, we conclude that that issue was preserved. <em>See State v. Merrick, </em>224 Or App 471, 472, 197 P3d 624 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The post-conviction court correctly ruled that petitioner\u2019s trial attorney failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment by not challenging the state\u2019s statutory interpretation of the term \u201cmentally incapacitated.\u201d We also agree with the post-conviction court that petitioner was prejudiced by his trial attorney\u2019s failure to do so. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the judgment that reversed the convictions on Counts 2, 4, and 6. As to Counts 7 and 8, however, we conclude that the record does not support the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusion that petitioner was prejudiced by any failure to more thoroughly cross-examine the nurse who examined F after the attack. In addition, there was no showing that the two counts of conviction for furnishing alcohol to a minor (Counts 9 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>10) were (or could have been) affected by any alleged inadequacy of counsel. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the judgment that reversed petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Portion of judgment reversing petitioner\u2019s convictions on Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> In 2009, the legislature amended the definition of \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d by deleting any reference to a controlled substance that is administered without the consent of a person.

Thus, under current law, in order to show that a person was \u201cmentally incapacitated,\u201d the state need prove only that the person was rendered \u201cincapable of appraising or controlling the conduct of the person at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d ORS 163.305(4).
