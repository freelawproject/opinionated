At trial, he was convicted on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195, interfering with a peace officer, ORS 162.247, and resisting arrest, ORS 162.315. On appeal, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his requested Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction (UCrJI) 1227. We reject, without further discussion, his other assignments of error. \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction for errors of law in light of the facts that are most favorable to defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>253 Or App 103, 104, 288 P3d 1004 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 814 (2014) (quoting <em>State v. Greeley, </em>220 Or App 19, 21, 184 P3d 1191 (2008)). We reverse and remand his conviction for resisting arrest and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">A statute and a uniform instruction frame our issue. Under ORS 162.315(1), \u201cA person commits the crime of resisting arrest if the person intentionally resists a person known by the person to be a peace officer or parole and probation officer in making an arrest.\u201d Employing those terms, the state charged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally resist Guy Pease, a person known to the defendant to be a peace officer, in making an arrest [.]\u201d Defendant gave a pretrial notice of intent to assert self-defense and, at trial, submitted a request for UCrJI 1227. That instruction reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\"><em>\u201c[Defendant\u2019s name] </em>has raised the defense of self-defense to the charge of resisting arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cIf <em>[defendant\u2019s name] </em>reasonably believed that the officer [s] arresting [him / her] [was / were] using more physical force than was necessary to make the arrest, then <em>[defendant\u2019s name] </em>was entitled to use physical force in self-defense. In defending, <em>[defendant\u2019s name] </em>was entitled to use only that degree of physical force that [he / she] reasonably believed to be necessary to defend [himself / herself] against what [he / she] believed to be the excessive force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cThe burden of proof is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defense does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>(Brackets and italics in original.) To be given, the instruction required the trial court, and now requires this court, to determine whether the facts in evidence, construed in the light most favorable to defendant, could show that he believes, and a reasonable person in his position would have believed, that the officer used more force than necessary to effect the arrest. <em>State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 194, 218 P3d 1281 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In light of that standard, we juxtapose defendant\u2019s evidence against a backdrop of evidence from the state\u2019s witnesses. Defendant suffers from long-term work-related injuries, including damaged rotator cuffs in both of his shoulders and 38 percent hearing loss in both ears. On September 8, 2011, defendant drove to the Lane County Jail to pick up his wife, who had been arrested the previous day. Defendant arrived at the jail with two of his young children. After waiting for some time outside, defendant entered the jail reception area. A deputy working at the reception desk noticed that defendant \u201cwas a little loud, wasn\u2019t walking too straight, and appeared to be impaired in some way.\u201d A sergeant escorted defendant outside because he had begun to cause a disturbance. Deputy Pease was dispatched and told that defendant was potentially an intoxicated driver. Pease met defendant outside the jail. After investigating, Pease placed defendant under arrest for DUII and handcuffed defendant with his hands behind his back. While Pease searched defendant, defendant\u2019s wife emerged from the jail. Pease recalled that defendant yelled at his wife and would not get into the patrol car. Defendant recalled that he was shouting in an effort to give his keys and his wallet to his wife so that she could leave with their children. Pease pushed defendant halfway into the car and another deputy pulled him the rest of the way into the back seat. Defendant loudly complained that his nose was broken and that Pease had not seen him drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">According to defendant, he told the officers, while they were arresting him, that he had badly injured shoulders, and they did not heed his concerns. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that defendant \u201ckept repeating, Watch my shoulders,\u2019 because it was hurting him\u201d and that she had \u201clet [the deputies] know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>he does have two torn rotator cuffs. And he can\u2019t hear very well.\u201d Defendant said he was in pain when they handcuffed him and pushed him into the patrol car. As Pease pushed him, defendant hit his head and scraped his nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Pease drove to a secured parking area. After Pease and defendant stepped out of the car, Pease tried to direct defendant to the Intoxilyzer room inside the facility. Rather than walking as directed, defendant stared angrily at Pease. With \u201cpush/pull\u201d pressure on defendant\u2019s shoulders, Pease turned defendant toward the facility. Defendant pushed back against the force on his shoulder and \u201ckept his body from turning in the direction that [Pease] was trying to get him to walk.\u201d Pease told defendant to stop resisting and increased the pressure to defendant\u2019s shoulder to get him to move in the proper direction. Pease attempted to push defendant down but later testified, \u201cI had him by the shoulders, I didn\u2019t have very good control. So we started spinning around in a clockwise circle, him pushing against me and me trying to push him down. We weren\u2019t going anywhere except in a circle.\u201d Pease swept defendant\u2019s legs out from under him, and defendant fell facedown to the ground. Defendant\u2019s head hit the concrete floor causing a \u201cgoose egg\u201d to appear on his forehead. He began yelling that Pease had hurt his shoulder and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">After entering the jail, defendant testified that Pease grabbed him and caused him \u201cexcruciating\u201d pain. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cYou grab somebody and you tend \u2014 all you do is jerk in a motion. And when [Pease] says we\u2019re turning a circular motion, you\u2019re going away from the pain. * * * And I think that\u2019s what he mistook as interfering or resisting arrest. And that\u2019s when he slammed me down, or they did, or whatever, man. It just happened so fast, you know. That\u2019s the reason I was so mad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get away or nothing. I was just, you know, just a reaction. I never resisted arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Defendant believed that problems related to his hearing were mistaken for threatening and noncompliant behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>A video recording was made of the ensuing events. The recording was received into evidence, and it would become critical to defendant\u2019s requested instruction. The video recording occurred when a nurse evaluated defendant for injuries and when defendant considered whether to take a breath-test, waited for the equipment to run, and waited for an analysis. On the video, defendant made several statements regarding Pease\u2019s use of force:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201cBring that cop in here that kicked my ass * * *. I want you to bring him in here with me and videotape it. * * * I was trying to be a gentleman about it, man, but he just wanted to kick my ass. So yeah, let\u2019s get it on tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201cNo, man, I don\u2019t got no problem. The only problem I\u2019ve got is you manhandling [indiscernible].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I should go [take a breath test]. \u2018Cause [Deputy Pease is] trying to bust me, after [expletive] breaking my nose and [expletive] my shoulder up. I think that he\u2019s trying to bust me on a [indiscernible] * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">\u201cWhy does he want to hurt me man? * * * He did hurt me and he\u2019s not done trying to hurt me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">\u201cAnd you got this guy already, bust my nose and break my head and bust me up. * * * And everybody seems ok with it, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what you said or what you heard, but I think you were just being a little ornery. * * * or you wouldn\u2019t hit me like you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-14\">\u201cCan I ask you something, man, honestly? * * * Is it just procedure? Is it just part of the rules, or? * * * How come you got to get so rough with the people when [indiscernible] * * *. When there\u2019s people not resisting, even, you know, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>get rough with them, why? Why do you do it? Is it part of the procedure thing, rules and things?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">At trial, Pease acknowledged many of defendant\u2019s statements on the video, although Pease denied hitting defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Defendant followed his pretrial notice with a written request for jury instructions that included UCrJI 1227. As noted, the instruction entitled the defendant to \u201cuse physical force in self-defense\u201d if he \u201creasonably believed that the officer [s] arresting [him] [was] using more physical force than was necessary to make the arrest ***.\u201d If so, then he may \u201cuse only that degree of physical force that [he] reasonably believed to be necessary to defend [himself] against what [he] believed to be the excessive force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The state objected to the instruction, arguing that there was no evidence to support it because defendant had not testified at trial that more force than necessary was used for the arrest or that he believed he needed to defend himself against excessive force. Deeming the evidence legally insufficient to require the giving of the instruction on self-defense, the court denied the request for the jury instruction. On the following day of trial, defense counsel raised the issue again and argued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cWe had discussed the self-defense relating to the charge of resisting arrest. And as I stated [yesterday], there was no testimony elicited about [defendant\u2019s] subjective belief about the reasonableness of the police action. However, on the video, it shows [defendant] stating that he believes he had been manhandled by Deputy Pease and suggesting that Deputy Pease had handled him roughly. And I believe that is sufficient evidence to raise the self-defense of the resisting arrest instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The trial court adhered to its prior ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">On appeal, defendant urges that the trial court erred in denying the request for the jury instruction, contending that the video recording provided sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s subjective belief so as to warrant the requested jury instruction. The state responds that the trial court did not err because \u201c[defendant failed to identify to the trial court any statement made in the recording that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>established he believed Pease\u2019s level of force was not reasonably necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alternatively, the state contends that defendant\u2019s belief was not \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d The state asserts that defendant merely established that he had been hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Our review is not to determine the factual disputes of self-defense or resisting arrest. Our concern is only defendant\u2019s entitlement to the jury instruction. \u201cGenerally speaking, a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury instruction if the instruction \u2018correctly states the law,\u2019 the instruction is \u2018based on [the defendant\u2019s] theory of the case[,]\u2019 and the record includes evidence supporting that theory.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Cossette, </em>256 Or App 675, 680, 301 P3d 954 (2013); <em>State v. </em>Branch, 208 Or App 286, 288, 144 P3d 1010 (2006). Where that theory is self-defense and some evidence supports it, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction that explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c[i]f [the defendant] believed, and a reasonable person in his position would have believed, that the use or imminent use of force against him exceeded the force reasonably necessary to effect the arrest, then he was entitled to defend himself from that use of force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Oliphant, </em>347 Or at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">A recent case offers some parallel for our case here. In <em>State v. Wan, </em>251 Or App 74, 85, 281 P3d 662 (2012), we considered whether the trial court erred in declining to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instructions on self-defense to the charge of resisting arrest. The defendant had prevented officers from entering his apartment to check on his girlfriend\u2019s welfare. The building security had reported loud crying that had endured for hours. <em>Id. </em>at 76-77. The officers attempted to gain control of the defendant, but the defendant twisted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>prilled his arm away. One of the officers punched the defendant in the face when the defendant raised his arms and made a fist. An officer attempted to sweep the defendant\u2019s legs out from under him and attempted to put the defendant in an \u201carm bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77-78. At trial, the defendant presented evidence that he had recently come from Taiwan and could not understand all of the officers\u2019 commands. He could not open the apartment door without moving out of the way due to the position of a shoe-rack, and he believed that he had been attacked even though he had attempted to comply with the order to let the officers in. <em>Id. </em>He testified that the officers\u2019 use of physical force resulted in movement of his arms \u201cto protect himself from falling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78. The evidence \u2014 his difficulty with English, the limited space around the apartment door, and his belief that he was attacked despite complying with the officers\u2019 order- \u2014 was sufficient to support a jury instruction on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Similarly, in this case, there is some evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to defendant, that defendant reasonably believed the officers were using unnecessary force to effect the arrest. From the outset, defendant and his wife told Pease that defendant had painfully injured shoulders. Despite being advised about defendant\u2019s torn rotator cuffs, Pease subjected defendant to pain, which defendant described as \u201cexcruciating,\u201d and caused defendant to scrape his nose on the patrol car. Such testimony supports defendant\u2019s contention that he perceived that Pease ignored his injuries and wanted to \u201churt\u201d him. Defendant\u2019s statements on the video show that defendant believed that Pease\u2019s increased pressure on defendant\u2019s shoulders, while in the booking area, was unnecessary to effect the arrest under the circumstances. Defendant questioned, \u201cWhy does he want to hurt me man? * * * He did hurt me and he\u2019s not done trying to hurt me.\u201d The videotape revealed that defendant believed that he tried to be compliant, but had been subject to painful and unnecessarily forceful police conduct anyway. Given the prior injuries and all the circumstances, a reasonable juror could find objectively and from defendant\u2019s subjective perspective, that the officer used more force than what was necessary to accomplish the arrest. Accordingly, there was some evidence to support defendant\u2019s self-defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>theory. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Conviction for resisting arrest reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> On appeal, the state\u2019s argument is not limited to a criticism of defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. The state recognizes that our review for support for the jury instruction must consider all the evidence offered at trial, including exhibits such as defendant\u2019s statement in the video recording. <em>See Crismon v. Parks, </em>238 Or App 312, 314, 241 P3d 1200 (2010) (our review includes \u201cany competent evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> The state does not dispute whether the uniform jury instruction correctly states the law or whether the instruction is consistent with defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
