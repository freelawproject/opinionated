J.</author>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In this criminal case, defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting him of multiple crimes. He raises four assignments of error. We write only to address defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on Count 8 of the indictment, which charged him with \u201cassault in the fourth degree - constituting domestic violence\u201d for physically injuring his stepdaughter, S. Defendant does not dispute that he assaulted S, but he does dispute that the assault constituted domestic violence. He argues that \u201cdomestic violence\u201d is \u201cabuse between family or household members,\u201d ORS 135.230(3), and that he and S were not \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d ORS 135.230(4). The state concedes that defendant and S were not family or household members. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the parties that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant\u2019s assault of S constituted domestic violence. We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s remaining three assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for assault in the fourth degree constituting domestic violence and remand to the trial court for entry of a judgment of conviction for the lesser-included offense of assault in the fourth degree, and we otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The relevant facts are few, and we state them in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Evans, </em>161 Or App 86, 89, 983 P2d 1055 (1999) (when reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state). Defendant was married to Rose McKarge, but the two were estranged. McKarge lived in her own home with two of her three daughters, including S. One night, defendant went to McKarge\u2019s home, where an altercation ensued that involved McKarge, her three daughters, and the boyfriend of one of the daughters. Following the altercation, the state brought a 13-count indictment against defendant. In Count 8, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>entitled \u201cassault in the fourth degree - constituting domestic violence,\u201d the state alleged that defendant assaulted S and further alleged that, at the time of the assault, defendant was S\u2019s stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">At trial, in support of Count 8, the state presented evidence that, during the altercation at McKarge\u2019s home, defendant caused physical injury to S, who was a minor. McKarge and her three daughters testified that defendant did not live at McKarge\u2019s home and was not part of their family. A jury found defendant guilty of nine of the charged counts, including Count 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">As mentioned, on appeal, defendant challenges his conviction on Count 8 on the ground that his assault of S did not constitute \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d ORS 135.230(3), because he and S were not \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d ORS 135.230(4). The state agrees that defendant and S were not \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d and, for the reasons explained below, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">ORS 132.586 authorizes the state to plead and prove that a crime involved domestic violence. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201c(1) As used in this section, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 135.230.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201c(2) When a crime involves domestic violence, the accusatory instrument may plead, and the prosecution may prove at trial, domestic violence as an element of the crime. When a crime is so pleaded, the words \u2018constituting domestic violence\u2019 may be added to the title of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In turn, ORS 135.230(3) defines \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as \u201cabuse between family or household members,\u201d and ORS 135.230(4) defines \u201cfamily or household members\u201d as \u201cany of the following\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">\u201c(a) Spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201c(b) Former spouses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">\u201c(c) Adult persons related by blood or marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-13\">\u201c(d) Persons cohabiting with each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-14\">\u201c(e) Persons who have cohabited with each other or who have been involved in a sexually intimate relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-15\">\u201c(f) Unmarried parents of a minor child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>In this case, there is no evidence in the record that defendant and S were \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d as defined by ORS 135.230(4), at the time of defendant\u2019s assault of S. There is no evidence that they were spouses, former spouses, adult persons related by blood or marriage, persons who were cohabiting with each other, persons who had cohabited with each other, persons who had been in a sexually intimate relationship, or the unmarried parents of a minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">As mentioned, in the indictment the state alleged that defendant was S\u2019s stepfather. Thus, it is possible that the state believed that defendant and S were \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d as defined by ORS 135.230(4), because they were related by marriage. But, that belief would have been incorrect. The portion of the definition of \u201cfamily or household members\u201d that refers to \u201cpersons related by * * * marriage,\u201d ORS 135.230(4)(c), is limited to <em>\u201c[ajdult </em>persons related by * * * marriage,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added). It does not apply in this case, because S was a minor at the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">It is also possible that the state believed that defendant and S had cohabited with each other. But, that belief also would have been incorrect. As used in the definition of \u201cfamily or household members,\u201d \u201ccohabiting\u201d means \u201cliving in the same residence in a relationship akin to that of spouses.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. C. M. C., </em>243 Or App 335, 339, 259 P3d 938 (2011). In this case, there was no evidence that defendant and S had lived together, much less that they had lived together in a relationship akin to spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Because, as the state concedes, the record contains no evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction for fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 8 and remand for entry of a judgment of the lesser-included offense of fourth-degree assault, and we otherwise affirm. <em>See, e.g., State v. Sturgeon, </em>253 Or App 789, 790-91, 291 P3d 808 (2012) (reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction for fourth-degree assault constituting domestic violence because the defendant and the victim, who was the adult son of the defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend, were not family or household members and remanding with instructions to enter a conviction for fourth-degree assault).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Judgment of conviction on Count 8 reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a judgment of conviction for fourth-degree assault; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> In those assignments, defendant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to enter a judgment of acquittal on Count 13 (second assignment), instructing the jury that it could find defendant guilty by nonunanimous verdicts (third assignment), and accepting the jury\u2019s verdicts after instructing the jury that its verdicts need not be unanimous (fourth assignment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
