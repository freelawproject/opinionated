We review the board\u2019s order for errors of law pursuant to ORS 183.482(8), and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The following facts are either taken from the board\u2019s factual findings or stipulated to by the parties. According to the City of Lebanon Charter of 2004, the city is <em>\u201ca </em>municipal corporation\u201d that includes \u201call territory encompassed by its boundaries ***.\u201d The city is also a public employer as defined by ORS 243.650(20). All powers of the city are vested in the city council, which is composed of a mayor and six councilors; the council delegates much of that power to the city administrator (manager), who is the \u201cadministrative head of the government of the City.\u201d Specifically, the city administrator (manager) is \u201cresponsible for the daily operation of the City\u2019s departments and implementation of Council policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The council is responsible for .holding regular meetings, adopting \u201crules for the government of its members and proceedings [,]\u201d and appointing certain city officers. The council is also responsible for passing ordinances and voting on questions before it, including whether to approve \u201ca bond of a City officer or a bond for a license, contract or proposal [.]\u201d Except as the city charter provides, \u201cthe concurrence of a majority of the members of the Council present and voting at a Council meeting shall be necessary to decide any question before the Council.\u201d Further, \u201c[n]o action by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the council shall have legal effect unless the motion for the action and the vote by which it is disposed of take[] place at proceedings open to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Campbell was appointed as a city councilor in 2010 and was a member of the budget committee. As a city councilor, she would \u201cbe asked to vote and ratify any collective bargaining agreement with the Union that [was] negotiated by the City negotiation team.\u201d However, Campbell was not a member of the city\u2019s labor negotiation team, and, \u201c[o]ver the last 10 years, no city councilor [had] been a member of the City\u2019s labor negotiation team.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At the time of the events giving rise to this case, the city was experiencing a budget crisis, and the city and the union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that was set to expire. The president of the union, along with the president of another union that represents city employees, co-authored a letter to the city. In that letter, the union presidents stated that the city should consider eliminating the positions of assistant city manager/ human resources manager and human resources assistant before cutting essential services or laying off union workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Shortly thereafter, Campbell sent a letter to the <em>Lebanon Express, </em>a local newspaper. The letter was addressed to \u201cAll Citizens of Lebanon [.]\u201d Campbell began the letter by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201cI would like to inform all of you about some elements of my personal background before I get to the basis of my letter. Further I would like to clarify this letter is being written by me as an individual and not a reflection of a majority of the City Council, the City or my employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Campbell then described her and her family\u2019s involvement with unions, defended the city\u2019s human resources positions, and criticized unions in general. Campbell concluded the letter by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\u201cTo employees of the City and other organizations imprisoned by the dictatorship of a union as a private citizen I advise you to seek out the Department of Labor website where you can find instructions on how to de-certify your union captors. As an individual and former union member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>I believe you can put your union dues to better use in your own household budget and in supporting causes that truly express your own values.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\">\u201cSincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">Margaret A. Campbell</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZf\">City Councilor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATB\">Ward II\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The newspaper published an article that summarized Campbell\u2019s letter. That article noted that the letter could be found on the newspaper\u2019s website and stated that Campbell planned to read the letter at a city council meeting. The parties later stipulated that Campbell did not read the letter at the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The union thereafter filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the city. In its complaint, the union alleged that the city \u201cis a public employer under ORS 243.650(20)\u201d and that \u201cthe comments in [Campbell\u2019s] letter were delivered by Councilor Campbell in her official capacity.\u201d The city filed a motion to make the union\u2019s complaint more definite and certain, moving \u201cthat the Complainant be required to specifically allege whether it assert [ed] that Ms. Campbell is a \u2018public employer\u2019 or whether Ms. Campbell is the City\u2019s \u2018designated representative\u2019 as those terms are used in ORS 243.672 and defined in ORS 243.650(20) and (21).\u201d The union filed an amended complaint, adding the following language: \u201cMs. Campbell is a representative and authorized agent of the City and a \u2018designated representative\u2019 as that term is used in ORS 243.672 and ORS 243.650(21).\u201d In its answer, the city raised an affirmative defense against the union\u2019s <em>claim </em>\u2014 viz., that the \u201cUnion\u2019s Complaint fails to state a claim because it fails to allege sufficient facts that Ms. Campbell was the City\u2019s \u2018designated representative.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The parties submitted the case to an administrative law judge on stipulated facts, and the matter was submitted directly to the board. The board concluded that the city violated ORS 243.672(l)(a) and (b) through Campbell\u2019s act of advising city employees \u201c\u2018to seek out the Department of Labor website where you can find instructions on how to de-certify your union captors.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In reaching that conclusion, the board stated that a \u201cpublic employer is liable for the actions of its officials [.]\u201d It then stated, \u201cBecause [Campbell] spoke as the City\u2019s representative, liability for her remarks is ascribed to the City * * The board specifically rejected the city\u2019s \u201caffirmative defense against the Union\u2019s claim [.]\u201d The board stated that Campbell was \u201ca member of a six-person Council in which the City Charter vests all powers. The Council <em>is </em>the public employer, and Campbell shares that status because she is a member of the Council.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The board relied upon <em>OPEU v. Jefferson County, </em>18 PECBR 310, 317 (1999), in which the board concluded that a county committed an unfair labor practice when one of its commissioners called a union president to \u201carrange a meeting so he could address the whole bargaining unit about the bargaining dispute between the County and [the union].\u201d In a footnote, the board further stated, \u201cCouncilor Campbell, as a member of the council that is responsible for formulating all City policies and overseeing all City operations, is a public employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">On judicial review, the city contends that the board erred in holding that Campbell\u2019s \u201cpersonal statement of opinion criticizing the local union and union membership violated ORS 243.672(l)(a) and (b) because a single rogue councilor is not a 'public employer\u2019 or its \u2018designated representative\u2019 under ORS 243.672.\u201d The city asserts that Campbell is not a \u201cdesignated representative\u201d because she is not the \u201crepresentative\u201d of the City of Lebanon \u2014 that is, she was never \u201cspecifically designated\u201d by the city \u201cto act in its interests in all matters dealing with employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues.\u201d ORS 243.650(21). The city further asserts that Campbell is not a \u201cpublic employer\u201d and does not share the status of a \u201cpublic employer\u201d; according to the city, \u201cindividual city councilors have no authority to take action or make decisions on behalf of the City\u201d because the power to act on the city\u2019s behalf \u201cis vested solely to the body of the Council through a majority vote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In response, the union argues that \u201c[individual City Councilors <em>are </em>'public employers\u2019 within the meaning of the PECBA [(Public Employee Collective Bargaining Act)] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>when they interfere as such with employees\u2019 exercise of their rights under ORS 243.662 [.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The union also argues that it is appropriate to broadly apply \u201cagency, estoppel, and apparent authority principles in order to hold employers responsible for the unfair labor practices that are committed on their behalf, even by third parties.\u201d To support that argument, the union cites federal case law and decisions of the National Labor Relations Board construing the National Labor Relations Act, on which PECBA was modeled. Specifically, the union cites <em>National Labor Relations Board v. American Furnace Co., </em>158 F2d 376 (7th Cir 1946), in which an employer\u2019s president and superintendent authorized the town\u2019s mayor to make an antiunion speech to employees on the employer\u2019s premises during work hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">As noted, ORS 243.672(1) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for a \u201cpublic employer or its designated representative\u201d to commit certain acts. In its amended complaint, the union alleged that the city is a public employer under ORS 243.650(20).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The union further alleged that \u201cMs. Campbell is a representative and authorized agent of the City and a \u2018designated representative\u2019 as that term is used in ORS 243.672 and ORS 243.650(21).\u201d On review, the city and the union appear to agree that, if Campbell is a \u201cdesignated representative,\u201d the city can be held liable under ORS 243.672 for any unfair labor practice that she committed. Thus, we focus our analysis on the question whether Campbell is the city\u2019s \u201cdesignated representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">When interpreting a statute, our goal is to discern legislative intent. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>1042 (2009). We first look to the statutory text and context to determine the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>When a term is defined by a statute, we look to the statutory definition, but when a term is not statutorily defined, we look to dictionary definitions to ascertain the plain meaning of terms. <em>See id. </em>at 175 (using dictionary definitions to discern the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of terms). We also consider changes in the text of a statute over time, as those changes \u201care context for interpreting the version at issue in a given case.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. City of Dunes City, </em>236 Or App 194, 199, 236 P3d 750 (2010). If it is useful to our analysis, we also consider legislative history. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">As noted above, ORS 243.672 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201c(1) It is an unfair labor practice for a public employer or its <em>designated representative </em>to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201c(a) Interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in or because of the exercise of rights guaranteed in ORS 243.662.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201c(b) Dominate, interfere with or assist in the formation, existence or administration of any employee organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The first issue in this case is whether Campbell is a \u201cdesignated representative.\u201d Because PECBA does not define \u201cdesignated representative,\u201d we rely on the definition of \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d in ORS 243.650(21) to determine whether Campbell is a \u201cdesignated representative\u201d under ORS 243.672(1). <em>See Service Employees Int\u2019l Union Local 503 v. DAS, </em>202 Or App 469, 476, 123 P3d 300 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 140 (2006) (stating that there is no statutory definition of \u201cdesignated representative\u201d and relying on the definition of \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d in ORS 243.650(21) to determine that the Department of Human Services was not the \u201cdesignated representative\u201d of the Home Care Commission under ORS 243.672(1)). For purposes of PECBA, ORS 243.650(21) defines a \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u2018\u201cPublic employer representative\u2019 includes any individual or individuals specifically designated by the public employer to act in its interests in all matters dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Based solely on the statutory text, we cannot determine whether Campbell is a \u201cdesignated representative.\u201d We note that the adverb \u201cspecifically\u201d can mean \u201cwith exactness and precision : in a definite manner.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2187 (unabridged ed 2002) (boldface in original). We also note that the verb \u201cdesignate\u201d can mean \u201cto choose and set apart (as by public will or in the process of government administration).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612. Those definitions indicate that a \u201cdesignated representative\u201d must be specifically chosen to act on a public employer\u2019s behalf in certain definitive matters \u2014 that is \u201call matters dealing with employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues.\u201d ORS 243.650(21).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">However, we also note that ORS 243.650(21) uses \u201cincludes\u201d as opposed to \u201cmeans.\u201d Whereas \u201cmeans\u201d is used in a definition to restrict the meaning of a word, \u201c\u2018[includes\u2019 is used if the definition extends the meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Fox, </em>262 Or App 473, 483, 324 P3d 608 (2014) (citing Office of Legislative Counsel, <em>Bill Drafting Manual </em>\u00a7 7.2 (2012)). The legislative assembly\u2019s use of the term \u201cincludes\u201d suggests that the legislative assembly intended the definition of \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d to be \u201copen-ended [.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>(stating that the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cincludes\u201d in ORS 162.005 (1971) \u201cis evidence that it intended the enumerated examples to be open-ended rather than exclusive\u201d). Accordingly, ORS 243.650(21) encompasses not only those who are \u201cspecifically designated by the public employer to act in its interests in all matters dealing with employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues [,]\u201d but also a broader class of individuals. The statutory text of ORS 243.650(21), however, does not address the scope of that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We therefore look to context \u2014 that is, changes in the text over time. The provisions of ORS 243.650 were originally enacted in 1963 as part of House Bill 1288. Or Laws 1963, ch 579, \u00a7 2. At that time, PECBA did not define the phrase \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d and \u201cpublic employer\u201d was defined to mean \u201cthe state, county or city or any political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>subdivision or agency thereof.\u201d Or Laws 1963, ch 579, \u00a7 2(4) (codified as <em>former </em>ORS 243.710 (1963), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1969, ch 671, \u00a7 1). In lieu of that definition, the following definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d was enacted in 1969:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201c\u2018Public employer\u2019 means the state and any of its agencies and institutions, and includes a city, county or other political subdivision that has requested the Public Employe [e] Relations Board under section 4 of this 1969 Act to make its services and facilities available for the purpose of establishing public employe [e] representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Or Laws 1969, ch 671, \u00a7 2(5). The legislative assembly amended the definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d in 1973 and again in 1987. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1973, ch 536, \u00a7 1(18); Or Laws 1987, ch 792, \u00a7 1(18). Then, in 1995, the legislative assembly created two separate definitions \u2014 one for \u201cpublic employer\u201d and one for \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d \u2014 that are now codified as ORS 243.650(20) and (21):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201c(20) \u2018Public employer\u2019 means the State of Oregon <em>[or any], </em>and the following political <em>[subdivision] </em>subdivisions: <em>[therein, including] </em>Cities, counties, community colleges, school districts, special districts, mass transit districts, metropolitan services districts, public service corporations or municipal corporations and public and quasi-public corporations. <em>[\u201cPublic employer\u201d]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">\u201c(21) \u2018Public employer representative\u2019 includes any individual or individuals specifically designated by the public employer to act in its interests in all matters dealing with <em>[public employees] </em>employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Or Laws 1995, ch 286, \u00a7 1(20), (21) (boldface, brackets, and italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In light of those changes, we conclude that Campbell is not a \u201cdesignated representative.\u201d As can be seen from the text, the legislative assembly used more specific language to define \u201cpublic employer representative\u201d than it had previously used to define \u201cpublic employer.\u201d First, the legislative assembly added the adverb \u201cspecifically\u201d to modify \u201cdesignated.\u201d Second, the legislative assembly added limiting language to describe the duties of a \u201cpublic employer representative.\u201d Thus, under ORS 243.650(21), a \u201cpublic employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>representative\u201d must have been \u201cspecifically designated\u201d\u2014 that is, the public employer must have taken specific action to indicate its intent to designate a particular representative to act in the public employer\u2019s interests in certain definitive matters: \u201call matters dealing with employee representation, collective bargaining and related issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Because we infer that the legislative assembly intended the 1995 amendment to ORS 243.650 to have a limiting effect despite its retention of the word \u201cincludes\u201d in the statutory definition of \u201cpublic employer representative,\u201d we determine that ORS 243.650(21) does not include an individual city councilor who attends regular city council meetings and votes on general questions that come before the council, even if those actions relate to matters that concern public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The second issue in this case is whether we should, as the union suggests, broadly apply \u201cagency, estoppel, and apparent authority principles in order to hold [the city] responsible\u201d for Campbell\u2019s act of writing and sending her letter to the newspaper. The union raises an interesting question by asserting that we should apply agency principles in this case: whether a public employer can be liable for an unfair labor practice committed by an agent other than its designated representative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we need not resolve that question because, even assuming without deciding that it is appropriate to apply agency principles in this context, we conclude that Campbell was not acting as the city\u2019s agent when she wrote and sent her letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Under the theory of apparent agency, apparent authority \u201carises when the agent does not possess the actual or implied authority to act for the principal in the matter, but the principal has clothed the agent with apparent authority to act for the principal in that particular.\u201d <em>Badger v. Paulson Investment Co., Inc., </em>311 Or 14, 24, 803 P2d 1178 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201c[a]pparent authority is created only by some conduct of the principal which, when reasonably interpreted, causes a third party to believe that the principal consents to have the apparent agent act for him on that matter. The third party must also rely on that belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Apparent authority can be created by appointing a person to a position, \u201cwhich carries with it generally recognized duties; to those who know of the appointment there is an apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 n 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In <em>Badger, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court determined that there was sufficient evidence of an apparent agency relationship between an investment company and its two registered representatives to impose liability on the company for the representatives\u2019 alleged engagement in fraudulent securities practices and the sale of unregistered securities. In so concluding, the court considered the following factors: the company employed the representatives; the company sent its customers letters announcing a representative\u2019s association with the company; one representative sent out letters on the company\u2019s stationery; both representatives made sales presentations on the company\u2019s premises; at least one of those sales presentations occurred during business hours; and at no time was there any notification that the representatives, when selling securities, were acting on their own behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Our analysis of those factors indicates that Campbell was not acting as the city\u2019s apparent agent when she wrote and sent her letter. As a city councilor, Campbell was responsible to attend regular city council meetings and vote on questions before the council \u2014 questions involving the adoption of rules, the appointment of city officers, the passage of ordinances, the approval of bonds, and the ratification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>collective bargaining agreements. Thus, although Campbell was a city councilor, there is no evidence that writing public letters was one of the things \u201cordinarily entrusted\u201d to one occupying Campbell\u2019s position, and the city\u2019s conduct in appointing Campbell as councilor cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that the city consented to have Campbell write a letter to the newspaper on its behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 25 n 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). There is also no evidence that Campbell wrote her letter on the city\u2019s stationery, while on city property, or during business hours. Thus, this case is distinguishable not only from <em>Badger, </em>311 Or at 14, in which a representative sent out letters on the company\u2019s stationery, but also from <em>American Furnace Co., </em>158 F2d at 376\u2014which is cited by the union \u2014 in which the employer\u2019s president and superintendent authorized the town\u2019s mayor to make an antiunion speech to employees on the employer\u2019s premises during work hours. Further, as noted, Campbell clarified that her letter was \u201cbeing written by me as an individual and not a reflection of a majority of the City Council, the City or my employer.\u201d Thus, this case is further distinguishable from <em>Badger </em>because Campbell, in her letter, notified the public that she was acting on her own behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In sum, we conclude that the board erred when it concluded that the city committed an unfair labor practice based on Campbell\u2019s act of writing a letter criticizing unions and sending it to a local newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> ORS 243.672 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201c(1) It is an unfair labor practice for a public employer or its designated representative to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201c(a) Interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in or because of the exercise of rights guaranteed in ORS 243.662.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201c(b) Dominate, interfere with or assist in the formation, existence or administration of any employee organization.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\"> As noted, the union argues on judicial review that \u201c[individual City-Councilors <em>are </em>\u2018public employers\u2019 within the meaning of the PECBA when they interfere as such with employees\u2019 exercise of their rights under ORS 243.662 [.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.) That argument appears to suggest that the city might be liable for any unfair labor practice committed by Campbell because Campbell, herself, was a \u201cpublic employer.\u201d We do not understand why that is necessarily so; rather, it would appear that, if Campbell were a public employer, she would be liable for any unfair labor practice that she committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In any event, we need not resolve that question because Campbell is not, in fact, a public employer, as that term is defined by ORS 243.650(20). To the extent that the board\u2019s order appears to suggest that Campbell <em>is </em>a public employer because she is a member of the council or because she \u201cshares that status\u201d with the city, the board\u2019s order is incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-6\"> We note that the term \u201cagent\u201d does not appear in ORS 243.650(20) and (21) or ORS 243.672(1). We also note that, when the legislative assembly intends to communicate that a principal is liable for the acts of its \u201cagents,\u201d it knows how to do so. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 30.265(1) (providing, in part, that \u201cevery public body is subject to civil action for its torts and those of its officers, employees and <em>agents </em>acting within the scope of their employment or duties\u201d (emphasis added)); ORS 401.667 (providing that certain emergency health care providers and other health care providers, as well as health care facilities and persons operating emergency health care centers, are <em>\u201cagents of the state </em>under ORS 30.260 to 30.300\u201d for purposes of certain claims (emphasis added)). However, we also note that it is sometimes appropriate to invoke common-law agency principles to impose liability, even when the word \u201cagent\u201d does not appear in a statute. <em>See Badger v. Paulson Investment Co., Inc., </em>311 Or 14, 23, 803 P2d 1178 (1991) (concluding that common-law principles of agency are available to impose liability against nonsellers of securities under ORS 59.115(1)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> This case is also distinguishable from <em>OPEU, </em>18 PECBR 310, 317 (1999), in which the hoard concluded that a county committed an unfair labor practice when one of its commissioners called a union president to \u201carrange a meeting so he could address the whole bargaining unit about the bargaining dispute between the County and [the union].\u201d Although the commissioner stated that he had initiated the call on his own, expressed frustration that his personal business had been picketed, and stated that he did not want to talk again with a certain member of the union bargaining unit, his \u201cstated reason for calling\u201d was official county business. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Here, in contrast, Campbell did not state that she was writing her letter to conduct official city business, and the parties stipulated that Campbell did not read her letter at an official city council meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
