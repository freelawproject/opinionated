Defendant pleaded no contest and the trial court accepted that plea, finding defendant guilty of both counts. At a later sentencing hearing, defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s determinations of guilt should merge under ORS 161.067, resulting in only a single conviction. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s merger request and entered a judgment reflecting two felon-in-possession convictions. On appeal, defendant renews his merger argument. The state responds, first, that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal and must dismiss. On the merits, the state argues that merger is precluded because evidence in the record supports an inference that defendant obtained the two firearms at different times, resulting in a pause during which defendant could have renounced his criminal intent. We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal and authority to review defendant\u2019s merger argument. On the merits, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In conjunction with entering his no-contest plea, defendant signed a \u201cplea statement\u201d in which he acknowledged, among other things, that he was pleading \u201cno contest\u201d to two counts of felon in possession and that the state would argue for consecutive sentences on those two counts. The trial court accepted the pleas and found defendant guilty. Immediately after the court announced that it would accept the pleas, defendant asserted that it was the appropriate time \u201cto ask the Court to consider merger\u201d of the two counts of felon in possession. On that point, defendant argued that the two counts merged under ORS 161.067(3) because they involved \u201cexactly the same criminal offense\u201d and there was \u201cnot sufficient pause\u201d between the two offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>objected to defendant\u2019s merger argument and requested an opportunity to submit additional briefing on that point. Defendant did not oppose the state\u2019s request, and the court scheduled a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Shortly before the sentencing hearing, defendant filed a \u201csupplemental memorandum regarding merger and concurrent sentencing\u201d in which he argued that his \u201cconvictions should merge,\u201d that \u201cconcurrent sentencing [was] required if the two convictions do not merge,\u201d and that the court should impose concurrent sentences even if it had authority to make the sentences consecutive. In a responsive memorandum, the state expressed opposition to defendant\u2019s merger request on several grounds, including that defendant had agreed to plead to \u201cboth counts of Felon in Possession of a Firearm.\u201d At the merger hearing, a deputy sheriff testified about the circumstances under which law enforcement officers had found the two guns in different areas in defendant\u2019s home. During that encounter, the deputy testified, defendant said that the rifle belonged to his wife and that he had known that the rifle was in their home. Defendant also told the deputy that the shotgun belonged to one of his friends, who must have left it at defendant\u2019s house; defendant eventually admitted that he had known that firearm was present, too. Defendant later acknowledged that his fingerprints would be on both guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At the end of the hearing, the trial court rejected defendant\u2019s request for merger, ruling that merger was not warranted because defendant\u2019s guns were stored in different locations (\u201cthe rifle was stored in a case under a bed in the bedroom, the other one was located in the living room area\u201d) and the guns were owned by different people (one by defendant\u2019s wife, the other by a friend). Based on those facts, the court ruled, \u201ca reasonable inference\u201d could be drawn that the two guns \u201cwere acquired at different times, in different ways, in different places, again, one by the wife, and another by the friend.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthere was a sufficient pause in the possession of the shotgun versus the possession of the rifle, for an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d In accordance with that conclusion, the court entered a judgment reflecting convictions for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>counts of felon in possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is that judgment from which defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it did not enter a single merged conviction for felon in possession. The state makes two arguments in response. First, the state contends that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal and must dismiss it. Second, the state contends that, on the merits, the trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s merger request. We address the jurisdictional issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A. <em>Appellate jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Defendant originally asserted, in his opening brief, that this court has jurisdiction over his appeal under ORS 138.050. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 135.335, a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 [ \u2014 including, as here, judgments that impose a sentence on conviction \u2014 ] only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u201c(3) On appeal under subsection (1) of this section, the appellate court shall consider only whether the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Alternatively, defendant has suggested (in a memorandum responding to the state\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal) that this court may have jurisdiction under ORS 138.222, because defendant\u2019s conviction is for a felony, not a misdemeanor. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201c(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of ORS 138.040 and 138.050, a sentence imposed for a judgment of conviction entered for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, may be reviewed only as provided by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">\u201c(4) In any appeal, the appellate court may review a claim that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-11\">\u201c(a) The sentencing court failed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-12\">\u201c(b) The sentencing court erred in ranking the crime seriousness classification of the current crime or in determining the appropriate classification of a prior conviction or juvenile adjudication for criminal history purposes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-13\">\u201c(c) The sentencing court erred in failing to impose a minimum sentence that is prescribed by ORS 137.700 or 137.707.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-15\">\u201c(7) Either the state or the defendant may appeal a judgment of conviction based on the sentence for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, to the Court of Appeals subject to the limitations of chapter 790, Oregon Laws 1989. The defendant may appeal under this subsection only upon showing a colorable claim of error in a proceeding if the appeal is from a proceeding in which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-16\">\u201c(a) A sentence was entered subsequent to a plea of guilty or no contest [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>In response, the state contends that we do not have jurisdiction under either ORS 138.050 or ORS 138.222. With respect to the former statute, the state argues that we lack jurisdiction because any error associated with failure to merge the two guilt determinations into a single conviction does not mean that \u201cthe disposition\u201d in the case \u201cis unconstitutionally excessive or that [defendant] had a legal entitlement to some lesser sentence.\u201d Rather, the state argues, defendant\u2019s merger argument relates to the convictions that the trial court entered, not to any disposition on those convictions. Accordingly, the state concludes, defendant does not have a colorable claim of dispositional error of the type that would give this court jurisdiction under ORS 138.050(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The state also argues that ORS 138.222 cannot confer appellate jurisdiction here, either because that statute is not \u201can independent source of appellate jurisdiction in a felony case\u201d or, even if it can be, it works \u201cin tandem\u201d with ORS 138.050 with the following result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cSo, if a defendant is convicted of a felony based on his plea of no contest, ORS 138.050 permits an appeal only if and to the extent that he asserts a claim that the \u2018disposition\u2019 exceeds the statutory or constitutional maximum, and then ORS 138.222 more narrowly and specifically defines the permissible scope of appellate review <em>of such a claim\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(Emphasis in state\u2019s brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Recent decisions of this court resolve the jurisdictional questions presented here. In <em>State v. Clements, </em>265 Or App 9, 333 P3d 1177 (2014), we explained that ORS 138.050 prohibits a defendant who pleads guilty or no contest to <em>either </em>a misdemeanor or a felony from challenging his conviction on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 21 (describing ORS 138.050 as \u201cprohibiting] * * * a defendant\u2019s challenge to a conviction\u2014 as opposed to a sentence \u2014 when the defendant has pleaded guilty\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 23 (ORS 138.050 \u201ccarries] weight when the appeal in a felony case is not based on the sentence\u201d) (slip op at 16); <em>State v. Landahl, </em>254 Or App 46, 58-59, 292 P3d 646 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 788 (2013) (a conviction is not a \u201cdisposition\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.050; therefore, the statute does not confer jurisdiction over a challenge to a conviction). Thus, we will dismiss a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>criminal defendant\u2019s appeal from a judgment based on a guilty or no-contest plea if the only arguments made on appeal challenge the defendant\u2019s convictions, whether the convictions are for misdemeanors or felonies. <em>See Landahl, </em>254 Or App at 59 (so ruling with respect to misdemeanors); <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 23 (where the defendant had pleaded guilty to felonies, this court lacked jurisdiction to address an argument that was, \u201cin effect, a challenge to defendant\u2019s conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">But if the issues raised on appeal involve something <em>other than </em>challenges to a conviction, the existence of appellate jurisdiction depends on whether the defendant pleaded to a felony or to a misdemeanor. When the appeal is from a judgment based on a plea to a misdemeanor, jurisdiction lies, if at all, under ORS 138.050(1) and the scope of issues that this court may review is also governed by that statute. <em>State v. Beckham, </em>253 Or App 609, 615, 292 P3d 611 (2012); <em>see State v. Brewer, </em>260 Or App 607, 609, 320 P3d 620, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 380 (2014) (\u201cUnder ORS 138.050 *** the issues that may be appealed and those that may be reviewed in the appeal are the same \u2014 whether the disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">When the appeal is from a judgment based on a plea to a felony, however, jurisdiction lies, if at all, under ORS 138.222(7). <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 18 (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018based on the sentence\u2019 in ORS 138.222(7) was intended to limit an appeal by a defendant who pleads guilty to a felony to assignments of error concerning either the terms of the sentence or procedural or legal errors bearing directly on the terms of the sentence.\u201d). That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cEither the state or the defendant may appeal a judgment of conviction <em>based on the sentence </em>for a felony committed on or after November 1, 1989, to the Court of Appeals subject to the limitations of chapter 790, Oregon Laws 1989. The defendant may appeal under this subsection only upon showing a colorable claim of error in a proceeding if the appeal is from a proceeding in which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201c(a) A sentence was entered subsequent to a plea of guilty or no contest [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ORS 138.222(7) (emphasis added). The scope of issues that we may review when an appeal is properly taken under ORS 138.222(7) is \u201ccongruent\u201d with the scope of issues \u201cbased on the sentence\u201d that give rise to our jurisdiction under that statute. <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 18; <em>see also Brewer, </em>260 Or App at 614, (in addition to providing a basis for appellate jurisdiction in felony cases involving guilty or no-contest pleas, ORS 138.222 \u2014 and not ORS 138.050 \u2014 establishes the scope of appellate review in those cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Applying those principles, we consider the following questions in determining whether we have jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal. First, does defendant challenge only his conviction on appeal? If so, we must dismiss because the appeal is prohibited by ORS 138.050. Second, if defendant challenges something other than his conviction on appeal, do his appellate arguments concern \u201ceither the terms of the sentence or procedural or legal errors bearing directly on the terms of the sentence\u201d? <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 18. If they do, and if his arguments raise a colorable claim of error in that regard, then we have jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We begin by exploring whether defendant\u2019s merger arguments amount to a challenge to his conviction or, instead, are challenges \u201cbased on the sentence.\u201d Related questions have vexed us over the years. On one hand, the Oregon appellate courts have emphasized that \u201cmerger\u201d is a concept that applies to the merger of multiple guilty verdicts into a single conviction. <em>State v. White, </em>346 Or 275, 279 n 4, 211 P3d 248 (2009). Sentences themselves do not \u201cmerge\u201d; they are either concurrent or consecutive. <em>State v. Colmenares-Chavez, </em>244 Or App 339, 342 n 1, 260 P3d 667, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011). Accordingly, we have counseled trial courts against the once-common practice of purporting to merge offenses \u201cfor the purpose of sentencing\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cTo be perfectly clear, the phrase \u2018merged for sentencing purposes\u2019 is a misnomer and should never be used because it improperly conflates two distinct parts of the criminal process: the entry of convictions and the imposition of sentences. The concept of merger relates to the former and is controlled by ORS 161.067. The imposition of consecutive or concurrent sentences relates to the latter and is controlled by ORS 137.123. The two statutes operate independently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>State v. Mason, </em>241 Or App 714, 718 n 4, 250 P3d 976 (2011). Considered alone, that line of cases might suggest that a challenge to a trial court\u2019s decision not to merge multiple determinations of guilt, resulting in the entry of a judgment reflecting multiple convictions, is a challenge to one or more of those convictions \u2014 not to a sentence \u2014 and, therefore, cannot confer jurisdiction on this court in a case in which the defendant has pleaded guilty or no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On the other hand, we repeatedly have held just the opposite. Most prominently, we held in <em>State v. Sumerlin, </em>139 Or App 579, 584-85, 913 P2d 340 (1996) that an argument that multiple guilt determinations should have merged into a single conviction was a contention that the disposition \u201cexceed [ed] the maximum allowable by law\u201d and, therefore, was reviewable under ORS 138.050. The <em>Sumerlin </em>holding necessarily implies that, had merger been the only issue that the defendant raised on appeal in that case, we also would have held explicitly that we had jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See </em>ORS 138.050(l)(a) (this court has jurisdiction where the defendant-appellant argues that the disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law). We have adhered to that principle in the face of repeated challenges from the state. <em>See, e.g., State v. McConville, </em>243 Or App 275, 280, 259 P3d 974 (2011) (summarily rejecting \u201cstate\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s entry of two first-degree theft convictions [instead of a single merged conviction] is not an appealable \u2018disposition\u2019 under ORS 138.050(1)\u201d); <em>State v. Moncada, </em>241 Or App 202, 205 n 3, 250 P3d 31 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 545 (2012) (rejecting state\u2019s argument that <em>Sumerlin </em>was wrongly decided); <em>State v. Bowers, </em>234 Or App 301, 306, 227 P3d 822, <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 621 (2010) (similar).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Not only did <em>Sumerlin </em>hold that merger arguments can give rise to jurisdiction under ORS 138.050, it explicitly overruled contrary precedent that was based on the scope of this court\u2019s authority under ORS 138.222. In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>119 Or App 23, 849 P2d 548 (1993), we had held that we lacked jurisdiction under ORS 138.060 and ORS 138.222 over a state\u2019s appeal in which the state argued that a trial court should not have merged a defendant\u2019s assault and attempted-aggravated-murder convictions. We reached that conclusion based on our reasoning that the merger \u201cdid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>not involve the failure to comply with the requirements of the law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence because \u2018 [m] erger is not a sentence. It is the predicate of a sentence.\u2019\u201d <em>Sumerlin, </em>139 Or App at 582 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>119 Or App at 25; brackets in Sumerlin). In <em>Sumerlin, </em>we stated to the contrary that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s merger decision is <em>directly </em>relevant to whether it complied with the requirements of law in failing to impose a sentence under ORS 138.222(4)(a), as well as to whether a defendant\u2019s disposition \u2018exceeds the maximum allowable by law\u2019 under ORS 138.050(1).\u201d 139 Or App at 583 (emphasis in original). As noted, we have consistently followed that aspect of <em>Sumerlin </em>over the nearly 20 years since that opinion issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">It may appear that some tension exists between the <em>Sumerlin </em>cases (holding that merger arguments are sufficiently related to sentencing or disposition to give rise to appellate jurisdiction in cases involving guilty or no-contest pleas) and those in which we have emphasized that merger relates to convictions, not to sentences. Nonetheless, those lines of cases have coexisted for nearly two decades, and we have repeatedly rejected arguments that we should overturn <em>Sumerlin </em>based on the competing line of authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We see no reason that we should now abandon our holding in <em>Sumerlin, </em>the reasoning of which governs here. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision not to merge the felon-in-possession counts into a single conviction must be deemed, under <em>Sumerlin, </em>not to relate to his conviction; consequently, ORS 138.050(1) does not bar his appeal. Moreover, under <em>Sumerlin, </em>defendant\u2019s merger argument is <em>\u201cdirectly </em>relevant to whether [the court] complied with the requirements of law in failing to impose a sentence\u201d for purposes of ORS 138.222(4)(a), which means that we have jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>consider that question under ORS 138.222(7). And that holding in <em>Sumerlin </em>is consistent with our more recent explanation that we have jurisdiction under ORS 138.222 to consider \u201cprocedural or legal errors bearing directly on the terms of the sentence\u201d in a case in which a defendant has pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony. <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Nonetheless, the state argues that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because <em>Sumerlin </em>cannot withstand the holdings in <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 261 P3d 1234 (2011), and <em>Landahl. </em>We disagree because the holdings in those two cases do not govern the jurisdictional question here. <em>Cloutier </em>involved an appeal by a defendant who pleaded no contest to a charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants, entered a diversion agreement, and later failed to complete the program. 351 Or at 70. When the trial court subsequently entered a judgment of conviction, it imposed a sentence that included a fine that was $100 greater than the statutory minimum, explaining \u201cthat the $100 \u2018was for his no contest plea at the time of entering the diversion.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant appealed, contending that we had jurisdiction under ORS 138.050(l)(a) because he had made a colorable claim that the sentence exceeded the maximum allowable by law, given his assertion that the trial court exceeded its constitutional authority in imposing that sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 74. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, holding \u201cthat the reference to a disposition that \u2018[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law\u2019 in ORS 138.050(l)(a) does not refer to a sentence that was imposed by means of procedures that violate the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Instead, the court explained, that phrase \u201crefers to a disposition that exceeds a maximum expressed by means of legislation, not the state or federal constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Two aspects of <em>Cloutier </em>readily distinguish that case from this one. First, and most significantly, the court was addressing the scope of appellate jurisdiction created by ORS 138.050, not the scope of jurisdiction that we may have in this case under ORS 138.222. As we recently explained, the scope of appellate jurisdiction under those two statutes is not identical. <em>Clements, </em>265 Or App at 18. Under ORS 138.222, we have jurisdiction over any felony appeal from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>guilty or no-contest plea in which the defendant-appellant makes \u201cassignments of error concerning either the terms of the sentence or procedural or legal errors bearing directly on the terms of the sentence,\u201d <em>id., </em>not over only those appeals from pleas in which the defendant makes a colorable showing that a disposition exceeds the maximum allowable by law or is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual \u2014 the jurisdictional limitation that applies to appeals taken under ORS 138.050(1). <em>Cf. Cloutier, </em>351 Or at 101 (noting that appellate review under ORS 138.222 \u201cis much broader\u201d than would be the case under ORS 138.040 and ORS 138.050). Thus, even if the state is correct (and we express no opinion on this point) that a merger argument does not raise a colorable claim of dispositional error that can give rise to jurisdiction under ORS 138.050, that does not mean that a merger argument cannot give rise to jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Second, the <em>Cloutier </em>defendant was making a constitutional argument, not a statutory one, and that distinction helped drive the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis. The court did not broadly hold that <em>no </em>procedural arguments related to sentencing can give rise to jurisdiction under ORS 138.050 (although portions of its discussion admittedly hint at the possible viability of such an argument in the future); rather, it held only that a sentence imposed in violation of <em>constitutional </em>due process principles is not a disposition that \u201c[e]xceeds the maximum allowable by law\u201d under ORS 138.050(l)(a). Defendant here does not make a constitutional argument; rather, his argument is that the trial court failed to comply with statutory requirements when it rejected his merger request.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Nor does our decision in <em>Landahl </em>call <em>Sumerlin </em>into question, at least with respect to appeals that arise under ORS 138.222(7). <em>In Landahl, </em>the defendant appealed a misdemeanor DUII conviction, entered after a trial court \u201cset[] aside its previous dismissal of the charge and [entered] a judgment based on his guilty plea made upon his entry into a diversion program.\u201d 254 Or App at 48. On appeal, the defendant argued that we had jurisdiction under ORS 138.050 (l)(a) because the DUII conviction and the sentence for it were dispositions that exceeded the maximum allowable because the trial court lacked authority to enter them. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>We disagreed, rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that his conviction itself was a \u201cdisposition,\u201d as that term is used in ORS 138.050(1). <em>Landahl, </em>254 Or App at 58. Thus, as was the case in <em>Cloutier, </em>the <em>Landahl </em>opinion addressed only the scope of our appellate authority under ORS 138.050, focusing on the meaning of the word \u201cdisposition\u201d in that statute. <em>Landahl </em>did not address the scope of our jurisdiction under ORS 138.222(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">To sum up: We have jurisdiction over this appeal because defendant\u2019s merger argument means that the appeal is \u201cbased on the sentence\u201d within the meaning of ORS 138.222(7). We have authority to review that argument because it raises a claim that the \u201csentencing court failed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence.\u201d ORS 138.222(4)(a); <em>see Sumerlin, </em>139 Or App at 583 (merger decisions are reviewable under ORS 138.222(4)(a)). Accordingly, we deny the state\u2019s motion to dismiss and proceed to address the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling that defendant\u2019s no-contest pleas to two felon-in-possession charges should not merge into a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">B. <em>Merger</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">ORS 161.067, the \u201canti-merger statute,\u201d governs the circumstances under which multiple guilty verdicts or a defendant\u2019s guilty or no-contest pleas to multiple criminal charges should merge into a single conviction. As pertinent here, that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201c(3) When the same conduct or criminal episode violates only one statutory provision and involves only one victim, but nevertheless involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are violations, except that each violation, to be separately punishable under this subsection, must be separated from other such violations by a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s merger request for legal error and are bound by the court\u2019s findings of historical fact if constitutionally sufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>in the record supports them. <em>State v. Watkins, </em>236 Or App 339, 345, 236 P3d 770, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 480 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Defendant contends that, under ORS 161.067(3), he should be convicted of only one count of felon in possession because \u201cthe state failed to prove that [his] possession of one of the firearms ended before the possession of the second began\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe state failed to prove that a sufficient pause existed between defendant\u2019s \u2018repeated\u2019 violations of the felon in possession statute.\u201d Defendant relies on <em>State v. Barnum, </em>333 Or 297, 303, 39 P3d 178 (2002), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 147 P3d 313 (2006), in which the Supreme Court stated that, for two crimes \u201cto be separately punishable\u201d under ORS 161.067(3), \u201cone crime must end before another begins.\u201d Because unlawful possession of a firearm is a continuing crime, defendant contends, \u201c[o]nly if the state were able to prove that the defendant relinquished control of one piece of contraband before acquiring another, would it be able to establish that the first possession crime had ended before the other began, thus preventing merger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The state acknowledges that the \u201cone crime must end before the other begins\u201d test \u201cmakes sense in the context of a continuous series of acts during a <em>single incident </em>that, when combined, constitute a single offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state contends, however, that the test does not make sense \u201cwhen the charges are based on [acts] that the defendant commenced committing separately, at different times and places, when the offenses are of a \u2018continuing\u2019 nature and thus all happen to overlap at a single time and place.\u201d As we understand the state\u2019s argument, it is that the existence of <em>some </em>overlap in time and place between two continuing crimes does not mean that there <em>never </em>was \u201ca sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d ORS 161.067(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We agree with the state. As we explained in <em>State v. Bell, </em>246 Or App 12, 264 P3d 182 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 678 (2012), a person commits multiple, separately punishable crimes when he unlawfully obtains multiple firearms <em>at different times </em>if the person has an opportunity, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>acquiring each additional firearm, to renounce his criminal intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">\u201cHere, * * * the record establishes that defendant\u2019s acts of possession of the firearms were separate acts. He obtained each firearm from a different person at a different time and then stored each firearm in a different location within his residence. These facts demonstrate, as the trial court ruled, that defendant had the opportunity to renounce his criminal intent at each juncture. Consequently, ORS 161.067(3) authorized separate convictions for the possession of each firearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We followed <em>Bell </em>in our recent decision in <em>State v. O\u2019Dell, </em>264 Or App 303, 330 P3d 1261 (2014), another case in which the defendant was alleged to have possessed multiple weapons unlawfully. In <em>O\u2019Dell </em>we emphasized that the important point, for purposes of ORS 161.067(3), is whether evidence in the record supports an inference of a \u201c\u2018pause\u2019 in defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to \u2018separate!]\u2019 one violation from the others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311 (brackets in <em>O\u2019Dell). </em>We described two scenarios in which a sufficient pause might exist: (1) where evidence in the record supports \u201ca plausible inference that [the] defendant <em>acquired </em>possession of the different weapons at different times,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 310 (emphasis added), and (2) where evidence supports an inference that the defendant\u2019s \u201cpossession of certain of the weapons ceased and later resumed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 311. The facts in <em>O\u2019Dell </em>did not fit either scenario because the defendant possessed the four firearms simultaneously and no evidence suggested either that the defendant obtained the guns at different times or that there was a gap in time during which he did not possess all of the guns. <em>Id. </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Here, defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant acquired the two firearms from two different people. Defendant also does not challenge the inference that the trial court drew from that finding: that defendant acquired the guns at different times. Instead, he simply argues that that inference is not relevant to the merger analysis because \u201cthe fact that the offenses may have <em>begun </em>at different times does not mean that one offense ended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>before the other began.\u201d (Emphasis in defendant\u2019s brief.) Defendant acknowledges our contrary holding in <em>Bell, </em>but urges us to overrule that case. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Accordingly, in keeping with our holdings in <em>Bell </em>and <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>we consider whether the record in this case includes evidence sufficient to support a plausible inference that defendant gained possession of the two firearms at different times that were separated by a pause sufficient to give defendant an opportunity to renounce his criminal intent. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that such an inference is supported by the evidence that defendant\u2019s wife owned the rifle, which defendant knew was in their home, and that defendant had obtained the shotgun from a friend. Accordingly, each of the two felon-in-possession offenses is separately punishable under ORS 161.067(3). The trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s request for merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Motion to dismiss denied; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> As discussed in more detail below, multiple offenses that violate only one statute and involve only one victim result in \u201cseparately punishable offenses\u201d\u2014 that is, they do not merge \u2014 if they are separated \u201cby a sufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce the criminal intent.\u201d ORS 161.067(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> The trial court\u2019s \u201copportunity to renounce\u201d ruling was only one of two bases on which the court determined that it should enter a judgment reflecting two felon-in-possession convictions. The court also ruled that merger was precluded by this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Collins, </em>100 Or App 311, 785 P2d 1084 (1990), <em>overruled by State v. Torres, </em>249 Or App 571, 277 P3d 641, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012), in which we held that two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm did not merge, under a predecessor statute to ORS 161.067, because that statute \u201cdid not apply to convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm * * * because (1) the victim of a defendant\u2019s [unlawful possession of a firearm] was \u2018the state\u2019 and (2) <em>former </em>ORS 161.062 applied only to crimes having a \u2018personal\u2019 victim.\u201d <em>Torres, </em>249 Or App at 574 (citing <em>Collins, </em>100 Or App at 314). The transcript reflects that the court made that ruling because it believed that it was bound by the <em>Collins </em>\u201cpersonal victim\u201d rationale even though, in its view, \u201ca more reasoned approach\u201d under ORS 161.067(3) would focus on whether the two offenses were separated by a \u201csufficient pause in the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, to afford the defendant an opportunity to renounce his criminal intent.\u201d The trial court\u2019s view was prescient. We overruled <em>Collins </em>less than a year after the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request for merger. <em>See Torres, </em>249 Or App at 576 (overruling the \u201cuntenable\u201d \u201cpersonal victim\u201d holding of <em>Collins).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-5\"> Any tension between the two lines of cases may reflect a practical reality: although merger does, strictly speaking, relate to convictions, trial courts generally consider the parties\u2019 arguments about merger at sentencing, not when juries return guilty verdicts on multiple counts, or even when a defendant pleads guilty to multiple charges. <em>See Bowers, </em>234 Or App at 307 (\u201c[T]he time to address a merger claim is post-verdict, not at or before a plea hearing, or during trial.\u201d). That is, not until after guilt determinations have already been made \u2014 either by a jury or based on a defendant\u2019s plea \u2014 does a trial court generally make the separate determination of how many separate convictions the judgment should reflect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
