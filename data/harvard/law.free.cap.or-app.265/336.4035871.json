On appeal, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. Defendant argues that, in order to obtain a conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer under ORS 811.540, the state was required to prove that he drove evasively and, here, there was no evidence that he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Defendant\u2019s assignment of error is resolved by our recent decision in <em>State v. George, </em>263 Or App 642, 330 P3d 1239 (2014). In that case, we considered the question defendant raises here \u2014 whether ORS 811.540 requires evidence of evasive driving \u2014 and answered that question in the negative. In particular, we concluded that ORS 811.540 \u201cdoes not require evidence of evasive driving\u201d and, instead, \u201c[t]he offense is complete when, given a signal to stop, an individual knowingly continues and avoids compliance with a pursuing officer.\u201d <em>George, </em>263 Or App at 645-46. In light of <em>George, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s contention in this case that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
