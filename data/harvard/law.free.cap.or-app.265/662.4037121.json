J.</author>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Mother and father were separated but still married when their son was born, and mother gave the child her own original last name, C. After entry of a judgment that dissolved their marriage and awarded legal custody to mother, father petitioned the trial court to change the child\u2019s last name to his own last name, S. The trial court ordered the requested change by a supplemental judgment, which mother now appeals, asserting that the name change is not in the child\u2019s best interest because mother is the custodial parent and father\u2019s abusive conduct led to the marital dissolution. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings and the evidence do not support its determination that the name change was in the child\u2019s best interests and, accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings if there is any evidence to support them. <em>Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick, </em>248 Or App 539, 541 n 1, 273 P3d 361 (2012). We, accordingly, state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, supplemented with uncontroverted information from the record. <em>Id. </em>at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Mother and father were married in June 2011, and mother became pregnant immediately after the wedding. As expectant parents often do, mother and father contemplated various first and middle names for the child, with the assumption that the child would be given their married name, S. During mother\u2019s pregnancy, father began to secretly record and monitor her activities from his mobile phone, and then uploaded those audio and video recordings to his work computer. The police were called to the couple\u2019s home several times due to father\u2019s abusive behavior; eventually, father was convicted of fourth-degree felony assault, ORS 163.160(3), based on his assault of mother when she was six-months pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Mother sought a Family Abuse Prevention Act (PAPA) restraining order against father, ORS 107.700 - 107.735, and a hearing was held in February 2012. Father questioned the child\u2019s paternity at the hearing. The child was born a week-and-a-half later, in March 2012, and, when mother submitted the form for the child\u2019s birth certificate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>she selected C as the child\u2019s last name. Father was not present at the birth, and he waited three weeks before his attorney contacted mother\u2019s attorney to ask about the birth of his child. The FAPA hearing concluded in May 2012, and mother was given temporary custody of the child. The marital dissolution trial was held in August, and mother was awarded legal custody of the child and returned to her original name of C; the child\u2019s last name was not raised as an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In October 2012, seven months after the child\u2019s birth, father petitioned to have the court change the child\u2019s last name to S. The supplemental judgment granting father\u2019s petition incorporated the following oral findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">\u201cThe first and foremost factor that I\u2019m looking at here is that there was an agreement that the child\u2019s name was going to be [S] before the child was born. And [m] other changed that because she was angry. She felt shocked, hurt and discouraged when she misread [father\u2019s statement about how he wanted for once and forever put to rest the issue of paternity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cBut the reality is that the name was chosen not out of love and joy, but out of hurt and anger and shock. And so we end up with the child not bearing the name that was originally planned for the child to have. And so \u2014 and the child is young enough [that the] child has not really used a last name effectively anywhere except the doctor has some chart. And maybe the school has some chart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cBut those are easily changed. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">\u201c[Mother\u2019s] name should be on the child. So [C] is going to be a middle name. So his name is going to be \u2014 [first name and middle name] [CMS].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So [S]is going to be his last name. And so that means that\u2019s going to be his name at school, the doctors, everywhere that last name is used. His name is [S]. It\u2019s not represented as anything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cThat\u2019s what the plan was. That\u2019s in the best interest of the child, that keeps [f]ather from being disincorporated or disenfranchised from the child. And that\u2019s what it should\u2019ve been and would\u2019ve been but for [flather\u2019s foolish abuse of [m] other and his very foolish recording. And you know, it was creepy behavior, Mom. It was creepy. You\u2019re right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cBut I think this was a decision that was made out of hurt and anger. And it was a mis-decision. And it was not in the best interest of the child to pick that name when [an] other name was already picked for him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">To summarize, the trial court determined that changing the child\u2019s last name was in the child\u2019s best interests because (1) there had been an \u201cagreement\u201d between mother and father that the child would have father\u2019s last name; (2) mother\u2019s choice to give the child her own last name, despite that original understanding, was made out of \u201churt and anger\u201d; and (3) providing the child with father\u2019s last name would prevent father \u201cfrom being disincorporated or disenfranchised from the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Although mother seeks <em>de novo </em>review, we decline to exercise our discretion to conduct such review. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (stating that we exercise <em>de novo </em>review only in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases). The party requesting a name change for a child \u201cbears the burden of showing \u2018that the change of name is in the child\u2019s best interest.\u2019\u201d <em>Doherty and Wizner, </em>210 Or App 315, 322, 150 P3d 456 (2006). We review a trial court\u2019s best-interest determination for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if a trial court\u2019s discretionary determination is not a legally permissible one. <em>Sjomeling v. Lasser, </em>251 Or App 172, 187, 285 P3d 1116, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 103 (2012); <em>see McCollum v. Kmart Corporation, </em>228 Or App 101, 113-14, 207 P3d 1200 (2009), <em>vac\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Or 707, 226 P3d 703 (2010) (\u201c\u2018Abuse of discretion,\u2019 as a legal term of art, means that the court\u2019s action or decision was not \u2018within the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u2019 and did not produce a \u2018permissible, legally correct outcome.\u2019\u201d (Quoting State <em>v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000).)); <em>Forsi v. Hildahl, </em>194 Or App 648, 652, 96 P3d 852 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 124 (2005) (\u201cThe trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>abuses its discretion if it exercises that discretion in a manner that is unjustified by, and clearly against, reason and evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Although \u201cthere is no definitive list of factors to consider when deciding what would be in the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d the following factors are among those that we and other courts have used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201c1. The identity and preference of the custodial parent. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201c2. The avoidance of embarrassment, inconvenience or confusion. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\"><em>\u201c3. </em>Identification of the child as being part of a distinct family unit. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>The age of the child and the length of time the child has used the surname. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">\u201c5.

The level of support for and contact with the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-14\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-15\">\u201c9. The motivation of the parent seeking the name change or the parent seeking to oppose it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">\u201c10. The community reputation associated with the names at issue. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">\u201c11. Assurances of the custodial parent that she or he will not change hers or his own surname or the child\u2019s surname. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-20\">\u201c12. Important ties to family heritage, ethnic identity, and cultural values. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-21\"><em>Doherty, </em>210 Or App at 324-26 (boldface omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">Mother argues on appeal that the trial court placed too much importance on the parties\u2019 original plan that the child would have father\u2019s last name; that plan, she notes, was made before father\u2019s recording of mother\u2019s activities, his physical abuse of mother, a FAPA hearing, their separation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>and father\u2019s petition for dissolution. She acknowledges that she was angry with father when the child was born but contends that it was rational and logical for her to choose her own last name for the child; father\u2019s interest in the child was uncertain at that time and she believed that she would obtain legal custody. Moreover, mother points to several of our decisions where the preference of the custodial parent was an important factor in determining the child\u2019s best interests. Father remonstrates that applying the <em>Doherty </em>factors favors a determination that the child should have his last name, because the preference of the custodial parent is \u201ctempered\u201d by mother\u2019s reasons for choosing her own last name. He similarly contends that the <em>Doherty </em>reference to \u201cthe avoidance of embarrassment, inconvenience, or confusion\u201d is also \u201ctempered\u201d because mother has no other children, has changed her name more than once and, if she has future children, \u201cthey will almost certainly not be named [C], and mother may well change her name again too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Father concedes that none of the other <em>Doherty </em>factors favor him, except his motivations for seeking the name change. At trial, father testified that he was motivated to change the child\u2019s last name for the same reasons given by the trial court: there was an \u201cagreement\u201d; mother chose C out of anger; and that the child \u201cnot having my last name provides another way for him to be alienated from his father.\u201d Additionally, he stated that mother had tried to disparage the relationship between him and the child by discussing with friends and family that father had made an issue out of the child\u2019s true paternity and that she had indicated that she would eventually tell the child his father \u201cwas a criminal.\u201d He also expressed concern that if the child\u2019s \u201clast name remains [C], he\u2019s also going to have that conversation with his friends and his peers on why he doesn\u2019t have his father\u2019s last name.\u201d Father also speculated that mother would change her name if she remarried, which would leave the child \u201cthe only sibling in mother\u2019s home with the name [C]\u201d; his last name, he testified, \u201cwill never change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Much of what father argues presumes that a child should have the name of his legal father. That presumption, though not named, also lurks in the trial court\u2019s analysis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>As we explained in <em>Doherty, </em>although the historical basis for such an unnamed presumption is beyond dispute, in Oregon and elsewhere the best interests standard has evolved toward a \u201cmore gender-neutral and child-centered inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322-24. Further, \u201c[i]t is well-established law today that neither parent has a superior right in determining the child\u2019s last name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. That evolution is reinforced in ORS 109.030, which provides that \u201c[t]he rights and responsibilities of the parents, in the absence of misconduct, are equal, and the mother is as fully entitled to the custody and control of the children * * * as the father.\u201d <em>See generally Doherty, </em>210 Or App at 328 (rejecting any presumptions and preferences in application of the best interest of the child standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Although we do not presume that the custodial parent\u2019s preference of a last name is in the child\u2019s best interests, <em>id. </em>at 324, the custodial parent\u2019s identity and preference is, nevertheless, an important factor. <em>Id. </em>at 329; <em>Tibbetts and Mueller, </em>183 Or App 379, 390-91, 52 P3d 1067 (2002); <em>Gleason v. Michlitsch, </em>82 Or App 688, 691, 728 P2d 965 (1986). More than once, we have quoted approvingly a New York trial court\u2019s statement about the naming of children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">\u201c\u2018The significant consideration is that the mother has custody and it is she who will be the primary caretaking figure and who will make the major decisions for [the child]. Moreover, the court recognizes that children, as they grow older, generally prefer to use the name of the parent with whom they live.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Doherty, </em>210 Or App at 329 (quoting <em>State ex rel Spence-Chapin Services v. Tedeno, </em>101 Misc 2d 485, 489, 421 NYS2d 297, 300 (NY Sup Ct 1979)); <em>Gleason, </em>82 Or App at 691 (also quoting <em>Spence-Chapin </em>Services); <em>Tibbetts, </em>183 Or App at 391 (also quoting <em>Spence-Chapin </em>Services). In <em>Gleason, </em>we also referred to a Pennsylvania case where the court upheld a statutory provision that the choice of a last name rests with the custodial parent if the parents are divorced or separated at the time of birth, because \u2018\u201c[t]he custodial parent generally has the right to make major decisions affecting the best interests of a minor child.\u2019\u201d 82 Or App at 691 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Petition of Schidlmeier by Koslof, </em>344 Pa Super 562, 569, 496 A2d 1249 (1985) (brackets in <em>Gleason)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Other factors appear to be pertinent in this case. In <em>Doherty, </em>we stated that \u201cit is foreseeable that giving the child her father\u2019s surname may lead to some confusion and possible embarrassment to the child at those times when the child is identified as having a different surname from the surname used by her mother and three siblings.\u201d 210 Or App at 329. We also recognized that a child having a last name different from the noncustodial parent\u2019s last name could possibly affect the child\u2019s relationship with that parent, but concluded that, \u201c[i]n the final analysis, development of a bond between [the parent] and [the child] will depend on the love and devotion that [the parent] exhibits toward [the parent\u2019s child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. \u201cThe surname the child uses is <em>incidental </em>to [the] process\u201d of a parent \u201cestablishing and maintaining a strong bond\u201d with his or her child. <em>Id. </em>at 331 n 36 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">With those observations in mind, we begin by noting that father, the party seeking the name change, \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the change of name is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Tibbetts, </em>183 Or App at 390. The trial court\u2019s emphasis on its finding that mother chose her last name for the child out of \u201churt and anger,\u201d however, is directed at the initial naming of the child, rather than assigning to father the burden of showing that a change in the child\u2019s name is in his best interests; that finding, then, is misplaced and irrelevant. The motivation of the parent seeking the name change may be considered; father has not established the relevance of mother\u2019s original motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Similarly, the trial court treated as most important\u2014 its \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d factor \u2014 that the parties had an \u201cagreement\u201d that the child would have father\u2019s last name. Again, however, the court\u2019s task is to determine whether the <em>change </em>to the child\u2019s name is in the child\u2019s best interests, not to examine the merits of the initial choice to name the child, which was made at a time when the parties were separated and mother was solely responsible for parental decisions. Indeed, father then appeared to be questioning paternity. As we have recognized before, <em>Gleason, </em>82 Or App at 691, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>was appropriate for mother to choose the child\u2019s name under those circumstances. To the extent that the trial court believed that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to restore the child\u2019s name to what the parties originally planned, its findings do not explain why that is so. The inquiry is a child-centered one, and a conclusion that rests on the significance of the parents\u2019 original plans before their marital difficulties and separation turns the focus away from the child\u2019s well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The trial court\u2019s third finding \u2014 that changing the child\u2019s last name \u201ckeeps [fjather from being disincorporated or disenfranchised from the child\u201d \u2014 lacks any evidentiary support. Whereas a custodial parent\u2019s preference that a child should have his or her last name facilitates practical decision-making and the custodial parent\u2019s duties as primary caretaker, the record lacks evidence that sharing a last name would foster a bond between father and the child. Development of a bond, as we have recognized, comes from the \u201clove and devotion\u201d that a parent exhibits toward his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Moreover, on this record, father has not carried his burden of proving that it is in the best interest of the child to change the child\u2019s name: father\u2019s contention that an application of the <em>Doherty </em>factors favors a determination that a name change is in the child\u2019s best interest is unavailing. His argument that the factor we consider to be an important one \u2014 the identity and preference of the custodial parent \u2014 is \u201ctempered\u201d because of mother\u2019s anger is not relevant for the reason stated above. Also, the avoidance of embarrassment, inconvenience, or confusion that would result in having a different name than the custodial parent is not \u201ctempered\u201d by father\u2019s mere speculation that mother will change her name in the future. Even if his concern was not speculative, giving import to that argument would conflict with a gender-neutral best interest determination. Furthermore, father\u2019s motivations for seeking the name change are insufficient to carry his burden. His concern that the child will have to explain eventually why his name is different than his father\u2019s rests on an assumption that a child is burdened with a stigma if he or she does not have the same last name as his or her legal father. Again, such a concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>is not in accord with our best interest standard. Father also expressed concerns about mother\u2019s statements regarding father\u2019s request for a paternity test and his criminal conviction. Although those statements may be unfortunate, father has not explained how changing the child\u2019s last name would alleviate those concerns. We note that father did establish paternity and sharing a last name with the child will not erase the record of his felony abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The findings of the trial court either are irrelevant to the task of determining the best interest of the child with regard to the requested name change or lack evidentiary support. Accordingly, its decision is outside the range of permissible discretion. Moreover, the record, viewed most favorably to father, could not support a determination by a reasonable trial court that a name change is in the child\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, a remand to permit further findings by the trial court is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> The supplemental judgment changed the name to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">\u201cFirst.
