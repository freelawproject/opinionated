Black drove the three men in his truck. Defendant cut the firewood, and Brown loaded it into the truck. Black helped with the loading until it became too painful for him. He had a previous neck injury that was aggravated by driving on the rough road, changing a tire at the site, and loading the firewood. After several hours, Black wanted to leave because snow was beginning to fall and it would soon be dark. Black asked defendant to drive the truck because of his severe neck pain, lack of any cell phone service, and Brown\u2019s inability to use the truck\u2019s manual transmission. Defendant drove despite that his driver\u2019s license had been revoked. A sheriffs deputy stopped the vehicle on their return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Defendant was charged with driving while his license was revoked, in violation of ORS 811.182. At trial, defendant stipulated that he committed the act, but he raised the affirmative defense of necessity. The jury convicted defendant, and he was sentenced to three years of bench probation. On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error regarding the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on the defense of necessity. Because we resolve the first assignment of error in defendant\u2019s favor, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court should have given the following jury instruction requested by defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cYou do not need to find that the urgency of the circumstances actually made it necessary for the defendant to drive in order to acquit him; you only need to find that the defendant reasonably believed that the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for him to drive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The trial court declined to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction. Instead, the court gave the following instruction, which incorporated the uniform instruction on necessity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">\u201cTo the charge of DRIVING WHILE REVOKED [defendant] has raised an affirmative defense that injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>or immediate threat of injury to a human being and the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for him to drive a motor vehicle at the time and place in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201cIf he [proves] this affirmative defense then he is not GUILTY of the charge of DRIVING WHILE REVOKED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cIn this case to establish this affirmative defense [defendant] must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201c1. [Defendant] reasonably] believed that there was an injury or an immediate threat of injury to a human being. And</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">\u201c2. The urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for him to operate a motor vehicle at the time and place in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Defendant objected to the trial court\u2019s instruction, arguing that the second numbered part of the instruction was incorrect because it failed to frame the \u201curgency of the circumstances\u201d in terms of defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief.\u201d Defendant\u2019s requested instruction, he contends, cured that deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction if the instruction correctly states the law and evidence in the record supports the instruction. <em>State v. Cruz-Gonzelez, </em>256 Or App 811, 813, 303 P3d 983, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 61 (2013). Failure to give a requested instruction is not error if the trial court\u2019s instruction adequately covers the subject of the requested instruction. <em>Leiseth v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>185 Or App 53, 57, 57 P3d 914 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 443 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Tucker, </em>315 Or 321, 332, 845 P2d 904 (1993). We reverse only if the instructional error prejudiced defendant. <em>Hernandez v. Barbo Machinery Co., </em>327 Or 99, 106, 957 P2d 147 (1998) (explaining that reversal is necessary \u201cif the trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction probably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the members of the jury and if that erroneous impression may have affected the outcome of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">The difference between the instruction that defendant wanted and the instruction that the trial court gave is the reference, in the former, to defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief.\u201d To determine whether defendant was entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>instruction that he requested, we turn first to the statute. The necessity defense that defendant raised at trial is codified at ORS 811.180(l)(a), which allows a defendant to avoid liability for driving while revoked, among other charges, if defendant proves the existence of \u201c[a]n injury or immediate threat of injury to a human being or animal, and the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for the defendant to drive a motor vehicle at the time and place in question [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Although the text of the statute frames the issue in purely objective terms, the Supreme Court has held that the defense applies if a defendant reasonably believes that there was an injury or threat of injury that, under the circumstances, required the defendant to drive a vehicle. <em>State v. Brown, </em>306 Or 599, 606, 761 P2d 1300 (1988). The court in <em>Brown </em>explained that <em>\u201ca </em>defendant\u2019s perception of circumstances that constitute an injury or immediate threat thereof has to be reasonable in all the circumstances\u201d and <em>\u201ca </em>defendant himself must reasonably have believed there to be such an injury or threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, <em>\u201cwhether there was such urgency </em>is to be tested by the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief, and defendant\u2019s reasonable belief must be established by evidence of the same criteria as that concerning the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s belief that there was injury or threat thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction was incorrect and prejudicial because it only partially incorporated the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 component. That is, the first part of the trial court\u2019s instruction directed the jury to determine whether defendant reasonably believed that there was an \u201cinjury or immediate threat of injury to a human being.\u201d The second part, however, directed the jury to decide whether the \u201curgency of the circumstances made it necessary for [defendant] to drive a motor vehicle at the time and place in question,\u201d without reference to defendant\u2019s reasonable belief. Thus, defendant contends, even though he was entitled to acquittal under <em>Brown </em>if the jury found that he reasonably believed that the circumstances were sufficiently urgent to require him to drive, the instruction that the trial court gave allowed the jury to convict defendant if the jury made its own determination that the circumstances were not sufficiently urgent.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In response, the state argues: (1) that the trial court\u2019s instruction was not erroneous, and (2) that, even if the instruction was erroneous, defendant was not prejudiced by it. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The state\u2019s first contention is that the trial court\u2019s instruction was not erroneous because it adequately stated the law. The state points out that the necessity defense is codified at ORS 811.180(l)(a) and that the court\u2019s instruction \u201ccovered the statutory requirements.\u201d Acknowledging that <em>Brown </em>is what controls our analysis, the state next argues that the court in <em>Brown </em>was \u201cfocused\u201d on a defendant\u2019s reasonable belief about the injury or threat of injury, not the urgency of the circumstances. The state\u2019s reading of <em>Brown </em>is incorrect. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief applies to <em>both </em>the \u201cinjury\u201d prong and the \u201curgency\u201d prong of the necessity defense. We disagree, therefore, with the state\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s instruction in this case \u201cadequately covered\u201d the subject matter. The trial court\u2019s instruction correctly stated the law only as to the first part of a two-part test. Moreover, by expressly framing the first part of the instruction in terms of defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable belief,\u201d and omitting any reference to reasonable belief in the second part of the instruction, the trial court\u2019s instruction implicitly created the impression that \u201creasonable belief\u2019 was not relevant to that part of the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The state\u2019s second argument is that, even if the instruction was incorrect, it did not prejudice defendant. Here, the state\u2019s entire argument rests on the fact that <em>defendant </em>\u201ctold the jury to consider whether defendant reasonably believed it was necessary to drive.\u201d Defendant\u2019s arguments to the jury, the state contends, assured that the jury \u201cwould not have had an erroneous impression of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We reject the state\u2019s argument that defense counsel\u2019s arguments to the jury were an adequate substitute for a correct instruction given by the trial judge. <em>State v. Pierce, </em>235 Or App 372, 377, 232 P3d 978 (2010) (noting that \u201ccounsel\u2019s arguments are no substitute for proper instructions\u201d); <em>State v Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 356, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (\u201c[N] either the sufficiency of the evidence nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the completeness of counsel\u2019s arguments concerning that evidence is a substitute for the sufficiency of the instructions.\u201d). Moreover, the record reveals that the trial court gave the jury a standard instruction that arguments and statements by the lawyers in the case were not \u201cevidence.\u201d In effect, the state asks us to conclude that the jury would have given defendant\u2019s characterization of the law greater weight than the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">In short, the trial court\u2019s jury instruction was incomplete and inaccurate under <em>Brown. </em>Defendant\u2019s requested instruction was a correct statement of the law and was supported by evidence in the record; the jury could reasonably have found that the circumstances (including the weather, the late hour, Black\u2019s neck injury, the lack of cell phone service, and Brown\u2019s inability to drive a manual transmission truck) led defendant to form a reasonable belief that it was necessary for him to drive. The trial court\u2019s failure to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction prejudiced him because the jury could have convicted defendant based on the jury\u2019s own assessment of the \u201curgency of the circumstances\u201d rather than its assessment of what defendant reasonably believed at the time. The state\u2019s argument that defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s instructional error because of what defendant\u2019s counsel argued to the jury is not plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it refused to give the following jury instruction that defendant requested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201cThe qualifying injury or threat of injury that the defendant believed was occurring need not be life threatening; it only has to be an injury that could cause pain to another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The trial court declined to give that instruction and instead gave the instruction described above, which referred to \u201cinjury or immediate threat of injury to a human being\u201d without elaborating on the meaning of \u201cinjury.\u201d Defendant acknowledges that that language tracked the language in ORS 811.180(l)(a), but argues that clarification was needed under <em>State v. Haley, </em>64 Or App 209, 667 P2d 560 (1983), which held that an injury need not be \u201clife-threatening\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>order to qualify for the version of the statutory defense of necessity that existed at that time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The state responds that the trial court correctly rejected defendant\u2019s requested instruction because that instruction contained an improper comment on the evidence and was potentially confusing. Here, we agree with the state. By its terms, defendant\u2019s requested instruction can be read to assume what was a central issue of fact in the case, namely, that there was a \u201cqualifying injury or threat of injury that defendant believed was occurring.\u201d That is, the jury could have interpreted the phrase \u201cthat the defendant believed was occurring\u201d as a directive from the court to conclude that defendant had such a belief, when the jury might otherwise have found that defendant did <em>not </em>have a reasonable belief as to any actual or immediate threat of injury. <em>See, e.g., Watson v. Miller, </em>164 Or App 309, 316 n 3, 991 P2d 1083 (1999) (trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction that would have directed the jury to reach a specific conclusion, when the jury could have reached a contrary conclusion from the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">As to the first assignment of error, we agree with defendant that the trial court should have given defendant\u2019s requested instruction and that the failure to do so prejudiced defendant. As to the second assignment of error, we conclude that defendant was not entitled to his requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 487.560(2)(a) (1981) <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201c(2) In a prosecution [for the crime of \u2018driving while suspended\u2019] * * * it is an affirmative defense that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">\u201c(a) An injury or immediate threat of injury to human or animal life and the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for the defendant to drive a motor vehicle at the time and place in question [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-10\"><em>Haley, </em>64 Or App at 211.
