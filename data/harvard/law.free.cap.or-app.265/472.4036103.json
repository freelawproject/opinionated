After the crash, police found a firearm in defendant\u2019s vehicle and, later, found a significant amount of controlled substances in the vehicle, including heroin. As a result, defendant was convicted of, among other crimes, third-degree assault, failure to perform the duties of a driver, felon in possession of a firearm, and commercial delivery of heroin. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for third-degree assault and 20 months\u2019 imprisonment for failure to perform the duties of a driver; the court also sentenced defendant to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession of a firearm, to be served consecutively to a sentence of 92 months\u2019 imprisonment for delivery of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On appeal, defendant advances two assignments of error. First, he argues that the trial court erred in imposing his sentences for third-degree assault and failure to perform the duties of a driver consecutively without applying the \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule, OAR 213-012-0020(2)(a)(B). According to defendant, those two counts were based on conduct that occurred during the same criminal episode and therefore triggered the \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule, which would have resulted in a shorter term of incarceration. Our decision in <em>Orchard v. Mills, </em>247 Or App 355, 358, 270 P3d 309 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012), disposes of that argument. In <em>Orchard, </em>a post-conviction case, we explained that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cassaultive conduct and his subsequent efforts to evade apprehension for that assault were not directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359. Thus, we held that \u201cit was proper to impose consecutive sentences on the assault and failure to perform the duties of a driver charges without applying the \u2018shift-to-I\u2019 rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In his second assignment of error, defendant similarly complains that the court erred in failing to apply the \u201cshift-to-1\u201d rule to his sentences for delivery of heroin and felon in possession of a weapon, because the crimes were committed as part of the same criminal episode. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>did not make that argument below, and we reject that unpreserved contention without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
