We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">This case arises on SAIF Corporation\u2019s (SAIF\u2019s) petition for judicial review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (board). The pertinent facts are not disputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant is a home care worker within the meaning of ORS 410.600.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of her injury, she was employed by her client/employer through a program administered, in part, by the State of Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS). As part of that program, a DHS Case Manager generated a \u201cService Plan\u201d for claimant\u2019s client/employer and an associated \u201cTask List\u201d for claimant. The \u201cService Plan\u201d and \u201cTask List\u201d set forth the number of home care service hours for which claimant\u2019s home care client/employer was eligible under the program and identified the tasks for which the claimant would be compensated. Claimant\u2019s Task List for her client/employer provided, among other things, that she was to assist the client with \u201cmoving around outside,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201c[p]lacing food/utensils within reach,\u201d \u201c[b]reakfast [preparation,\u201d and \u201cget [ting] in/out of a vehicle.\u201d The Task List did not specifically authorize claimant to transport the client/ employer or to conduct any services for the client/employer away from the client/employer\u2019s home. Under the DHS program, claimant\u2019s client/employer was her employer, and was responsible for hiring claimant, directing claimant\u2019s work, and, ultimately, firing claimant. However, claimant was paid through DHS for providing the services on the Task List.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">One morning, after claimant had performed some services on the Task List, the client/employer requested that claimant take her out for breakfast because the client/ employer did not want to have breakfast at home. Claimant complied with the request and, while driving her client/ employer to get breakfast, was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Claimant sustained injuries requiring medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Thereafter, claimant submitted a workers\u2019 compensation claim to petitioner SAIF in connection with the injury. SAIF denied the claim on the ground that claimant\u2019s injury \u201cdid not arise out of or occur within the course of [her] employment.\u201d Claimant requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), and, following the hearing, the ALJ upheld SAIF\u2019s denial, also concluding that claimant\u2019s injury \u201cdid not arise out of or in the course and scope of her employment.\u201d The ALJ found that claimant had taken the client/employer out to breakfast at the client/employer\u2019s direction but that that activity was not on claimant\u2019s Task List. Based on those findings, the ALJ concluded that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur in the scope of her employment because it did not occur during a Task List activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Claimant appealed the ALJ\u2019s order to the board, and the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order and set aside SAIF\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s claim. The board concluded that claimant\u2019s injury arose out of, and occurred in the course of, claimant\u2019s employment, based on the fact that the injury occurred during her employment hours, while she was performing a service for her employer, and at the direction of her employer, even though the injury occurred during an activity that was not included on the Task List. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the board concluded that claimant had suffered a compensable injury. SAIF timely petitioned this court for review of the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">As explained further below, SAIF contends that the board misinterpreted the requirements of ORS 656.039(5) when it concluded that claimant was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage for an injury incurred in an employer-directed activity that was not funded by the state. We review the board\u2019s order to determine whether it reflects an erroneous interpretation of ORS 656.039(5) and, if so, whether the correct interpretation of the statute requires the board to take a particular action. ORS 183.482(8)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On review, SAIF does not contest that claimant was injured while performing a service directed by her employer or that, under ordinary circumstances, claimant\u2019s injury would be deemed to have arisen out of, and occurred in the course of, claimant\u2019s employment, in light of the fact that the employer directed that claimant conduct the activity in which she was injured. Instead, SAIF argues that, in concluding that claimant was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage for her injury, the board erroneously interpreted ORS 656.039(5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SAIF contends that, in the case of home care workers, ORS 656.039(5) supplants the ordinary framework for determining whether an employee\u2019s injury arises out of, and occurs in the course of, employment and is therefore compensable. SAIF further asserts that ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>656.039(5) limits workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers to injuries sustained while performing activities funded by the state, that is, activities on the Task List. Accordingly, in SAIF\u2019s view, the board erred by setting aside the denial, because ORS 656.039(5) establishes as a matter of law that claimant\u2019s injury \u2014 which did not occur during a Task List activity \u2014 is not one for which workers\u2019 compensation coverage is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">We reject SAIF\u2019s interpretation of ORS 656.039(5). The text and the context of that statute demonstrate that it does not impose the limitation on workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers that SAIF claims it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">ORS 656.039(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201c(a) The Home Care Commission created by ORS 410.602 shall elect coverage on behalf of clients of the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Health Authority who employ home care workers to make home care workers subject workers if the home care worker is funded by the state on behalf of the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201c(b) As used in this subsection, \u2018home care worker\u2019 has the meaning given that term in ORS 410.600.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Nothing in the plain terms of that provision imposes any limitation on the scope of workers\u2019 compensation coverage available to state-funded home care workers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, the provision does not state that coverage is limited to injuries incurred by home care workers during state-funded <em>activities. </em>Instead, the statute simply makes clear, particularly when read in conjunction with the definition of \u201chome care worker\u201d in ORS 410.600(8), that home care workers who receive state funding are subject workers for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. To read ORS 656.039(5) to say that workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>workers applies only to state-funded <em>activities </em>would require us to insert terms into the statute that the legislature did not include. ORS 174.010 bars us from rewriting the statute in that manner. ORS 174.010 (in construing a statute, courts shall \u201cnot insert what has been omitted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The context of ORS 656.039(5) also counters SAIF\u2019s interpretation of it. As SAIF points out in its brief, other provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u2014 specifically, ORS 656.031 (governing municipal volunteers),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 656.033 (governing worker experience trainees),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and ORS 656.041 (governing city and county inmate workers)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014 all provide for workers\u2019 compensation coverage for certain unique categories of workers, but all also explicitly limit coverage to specified activities by those workers. If the legislature had intended to limit workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers to particular activities, it would have said so expressly, as it did in ORS 656.031, ORS 656.033, and ORS 656.041, by stating that home care workers were entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201cprovided the injury occurred while the home care worker was performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>a state-funded duty,\u201d or some similar wording. The legislature\u2019s omission of that type of express limitation in ORS 656.039(5) indicates that it did not intend to impose one on workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In the light of that text and context,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we conclude that ORS 656.039(5) does not limit workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers to state-funded activities only and that the board\u2019s order therefore does not represent an erroneous interpretation of that statutory provision. In reaching that conclusion, we emphasize the narrowness of our holding. It is possible that there is some other limitation on the scope of workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers, but SAIF has not identified one. For that reason, we express no opinion on whether other limitations restrict workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers to state-funded activities and hold only that ORS 656.039(5) does not impose that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\"> The parties do not challenge the board\u2019s factual findings. We therefore take the facts from the board\u2019s order, supplementing with consistent facts from the record as necessary. <em>Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\"> ORS 410.600(8) provides that a \u201cHome care worker\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201c(a) A person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201c(A) Who is hired directly by an elderly person or a person with a physical disability or by a parent or guardian of an elderly person or a person with a physical disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201c(B) Who receives moneys from the Department of Human Services for the purpose of providing care to the elderly person or the person with a physical disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201c(C) Whose compensation is funded in whole or in part by the department, an area agency or other public agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201c(D) Who provides either hourly or live-in home care services; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai4\">\u201c(b) A personal support worker.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> SAIF also argues that administrative rules limit workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers to activities funded by the state. However, the administrative rules cited by SAIF \u2014 OAR 411-030-0050(3)(c) (Dec 14, 2012) and OAR 411-030-0040(3)(a) (Dec 14, 2012) \u2014 do not discuss the scope of workers\u2019 compensation coverage available to home care workers and, thus, are not probative of whether workers\u2019 compensation coverage for home care workers is restricted to state-funded activities. Moreover, a different administrative rule indicates that the Collective Bargaining Agreement between home care workers and the Home Care Commission may set forth the parameters for workers\u2019 compensation for home care workers. <em>See </em>OAR 411-031-0040(12) (\u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation and health insurance are available to eligible homecare workers as described in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Or Const, Art XV, \u00a7 ll(3)(f); ORS 410.612; ORS 410.614 (all providing for collective bargaining for home care workers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> We note that, in 2014, the legislature amended ORS 656.039 to make privately paid home care workers, as well as state-funded home care workers, eligible for workers\u2019 compensation coverage upon election by the Home Care Commission. Or Laws 2014, ch 116, \u00a7 12. As amended, that statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he Home Care Commission created by ORS 410.602 shall elect coverage on behalf of persons who employ home care workers to make home care workers subject workers.\u201d ORS 656.039(5)(a).
