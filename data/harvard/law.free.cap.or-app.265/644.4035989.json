Respondent appeals, asserting that petitioner failed to carry her burden of presenting sufficient evidence to prove that the statutory prerequisites for an SPO were met. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Under ORS 30.866, a court may issue an SPO against a person if (1) the person \u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly engages in repeated and unwanted contact with [another] person or a member of that person\u2019s immediate family or household thereby alarming or coercing the other person,\u201d (2) the other person\u2019s alarm or coercion was objectively reasonable, and (3) the unwanted contacts caused the other person \u201creasonable apprehension regarding the personal safety of [the other person] or a member of the [other person\u2019s] immediate family or household.\u201d ORS 30.866(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\u201cIn the case of an alleged speech-based contact, Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution requires the petitioner to prove that the contact constitutes a threat\u2014 that is, \u2018a communication that instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.\u2019\u201d <em>Langford v. Langford, </em>262 Or App 409, 412, 324 P3d 623 (2014) (quoting <em>State v. Rangel, </em>328 Or 294, 303, 977 P2d 379 (1999)). The threat must be \u201cso unambiguous, unequivocal, and specific to the addressee that it convincingly expresses <em>to the addressee </em>the intention that it will be carried out * * * and that the actor has the ability to do so.\u201d <em>Rangel, </em>328 Or at 306 (emphasis in original). Threats do not include \u201cThe kind of hyperbole, rhetorical excesses, and impotent expressions of anger or frustration that in some contexts can be privileged even if they alarm the addressee.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303 (quoting <em>State v. Moyle, </em>299 Or 691, 705, 705 P2d 740 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">A detailed discussion of the facts of this case would not benefit the bench, bar, or public. Suffice it to say that petitioner and respondent are neighbors and, at the hearing on her SPO petition, petitioner presented evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>statements respondent made, and actions he took, on and after the day she had a tree house built on her property. All but one of respondent\u2019s actions involved speech, and none of the speech constituted threats of the kind required under <em>Rangel. </em>Therefore, the record contains, at most, one qualifying contact. Because two or more qualifying contacts are required, the trial court erred in entering the SPO against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
