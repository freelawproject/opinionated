Defendant asserts that the trial court erred when, in response to a question from the jury, it gave the jury instructions regarding criminal trespass and defense of premises. As explained below, we agree that the trial court erred and, accordingly, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">This case arose out of events that occurred on March 23, 2011, when defendant visited her sister (Crape). Defendant and her daughter, R, arrived at Crape\u2019s home in the evening, and defendant and Crape drank several alcoholic beverages and visited while defendant did laundry. At some point during the evening, R went to sleep in one of the bedrooms of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">At approximately 12:30 a.m., defendant informed Crape that she was ready to leave and Crape, who believed that defendant was intoxicated, asked defendant not to take R with her. Defendant nonetheless proceeded to the room where R was sleeping and woke her. R told defendant that she did not want to leave, and defendant responded by raising her voice and swearing at R. Crape then pulled defendant into the hallway of the home. Defendant and Crape struggled with each other and, at some point, defendant hit Crape in the face with her keys. R watched the two sisters struggle and eventually intervened when she saw that Crape\u2019s face was bleeding. Defendant was ultimately arrested and charged with fourth-degree assault and harassment. A breath test conducted at 4:14 a.m. at the police station indicated that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.0 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">At trial, defendant asserted that she had acted in self-defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She testified that, while she was in the bedroom with R, Crape had grabbed her arm and shoved her down the hallway. Defendant testified that she refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>leave the house without R, and that Crape insisted that defendant do so and followed up by grabbing and twisting defendant\u2019s hair and pulling her down. According to defendant, she then swung upward toward Crape and struck her without realizing that the keys were in her hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The court instructed the jury on self-defense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">\u201cThe defense of self-defense has been raised. A person is justified in using physical force upon another to defend herself from what she reasonably believes to be the use, or imminent use, of unlawful physical force. In defending, a person may only use that degree of force which she reasonably believes to be necessary. The burden of proof is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt [that] this defense does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">During its deliberation, the jury sent out a question to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\u201cOn count 2 in the charge of harassment, the use of the phrase in case number four, \u2018[Defendant] intended to harass or annoy *** Crape.\u2019 Was [Crape] in her right to use lawful physical force to escort [defendant] out of the premises?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The state asked that the court, in response to the jury\u2019s question, instruct the jury on criminal trespass and defense of premises and, over defendant\u2019s objection, the court gave those additional instructions. In particular, the court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">\u201c[a] person in lawful possession or control of premises is justified in using physical force on a person who she reasonably believes to be committing or attempting to commit a criminal trespass in or on the premises. However, she may do so only when she reasonably believes it to be necessary to prevent or terminate the trespass and she may only use the amount of physical force that she reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the trespass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-11\">\u201cCriminal trespass is defined below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">\u201c [Defendant] enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of harassment and fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>On appeal of the resulting judgment of conviction, defendant asserts that the court\u2019s instruction in response to the question was erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, citing <em>State v. Oliphant, </em>347 Or 175, 218 P3d 1281 (2009), defendant contends that the court erred because \u201cthe court\u2019s clarifying instruction informed the jury that the victim\u2019s use of force was lawful if the victim reasonably believed defendant was committing a trespass\u201d but that \u201cwhether the victim believed her use of force was lawful was irrelevant\u201d; rather, the \u201conly consideration for the jury was whether <em>defendant </em>believed the victim\u2019s use of force was unlawful.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) In other words, defendant asserts that the instruction impermissibly inserted an irrelevant issue into the jury\u2019s deliberations with respect to her claim of self-defense. In addition, defendant contends that the trial court could only instruct the jury \u201cas to crimes charged in the charging instrument and lesser-included offenses\u201d and, although defendant was not charged with criminal trespass, the court instructed the jury as to the elements of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The state first responds that, in light of ORCP 59 H(l), because defendant failed to except to the court\u2019s instruction after it was given, appellate review is unavailable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, after the state submitted its brief, the Oregon Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>State v. Vanornum, </em>354 Or 614, 317 P3d 889 (2013). In that case, the court held that ORCP 59 H \u201cwas not intended to govern preservation of instructional error for purposes of appellate court review or to preclude appellate courts from reaching plain errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, ORCP 59 H does not make a party\u2019s claim of instructional error unreviewable on appeal, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>does ORCP 59 H \u201cset the standard by which the appellate courts will determine if a claim of instructional error is preserved. Instead, preservation must be determined by this court\u2019s preservation jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631. The state nonetheless argues that we should not review defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s instruction inserted an irrelevant issue into the jury\u2019s deliberations concerning her claim of self-defense because defendant failed to preserve that argument before the trial court. We are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s contention regarding preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We ordinarily will not consider an issue on appeal unless it was first presented to the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1). The question whether a \u201cparticular issue was preserved for appeal is a \u2018practical one\u2019; it will depend on whether the policies behind the preservation requirement \u2014 judicial efficiency, full development of the record, and procedural fairness to the parties and the trial court \u2014 are met in an individual case.\u201d <em>Charles v. Palomo, </em>347 Or 695, 700, 227 P3d 737 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Parkins, </em>346 Or 333, 340-41, 211 P3d 262 (2009)). Thus, we will review an issue raised by a party on appeal if the party \u201craised the issue below with enough particularity to assure that the trial court was able to \u2018identify its alleged error\u2019 so as to \u2018consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000)). The Supreme Court has \u201cdrawn attention to the distinctions between raising an <em>issue </em>at trial, identifying a <em>source </em>for a claimed position, and making a particular <em>argument. </em>The first ordinarily is essential, the second less so, the third least.\u201d <em>State v. Hitz, </em>307 Or 183, 188, 766 P2d 373 (1988) (citation omitted; emphases in original). However, \u201cwhatever the abstract content of\u2018issue,\u2019 \u2018argument,\u2019 or \u2018authority,\u2019 the appealing party\u2019s statements before the trial court must have alerted the trial judge and opposing counsel to the substance of the position that is advanced on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>198 Or App 460, 469, 108 P3d 682, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 66 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Here, as noted, in response to the jury question, the state asserted that the court should instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>on defense of premises because they needed to know \u201cwhat that defense is regarding * * * Crape\u2019s use of force against the defendant.\u201d According to the prosecutor, the jury also needed \u201cto know what a criminal trespass is because if you just give the defense of premises without letting them know what a trespass is, then they\u2019re still going to be asking for definitions!.]\u201d Defendant, on the other hand, argued that those instructions should not be given, first, because there was no need to respond to the jury question at all and, second, because the particular instructions requested by the state were improper. As relevant here, defendant asserted that \u201cthis is not a criminal trespass case and although the instruction proposed by counsel reads in conclusion * * * the defense of defense of premises has been raised, that obviously is not an accurate description of the events in this case[.]\u201d Defendant asserted that the instructions proposed were \u201cinapt\u201d and pointed out that \u201cthe issue raised by the jury is not a legal issue presented in this case.\u201d Defendant also noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\u201cif the court rules that the court will answer [the jury question] and the court makes some sort of answer directed towards the notion of criminal trespass or related topics, then I believe that the court is drawing the jury\u2019s attention to that particular aspect of the case * * * at the expense of * * * all the instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The court then announced that it intended to \u201ctry to assist the jury with coming to a conclusion by using the Uniform Jury Instructions, specifically defense of premises and the definition of criminal trespass.\u201d It read the text it intended to provide to the jury and then noted defendant\u2019s objection: \u201cFor the record, [defense counsel], you are objecting?\u201d Defendant responded by confirming her objection to those instructions being given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In our view, defendant\u2019s arguments to the trial court were sufficient to preserve the issue she seeks to raise on appeal. As set forth above, defendant clearly objected to the trial court giving an instruction regarding criminal trespass and defense of premises. And she particularly asserted that the instruction was erroneous because this was not a criminal trespass case or a case where defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of premises was raised and an instruction on those issues was, therefore, inappropriate. She also noted that the jury\u2019s question related to an issue that was not the legal issue in the case. Those arguments put before the trial court the question whether the proposed instruction inserted irrelevant issues into the case with sufficient particularity to allow the trial court to identify the error she now asserts and remedy that error had the trial court believed correction was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">With respect to the substance of defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on an irrelevant issue and, therefore, erred, as noted, defendant \u201crelies primarily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in * * * <em>Oliphant\u201d </em>In that case, the defendant was charged with, among other things, resisting arrest. He asserted that he had acted in self-defense. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c [a] peace officer may use physical force on a person being arrested only when, and to the extent, that the officer reasonably believes it necessary to make an arrest.\u201d 347 Or at 187 (emphasis omitted). The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous given the text of ORS 161.209. In particular, the court explained that \u201cthe plain wording of the statute * * * establishes that, in general, a person\u2019s right to use force in self-defense depends on the person\u2019s <em>own </em>reasonable belief in the necessity for such action, and <em>not on whether the force used or about to be used on him actually was unlawful.\u201d Id. </em>at 191 (first emphasis in original; second emphasis added). According to the court, the self-defense statute \u201cmakes the <em>defendant\u2019s reasonable belief </em>that unlawful force was being used (or about to be used) against him paramount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194 (emphasis in original). Thus, the court concluded that it was improper for the trial court to give an instruction that described another person\u2019s right to use force. Such an instruction \u201cinserted an irrelevant issue \u2014 the arresting officer\u2019s actual state of mind \u2014 into the jury\u2019s deliberations concerning [the defendant\u2019s claim] of self-defense [,]\u201d where the defendant was, instead, \u201centitled to have his right to self-defense explained to the jury in terms of what a reasonable person in his position would have believed was occurring.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Here, as in <em>Oliphant, </em>the court\u2019s instruction was erroneous. The jury\u2019s question, apparently, related to the issue of whether the force Crape was using against defendant was actually unlawful; that is, the jury\u2019s question asked whether Crape was \u201cin her right\u201d to use force against defendant. However, as discussed in <em>Oliphant, </em>defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense did <em>not </em>depend on whether the force Crape was using or about to use on her was <em>actually </em>lawful. It depended, instead, on defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that her actions were necessary. And, as in <em>Oliphant, </em>the court\u2019s instructions regarding defense of premises (which could only have related to <em>Crape\u2019s </em>right to use force) and criminal trespass (an offense not at issue in this case) inserted irrelevant issues into the jury\u2019s deliberations regarding defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. Defendant was entitled to have the jury consider what a reasonable person in <em>her </em>position\u2014 not Crape\u2019s position \u2014 would have reasonably believed to be necessary under the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Furthermore, we agree with defendant that the trial court\u2019s erroneous instruction was prejudicial. The jury question clearly demonstrates that the jury was focused on an irrelevant issue, that is, Crape\u2019s state of mind and whether Crape could lawfully use force against defendant. An instruction to the jury that expanded upon those issues necessarily further focused the jury on that irrelevant issue and detracted from the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s state of mind. As explained in <em>Oliphant, </em>defendant had the \u201cright to have the jury consider the circumstances surrounding the event from [her] own point of view,\u201d 347 Or at 194, and the court\u2019s instruction to the jury under the circumstances presented here caused a substantial risk of jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>confusion. As noted by defendant, the erroneous instruction \u201cwent to the heart of defendant\u2019s self-defense theory.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the court\u2019s error in instructing the jury was harmful and the case must be reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> ORS 161.209 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cExcept [in circumstances not at issue in this case], a person is justified in using physical force upon another person for self-defense or to defend a third person from what the person reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force, and the person may use a degree of force which the person reasonably believes to be necessary for the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> Defendant also asserts that the court abused its discretion by responding to the jury question without clarification because the jury question \u201cwas unclear and did not warrant a response.\u201d Because, as explained, we conclude that the court erred in instructing the jury on defense of premises and criminal trespass in response to the jury question, we need not address the question whether the court abused its discretion in responding to the question at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\"> ORCP 59 H(l) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">\u201cA party may not obtain review on appeal of an asserted error by a trial court *** in giving or refusing to give an instruction to a jury unless the party who seeks to appeal identified the asserted error to the trial court and made a notation of exception immediately after the court instructed the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> Indeed, ORCP 59 H(l) was amended in 2014 to specifically provide that the \u201crequirements of this rule do not preclude an appellate court from reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>asserted errors in jury * * * instructions for legal errors that are apparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\"> We note that the state emphasizes that, in <em>Oliphant, </em>the instructions considered by the Supreme Court included a longer discussion of the irrelevant issue \u2014 the officer\u2019s state of mind \u2014 than the circumstances here where the trial court \u201cessentially [referred to the victim\u2019s state of mind] just once when responding to the jury\u2019s question.\u201d However, in <em>Vanornum., </em>354 Or at 630, the Supreme Court concluded that it was \u201cbeyond reasonable dispute\u201d that it was error to give an instruction regarding an officer\u2019s state of mind in a case where the defendant had raised the issue of self-defense. In that case, where the state similarly argued that <em>Oliphant </em>was distinguishable because it involved a number of additional instructions regarding the officers\u2019 use of force, the court observed that \u201c[t]he other instructions given in <em>Oliphant </em>* * * played <em>no part </em>in our assessment\u201d of the challenged instruction. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Poitra, </em>261 Or App 818, 822, 323 P3d 563 (2014) (rejecting the same argument based on <em>Vanornum).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
