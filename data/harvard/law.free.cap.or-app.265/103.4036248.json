Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction on four counts of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, assigning error to the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Defendant moved to dismiss after learning that a detective had inadvertently read part of a letter that defendant had sent to his attorney and finding that other letters to or from his attorney had been opened. Defendant argued below that the interference with confidential communications violated his right to counsel under the state and federal constitutions. The court denied the motion on the grounds that the intrusions produced no tainted evidence and that the prosecution itself received no privileged information. As a precaution, the court limited the scope of the detective\u2019s testimony at trial. That testimonial limitation is not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We review a motion to dismiss for errors of law. <em>See State v. Penrod, </em>133 Or App 454, 459-60, 892 P2d 729 (1995) (applying that standard to an officer\u2019s intrusion into attorney-client communications); <em>see also State v. Loza, </em>244 Or App 71, 76, 260 P3d 555 (2011) (motion to dismiss). We defer to the trial court\u2019s findings that are supported by evidence in the record, and, if there are no express findings of fact with respect to disputed factual issues, we presume that the facts were decided in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>State v. Potter, </em>236 Or App 74, 82, 234 P3d 1073 (2010). We reject defendant\u2019s arguments that prejudice must be presumed or that prejudice was shown under these circumstances, and, to the extent that the state intruded into defendant\u2019s communications here, we conclude the trial court did not err in denying dismissal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The relevant facts are undisputed, even if not fully explained. The events began when defendant\u2019s eight-year-old step-daughter, K, disclosed on April 5, 2010, that defendant had engaged in sexual conduct with her. K\u2019s mother spoke with Gresham Police Detective Hickey. Defendant was arrested on April 20, and indicted on four counts of first-degree sodomy. Defendant was held in jail while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>awaited trial. The jail\u2019s Inmate Manual sought to protect the confidentiality of certain mail by permitting the inmate to write the words \u201cLegal Mail\u201d on the envelopes of outgoing mail. Otherwise, all other mail \u201cmay be read, inspected, and copied.\u201d Incoming mail, which is \u201cclearly marked\u201d from an attorney or a law firm, may be opened and inspected for contraband in the inmate\u2019s presence. The manual lists forbidden contraband items, ranging from personal checks, stamps, or tape to drugs, escape plans, or communications \u201crestrained\u201d by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Hickey suspected that defendant was sending letters through his grandfather to influence K\u2019s mother, a potential witness. Hickey filed a \u201cRequest for Inmate Mail Monitoring\u201d with Multnomah County Corrections Deputy Watts, who coordinated the jail\u2019s mail-monitoring program. Per the request, jail staff began opening defendant\u2019s mail and scanning its contents into the jail\u2019s computer system. In early July, Hickey received the first response from Watts. It was an e-mail with 30 to 50 attachments, consisting of defendant\u2019s mail from June 1 to July 1. Each attachment was a scan of an envelope or a single page of a letter. In early August, Hickey received a second e-mail from Watts containing another batch of defendant\u2019s mail. He opened the attachments in no particular order. While reading one, Hickey became curious \u201cwho [defendant] was telling this particular piece of information to.\u201d Hickey opened the preceding page to determine the letter\u2019s recipient and discovered that the letter was intended for defendant\u2019s attorney Barnett. The letter\u2019s envelope had not been marked as \u201cLegal Mail,\u201d and it did not address the recipient as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Hickey immediately contacted the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Casalino, to explain the situation. The prosecutor instructed Hickey not to communicate any contents of the letter to him and to seal it and await further instructions. Hickey printed the letter, sealed it in an envelope, and mailed it to defense counsel\u2019s office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He deleted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>files from his computer and the e-mail that contained the attachments. The prosecutor e-mailed Barnett to explain the circumstances. Barnett told defendant about the situation but said that it was probably a mistake and not to worry about it. A third batch of defendant\u2019s letters was sent to Hickey without incident. The monitoring request expired on August 27, and the last piece of mail Hickey received was dated August 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Some time later, Barnett examined two or three envelopes he had received earlier from defendant and saw they had been opened and taped closed before he had received them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant also discovered that a letter, postmarked July 27 and sent to him from his previous attorney, had been opened and resealed. The envelope had a law office as a return address. Another letter, which defendant had mailed to Barnett with a bad address and a postmark of September 15, was returned to defendant at the jail\u2019s mail call. It was marked \u201cReturn to Sender\u201d and had been opened outside of defendant\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jail deputy verified that the mail had been opened, and it was addressed on the outside as \u201cLegal Mail.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant found that another letter, postmarked November 3, from Barnett to him, had been opened outside of his presence. On the outside of the envelope was written \u201cOpened in Error K Parker.\u201d In sum, one unmarked letter, a portion of which Hickey inadvertently read, was opened, and five or six envelopes with the inscription \u201cLegal Mail\u201d were opened and resealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice based on the intrusions into his correspondence with his attorneys. In his affidavit, he stated, \u201cI am now afraid to correspond with my attorney because I believe that the attorney [-] client privilege has been intruded upon by the State, and that I am now at an obvious disadvantage in my defense.\u201d At a hearing on his motion on November 8, defendant testified that all of the letters contained trial strategy, lists of witnesses, and potential weaknesses with the state\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Hickey explained that the envelope for the letter, which he had begun to read, was not marked as \u201cLegal Mail.\u201d He testified that he did not change his investigation or act on the information in the letter. By the time he saw the letter in August 2010, he had already completed the interviews in the case. He had interviewed defendant, the victim\u2019s mother, and three other witnesses. That investigation culminated in the arrest of defendant in April 2010, about four months before he saw the letter. Hickey reported that he did not share the letter\u2019s contents with the prosecutor or any other law enforcement officers. Hickey added that he had not seen any of the other attorney-client correspondence that had apparently been opened and resealed. Deputy Watts described the jail\u2019s mail-monitoring program and testified that no one outside of the jail would have had access to defendant\u2019s mail. No explanation was given for the five or six opened envelopes other than the note on one, \u201cOpened in Error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The trial court found Hickey and Watts to be credible. The judge explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cFrankly, I find Detective Hickey\u2019s credibility was not challenged. I do believe him when he said that he didn\u2019t provide the information to the prosecutor and that he didn\u2019t change the course of the investigation, he didn\u2019t rely on the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\"><em>\u201c* * </em>* I have his word, who, you know, as I said, I find him to be credible. I appreciate the fact that he went right to the prosecutor in this case, that Mr. Casalino was very forthright about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Similarly, the judge indicated, \u201cI find Ms. Watts to be credible * * * \u201d Nonetheless, the judge found it \u201cvery troubling\u201d that the jail was not following its policy insofar as outgoing \u201clegal mail\u201d had been opened and incoming attorney letters had been opened outside of defendant\u2019s presence. The judge identified two problems in dealing with the opened envelopes. First, given the sparse evidence offered, the judge could not tell who had read what, if anything, in the letters and there was no \u201cproof of how they impact this trial.\u201d Second, defendant\u2019s only requested remedy was dismissal with prejudice. The judge observed that no rule or statute prescribed a remedy for opened mail. She said, by comparison, when a prosecutor improperly comments before a jury on a defendant\u2019s right to counsel or to remain silent, the remedy is dismissal without prejudice, typically resulting in a new trial. Here, dismissal without prejudice would be ineffectual, the judge allowed, if compromising confidences had been learned and would only be reused at a new trial. Although no communications were exploited here, defendant asked for dismissal with prejudice, thus precluding retrial. The judge concluded that, \u201cunder these circumstances where I don\u2019t have any showing of tainted evidence or * * * intentional communication of the information that was learned to the prosecutor,\u201d the court would not dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The court did respond with a precautionary order. Defendant moved for an order that would bar Hickey from testifying at trial. Instead, the court prohibited the detective from talking about anything in the letter. The court ordered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cDetective Hickey is not to testify anywhere close to the subject matter that\u2019s in that letter, and if he senses that an answer calls for something related to that, he needs to indicate so and we\u2019ll have a conversation about it out of the presence of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The court urged defense counsel to alert the court if he thought Hickey\u2019s testimony was influenced by the letter, at which point an <em>in camera </em>review of the letter could be done.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The case proceeded to trial, and a jury convicted defendant on all four counts of first-degree sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the denial of his motion to dismiss with prejudice. He asserts that Hickey\u2019s review of a letter and the unexplained opening of several envelopes violated his constitutional right to counsel as protected by Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Apparently, the state does not contend otherwise. Because the parties share the premise that the state infringed on defendant\u2019s right to counsel, we do as well.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Defendant argues that no showing of actual harm is required because \u201c[prejudice must be presumed when the state intrudes upon the attorney-client relationship.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Defendant reasons that the information taken from the letters \u201cbecomes so intertwined in the development of the state\u2019s case, consciously or unconsciously, it is impossible to separate out the prejudicial information.\u201d Defendant prefers that the opening of his mail should be conclusively presumed to have prejudiced him. Alternatively, defendant argues that, if presumed prejudice is rebuttable, then the state failed to rebut it, because the jail and prosecutor are one enterprise with collective knowledge. Finally, if prejudice is not presumed, then it was proved, defendant contends, because defendant perceived his constitutional right to counsel was \u201cimpermissibly chilled.\u201d Defendant maintains that the only adequate remedy is dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The state urges that \u201ca defendant who claims that an Article I, section 11 violation requires dismissal bears the burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the violation [.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In support, the state cites <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 34-35, 115 P3d 908 (2005), where the Oregon Supreme Court held that, under Article I, section 9, a defendant must show a \u201cminimal factual nexus\u201d between an unconstitutional seizure of a defendant and a defendant\u2019s consent to search, so as to justify suppression of the evidence. In this case, the state argues that the evidence and the trial court\u2019s findings reveal that \u201cany constitutional violations did not produce\u2014 and were not otherwise linked to \u2014 evidence or information that aided the prosecution or prejudiced defendant.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, defendant is required to demonstrate that prejudice, and he failed to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that no presumption of prejudice arises in the absence of evidence of a purposeful intrusion that conveys the content of attorney-client communications to the prosecution. If the intrusion is inadvertent, defendant must offer some evidence to show prejudice to his constitutional rights, such as the disclosure of trial strategy to the prosecution or the production of tainted evidence. If a purposeful intrusion takes and conveys privileged information, it will remain for another case to determine whether prejudice should be conclusive or might be rebutted by an appropriate standard of proof if the state could show that defense strategy or evaluations were not actually communicated to the prosecution, that no evidence resulted from or in response to the privileged information, and that no other, compromise of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights occurred. We restrict our opinion to the facts now presented to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Our review begins with Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution. It provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right *** to be heard by himself and counsel [.]\u201d This section was adopted as part of the original state constitution without amendment or debate. Claudia Burton &amp; Andrew Grade, <em>A Legislative History of the Oregon Constitution of 1857 </em>\u2014 Part <em>I (Articles I &amp; II), </em>37 Willamette L Rev 469, 519-20 (2001). The text provides no express reference to defendant\u2019s right to consult privately with counsel. <em>State v. Durbin, </em>335 Or 183, 190, 63 P3d 576 (2003). Yet, Oregon case law is resolute that \u201cconfidentiality is inherent in the right to consult with counsel; to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>otherwise would effectively render the right meaningless.\u201d <em>Penrod, </em>133 Or App at 457. It is elementary that \u201cwhen an individual has a constitutional right to consult with counsel, that right includes the right to confer privately with counsel.\u201d <em>Durbin, </em>335 Or at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The right to confer privately with counsel serves purposes in common with the attorney-client privilege. The privilege is understood to \u201c\u2018encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel OHSU v. Haas, </em>325 Or 492, 500, 942 P2d 261 (1997) (quoting <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 US 383, 389, 101 S Ct 677, 66 L Ed 2d 584 (1981)). The importance of full and frank communication has led the Supreme Court to observe, \u201cLawyers can act effectively only when fully advised of the facts by the parties whom they represent[.]\u201d <em>State v. Jancsek, </em>302 Or 270, 274, 730 P2d 14 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Unlike other jurisdictions, Oregon has not yet addressed the remedy for an intrusion into an accused\u2019s legal mail, but our case law does offer guidance. Defendant\u2019s preferred remedy \u2014 a conclusive presumption of prejudice coupled with dismissal without retrial \u2014 is a call for automatic reversal founded on \u201cstructural error.\u201d Our courts, however, have rejected the concept of \u201cstructural error\u201d under our state\u2019s constitution. <em>Ryan v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 278, 294-97, 108 P3d 1127, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 874 (2005) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument for \u201cstructural error\u201d when he could show no prejudice). The Oregon Supreme Court has explained that the concept obscures the analysis of whether legal error was prejudicial or harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 296. Worse yet, notions of \u201cstructural error\u201d are \u201cnot consistent with Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution,\u201d which requires that we \u201c\u2018must affirm a judgment, despite any error committed at trial, if, after considering all the matters submitted, the court is of the opinion that the judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>such as should have been rendered in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 28, 77 P3d 1111 (2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Typically, in order to require a remedy, a defendant must offer some evidence that the violation of a constitutional right has resulted in some harm or prejudice. In <em>State v. Lewis (A123966), </em>217 Or App 56, 58, 174 P3d 1043 (2007), the defendant contended that the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel until 13 weeks after his first court appearance violated his right to counsel under Article I, section 11, and required dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 58. We rejected defendant\u2019s constitutional claim and held, \u201c[E]ven assuming <em>arguendo </em>that defendant was unconstitutionally deprived of his right to counsel * * *, the fact remains that he has identified no evidence that the state obtained in violation of that right. Nor has he identified any other way in which he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to provide him with a lawyer during that period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59-60. Similarly, when a defendant argues that he was denied the right to a speedy trial under Article I, section 10, we have required the defendant to show some degree of actual \u2014 not speculative \u2014 prejudice to establish a constitutional violation sufficient to justify dismissal of the criminal charge. <em>State v. Garcia-Plascencia, </em>148 Or App 318, 324, 939 P2d 641, <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 58 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Mende, </em>304 Or 18, 23, 741 P2d 496 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Tailoring an appropriate remedy depends on the right at issue and the wrong suffered. For example, in considering the appropriate remedy for an unreasonable search under Article I, section 9, the Supreme Court determined that suppressing the illegally obtained evidence was appropriate because the goal of remedies for violations of the Oregon Constitution is \u201c\u2018to preserve *** rights to the same extent as if the government\u2019s officers had stayed within the law.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>313 Or 246, 253-54, 834 P2d 1008 (1992) (quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 234, 666 P2d 802 (1983)). When the state violates \u201crules of law designed to protect citizens against unauthorized or illegal searches,\u201d those rules \u201care to be given effect by * * * restoring the parties to their position as if the state\u2019s officers had remained within the limits of their authority.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>295 Or at 237. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In such cases, the remedy is to suppress evidence resulting from the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The right to counsel and an appropriate remedy are at issue in cases involving drivers suspected of driving under the influence of intoxicants. In <em>State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 74-75, 750 P2d 147 (1988), the court held that, \u201cunder the right to counsel clause in Article I, section 11, an arrested driver has the right upon request to a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding whether to submit to a breath test.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The problem arises when the state intrudes on those confidential communications. In <em>State v. Riddle, </em>149 Or App 141, 144, 941 P2d 1079, <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 68 (1997), a defendant consulted with her attorney, prior to a breath test, on a telephone line that automatically recorded phone calls. We concluded that the breath test should be suppressed, observing, \u201cDefendant is entitled to a reasonable opportunity to <em>consult privately </em>with her attorney, and the chilling effect of tape recording the communication occurs at the time of the conversation. The violation cannot be cured later simply because no one listened to the tape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In <em>Durbin, </em>the arresting officer remained in the room and within earshot while the defendant conferred with a lawyer. 335 Or at 185. The state argued that the defendant had failed to show that his communication was actually \u201cchilled\u201d or affected by the officer\u2019s presence. The Supreme Court rejoined that the court \u201cwill not speculate here as to the effect of the arresting officer\u2019s presence on defendant\u2019s communications with his lawyer ***.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192. The court concluded that the officer\u2019s presence destroyed the confidentiality necessary to exercise his right to counsel, and, therefore, violated Article I, section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">These cases have common features. The state\u2019s intrusion is contemporaneous, indeed interactive, with the defendant\u2019s exercise of the constitutional right, and further proof of prejudice becomes a non-issue. The remedy is tailored to the violation: Evidence of refusal to take the breath test or evidence of the test result is suppressed. In such cases the remedy is not to dismiss the case. In <em>Penrod, </em>the officer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>remained within earshot of defendant\u2019s telephone call to her lawyer. 133 Or App at 460. We held that defendant\u2019s breath test should be suppressed, but we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that she was entitled to dismissal. We noted that \u201cthe officer here did not attempt to intercept any conversations or otherwise engage in any misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As she talked, he filled out paperwork. He could hear defendant but not her lawyer. \u201c[H]e did not obtain or use any evidence from defendant\u2019s portion of the conversation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under such facts, dismissal was \u201cnot warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Dismissal is strong medicine. Referring to the trial court\u2019s general authority under ORS 135.755 to dismiss an indictment in furtherance of justice, we have observed, \u201c[D]ismissal *** is reserved for severe situations because the dismissal of a charging instrument frustrates the public interest in having the prosecution of crimes occur in order to promote the protection of the public and the rehabilitation of offenders.\u201d <em>State v. Hadsell, </em>129 Or App 171, 174, 878 P2d 444, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 271 (1994). In fashioning a remedy for a constitutional violation, a court should be mindful that \u201c[t]he power to bar prosecution, with all its attendant public consequences, is a drastic one to be exercised only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>17 Or App 43, 48, 520 P2d 462 (1974). If defendant seeks dismissal and if dismissal is so serious a remedy, then some demonstrable prejudice would seem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">This need has been explored in federal law, and that law lends some guidance. In <em>Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 US 545, 97 S Ct 837, 51 L Ed 2d 30 (1977), the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant is required to identify some prejudice that resulted from governmental intrusions into attorney-client communications in order to find that a violation occurred under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A criminal defendant and an undercover agent had been arrested together. The defendant asked the undercover agent to accompany him in meetings with the defendant\u2019s attorney. To maintain his cover, the agent agreed. The agent did not pass along to his superiors or to the prosecution anything about the defendant\u2019s trial plans, strategy, or anything about the case against the defendant. Later, the agent testified at the defendant\u2019s trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>but his testimony did not involve anything he learned in the attorney meetings. The defendant was convicted. Later yet, the defendant, now turned plaintiff, filed a civil rights action under 42 USC section 1983. The Supreme Court rejected any <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>or prophylactic rule for such intrusions. The Court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">\u201cOne threat to the effective assistance of counsel posed by government interception of attorney-client communications lies in the inhibition of free exchanges between defendant and counsel because of the fear of being overheard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Weatherford, 429 US at 554 n 4. That threat, however, did not exist in <em>Weatherford. </em>The Court noted that the agent\u2019s testimony concerned earlier events, not anything about the attorney meetings. None of the government\u2019s evidence resulted from the agent\u2019s presence in the attorney meetings. The Court concluded that the defendant had failed to show that any prejudice resulted from the intrusion into defendant\u2019s confidential communications, and that, without \u201cat least a realistic possibility of injury to [the defendant] or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558. The Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201cThere being no tainted evidence in this case, no communication of defense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by [the agent], there was no violation of the Sixth Amendment * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\"><em>Id. </em>Under federal law, defendant\u2019s argument for presumptive prejudice or conclusive prejudice is unavailing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Defendant urges us to take guidance instead from other jurisdictions such as Washington and Connecticut, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>defendant\u2019s references would not support either a rebuttable or conclusive presumption of prejudice in defendant\u2019s case. Well before <em>Weatherford, </em>our northern neighbor adopted a presumption of prejudice in <em>State v. Cory, </em>62 Wash2d 371, 382 P2d 1019 (1963). The Washington Supreme Court held that prejudice may be presumed where a sheriff had <em>purposefully </em>eavesdropped on a criminal defendant\u2019s private consultations with his attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 372-78, 382 P2d at 1020-23. That court directed that the charges be dismissed in order to deter the \u201codious practice of eavesdropping on privileged communication between attorney and client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378, 382 P2d at 1023. In <em>State v. Garza, </em>99 Wash App 291, 994 P2d 868 (2000), after a prison escape attempt, jail officials searched the prisoners\u2019 cells, and confiscated and examined their legal materials. The Washington Court of Appeals quoted approvingly of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis that \u201cwhen the state becomes privy to confidential communications <em>because of its purposeful intrusion </em>into the attorney-client relationship and lacks a legitimate justification for doing so, a prejudicial effect on the reliability of the trial process must be presumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 994 P2d at 872 (quoting <em>Shillinger v. Haworth, </em>70 F3d 1132, 1134 (10th Cir 1995) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Washington Supreme Court recently added that \u201cthe presumption of prejudice arising from such eavesdropping is rebuttable.\u201d <em>State v. Fuentes, </em>179 Wash2d 808, 819, 318 P3d 257, 262 (2014) (remanding for discovery where eavesdropping occurred after trial but may have influenced post-trial motions). The prosecution\u2019s burden in rebutting that presumption is high; it must show beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was not prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 820, 318 P3d at 262. In these cases, Washington has employed a presumption of prejudice based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>largely on a deterrence rationale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, these cases reflect that Washington\u2019s presumption arises when police or prosecutors have made <em>purposeful </em>intrusions into attorney-client communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Defendant\u2019s reference to Connecticut is likewise distinguishable insofar as the decision in that state was based on an even more egregious state of facts. In <em>State v. Lenarz, </em>301 Conn 417, 22 A3d 536 (2011), the prosecutor had read numerous documents which were protected by the attorney-client privilege and which detailed defendant\u2019s trial strategy. In a lengthy opinion surveying federal law, the court determined that a presumption of prejudice should arise when the prosecutor learns of confidential communications containing trial strategy. That is, \u201cthe burden is not on the defendant to establish that he was prejudiced when the prosecutor has intruded on attorney-client communications that contain information concerning the defendant\u2019s trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 22 A3d at 549 (footnote omitted). The court reasoned that \u201cbecause the disclosure of such information is <em>inherently prejudicial, </em>prejudice should be presumed [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 22 A3d at 549 (emphasis in original). The state may rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 22 A3d at 542. The court emphasized that the presumption of prejudice arises upon the disclosure of trial strategy <em>to the prosecutor. Id. </em>(\u201c[Prejudice may be presumed when the prosecutor has *** read[] privileged materials containing trial strategy.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 451, 22 A3d at 558 (\u201cThis is a case in which the prosecutor clearly invaded privileged communications that contained a detailed, explicit road map of the defendant\u2019s trial strategy.\u201d). Because the case was \u201cirrreversibly tainted by the prosecutor\u2019s intrusion into the privileged communications, the only available appropriate remedy,\u201d on the facts there, was dismissal of the charges of which defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 22 A3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Defendant urges that this case is like <em>Lenarz </em>because the jail, police, and prosecution should be treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>as one entity. Defendant suggests that knowledge in the mind of one person should be imputed without distinction to all government actors. Thus, the detective\u2019s inadvertent review of a page of a letter should be deemed communicated to the prosecutor, despite the fact the prosecutor forbade exactly that communication. As authority, defendant relies on the collective knowledge doctrine, whereby, for example, an officer in a police unit may make a traffic stop based on a request from another officer who has information that suffices as probable cause to stop a car. <em>See, e.g., State v. Soldahl, </em>331 Or 420, 427, 15 P3d 564 (2000); <em>State v. Pratt, </em>309 Or 205, 785 P2d 350 (1990). While turnabout may seem fair play, that doctrine has no application here. In these circumstances, the prosecution and detective did not communicate so as to act together to make an arrest or traffic stop. To the contrary, the prosecutor and detective both acted to prevent communication. For defendant to show the potential for prejudice like the egregious facts in <em>Lenarz, </em>something more is necessary than fiction or an inapplicable doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We cannot conclude that a presumption of prejudice, whether rebuttable or conclusive, should arise on the facts of this case. There was evidence from which the trial court could conclude that the intrusions into his mail were not purposeful. Defendant did not contest the validity of the police request that defendant\u2019s mail be monitored for the potential that defendant may seek to influence a witness. The detective\u2019s reading of one letter was inadvertent, rather than an intentional intrusion into confidential communications. Defendant had failed to mark the letter\u2019s envelope as \u201clegal mail,\u201d and he had not identified the letter\u2019s recipient as an attorney. The prosecutor was screened from the contents of that letter. The detective did not change his investigation based on the information in the letter. The investigation was complete months before. No evidence was produced at trial based on any information from the letter. None of defendant\u2019s trial strategy or evaluation of the case was disclosed to the prosecution or used to defendant\u2019s disadvantage at trial. As for the five or six envelopes which were duly if not boldly marked as legal mail, there was no evidence that the letters inside the envelopes had been read by the detective or the prosecutor. Defendant provided no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>opening and resealing of the envelopes was done with any purpose or effect of causing harm to his defense. Hickey testified that he never encountered or read those letters and Watts testified that no one outside of the jail would have had access to those letters. The trial court found both witnesses credible. We defer to a trial court\u2019s findings of credibility where they are based on an opportunity to see and hear witnesses. <em>State v. Hall, </em>166 Or App 348, 361, 999 P2d 509 (2000). This is especially true where credibility based on demeanor is a crucial factor in making an appraisal of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 362-63 (citing <em>Wales v. Lester, </em>267 Or 379, 382, 517 P2d 281 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that, if there is no presumption, then he was prejudiced because his right to counsel was \u201cchilled\u201d like that of the defendants in Oregon\u2019s breath test cases. Those cases, however, are inapposite. In those cases, the police intrusion typically is simultaneous with a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to counsel, and it happens in a limited time when the defendant\u2019s <em>only </em>communication is a telephone call with an officer within earshot. The prejudice is evident. The remedy is confined to suppression of the evidence of the breath test. Other evidence of intoxication at the scene may remain. The charge is not dismissed, let alone with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This case is unlike the breath test cases. Defendant had already fully expressed himself in the letter before the detective inadvertently saw it; nothing had inhibited defendant\u2019s communication to his attorney. Defendant and counsel exchanged five or six letters that were opened and resealed in an imperfect exercise of the jail\u2019s mail policy on contraband. Defense counsel did not discover the resealed envelopes until well after the communications. Defendant attested, after learning of the letter the detective had seen and after the return of the misaddressed and resealed letter to his attorney, that he relied on his attorney\u2019s opinion that future correspondence would not be opened. \u201cBecause I relied upon his opinion, I continued to write to him without concern for that [sic] our correspondence would remain confidential and subject to the attorney!-] client privilege.\u201d He did declare that he had become afraid to correspond with his attorney because the state had intruded into prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>communications. Whatever the explanation for the resealed envelopes, defendant and his counsel evidently did communicate in writing repeatedly. Whatever the nature of each intrusion, it was not contemporaneous with the written communication, like an officer sitting near a defendant making a call about a breath test. Unlike that single, compromised call to a lawyer, here defendant testified that he \u201cvisited in person\u201d with his attorney, and he \u201cvisited *** [o]n the phone\u201d with his attorney \u2014 on a line that was unmonitored. The circumstances here did not compel the trial court to have concluded that defendant\u2019s ability to communicate with his attorney was impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In sum, these facts do not justify a presumption of prejudice. Even if a presumption were posited, it would be rebutted on facts in which an inadvertent intrusion is immediately disclosed to the defense, steps are taken to isolate the prosecutor from any privileged information, no defense strategy or evaluation is revealed, and no evidence from any intrusion clouds the trial. Ultimately, the record supports the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that defendant was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The trial court did act to respond to the potential for a violation of defendant\u2019s right to counsel. As recounted at the outset, the court forbade the detective from testifying about anything related to the content of the letter seen. The court invited defense counsel to be alert for any indication during trial of evidence related to any improper intrusion. The court was willing to stop the trial and conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the privileged communications in order to insure the intrusions into defendant\u2019s mail did not produce testimony or evidence at the trial. Defendant never saw need for the court\u2019s added protection. Neither the state nor defendant have assigned error to the court\u2019s tailored response to the risk of prejudice to defendant. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s chosen remedy was appropriate, and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was too much to ask. <em>See Lewis, </em>217 Or App at 61 (refusing dismissal in the absence of tainted evidence or other prejudice); <em>see also Penrod, </em>133 Or App at 460 (refusing dismissal). The trial court did not err in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Finally, defendant assigns error in his supplemental brief to the trial court\u2019s admission of testimony by an examiner at CARES Northwest regarding \u201cdelayed reporting.\u201d As to relevance, <em>State v. White, </em>252 Or App 718, 725, 288 P3d 985 (2012), explains that testimony about \u201cdelayed reporting\u201d counters a possible inference that the delay is indicative of fabrication. As for \u201cvouching,\u201d there was none. The witness testified that delayed disclosure \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean abuse did happen or didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The testimony did not implicate <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009). No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\"> When the detective learned that defense counsel never received the subject letter from him, he asked Watts to email him the scan of only the envelope to defendant\u2019s letter.

Hickey realized that Watts had sent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>entire batch of defendant\u2019s mail, which likely contained the letter from defendant to Barnett. He did not open any of the attachments and again contacted the prosecutor to report what had happened. The prosecutor told Hickey not to do anything and Hickey did not delete the e-mail.
