She assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of her motion for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence that she intended to tamper with evidence that was to be introduced in \u201can official proceeding which is then pending or to the knowledge of such person is about to be instituted,\u201d as ORS 162.295 requires. We review challenges to the sufficiency of evidence to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational factfinder could find the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The facts are undisputed. Defendant petitioned for and was granted a temporary restraining order against her ex-boyfriend, Coffman. A hearing on whether to continue the order was scheduled for July 22, 2010. The day before the hearing, defendant reported to Officer Peterson that Coffman had violated the temporary order and that she wanted the order to be enforced by the police. In the course of her report, defendant told Peterson that Coffman had broken her lamp in the trailer where she and Coffman lived. Peterson arrived at the trailer a short while later, but no one was home. He peered into an open window and saw an undamaged lamp that matched defendant\u2019s description, in the middle of the living room floor. Peterson took a photo of the lamp through the window. Later that day, the trailer park manager heard \u201ca bunch of smashing and breaking\u201d in the trailer, went to see what the noise was, and found defendant inside. Defendant told the manager that she was waiting for the police. She was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn that Peterson had already come and left. On July 26, Peterson returned to the trailer and saw that the lamp had been smashed on the living room floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Defendant was charged with initiating a false report, ORS 162.375, and tampering with physical evidence, ORS 162.295. As to tampering, the charging instrument alleged that defendant \u201cunlawfully and knowingly [altered] physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>evidence, to-wit: a lamp, thus impairing its veracity, with the intent that it be used in an official proceeding which to the knowledge of * * * defendant was about to be instituted, to-wit: arraignment.\u201d Defendant opted for a bench trial and moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts. Defendant argued, among other things, that there was no \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d that she knew was pending or about to be instituted, as required by ORS 162.295. Defendant pointed out that the state alleged \u201can arraignment\u201d in the charging instrument but had not indicated whose arraignment was at issue. The state responded that defendant knew that there was an official proceeding the following day \u2014 the hearing on the restraining order \u2014 and that it was insignificant that the charging instrument \u201csays arraignment\u201d because \u201c[a]ny official proceeding includes potential future proceedings.\u201d The trial court denied the motion, determining that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">\u201cI think when you tamper with physical evidence * * * the issue is at the time you tampered with it * * * what was the intention. And * * * [an] arraignment is what happens to people after they\u2019re charged with a crime. The initiating a report was to hold somebody in violation of a restraining order, which would have been a contempt, which would have been a proceeding for arraignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cThe fact that the state later decided not to arraign somebody can\u2019t be a defense to tampering with * * * physical evidence or they\u2019d never be able to convict somebody of that because as soon as they decide they were tampering and that\u2019s the only reason they had it charged, they wouldn\u2019t bring the charge. You\u2019d have a complete defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">At the conclusion of trial, defendant was convicted of tampering with physical evidence and acquitted of initiating a false report.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On appeal, defendant reiterates her arguments that the state failed to provide evidence of a pending official proceeding or an official proceeding that was \u201cabout to be instituted.\u201d Defendant argues that, as for an official proceeding \u201cabout to be instituted,\u201d the plain text of ORS 162.295 requires imminency and defendant\u2019s knowledge of a proceeding that is likely to occur. In her view, the text of the statute does not allow for a conviction based on an inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>defendant hoped that Coffman would be cited with contempt of the restraining order. Instead, she argues, the statute \u201cexcludes from its scope proceedings that are only a mere future possibility.\u201d The state responds that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion. The state argues that the statute should be satisfied because the evidence permits the inference that defendant intended Coffman to be prosecuted, albeit for a crime he did not commit. In the state\u2019s view, the element involving an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d would be satisfied if defendant believed or intended that the tampered physical evidence would be used in a proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is so, the state believes, regardless whether a proceeding materializes. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The statute on tampering with physical evidence provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of tampering with physical evidence if, with intent that it be used, introduced, rejected or unavailable in an official proceeding which is then pending or to the <em>knowledge </em>of such person is <em>about to be </em>instituted, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">\u201c(a) Destroys, mutilates, alters, conceals or removes physical evidence impairing its verity or availability; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">\u201c(b) Knowingly makes, produces or offers any false physical evidence [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">ORS 162.295 (emphasis added). The plain text of ORS 162.295 requires that \u2014 in absence of a pending proceeding at the time of the tampering \u2014 a person have \u201cknowledge\u201d of a proceeding that is \u201cabout to be instituted.\u201d \u201cKnowledge\u201d of a proceeding that is \u201cabout to be instituted\u201d is not the same as a hope for a proceeding to be instituted at some indefinite point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">That plain meaning parallels the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of related but differing text in a neighboring statute. In <em>State v. Bailey, </em>346 Or 551, 561, 213 P3d 1240 (2009), the Supreme Court construed ORS 162.285, involving witness tampering, and, in the discussion, compared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d element in ORS 162.295.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>The court observed that there was a \u201cclear expression of legislative intent,\u201d as to the requirement in the statute on the tampering with physical evidence that an official proceeding either be pending or about to happen at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 562. As the court explained, tampering with physical evidence \u201cexpressly provides that an official proceeding must be pending at the time of the tampering conduct or that, in the alternative, the person charged with tampering must know that an official proceeding is <em>about </em>to be instituted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561 (emphasis in original). The court distinguished that requirement from the differing language involving an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d related to the crime of tampering with a witness, where it determined that the proceeding element could be satisfied by \u201cthe offender\u2019s reasonable belief that a proceeding * * * <em>might commence in the </em>future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564 (emphasis added). Absent text like a proceeding \u201cabout to occur,\u201d the court held that witness tampering can occur even when no proceeding is pending or imminent. <em>Id. </em>The statute punishes \u201cconduct that was based on the offender\u2019s reasonable <em>belief </em>that a proceeding either was underway or might commence in the future.\u201d <em>Id?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In our case, the plain text of ORS 162.295 cannot be reconciled with the state\u2019s argument that it sufficed that defendant intended that her accusation would result in a future contempt proceeding against Coffman. A \u201cbelief\u2019 about a proceeding that \u201cmight\u201d occur is not the same as \u201cknowledge\u201d of an actual proceeding that is \u201cabout to be instituted.\u201d The state\u2019s interpretation approaches the broader meaning that <em>Bailey </em>applied to the related, but distinguishable, witness-tampering statute. That broader meaning does not apply to the differing text here.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>We turn to whether a rational factfinder could find the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cunningham, </em>320 Or at 63. Presumably, defendant called the police because she wanted to trigger a contempt proceeding for Coffman\u2019s \u201cviolation\u201d of the restraining order or to have Coffman cited for some other crime. She returned to the trailer and destroyed the lamp to support her accusation. Such facts leave no doubt as to defendant\u2019s conduct. The evidence presented at trial, however, falls short of what is required by ORS 162.295. The state was required to show evidence that defendant destroyed the lamp with \u201cintent that it be used, introduced, rejected or unavailable in an official proceeding which is then pending or to the knowledge of such person is about to be instituted.\u201d ORS 162.295(1). \u201cKnowledge\u201d of an official proceeding that is \u201cabout to be instituted\u201d cannot be merely desired or based on a defendant\u2019s belief that a proceeding \u201cmight commence in the future.\u201d <em>Cf. Bailey, </em>346 Or at 564. The imagined \u201carraignment\u201d of defendant\u2019s ex-boyfriend was not sufficient for the statute\u2019s element. As a consequence, this evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find the \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d element of the offense. The motion for a judgment of acquittal on the tampering charge should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\"> The state does not argue, on appeal, that evidence of the hearing on the restraining order was sufficient to prove defendant had knowledge of an official proceeding pending or about to be instituted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\"> The court observed that the text of the two statutes, ORS 162.285 and ORS 162.295, \u201care related not only by proximity in the Oregon Revised Statutes, but by history and subject matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561 n 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> The court arrived at its conclusion by observing that ORS 162.285(l)(a) does not include the same express text of ORS 162.295 and noting that, \u201c [generally when the legislature includes an express provision in one statute and omits the provision from another related statute, we assume that the omission was deliberate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
