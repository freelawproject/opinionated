Defense counsel seeks to be relieved of his assignment as counsel for defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Upon our review of the record and defense counsel\u2019s brief, we agree. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty and was sentenced in accordance with the negotiated plea agreement. The judgment is, accordingly, affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979 [1985], <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650 [1986]; <em>see generally People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Crew III, J.P., Carpinello, Mugglin, Rose and Lahtinen, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
