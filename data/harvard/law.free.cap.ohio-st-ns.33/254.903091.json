To impeach the validity of that title, it is averred that, in 1859, their father, Henry, and mother, the defendant, Christina, were residents of Seneca county, and, on the 28th of March of that year, to secure a debt to one Nighswander, made to him a mortgage on this lot, which was duly recorded, and which, by transfer, became the property of John Lauer, December 28,1863; that their father had, in 1859, left his place of residence, and had been absent and unheard of for more than ton years after 1863, and was, in fact dead, having died seized of this equity of redemption; that, on the 28th of February, 1865, one David Biehler commenced proceedings in attachment in the. court of common pleas, against said Henry, as a non-resident of the state, to collect an alleged debt of some $300, under which this lot was seized upon the writ of attachment; that, before service was completed, Lauer, as assignee of the mortgage, appeared and filed his answer and cross-petition, setting up his mortgage, claiming priority over the attachment, and asking for a foreclosure and sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">Such proceedings were had that the court, on the 19th of May, 1865, rendered a judgment in favor of Biehler, on his attachment, for the amount claimed to be due, found amount due on the mortgage, and its priority, and ordered a sale to pay both claims. Upon this judgment, the lot was sold to Mary Zimmer, the sale confirmed, and a sheriff\u2019s deed made to her. The money realized ($600), after payment of costs, was applied to pay off the mortgage, and the balance on Biehler\u2019s judgment. In January, 1868, Zimmer conveyed to defendant, Leibrock.

If the petition contained a statement of all the-facts for an attachment as required by section 192 of the code, still there is no authority for issuing the order. Such statements in the petition would be mere surplusage. The-code requires certain distinct matters to be stated by affidavit to authorize an attachment. These matters are to be plainly stated for the inspection of the clerk, and upon which he issues the order. They are different from the allegations-of the pleading. The statements and legal effect of pleadings are matters addressed to the court; the statements-of such affidavit have no legal effect except as they state-the plain facts required by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">The verification of this petition contains no statement beyond what is necessary for a mere verification, and this-is sworn to only as a matter of belief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">The clerk therefore issued this order of attachment without any authority whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">But the irregularities of the case did not stop here. After the service of the order of attachment, the plaintiff proceeded to publish notice to the defendant to complete the-jurisdiction over his person. Before this publication could be legally made, an affidavit, as required by section 71 of the code, should have been filed. This affidavit is-wholly wanting. Here again it will be seen that some parts of what such an affidavit should contain are stated in the verification to the answer of th.e defendant. Lauer;: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u2022and it will be noticed that this verification is made April 4, 1865, about three weeks after the notice was first published. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-5\">.The notice to the defendants, published as stated, is wholly insufficient to give the court jurisdiction over them, \u2022or the property sought to be appropriated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-6\">Section 72 of the code requires that the notice must contain a summary statement of the object and prayer of the \u25a0petition, mention the court wherein it is filed, and notify the person or persons thus to be served, when they are required to answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">This notice, if everything prior to it were regular, is not \u2022sufficient to bring the defendants before the court, and a judgment resting on it for jurisdiction over the person is simply void. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Starks, </em>1 Ohio St. 369 ; <em>Calkins </em>v. . Johnson, 20 Ohio St. 539; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>12 Ohio St. 253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The notice also fails to give a description of the prop- \u2022 erty attached, or to state that an order of attachment was issued in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">The notice should have stated that an order of attachment had issued, and give a description of the property seized under it. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>2 Western Law Gazette, 44; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>McKim., </em>2 Western Law Monthly, 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">There is yet another feature of the case that ought not to be overlooked, for if the judgment recovered by the the plaintiff should be void, the decree obtained by the defendant, Lauer, might possibly be valid, and that alone might sustain the sale made under the decree taken in the .\u25a0case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-11\">In the first place, Lauer w7as not properly made a defendant. He held a mortgage on the lot attached. The attachment, if valid, created a lien, and after judgment in the case in which the attachment was issued, a bill by the plaintiff against the owner of the lot, and Lauer, a lien-'holder would have been proper to marshal liens. But in this case Lauer was improperly made a party, and had no night to a decree on cross-petition.

The failure to mention the court wherein the cross-petition is filed, follows into the part of the notice given by Lauer. The notice says that \u201c John Lauer filed his answer and cross-petition therein.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">And if the proceedings by which jurisdiction over either the person of Endel, or the land attached, were so defective-as that he did not have his day in court, both judgment and-decree are void. <em>Calkins </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>20 Ohio St. 539.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-6\"><em>Gr. JE. Seney, </em>for Leibroek, one of the defendants in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">If the proceedings under which the sale was made are-invalid and make no title to the purchaser, then, we insist that Leibroek, in equity, is subrogated to the rights of the-creditor against the debtor, and has an equitable lien upon the premises as against the plaintiffs, for the sum ($600) for which the premises were sold. 2 S. <em>&amp; C. 1149.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\"><em>We </em>insist, further, that the plaintiffs must do equity if they would have equity. Upon this maxim, they can have no relief before paying, or offering to pay, the $600, or showing this sum satisfied by rents and profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">Standing, then, as do both parties, in a court of equity, we, upon our part, ask that that which is equitable, and-that only, be done. The equity of the plaintiffs in these-premises, if any they have, is a mere right to redeem. Our equity, represented as it is, by the mortgage, and the debt for which the attachment issued, in dollars and cents, exceeds $1,300. We submit, therefore, that until this sum is satisfied, the plaintiffs have no right to our humble home. Nothing short of satisfying the whole debt meets the demands of the law. Satisfaction of a part is not a satisfaction of the whole. Satisfaction of the mortgage debt, even by rents and profits, is no satisfaction of the debt the attachment represents, nor is it a satisfaction of the sum' ($600) we paid for the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The title to these premises is not to be defeated by offensive technicalities. The case, we must bear in mind, is in equity. Equitable relief, and none other, is sought. Dealing in equities, equitable considerations control. The proceedings supporting this title are in attachment and foreclosure. Their construction must be liberal \u2014 liberal to the utmost \u2014 liberal to an extent not forbidden by positive law. \"We concede their irregularity. Possibly they are erroneous. Surely they are not void. The jurisdiction of the court was, as we think, full and complete. Upon the other-side, it is claimed that jurisdiction is wanting, for the reason that the order of attachment was issued without the affidavit required by section 192 of the code. Was this the fact, it would not, in our judgment, make the proceedings void. Jurisdiction in the action is not dependent upon the-affidavit which is required for an order of attachment.. The attachment is not the action, but a proceeding ancillary to the action. If there is jurisdiction in the action,, there is jurisdiction also in the ancillary proceeding. So that, the want'of an affidavit required by a proceeding ancillary to the action, can not defeat jurisdiction, properly acquired, in the action. Assuming then, for the present, that the court had jurisdiction in the action, by proper service upon the defendant, the issuing of the order of attachment without the affidavit required by section 192 of the code, is a mere irregularity, or error, for which the proceeding, in this particular, might be reversed. If the defendant was properly served in the action, in legal judgment, he was present in court when these proceedings were had. Being thus present, his failure to object to the final judgment, if not to what preceded it, waived that which is now urged against the proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-5\">All that section 192 of the code requires to be stated in an affidavit for an order of attachment, appears in the petition filed in the case. This petition, it will be seen, is verified by the oath of the plaintiff. So that, the facts authorizing an order of attachment to issue, were stated by the plaintiff, upon his oath, and in that which is of record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>in the case. It would have been better practice if these facts had been stated in a separate and distinctpaper. This irregularity, great as it may be, does not vitiate the proceedings and make this title, otherwise perfect, worthless. The same irregularity appears in the case of <em>Harrison </em>v. King, 9 Ohio St. 388. In this case, the court say the affidavit and order of attachment constitute no part of the pleadings in the action, and the grounds for an attachment should not be stated in the petition. The case, it will be observed, was before the court upon error to an order refusing to discharge an attachment, The irregularity referred to, was not made a question in the case. The court spoke of it as incorrect practice. In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Sutterfield, </em>27 Ohio St. 421, the court say it is not good pleading to copy a written instrument into the pleading, and upon a motion for that purpose the pleading would be reformed. But when it has been done without objection, and- the petition shows facts sufficient to make an action, the judgment will not be reversed. These adjudications show, as we think, the unimportance of the objection urged against the jurisdiction of the court, in the case made by the proceedings we are considering.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-4\">But it is urged that the proceedings are void because service by publication of notice was not made in the manner and form prescribed by section 71 of the code. This section requires an affidavit to be filed that service of a summons can not be made within the state, and that the case is one in which service may be had by publication of notice. The petition, it will be noticed, contains all that section 71 requires to be stated in the affidavit, and is, as we have already said, verified by the oath of the plaintiff in the action. The facts which authorized the publication of notice, we repeat, were sworn to, and the filing of the petition made them of record in the case. Had they been stated in an affidavit, instead of a pleading, the proceeding, according to the law of the other side, would be free from objection. This irregularity has the same dimensions as the one first considered. Upon the strength of the two cases cited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Harrison </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Ohio St. 888, and <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>27 Ohio St. 421, it is of no moment. We submit, therefore, that the maintenance of the title, made by the proceedings we are considering, is a matter of the first importance. It ought not to perish if that which even savors of law will save it. The petition contains all that sections '71 and 192 of the code require to be stated in the respective .affidavits for which these sections provide, and is verified by an oath. The petition and the oath are matters of record. Give the petition, then, the force and effect of an .affidavit for an order of attachment, and also of an affidavit authorizing the publication of notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">There is another ground upon which jurisdiction in this proceeding is assailed. The plaintiff's-say the published notice falls short of what is required by section 72 of the code. This section provides that the notice shall contain .a summary statement of the object and prayer of the petition, mention the court wherein it is filed and notify the person when he is required to answer. The purpose of a notice is the same as that of a summons. The summons notifies the defendant that he has been sued and the same thing, precisely, is done by the notice. The summons is served by delivering a copy to the defendant, or by leaving one at his place of residence. The notice is served by publishing it in a newspaper. When the summons is served, or the notice published, the defendant is in court. Service of the summons by copy at the defendant\u2019s residence is constructive, yet it gives jurisdiction over the person. Service by publication of notice is constructive, and gives jurisdiction in the pending proceeding. We submit, therefore, that the notice and the summons are, in effect, one and the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">We submit, therefore, that the provisions of section 72 that the notice contain a summary statement of the object and prayer of the petitiou, and state the time for answer, is merely <em>directory, </em>and that neither statement is essential to jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">The notice in the case before us, is all that is required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the law applicable to the the case. Under it, the court had jurisdiction in the proceedings as a foreclosure, if not in attachment. As a proceeding foreclosing a mortgage, we urge that the notice is sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-4\">It contains, as we think, a summary statement of the object and prayer of the cross-petition, mentions the court wherein it is filed, and states the time when answer is required. The plaintiffs say that Lauer was not a proper partyr Whether in such an action, founded as it is upon a debt, a mortgagee of the debtor may intrude, or be summoned, and foreclose his mortgage, is a matter we need not discuss. Sufficient is it to say, that the irregularity, if such it would be, would not make Iroid a sale, made under the proceedings, after its confirmation, and when the purchaser is in possession under his deed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-5\">Johnson, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aae\">The plaintiffs allege that these proceedings were no bar to their right to redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">It is an elementary principle that no man\u2019s rights should be adjudged until he has had his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">When judgment is authorized by statute, upon constructive service, the statutory method of acquiring jurisdictions should be substantially followed, or the person is not bound.. This substitute for personal service arises out of the necessity of the case, and should be complied with to give-jurisdiction over the property seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">From this record it appears, that on the 8th day of February, 1865, Biehler, as an attaching creditor, commenced an action against Henry Endel, father of plaintiffs, then living, in which Lauer, his mortgagee, was also coupled as a defendant. Two causes of action are stated in the petition against Endel alone, one upon a note made in California, bearing a special rate of interest, for $160, and the other on an open account.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In addition to the averments proper to state these causes-of action, the petition also alleges that Endel is a non-resident of Ohio, upon whom service can not be made in this-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>state ; that he owned the lot in controversy in the county,, and that the defendant Lauer had some interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">These averments were properly no part of the petition. It is verified upon belief merely.</p>\n<p id=\"AEp\">There are numerous errors and 'irregularities in this re cord, for which it would be reversed, but we will only notice those which we regard as affecting the jurisdiction of the court, to make a valid sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> There was no personal service, nor was there any foundation laid for constructive service.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In an attachment proceeding, which is ancillary to the-action, where personal service can not be made, service by publication can not be made, unless an attachment is lawfully issued and property taken under it, or reached by garnishee process, which the court may act on, and no attachment can issue without the requisite affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Section 192 of the civil code requires, that before the writ issue, an affidavit must be filed, showing the nature of the-plaintiff\u2019s claim, that it is just, the amount affiant believes he should recover, and the existence of some one, at least,, of the specified grounds for an attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">No affidavit was filed, and unless the petition can be looked to, and found to supply this important omission, the writ was void, and no -jurisdiction was acquired by a seizure of the land under it, and if no valid seizure was made, no service by publication could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">In <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>King, </em>9 Ohio St. 388, it was held that the-affidavit and order of attachment formed no part of the-pleadings, and that the grounds for an attachment should not he stated in the petition. \"We may assume, however, as was.held in 17 B. Mon. 321, that if the petition contains all the showing necessary in an affidavit, and is properly verified, the omission would be cured, without so deciding, as an examination of the record shows it is fatally defective, as an affidavit for an attachment. The petition, or rather the surplus allegations thereof, do not purport to follow the requirements of section 192 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">There is no statement that the claims sued on are just\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>.-a very essential feature of an affidavit \u2014 nor of the <em>amount </em>affiant believes he ought to recover. The allegation in the petition, of the amounts due on the note and account, sworn to on <em>belief </em>only, is not a showing that the claims .are just. The petition only shows that he believes there is so much <em>due </em>on, the note and account, but whether they are just claims in his favor, which he truthfully believes he .should recover, is not shown. <em>Dunlevy </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>17 Ohio St. 640; <em>Garner </em>v. <em>White, </em>23 Ohio St. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Without noticing the other defects apparent on the record, such as the omission of an affidavit for publication, \u2022as required by section 71 of the code, or that the notice .published was defective, in not stating the <em>court </em>in which the case was pending, and in not stating a summary of the \u2022object of the petition, and in being misleading as to the nature of the causes of action and amount sued for, we think the fact that there was not the requisite affidavits to authorize the issuing of the attachment, renders all subsequent proceedings under it void.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> It only remains to inquire if the court acquired juris\u25a0diction to make this sale, under the cross-petition of John Lauer, who was joined as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">He was served, and filed a cross-petition, setting up a mortgage made by Henry Endel, the condition of which 'had been broken, and asking for a foreclosure. He was in no sense a proper party to the causes of action stated in the petition. They were for a money judgment against Endel alone. Until judgment was rendered thereon against Endel, and levied on the land mortgaged to him, or sought to be sold upon final judgment in attachment, the controversy could not affect his interests in the land, and he had no interest in the action itself. The petition averred that Lauer had some interest in the property that was afterward attached, as the reason for making him a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">By section 84 of the code, \u201c any defendant, <em>who is properly made a defendant, </em>may claim, in his answer, relief <em>touching the matters in question in the petition, </em>against the plaintiff, or against other defendants in the same action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In <em>Harrison </em>v. King, 9 Ohio State, 383, and in <em>Ward </em>v. Howard, 12 Ohio St. 158, the principle is settled that other attaching creditors can not become defendants in a prior-attachment, for the purpose of asserting their claims against the property, as they are not proper parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Eor the reasons assigned in these eases, the mortgagee is not a proper party defendant, in an attachment of the; property subject to his mortgage. As was then said, his. interest is connected with the special proceedings in attachment, and not with the matters stated in the petition. <em>Hillier </em>v. <em>Stewart et al., </em>26 Ohio St. 652, is also in point, and decisive.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Again, it is a fundamental rule in equity that it will not entertain a bill for relief, in an action at law, until the legal remedy is exhausted. Biehler\u2019s action was one at law. Until after judgment at law, and a failure to make the-money under his attachment, or upon execution, he had no right to compel the mortgagee to foreclose his mortgage, so that he might reach the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> But, assuming that we are in error in this, and that Lauer, as mortgagee, could be made a party, and his-mortgage foreclosed in the attachment suit, still the proceedings on this cross-petition were fatally defective. As. the court acquired no jurisdiction over the property, by by the attachment, none could be acquired under the cross-petition, unless the proper steps were taken, as in an independent action to foreclose his mortgage. Service by publication was a condition precedent to foreclosure, the mortgagor not being before the court already. His cross-petition was not filed until April 4, 1865. The notice was first published <em>March </em>7,1865, and for six consecutive weeks thereafter, so that four of those publications were <em>prior </em>to the commencement of his cross-action, and Endel was notified to answer in three weeks (April 25) after it was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The statute authorizing constructive service is in derogation of common right, and should be pursued substantially,.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>No service could be complete, until six consecutive publications, and a judgment of foreclosure, before such service, where there was no personal service, rendered the order of foreclosure and sale unauthorized, and ineffectual to bar the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Some question has been made as to the right of Leibrock, who holds under the sheriff\u2019s deed, made under these proceedings, which we have held are no bar to plaintiffs\u2019 right to redeem, to be subrogated to .the mortgagee, and the attaching creditor, for the amount of purchase-money paid -at the sheriff\u2019s sale, which was applied to the satisfaction \u2022of the mortgage and the claims of the attaching creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">His right to be subrogated to the mortgagee is conceded \u25a0by plaintiffs, to the extent of the amount due thereon. As '\u25a0to this there is no controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The act for the protection of purchasers at judicial sales \u25a0(2 S. &amp; C. 1149), provides, that in case of any sale of property on execution, the title of the purchaser shall be invalid by reason of a defect in the proceedings, the purchaser may, in equity, be subrogated to the right of the \u2022creditor, against the debtor, to the extent that the money \u2022paid and applied to the debtor\u2019s benefit, and to the same extent shall have a lien on the property sold, as against all persons except <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, without notice. By .section 2 of that act, this right extends to all sales by order -of court, sales by executors, administrators, and guardians, and to sales for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Speaking for myself, I think this provision includes the \u2022case before us, and that Leibrock is entitled- to be subrogated to Biehler to the amount that the purchase money went to pay a debt owing to him by Endel, but as it is perhaps premature to decide this question, it has not been passed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
