Jones, beiug seized of certain non-ancestral* real estate, by the first item of his will devised the same* to his wife, Rachel, for life, together with the stock, household goods, furniture, provisions, and other goods and chattels which might be thereon at the time of his decease;, but on condition : <em>First. </em>That she would reside on the property and keep it in repair; and, <em>Second. </em>That she would remain his widow; otherwise, she was to receive but her dower in said property. The next item in the will was as-follows: \u201c I do hereby bequeath to my said wife all my personal property, amounting to two thousand dollars ($2,000), the principal of which is to be kept in the hands of my executor of my personal property, the interest to go-for her support; but if, at any time, she desires her dower-set off, then the balance is to be shared equally among my heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">The testator had no children or lineal descendants at the time of making his will, but had several brothers and sisters living, and his wife was in a state of pregnancy. The \u25a0will was made October 14, 1871; testator died November 10, 1871; and, on the twenty-fifth of the same month, the will was duly probated. On the fifteenth day of December, in the same year, the testator\u2019s widow was delivered of a still-born child. She has never elected to take under the will of her late husband, and declines to do so. She demands of the administrator with the will annexed, of her husband\u2019s estate, the proceeds of all the personal properry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>thereof subject to distribution ; while the brothers and sisters of the testator claim that she is only entitled to a widow\u2019s distributive share of one-third, and that they are entitled to the residue, as donees under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-4\">Iu order to obtain a construction of the will which \u25a0 should determine the conflicting claims, the administrator filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Gallia \u25a0 county, making the widow, and the brothers and sisters of the testator, parties. The questions made were in regard to the effect of the second item of the will, which relates only to the personal property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">The case coming into the district court by appeal, the foregoing facts, in so far as they are not shown by the pleadings, were found by the court from the evidence. And from\u2019these facts, that court held and adjudged that, -\u201cRachel Jones, as wife and relict of the testator, is the \u25a0person, who, by the terms of said will, is .entitled to take, receive and have, the personal property bequeathed and given under the second item or clause of said last will and testament of said David E. Jones ; \u201d and directed the administrator to pay over to her the balance or residue referred to in said second item or clause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">The brothers and sisters of testator are here seeking, by petition in error, to reverse the judgment or decree, on the ground that, upon the facts found and shown by the record, the judgment of the court should have been in their favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-9\"><em>Simeon Nash, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak3E\">David E. Jones made his will October 14, 1871, which is set out in the petition. He died about November 10, 1871, leaving Rachel Jones, his widow, enciente of a child, which was afterward born dead and not alive. The will was probated, but the widow refused or did not elect to take under said will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-12\">These facts are found stated in the petition and finding -of the court. The court decides that the widow took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u00abestate <em>under the </em>will, though she had not elected according -to law to take under the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">Under this state of facts, we claim that the widow was entitled only to such share as she would have been entitled to in case David E. Jones had died leaving children ; and that his brother and sister were entitled to the share of the \u2022estate which the children would have taken, if he had died intestate leaving children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">The court decides she took the whole estate under the will, though she had not elected to take under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">The statute in force at the date of 1871, when Jones \u25a0died, is found in 2 S. &amp; C. 1623, \u00a7 44. It is as follows: \u201cIf the widow fail to make such election, she shall retain her dower and such share of the personal estate of her husband as she would be entitled to by law in case her husband had died intestate, leaving children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">The first error committed by the court was in ruling that the widow took this estate, although she had not made an \u2022election to take under the will; having failed to make her \u2022election to take under the will, she was entitled to only what she would have been entitled if her husband had died intestate, leaving children \u2014 one-half of first $400, and one-third of the balance. And, so far as the real estate is con\u2022cerned, she was only entitled to her dower and no more, and he having died leaving no living child, the balance of the estate went by descent to his brothers and sisters, the persons making this application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">The prior statute did not contain the words \u201cleaving \u25a0children,\u201d and hence widows declined to take under a will, and claimed the whole estate under statute of descents. And this amendment was, added to prevent such an outrage, which was substantially denying to a man without children to make a will. No one supposed after that that any such decision as\u00eds here made could be made again, and no one ever dreamed of giving the widow what the will gave her, where she failed to elect to take under it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Samuel A. Nash, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-4\">Without a will, this estate, real and personal, no child having been bora alive, would have gone to the widow as the heir at law of her deceased husband. The \u201c husband or wife, relict of such intestate,\u201d take the estate by force \u2022of the statute of descent, the same as the children, the-brothers and sisters, father or mother, etc. S. &amp; S. 305, 307. Heirship in Ohio is settled by positive statute. The-person upon whom the statute casts the estate is the heir at law.

St. 9, 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>There is absolutely no word in this will from which an implication can be raised that any person, other than his heir, as fixed by law, was intended by the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">The question, then, is not so much that the testator did not mean his wife, as who did he intend ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">The testator bxecuted his will, and died, knowing that a child was to be born to him, and if born alive, would be his heir. It can not be supposed that he intended to disinherit his child and heir. But if he intended these plaintiff's in error, his brothers and sisters, then he did intend to disinherit his child. No person or persons are mentioned, or remotely alluded to, in the will but his wife. The child, born alive, 'would have taken under the will (sec. 41, 2 S. &amp; C. 1623); being born dead, the widow must take as next in succession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">It is objected that the widow can not take under the will, because she did not elect so to do, as provided by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">Such election was not necessary. A widow refusing or neglecting to take under her husband\u2019s will is entitled to the same proportion of his personal estate as if he had died intestate, which, if he leave no children, is the whole. 2 lb. 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">Mrs. Jones is not claiming as widow, but as heir. There is no provision that the heir must elect, and the failure of the widow to elect does not affect her rights as heir. The statute applies solely to the widow. <em>Carder </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>16 Ohio St. 366.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b585-10\">Scott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3W\">In construing the will before us, it is our duty to give effect to the intention of the testator when clearly ascertained from its language, if such intention be consistent with law and public policy. Looking to the general scheme of disposition disclosed by the will, we think it apparent that the purpose and intention of the testator was to make what he judged to be a suitable provision for the support of his wife during her life; but subject to eer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tain conditions, to which, if she should decline to accede, and should prefer to claim her statutory rights of dower, etc., then she should be remitted to those statutory rights alone, and should take nothing by his will. In carrying out this purpose, by the first item of his will he devises all the real estate therein mentioned to her for life, but if she declines this gift clogged with the conditions annexed thereto, then he says \u201c she is to receive but her dower in said property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Coming then to the second item of the will, which is the one here in controversy, we find that it relates to all his personal property, other than the household furniture, goods, etc., embraced in the first item, and that it consisted probably of money, notes, bonds, etc., of fixed and readily ascertainable values, for he says it amounts to two thousand dollars. He directs the principal of this sum to be kept in the hands of his executors, the interest arising from it to be applied to his wife\u2019s support; and then adds that \u201cif at any time she desires her dower set off\u201d (that is, if she asserts her statutory right to dower, including the distributive share of this two thousand dollars, awarded to her by the statute), \u201cthen the balance is to be shared equally among my heirs.\u201d <em>We </em>think the language leaves no room for doubt that the testator did not regard his wife as his heir, and that he intended aud willed that if his wife chose to assert her right under the statute to the widow\u2019s share of this two thousand dollars, then, after giving her such share, \u201cthe balance\u201d (or residue thereof) should be distributed equally among <em>other </em>persons, whom he designates as his heirs. The word \u201c <em>heirs </em>\u201d is a flexible one, and when used in a will, should be so construed as to give effect to the manifest intention of the testator. It has often been properly held to mean \u201c next of kin,\u201d and should be so understood whenever the context so requires. 2 Redfield on Wills, 67. The sense in which the term \u201c heirs \u201d is used in a will is always open to inquiry. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>3 Rich. Eq. Cases, 156; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Godbold, </em>6 Ib. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In ascertaining the intention of the testator, no account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>can be taken of circumstances which clo not appear to have been known to him when the will was made. Hence, the fact that his wife was pregnant when t'he will was executed, can not affect its construction, unless it appear that this was known to him, or was at least suspected by him at the time. In this case, the fact of such knowledge or suspicion is not alleged in any of the pleadings \u2014 not even in the answer of the widow \u2014 and is not found by the court below. And the language of the will very strongly negatives the idea of such knowledge or suspicion on his part. The will not only contains no reference to the possible pregnancy' of the wife, which would be singular if the fact were known to, or suspected by, him; but the bequest is, that \u201c the balance is to be shared equally among my heirs.\u201d This language indicates clearly that the testator supposed he would have not less than two, or if force be given to the word \u201c among,\u201d then not less than three heirs. Are we to presume from this language, that, without any reference to the subject in the will, the testator not only supposed his wife to be pregnant, but that she would bring forth twins, or triplets ? The mere fact that the widow was, two months thereafter, delivered of a dead child, however premature such delivery may have been will not justify the inference that the testator was aware of the pregnancy when the will was made; especially, when the language of the will indicates the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">But suppose the testator was aware of his wife\u2019s pregnancy, when the will was made; yet, if it clearly appear that he did not regard her as an heir, then, in a bequest to his heirs, she can not be regarded as a legatee. And in ascertaining who are designated by the term \u201c heirs,\u201d she must be excluded from the number.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u25a0 The testator left four brothers and two sisters surviving at his death, and even if he knew his wife to be pregnant, he could not know that, she would be delivered of a living child. He bequeathed a certain sum \u201c to be shared equally among his heirs.\u201d Now, if it appear, as we think it does, that his wife was not to be regarded as an heir of his per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>sonalty, it makes no difference whether we consider the words <em>\u201c </em>my heirs,\u201d by which the legatees are described, as meaning \u201c my next of kin,\u201d or \u201c my heirs (according to the statute of distribution), exclusive of my wife.\u201d The bequest is in either case, under the facts of this case, to the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters. Eor the posthumous child not having been born alive, they were his next of kin, and were also his heirs, under the statute of descent and distribution, if his wife is not to be regarded as his heir. We can have no doubt, from the language of the will when applied to the facts shown by the record, that by his \u201c heirs \u201d the testator meant his \u201cnext of kin,\u201d whether children or brothers and sisters. Rachel Jones, the widow, having elected not to take under the will of her husband, must be remitted to her statutory rights as a widow. The statute in force at the time of her husband\u2019s death gives her dower, and such share of the personal estate of her husband as she would be entitled to by law in case her husband died intestate, leaving children. S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1624, \u00a7 44. A prior statute provides that if an intestate shall have left a child, the widow shall be entitled, upon distribution, to one-half of any sum not exceeding four dollars, and to one-third of the residue of the personal estate subject to distribution. S. &amp; C. 601, \u00a7 175.'</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The judgment of the district court must be reversed, and proceeding to render such judgment as that court should have rendered, we direct and adjudge that of the moneys coming into the hands of the administrator, under the second item of testator\u2019s will, and remaining after payment of debts, and costs of administration, distribution to be made as follows, to wit: <em>First. </em>The costs of this suit, including the costs of this proceeding in error, shall be fully paid. <em>Second. </em>That of the remainder of said fund, one-half of the first four hundred dollars, together with one-third of the residue, shall be paid to the said widow, Rachel Jones, and that the residue of said fund be equally distributed among the brothers and sisters of said testator, share and share alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In regard to the property devised by the first item of the will, which, as we understand it, is not here drawn in question, and was not passed upon by the court below, we express no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b589-5\">Johnson, C.
