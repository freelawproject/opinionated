On the trial they excepted to the rejection of certain evidence offered by them, which is now assigned for error. But they took a second trial, as allowed by the statute, on which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>gave evidence tending to prove all the matters set up as a special defense, and asked the court to charge, that if they found such matters to be true, \u201c then the said defendants, as officers and servants of said society, had a right to remove her goods outside of said fair grounds, and that, in such case,\u2019 the burden of proof was on the plaintiff, to show that the injury to, or loss of, the goods was caused by the negligent, careless, or other wrongful act of defendants, and was not the necessary result of such removal; which charge, as to the burden of proof, the court refused to give, but did charge that the burden of proof was on the said defendants, to show not only that said contract was made and violated by said plaintiff, but also to show that they removed the said goods in a careful manner, and that no unnecessary damage resulted to said property by such removal.\u201d To which refusal to charge, and to the charge as given, the defendants excepted; and, after judgment against them, filed their petition in error in the district court, where the judgment was affirmed. To reverse these judgments, this petition in error was prosecuted in the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-4\">J. and <em>J. </em>Bradbury, for plaintiff in error, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amm\"><em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>37 Barb. 15; Story on Bail. 344; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>4 Ohio St. 148; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Barrow, 2 </em>Ohio St. 247; Sher. &amp; Red. on Neg. \u00a7 12; 2 Par. on Cont. 125 ; <em>McCully </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>40 Penn. 399; 1 Hill on Torts, 121; <em>Tourlettot </em>v. <em>Rosebrook, </em>11 Met. 462; Am.

To determine this question, we must look to the issues made by the pleadings. The petition is founded \u2022solely on the wrongful taking of the goods. The answer .admits the taking of the goods, but justifies the taking \u2022under a contract, and avers that no unnecessary damage was done in such taking. The reply merely denies the making and breach of the contract. So far, then, the bur\u2022den of proof was cast upon the defendants. To that extent the court was right in its charge. But as to the further fact, that unnecessary damage was done to the goods in their removal, if it be conceded that this fact was \u25a0essential to the defense, it was averred in the answer, and not denied in the reply; it must, then, under the provisions of the code, be taken as true; and, therefore, no proof of the fact w\u00e1s required. The charge, therefore, that the burden of proving the fact rested on the defend.auts, was misleading; for, under the charge, though the fact was admitted by the pleadings, the jury was left to \u25a0find against the defendants, for want of evidence, where no proof was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">But, furthermore, under the contract, as it was claimed \u25a0to exist, if the plaintiff sold whisky she forfeited all her privileges, and it then became a lawful right of the society to remove her property from the fair grounds. This right, it must be presumed, the officers exercised in a lawful manner, as there can be no propriety in assuming that they would do a lawful thing in an unlawful manner. If, then, it was claimed, by the plaintiff, that the facts were otherwise, that there was carelessness or negligence on their part, it was for her, who made that claim, to establish it by evidence; the burden, thus, was upon her to show that the injury -was occasioned by defendants\u2019 negligence, and the charge asked by defendants should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Instead of this, however, the court said that it was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the defendants to 'show, not only that the contract was made and violated by the plaintiff, but also to show that they removed the goods in a careful manner, and that no unnecessary damage was done to the property by such removal. This was misleading, in that it seems to intimate that defendants must not only take care of the goods while moving them, but must also look out for them after the5r were removed. This was no part of their legal obligation. All they had to do was to remove the goods. If the owner saw fit to abandon them, and seek to make the society responsible, it was a risk she voluntarily assumed; their responsibility ceased when the goods were put off the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
