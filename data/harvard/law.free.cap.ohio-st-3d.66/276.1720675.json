Both claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Claimant\u2019s first assertion is grounded in the omission of \u201cdysthymic disorder\u201d from the enumerated conditions in the permanent total disability order. Relying on <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 339, 533 N.E.2d 720, claimant contends that the omission constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson, however, </em>is distinguishable. There, as here, the commission\u2019s order did not list an allowed psychiatric condition among the allowed conditions. However, in <em>Johnson, </em>the evidence upon which the commission relied to deny permanent total disability related solely to the claimant\u2019s physical condition. These two factors led us to question whether the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sion indeed considered all allowed conditions. The order was accordingly returned for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In this case, permanent .total disability denial was premised \u201cparticularly\u201d on the reports of Dr. Steiman and Dr. Pritscher, who evaluated claimant\u2019s physical and <em>psychiatric </em>conditions respectively. Thus, the commission clearly took claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition into account in denying permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Claimant also argues that the commission erred in not reviewing Dr. Durgin\u2019s report. This assertion is also based on omission \u2014 the order\u2019s lack of reference to Durgin\u2019s narrative among the evidence considered. Claimant, however, has forfeited his right to pursue this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">A party who fails to raise an argument in the court below waives his or her right to raise it here. <em>State ex rel. Gibson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 319, 530 N.E.2d 916. Before the appellate court, claimant argued that there was no evidence supporting the commission\u2019s decision. He did not argue in his brief that the commission did not consider Durgin\u2019s report or allege a resultant abuse of discretion. As review shows, the commission\u2019s second denial order also omitted reference to Durgin\u2019s report, despite the report\u2019s submission at that very hearing. As we stated in <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 200, 569 N.E.2d 496, 497:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\"><em>\u201cRes judicata </em>operates \u2018to preclude the relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u2019 * * * It applies \u2018not only to defenses which were considered and determined <em>but also to those defenses which could properly have been considered and determined.\u2019 </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
