Porterfield </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 260, 56 O.O.2d 156, 272 N.E.2d 124. For the following reasons, we find that the assessment in this case was based upon a valid test check.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">R.C. 5739.02 imposes a tax on each retail sale made in this state except, as provided in R.C. 5739.02(B)(2), for \u201c[s]ales of food for human consumption off the premises where sold.\u201d All vendors are required by R.C. 5739.11 to \u201ckeep complete and accurate records of sales, together with a record of the tax collected on the sales.\u201d However, \u201cno vendor shall be required to maintain records of * * * sales of food for human consumption off the premises where sold[.] * * * [Wjhere a vendor does not have adequate records of receipts from * * * sales of food for human consumption on the premises where sold, the tax commissioner may * * * determine the proportion that taxable retail sales bear to all [the vendor\u2019s] retail sales\u201d by conducting \u201ctest checks of the vendor\u2019s business for a representative period.\u201d R.C. 5739.10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In <em>King Drug Co. of Dayton v. Bowers </em>(1961), 171 Ohio St. 461, 463, 14 O.O.2d 318, 320, 172 N.E.2d 3, 4, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\u201cWhether a test check covers \u2018a representative period\u2019 is a factual question to be determined by the board * * See, also, <em>McDonald\u2019s of Springfield, Ohio, Inc. v. Kosydar </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 5, 72 O.O.2d 3, 330 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Narmac bears the burden of proving error on the part of the commissioner. <em>Cherry Street Corp., supra. </em>While arguing that the days chosen for the test check were not \u201crepresentative,\u201d Narmac has not presented any evidence that sales on the test check days were unusual or differed in any way from sales under normal business conditions. Thus, this argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">Narmac\u2019s second contention is that the commissioner erred in basing the assessment, not on the test check results, but on Narmac\u2019s own sales records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>for the two test days. Narmac asserts that R.C. 5739.10 \u201cmandates that the tax commissioner use only the results of the test checks to determine \u2018the proportion that taxable retail sales bear to all [the vendor\u2019s] sales.\u2019 \u201d However, R.C. 5739.10(B) expressly permits the commissioner to rely on \u201cother information relating to the sales made by such vendor\u201d in making that determination. Narmac has not demonstrated that the commissioner\u2019s reliance on Narmac\u2019s own records was improper or that the BTA\u2019s affirmance of the assessment was unreasonable or unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The decision of the BTA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b763-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
