The first is whether the common pleas court had jurisdiction to consider the Society\u2019s declaratory judgment action. The second is whether the common pleas court and the court of appeals used the proper standard of review in considering the Society\u2019s R.C. 119.12 appeal from SERB\u2019S decision. The third is whether the Society is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d under R.C. 4117.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">AFSCME argues that pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 572 N.E.2d 87, <em>inter alia, </em>the common pleas court did not have jurisdiction to hear the Society\u2019s declaratory judgment action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">The court of appeals held that the issue of whether the Society is a public employer is \u201cproperly determinable by declaratory judgment.\u201d In doing so it cited our opinion in <em>Ohio Historical Soc. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 45, 549 N.E.2d 157 <em>(\"Historical Soc. </em>I\u201d). This reliance was improper, however, because we expressly declined to consider the issue, since it was not before this court on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 549 N.E.2d at 160. The issue was squarely before the court, however, in <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn., supra, </em>which was decided the following year. It is this precedent which we must follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn., </em>this court considered whether the common pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain a complaint requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>preliminary and permanent injunctions and a declaratory judgment. We decided that because the matters alleged in the complaint are governed exclusively by the Ohio Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act, R.C. Chapter 4117, the trial court could not exercise jurisdiction. \u201cThe State Employment Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters committed to it pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Writing for the court, Chief Justice Moyer explained that \u201cR.C. Chapter 4117 has created a series of new rights and set forth the remedies and procedures to be applied regarding those rights. * * * [T]hose remedies and procedures are exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 572 N.E.2d at 90. The \u201cprocedures created in R.C. Chapter 4117 do not provide for the filing of a private action in the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a complainant in a labor relations case asserts rights that are completely independent of R.C. Chapter 4117, the common pleas court may exercise jurisdiction. However, \u201c[i]f a party asserts claims that arise from or depend on the collective bargaining rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117, the remedies provided in that chapter are exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 572 N.E.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The only substantive allegation in the Society\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment was that it is not a public employer. Resolution of this allegation depends entirely on the provisions of R.C. Chapter 4117, over which SERB has exclusive original jurisdiction. Determination of its jurisdiction over a petition for a representation election is to be decided, in the first instance, by SERB. <em>Id. </em>at 169-170, 572 N.E.2d at 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">R.C. Chapter 4117 \u201cwas meant to regulate in a comprehensive manner the labor relations between public employees and employers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 572 N.E.2d at 91. The Declaratory Judgments Act, R.C. Chapter 2721, was not intended to be used to circumvent such comprehensive agency processes. SERB has exclusive jurisdiction to consider issues concerning petitions for representation elections. Common pleas courts are limited to appellate jurisdiction, at the proper time, over these and other matters arising under R.C. Chapter 4117. As to this issue the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">AFSCME also argues that the courts below did not use the proper standard of review in reaching their decisions. The lower courts were considering both the R.C. 119.12 administrative appeal and the declaratory judgment action filed by the Society. In light of our disposition of the Society\u2019s declaratory judgment action, the issue presented to us is whether the courts below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>exercised the proper standard of review over the Society\u2019s administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Generally, appeals to the common pleas courts from agency adjudications are governed by Ohio\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, which is codified in R.C. Chapter 119. \u201c[Ejxcept where specific appeal procedures are provided, such as R.C. 4117.13(D) (unfair labor practices)[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and R.C. 4117.23 (penalty for unlawful strike), or where appeals to a court are prohibited, such as R.C. 4117.06(A) (determination of unit appropriate for collective bargaining purposes), the general provisions of R.C. 119.12 govern the appealability of an adjudication order issued by SERB.\u201d <em>Historical Soc. I, supra, </em>48 Ohio St.3d at 46, 549 N.E.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">R.C. 119.12 provides in part: \u201cThe court [of common pleas] may affirm the order of the agency complained of in the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d This standard requires two inquiries: a hybrid factual/legal inquiry and a purely legal inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265, and <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390, this court described the hybrid factual/legal inquiry required by R.C. 119.12. \u201cIt is obvious that, if the General Assembly had intended the appeal provision to afford a trial <em>de novo, </em>the court would be required to hear all material, relevant and probative evidence which either party might desire to present. On the other hand, the language in [then recently amended R.C. 119.12] extends the authority of the Common Pleas Court, upon appeal, beyond that court\u2019s former authority which did not permit it to substitute its judgment for that of the agency and which confined it to determining the rights of the parties in accordance with the statutes and law applicable.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>at 279-280, 58 O.O. at 53, 131 N.E.2d at 393. In undertaking its review, the common pleas court must give deference to the agency\u2019s resolution of evidentiary conflicts, but \u201cthe findings of the agency are by no means conclusive.\u201d <em>Conrad, supra, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 111, 17 O.O.3d at 67, 407 N.E.2d at 1268. \u201cWhere the court, in its appraisal of the evidence, determines that there exist legally significant reasons for discrediting certain evidence relied upon by the administrative body, and necessary to its determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>nation, the court may reverse, vacate, or modify the administrative order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 17 O.O.3d at 67, 407 N.E.2d at 1268. We take this precedent to mean that an agency\u2019s findings of fact are presumed to be correct and must be deferred to by a reviewing court unless that court determines that the agency\u2019s findings are internally inconsistent, impeached by evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, rest upon improper inferences, or are otherwise unsupportable. See <em>id. </em>at 111-112, 17 O.O.3d at 67, 407 N.E.2d at 1268. The agency\u2019s order survives the first prong of the common pleas court\u2019s review if the court finds that the evidence the agency relied on is indeed \u201creliable, probative, and substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"><em>Andrews </em>recognized that even before R.C. 119.12 was amended to require reviewing courts to make the hybrid inquiry described above, courts were to determine \u201cthe rights of the parties in accordance with the statutes and law applicable.\u201d <em>Andrews, supra, </em>164 Ohio St. at 280, 58 O.O. at 53, 131 N.E.2d at 393. Under R.C. 119.12, a reviewing court is obligated to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d An agency adjudication is like a trial, and while the reviewing court must defer to the lower tribunal\u2019s findings of fact, it must construe the law on its own. To the extent that an agency\u2019s decision is based on construction of the state or federal Constitution, a statute, or case law, the common pleas court must undertake its R.C. 119.12 reviewing task completely independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">AFSCME argues that the common pleas courts must affirm SERB orders as long as they are supported by \u201creliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d This is an incomplete statement of the proper standard of review. The Society correctly points out that the courts must also exercise independent judgment as to matters of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In this case none of the parties has argued that the SERB hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by \u201creliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d Thus, the inquiry for the reviewing courts is whether, accepting the facts found by the hearing officer as true, the Society is a public employer, as a matter of law, under R.C. 4117.01(B). We find that the courts below properly limited their review to this purely legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">The origins and development of the Society were detailed in a 1974 report prepared by the Society for Governor Gilligan and the General Assembly. Ten Year Plan of the Ohio Historical Society (June 1974) 5-7. The report\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>discussion of the organization\u2019s history highlights the tension between the Society\u2019s public and private roles:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cOhio\u2019s prehistoric Indian sites were being looted of their primitive art treasures. State archives were being removed from the State House. The personal papers of Ohio leaders were being destroyed or dispersed. No state organization existed to halt the loss of Ohio\u2019s patrimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In 1884, Governor Hoadly and the Secretary of State began looking for supporters to form a historical society. On March 12, 1885, one hundred and fifty citizens met in the Ohio Senate chamber and organized the Society. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\u201cThe interest of a combination of public officials and private persons in the creation of a state historical agency cast the newly formed group into a quasi-public, quasi-private framework. Governor Hoadly and the other founders envisioned the Society as becoming a large and effectively administered museum and library institution. They expected the organization to assume a leadership role in the cultural life of the state. To achieve these ambitious objectives, the founders anticipated state support of historical activities, a desire promptly translated into reality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The informal arrangement between the private, non-profit Society and the state of Ohio lasted until 1963 when that relationship was questioned in the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 7. A declaratory judgment action was brought in Franklin County Common Pleas Court to determine \u201cwhether or not the Society\u2019s policies and procedures, particularly in regard to the handling of funds of a private source, should be administered strictly in accordance with the regulations governing state government operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that the Society was a private, non-profit corporation and was, therefore, required to operate under laws governing corporations rather than under the procedures and regulations that apply to state agencies. The court also held, however, that a new basis for state support of the Society\u2019s public functions had to be enacted. The General Assembly responded to the court\u2019s decision by amending R.C. 149.30 to create a situation in which a formal contractual relationship could exist between the state and the Society. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">In considering the petition for representation election filed by AFSCME in this case, the SERB hearing officer made findings of fact that were adopted by SERB (with modifications not relevant here) in its decision. These undisputed findings paint a picture of the Society as it is today. Among them are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">(1) The Society is governed by a constitution which was written and adopted by its members. The constitution vests the government of the Society in a board of trustees (\u201cboard\u201d). The board includes eighteen members, nine of whom are elected from the membership and nine of whom are appointed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the Governor. The officers of the corporation are elected annually by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">(2) The board is responsible for formulating and approving the policies of the society, including personnel and labor relations policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">(3) The Society by-laws provide that the board delegates administrative duties for the operation of the Society to a director, who acts as the chief administrative officer. The board establishes the terms of the director\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">(4) The wages, terms, and conditions of employment of all employees are set by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">(5) The Society is, in part, self-supporting. It generates revenue from, among other things, admission fees to museums and other historic sites, the sale of meals, and the sale of goods and other services.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">(6) The Society enters into contractual relationships with different public and private entities for the .provision of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">(7) The Society contracts with the state of Ohio to perform certain public functions designated in R.C. 149.30 for which the Society receives public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">(8) Approximately sixty-five to seventy percent of the Society\u2019s total operating budget is composed of state appropriations. This money funds services contracted for between the Society and the state. The remaining thirty to thirty-five percent of the Society\u2019s operating budget represents private money from retail sales, admission fees, membership dues, private donations,- contract fees and other similar activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">(9) Society wage rates and salary increases are comparable to those of the state. No specific legislative or state approval is necessary for granting a Society wage increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">(10) Society employees participate in the Public Employees Retirement System.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">(11) Society employees are not covered by Ohio civil service laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">(12) The Society is not required to consult or obtain approval from the state as to any matter relating to employment policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">(13) The Auditor of State is required to annually examine the Society\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-17\">(14) Former state employees hired by the Society receive credit for state work time.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">(15) The Society has a regular mail pick-up at the Ohio Statehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(16) Approximately ninety-five percent of the Society\u2019s 1985 funds for capital improvements came from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">(17) The Society does not use the same rule-making procedures as state agencies do.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">(18) The Society has a state agency number for identification purposes in the state budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Based upon these and other findings of fact, the SERB hearing officer concluded that the Society is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d under R.C. 4117.01(B). SERB came to the same conclusion, and recognized that \u201ca respectable argument could be mounted that the Society is a public employer based on the similarities between the functions of the society and those of state government.\u201d SERB, however, rested its decision on the ground that because Society employees are \u201cpublic employees\u201d under R.C. 4117.01(C), the Society is necessarily a public employer under R.C. 4117.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The substantive issue presented by this case is whether the Society is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d under R.C. 4117.01(B). If the Society is a public employer, SERB may exercise jurisdiction over it for labor relations purposes. See <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 221, 560 N.E.2d 179. Both R.C. 4117.01(B) and 4117.01(C) are relevant to the parties\u2019 arguments and our disposition. R.C. 4117.01(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">\u201c \u2018Public employer\u2019 means <em>the state </em>or <em>any political subdivision of the state </em>located entirely within the state including, without limitation, any municipal corporation with a population of at least five thousand according to the most recent federal decennial census, county, township with a population of at least five thousand in the unincorporated area of the township according to the most recent federal decennial census, school district, state institution of higher learning, any public or special district, any state agency, authority, commission, or board, or <em>other branch of public employment.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">R.C. 4117.01(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">\u201c \u2018Public employee\u2019 means any person holding a position by appointment or employment in the service of a public employer, including any person working pursuant to a contract between a public employer and a private employer and over whom the national labor relations board has declined jurisdiction on the basis that the involved employees are employees of a public employer[.]\u201d It then lists fifteen specific groups of employees that are not included in the definition of \u201cpublic employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Under R.C. 4117.01(B) an entity is a public employer if it is one of three things: (1) the state, (2) a political subdivision of the state, or (3) an \u201cother branch of public employment.\u201d We come to this conclusion by way of the plain language of the statute. \u201c[T]he state\u201d and \u201cany political subdivision of the state\u201d are defined to include ten specific government entities (any \u201cmunicipal corporation with a population of at least five thousand * * *, county, township with a population of at least five thousand * * *, school district, state institution of higher learning, any public or special district, any state agency, authority, commission, <em>or </em>board\u201d). The words \u201cwithout limitation,\u201d however, indicate that entities considered \u201cthe state\u201d or a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d are not limited to those listed. After the final example of a state or political subdivision is listed (a board), the definition of public employer somewhat vaguely reaches \u201cother branch[es] of public employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">SERB argues that the Society is a public employer because it fits under all three categories set forth in R.C. 4117.01(B). It asserts that the Society is \u201cthe state\u201d because the state of Ohio has turned over significant state functions to the Society and substantially funds its operations. SERB\u2019S position is that the Society has become, at least, a <em>de facto </em>state agency. SERB also argues that the Society is a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the state\u201d because it was \u201ccreated for a public purpose, [and] authorized to exercise a limited portion of the sovereign power of the state.\u201d Finally, SERB asserts that the Society is a \u201cbranch of public employment\u201d for two reasons: the Society has the \u201cattributes\u201d of a public employer and its employees are public employees under R.C. 4117.01(C). SERB states that \u201c[t]he General Assembly could not have intended the ludicrous result urged by [the Society] that \u2018public employees\u2019 do not work for \u2018public employers\u2019 and do not have the right to collectively bargain specifically granted them in R.C. 4117.03.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">AFSCME focuses its argument on SERB\u2019S last point: that the definitions of \u201cpublic employer\u201d and \u201cpublic employee\u201d must be read together and in light of the policies of the labor law. AFSCME asserts that \u201c[a] private not for profit corporation can be a public employer and its employees public employees as those terms are defined in R.C. [Chapter] 4117 as R.C. 4117.01(B) and R.C. 4117.01(C) must be read <em>in pari materia.\" </em>It argues that Society employees are public employees under R.C. 4117.01(C) and that, therefore, the Society is a \u201cbranch of public employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The Society argues that the General Assembly could have extended its definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d to private entities such as the Society but chose not to do so. Instead, the Society argues, the legislature \u201cintended to limit the application of the Act to truly <em>public </em>entities.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>reasons that an entity can be \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d but not both \u2014 the terms are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The Society places heavy reliance on our decision in <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., supra (\u201cCMHA </em>\u201d). One issue in that case was whether CMHA is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d and is subject to SERB\u2019S jurisdiction under R.C. Chapter 4117. This court cited R.C. 4117.01(B) and concluded that \u201cthe General Assembly clearly intended to include within such definition any state-created public body such as CMHA.\u201d <em>Id., </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 224, 560 N.E.2d at 182. We reasoned that because a metropolitan housing authority is defined as \u201ca body corporate and politic\u201d under R.C. 3735.31 and \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d has been defined to include bodies \u201ccorporate and politic,\u201d CMHA is a public employer under R.C. Chapter 4117. The Society argues that our decision in <em>CMHA </em>holds that only \u201cstate-created public bod[ies]\u201d can be \u201cpublic employers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The court of appeals agreed with the Society. The court held that \u201cR.C. Chapter 4117 is strictly limited in its application to the regulation of employment relations between public employers and public employees. It has no application to the private sector.\u201d The court reasoned that while R.C. 149.30 gives the Society many attributes of a public entity, \u201cnothing contained in that statute has altered the basic legal status of [the Society] as a private, non-private [sic ] corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">SERB\u2019S position that the Society is a state or a political subdivision is not persuasive. The issue is not, as SERB would have it, whether the Society possesses a larger or smaller number of the attributes of a government entity. The issue is straightforward: whether the Society is in fact a government entity. Quite simply, the Society is not public; it was neither created by the state nor is it subject to state control.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The Society is a private, not-for-profit corporation. It was created by a group of individuals, in their capacities as private citizens, \u201c[t]o promote a knowledge of archaeology and history, especially in Ohio * * Section 1, Article II, Constitution of the Ohio Historical Society. The SERB hearing officer found that the Society is governed by a constitution written and adopted by its members; the constitution may be amended by a simple majority of votes cast by Society members. A board of trustees (\u201cboard\u201d) runs the Society. The corporate constitution, not a state statute, provides that half of the trustees are elected from the Society\u2019s membership and half are appointed by the Governor of Ohio. The board elects corporate officers to operate the Society and these officers report directly to the board. The Society is, in short, not a public or government entity. It was neither created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>by the state nor is it subject to state control. In both form and substance the Society is a private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Neither the Society leaders nor its members are subject to the political process. The members of its board, whether appointed by the Governor or elected by the membership, are responsible to the membership of the Society alone. Its corporate officers are responsible to the board alone. Neither directly nor indirectly do the citizens of the state of Ohio exercise control over the Society. Simply because a large portion of the Society\u2019s budget is derived from public funds does not render it a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The fact that the Society has a close relationship with the state does not make it an arm of the state. The Society\u2019s relationship with the state is based on contract. The Society contracts with the state to perform certain public functions designated in R.C. 149.30 for which the Society receives public funds. It is authorized by its constitution to enter into contracts with the state. The state is authorized to contract with the Society by R.C. 149.30. Nowhere, however, is the Society <em>required </em>by statute to perform state functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Moreover, the Society is not one of the ten entities specifically deemed to be \u201cthe state or any political subdivision of the state\u201d by R.C. 4117.01(B). The Society is not a municipal corporation, a county, a township, a school district, an institution of higher learning, a public or special district, a state agency, authority, commission, or board.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The General Assembly could have expressly included entities like the Society in its definition of \u201cpublic employer.\u201d In 1970, fourteen years before the General Assembly adopted the current definition of \u201cpublic employer,\u201d the Pennsylvania legislature adopted a definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d that almost certainly would include the Society. In the Pennsylvania Public Employee Relations Act, 43 P.S. Section 1101.101 <em>et seq., </em>the definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d expressly includes \u201cany nonprofit organization or institution * * * receiving grants or appropriations from local, State or Federal governments * * 43 P.S. Section 1101.301(1). Our General Assembly apparently chose not to follow Pennsylvania\u2019s example.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">The Society is also not a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d under state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. Chapter 4117 does not specifically define \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d and there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>no general statutory definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d In the absence of specific definitions, however, case law and Attorney General opinions provide a general definition: \u201cA political subdivision is a limited geographical area of the State, within which a public agency is authorized to exercise some governmental function.\u201d 1972 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 72-035 (citing other authorities). Because the Society does not exercise governmental authority in a limited geographical area, it is not a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The question of whether the Society is an \u201cother branch of public employment\u201d is more difficult to resolve. AFSCME\u2019s position is, essentially, that the General Assembly intended to give all public employees, except those specifically excluded from coverage, the right to collectively bargain under state law and that the Society\u2019s employees are \u201cpublic employees\u201d under R.C. 4117.-01(C). The Society\u2019s position is that only employees of truly public entities have the right to collectively bargain under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">AFSCME argues that employees of the Society are public employees pursuant to R.C. 4117.01(C). A \u201cpublic employee\u201d is a person in the service of a public employer, <em>including </em>\u201cany person\u201d (1) \u201cworking pursuant to a contract between a public employer and a private employer\u201d and (2) \u201cover whom the national labor relations board has declined jurisdiction on the basis that the involved employees are employees of a public employer.\u201d R.C. 4117.01(C). We agree that the Society\u2019s employees fit the second prong of this test: the NLRB declined to take jurisdiction over the employees because, under federal law, they are considered employees of a political subdivision. In so holding, the NLRB cited the National Labor Relations Act, Section 2(2) (Section 152[2], Title 29, U.S.Code), and <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. Natural Gas Util. Dist. of Hawkins Cty. </em>(1971), 402 U.S. 600, 91 S.Ct. 1746, 29 L.Ed.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">We do not believe, however, that Society employees are \u201cworking pursuant to a contract between a public employer and a private employer.\u201d The record does not show that certain Society employees are hired to perform discrete tasks, all of which are \u201cin the service of\u201d the state of Ohio. Society employees are employed to do the work of the <em>Society </em>\u2014 some of which is the private work of the Society and <em>some </em>of which may be characterized as public work pursuant to a contract with the state. The employees are paid from Society, not state, funds. While sixty-five to seventy percent of the Society\u2019s budget is composed of state appropriations, thirty to thirty-five percent of its budget comes from independent Society revenue raising. . The SERB hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>officer found that the Society generates its own revenues from admission fees to museums, the sale of meals, and the sale of goods and other services. Thus, we cannot say that Society employees are employed solely as a result of the Society\u2019s contractual relationship with the state. The Society\u2019s privately funded work is inextricably intertwined with the Society\u2019s publicly funded work. Its employees are, therefore, not \u201cpublic employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Moreover, as discussed above, the Society is a private entity. Whatever the policy reasons for treating the Society as a \u201cbranch of public employment,\u201d we cannot do so without support from the language or structure of R.C. Chapter 4117. If its employees were \u201cpublic employees\u201d under R.C. 4117.-01(C), we could conclude that the Society is a \u201cbranch of public employment.\u201d But such is not the case. The Society is a private entity and, accordingly, we hold that the Society is not a public employer under R.C. 4117.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The judgment of the court of appeals as to this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b603-8\">Douglas, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b603-9\">A.W.

While OHS may have some of the indicia of a public employer, and while it may even walk like, look like and quack like a public employer, the fact remains that it is still a <em>private </em>not-for-profit corporation and, under these peculiar circumstances, cannot be a public employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">I note in passing, as the majority does in fn. 2, that the regional director of the NLRB has concluded that OHS is, under federal law, a \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d Given our decision today, I would respectfully suggest that this matter be reviewed by proper authorities given the test set forth and approved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Natl.

Although I have misgivings about the manner in which the majority resolves some of the procedural matters in this case, I limit my discussion to the principal issue presented. That issue is whether the Ohio Historical Society (\u201cthe Society\u201d) is a \u201cpublic employer\u201d for purposes of R.C. Chapter 4117. A thoughtful consideration of relevant statutory provisions points to one inescapable conclusion: Even if one accepts the somewhat dubious assumption that the Society is a private corporation, the Society is clearly a \u201cpublic employer\u201d as that term is used in R.C. 4117.01(B). The majority\u2019s determination that the Society is not a public employer is irreconcilable with the undisputed facts underlying this case. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The employees of the Society are \u201cpublic employees\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4117.01(C), and therefore their employer must be a \u201cpublic employer\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4117.01(B), because the Society inescapably is an \u201cother branch of public employment\u201d as specified in the last phrase of R.C. 4117.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">R.C. 4117.01(C) specifically provides that the term \u201cpublic employee\u201d includes any person who works \u201cpursuant to a contract between a public employer and a <em>private employer </em>and over whom the national labor relations board [\u2018NLRB\u2019] has declined jurisdiction on the basis that the involved employees are employees of a public employer[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) I believe that the General Assembly, through this provision, was addressing precisely the situation presented by this case. SERB\u2019S order finding the Society to be a public employer relied on R.C. 4117.01(C). While SERB noted that \u201ca respectable argument could be mounted that the Society is a public employer based on the similarities between the functions of the [S]ociety and those of state government,\u201d SERB realized there was no need to entertain that inquiry. The Society\u2019s employees clearly fit the definition of \u201cpublic employees\u201d contained in the \u201cincluding\u201d language of R.C. 4117.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">It is apparent that employees of the Society work pursuant to a contract between the state and the Society. The majority even seems to recognize this, stating that \u201c[t]he Society\u2019s relationship with the state is based on contract. The Society contracts with the state to perform certain public functions designated in R.C. 149.30 for which the Society receives public funds.\u201d However, the majority appears to reason that, because the Society\u2019s privately funded work and publicly funded work are \u201cinextricably intertwined,\u201d the Society\u2019s employees are not working \u201csolely\u201d pursuant to a contract with the state, and thus are not \u201cpublic employees.\u201d However, the word \u201csolely\u201d doe's not appear anywhere in R.C. 4117.01(C). As noted by the majority, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Society performs numerous public functions and receives approximately sixty-five to seventy percent of its total operating budget from state appropriations. It is clear that the Society\u2019s employees work \u201cpursuant to a contract\u201d with the state. Because the NLRB has already declined jurisdiction over the Society\u2019s employees, both requirements of R.C. 4117.01(C) are met, and the Society\u2019s employees are \u201cpublic employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The concurring opinion seems to intimate that the NLRB erred by declining to exercise jurisdiction over the employees. However, the propriety of the NLRB\u2019s determination actually is irrelevant. What is of consequence is that the NLRB ruled as it did, thereby fulfilling one of the specific requirements of R.C. 4117.01(C). Moreover, the General Assembly, when it enacted R.C. Chapter 4117, attempted to provide that all employees in Ohio would be covered either by that chapter (if public employees) under SERB\u2019S jurisdiction unless expressly excluded, or by the National Labor Relations Act (if not public employees) under the jurisdiction of the NLRB. The General Assembly therefore chose to define \u201cpublic employee\u201d two ways in R.C. 4117.01(C). In most cases, the definition is straightforward: a public employee is one who works for a public employer. However, the legislature did not stop there in defining \u201cpublic employee,\u201d but continued with the \u201cincluding\u201d language. A public employee can also be one who works for a private employer which has some, but not all, the attributes of a public employer. When an employer\u2019s status as a public employer is in doubt, the legislature provided that that employer\u2019s employees might still be \u201cpublic employees\u201d when the NLRB declined to exercise jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">If the Society\u2019s employees are \u201cpublic employees\u201d (as they obviously are), it is glaringly apparent that the Society, as their employer, must be a \u201cpublic employer\u201d for R.C. Chapter 4117 purposes. The Society\u2019s argument that sometimes employees may be \u201cpublic employees,\u201d but their employer may at the same time not be a \u201cpublic employer\u201d should be unequivocally rejected. R.C. 4117.01(B) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 4117.01(C). A \u201cpublic employer\u201d is, by definition, one who employs \u201cpublic employees.\u201d And a \u201cpublic employee\u201d is, by definition, one who works for a \u201cpublic employer.\u201d When the definition of either R.C. 4117.01(B) or (C) is fulfilled, the definition of the other provision is also fulfilled. The General Assembly\u2019s decision to add the open-ended phrase \u201cother branch of public employment\u201d at the end of R.C. 4117.01(B) is an indication that in some instances a \u201cpublic employer\u201d may not possess <em>all </em>of the attributes of a state body. The Society, by advocating that we read R.C. 4117.01(B) and (C) as if they are unrelated, fails to appreciate the legislative intent that all employees in Ohio fall within the jurisdiction of either the NLRB or SERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>R.C. 4117.22 requires that \u201cChapter 4117. of the Revised Code shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purpose of promoting orderly and constructive relationships between all public employers and their employees.\u201d The majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of the definitional provisions of R.C. 4117.01 cannot be reconciled with the overall purpose of R.C. Chapter 4117, which is to afford collective bargaining rights, specified in R.C. 4117.03, to all \u201cpublic employees.\u201d As this court recognized in <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 221, 226, 560 N.E.2d 179, 184: \u201c[R.C. Chapter 4117\u2019s] overriding purpose is embodied in the very broad definition of \u2018public employer,\u2019 to extend the coverage of [R.C. Chapter 4117] as widely as possible in order to prevent the disruption of important public services by labor disputes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The majority states that \u201c[i]n both form and substance the Society is a private corporation.\u201d The majority appears to rely heavily on the finding that the Society is a <em>private </em>entity to reach the ultimate conclusion that the Society cannot be a <em>\u201cpublic </em>employer.\u201d The majority places too much emphasis on the word \u201cprivate\u201d and does not thoughtfully consider the purposes underlying R.C. Chapter 4117, including R.C. 4117.01(C)\u2019s clear provision that sometimes the employees of a \u201cprivate employer\u201d can be \u201cpublic employees.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Metro. Hous. Auth., supra, </em>does not at all stand for the proposition argued by the Society that only a public body can be a public employer. Rather, that case is an affirmation that an expansive, not a limiting, definition should be given to the term. The Society clearly falls within the definition provided by the General Assembly. The majority\u2019s analysis, which is based on a very narrow interpretation of \u201cpublic employer,\u201d cannot be accepted. The proper approach is diametrically opposed to that of the majority, who would appear to require the legislature to enact a statute explicitly declaring the Society to be a public employer before it would acknowledge that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Even though the Society argues that it is a private entity, the Society itself has admitted that it is not private for all purposes. In <em>State ex rel. Fenley v. Ohio Historical Soc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 509, 597 N.E.2d 120, the issue presented involved whether R.C. 149.43 (Ohio\u2019s public records law) obligated the Society to provide copies of public records by mail. Not at issue in that case was the question whether the Society is subject to the public records law \u2014 the Society clearly conceded that it is. For an entity to fall within the public records law, R.C. 149.43(A)(1) provides that the entity must be a \u201cpublic office,\u201d a term defined in R.C. 149.011(A). In <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Univ. of Toledo Found. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 258, 602 N.E.2d 1159, this court determined that the University of Toledo Foundation, a private nonprofit corporation, is a public office for R.C. 149.43 purposes, and is subject to the public records law. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Fostoria Daily Review Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Fostoria Hosp. Assn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 10, 531 N.E.2d 313 (a private, nonprofit corporation which performs a public function and is supported by public tax money is a \u201cpublic office\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 149.011[A], and is subject to the public records law). Even though determining whether an entity is a public office for R.C. 149.43 purposes differs significantly from determining whether it is a public employer for R.C. Chapter 4117 purposes, each inquiry requires a consideration of the distinction between a public and a private entity. <em>Univ. of Toledo Found, </em>and <em>Fostoria Hosp. Assn. </em>readily stand for the general proposition that although an entity may be a private one, it may still be public for some purposes. If the Society, allegedly a private entity, can be a public office for R.C. 149.43 purposes (as it has admitted it is), the Society also conceivably could be a public employer for R.C. Chapter 4117 purposes. As explained above, the Society is unquestionably a \u201cpublic employer.\u201d The Society\u2019s purported status as a private corporation does not preclude that determination, because R.C. 4117.01(C) specifically provides that, in the proper circumstances, the employees of a \u201cprivate employer\u201d are \u201cpublic employees.\u201d This case clearly presents those proper circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">In summary, the Society\u2019s employees work \u201cpursuant to a contract between a public employer and a private employer,\u201d and \u201cthe national labor relations board has declined jurisdiction on the basis that the involved employees are employees of a public employer[.]\u201d R.C. 4117.01(C). Because those two conditions are met, the Society qualifies as an \u201cother branch of public employment\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4117.01(B), and the Society is a \u201cpublic employer.\u201d I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The majority analyzes at length whether the Society qualifies as \u201cthe state or any political subdivision of the state\u201d for R.C. 4117.01(B) purposes, ultimately determining that the Society is neither the state nor a political subdivision of it. Given the foregoing view (expressed in Part I of this dissenting opinion) that R.C. 4117.01(C) specifically leads to the conclusion that the Society is a \u201cpublic employer,\u201d there is no real need to reach this question. However, the majority\u2019s reasoning cannot go unchallenged, and so I address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">R.C. 4117.01(B)\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic employer\u201d includes \u201c * * * any state agency, authority, commission, or board, or other branch of public employment.\u201d It is apparent that the Society is a \u201cstate agency\u201d in the sense of this definition. The Society has numerous attributes of a state agency, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>considered together make it at the very least the <em>de facto </em>equivalent of a state agency for R.C. Chapter 4117 purposes. It is incomprehensible how the majority is able to acknowledge these attributes, and yet find the Society is not a public employer. As the majority notes, the Society possesses the following characteristics:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\u2014Pursuant to the Society\u2019s constitution, nine members (one-half) of the Society\u2019s board of trustees are appointed by the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\u2014The Society enters into contracts with public, as well as private, entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\u2014The Society performs numerous public functions for the state, as detailed in R.C. 149.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">\u2014State appropriations provide approximately sixty-five to seventy percent of the Society\u2019s total operating budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u2014Employees of the Society are explicitly authorized to participate in the Public Employees Retirement System by R.C. 149.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">\u2014The Society\u2019s records are examined annually by the Auditor of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">\u2014The Society awards credit for previous state work time to former state employees it hires.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">\u2014State appropriations provided approximately ninety-five percent of the Society\u2019s 1985 funds for capital improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">\u2014The Society has a state agency number in the state budget for identification purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">These characteristics, taken in the aggregate, present an overwhelming scenario. Were several of these factors not present, this might have been a closer case. However, the large amount of state funding, taken alone, is a clear indicium of a public employer. Likewise, when an employer\u2019s employees participate in the Public Employees Retirement System, that alone also provides a strong indicator that the employer must be a public employer. The factors the majority relies on to find that the Society is not a public employer do not come close to countering the case in favor of finding that the Society is a public employer. However, as explained in Part I of this dissenting opinion, there is an even stronger ground for finding that the Society is a public employer, so that a resort to consideration of whether the Society possesses indicia of a public employer should not even be necessary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-15\">A.W.
