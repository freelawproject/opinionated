Case No. 91-2079 involves additional issues concerning the court of appeals' reinstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ment of Lawrence Browning\u2019s consortium claim against Dr. Blue and SEMC.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given the procedural disposition of these cases, the pertinent facts (where applicable) must be construed in a light most favorable to appellees who opposed the motions for summary judgment at the trial court level. See Civ.R. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Hospital Liability/Negligent Credentialing</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">SEMC appeals in both cases, urging that the claims asserted against it for negligent credentialing are time-barred by R.C. 2305.11(B)(1). Specifically, SEMC suggests that the court of appeals erred in determining that discovery (by appellees Mitchell and Browning) of the hospital\u2019s negligence was necessary to commence the running of the R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) period of limitations on the negligent credentialing claims. SEMC asserts that the \u201ccognizable events\u201d triggering the running of the statute of limitations on Mitchell\u2019s and Browning\u2019s medical malpractice claims against the doctor(s) were sufficient to commence the running of the period of limitations on their negligent credentialing causes of action against the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In support of its position, SEMC cites <em>Allenius, supra, </em>and a number of our other cases such as <em>Oliver v. Kaiser Community Health Found. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 111, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438, <em>Richards v. St. Thomas Hosp. </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 27, 24 OBR 71, 492 N.E.2d 821, <em>Hoffman v. Davidson </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 60, 31 OBR 165, 508 N.E.2d 958, <em>Hershberger v. Akron City Hosp. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 1, 516 N.E.2d 204, and <em>Flowers v. Walker </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 546, 589 N.E.2d 1284. This line of cases deals with the accrual of causes of action for <em>medical malpractice </em>under R.C. 2305.11, and the necessity of investigation and pursuit of remedies when a medical condition and its relationship to a previous medical procedure, treatment or diagnosis are \u201cdiscovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Conversely, appellees contend that under <em>Allenius, supra, </em>the \u201cWest 57th\u201d television program was the \u201ccognizable event\u201d which commenced the running of the R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) period of limitations on the negligent credentialing causes of action. Thus, appellees assert that Mitchell\u2019s and Browning\u2019s claims against SEMC were filed within the R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) period of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Upon reflection, we cannot accept either of the parties\u2019 positions, which assume that R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) and our cases governing the accrual of causes of action for <em>medical malpractice </em>apply to claims of hospital liability for negligent credentialing.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The theory of hospital liability at issue in these cases was discussed at some length in <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 257-260, 553 N.E.2d 1038, 1044-1047. In <em>Albain, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\u201cIn regard to staff privileges, a hospital has a <em>direct duty </em>to grant and to continue such privileges only to competent physicians. * * * In order to recover for a breach of this duty, a plaintiff injured by the negligence of a staff physician must demonstrate that but for the lack of care in the selection or the retention of the physician, the physician would not have been granted staff privileges, and the plaintiff would not have been injured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The general duty imposed upon hospitals to grant and continue staff privileges only to competent physicians was identified in <em>Albain </em>as an \u201cindependent\u201d duty of care owed <em>directly </em>to those admitted to the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 257-260, 553 N.E.2d at 1044-1047. See, also, <em>Taylor v. Flower Deaconess Home &amp; Hosp. </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 61, 135 N.E. 287. One of the areas in which the hospital owes the independent and direct duty to a patient is in establishing (and adhering to) reasonable peer review procedures:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\u201c * * * [0]nce a competent and careful physician has been granted staff privileges, the hospital will not thereafter be liable unless it had reason to know that the act of malpractice would most likely take place. That is, where a previously competent physician, with staff privileges develops a pattern of incompetence, which the hospital should become aware of through its peer review process, the hospital must stand ready to answer for its retention of such physician.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 258, 553 N.E.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In addition, the majority in <em>Albain </em>quoted with approval the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">\u201c\u2018 * * * [A hospital] is not required to pass upon the efficacy of treatment; it may not decide for a doctor whether an operation is necessary, or, if one be necessary, the nature thereof; but it owes to every patient whom it admits the duty of saving him from an illegal operation [or] false, fraudulent, or fictitious medical treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albain, </em>at 259, 553 N.E.2d at 1046, quoting <em>Hendrickson v. Hodkin </em>(1937), 250 A.D. 619, 621, 294 N.Y.S. 982, 984-985 (Lazansky, P.J., dissenting), reversed (1937), 276 N.Y. 252, 11 N.E.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The complaints against SEMC in the cases before us allege that the hospital breached these independent duties owed directly to Browning and Mitchell as patients at SEMC. The \u201cnegligent credentialing\u201d causes of action include allegations that SEMC failed to exercise prudence in granting or continuing staff privileges, failed to conduct reasonable peer review, failed to protect appellees Mitchell and Browning from known incompetent medical care, and otherwise failed to save appellees Mitchell and Browning from medical treatment (surgery) of an unnecessary and experimental nature. These claims are not claims for <em>medical malpractice </em>and, thus, the medical malpractice line of cases and the \u201ccognizable event\u201d test do not apply. A hospital does not practice medicine and is incapable, of committing malpractice. See, generally, <em>Lombard v. Good Samaritan Med. Ctr. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 471, 23 O.O.3d 410, 433 N.E.2d 162, and <em>Richardson v. Doe </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 370, 27 O.O.2d 345, 199 N.E.2d 878 (only physicians can commit \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d). Further, appellees\u2019 claims against the hospital have nothing to do with any issue concerning derivative liability of the hospital for the acts of its agent or employee-physicians. The question whether Burt or Blue is employed by SEMC is neither clear on the record before us nor particularly relevant to our discussion. Mitchell\u2019s and Browning\u2019s negligent credentialing claims against SEMC are independent claims asserted directly against SEMC for the <em>hospital\u2019s </em>own acts or omissions in granting and/or continuing the staff privileges of the doctor(s). Thus, we must determine what type of claim is being asserted by Browning and Mitchell against SEMC and, in addition, what statute of limitations applies to such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Medical Claim \u2014 R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) and (D)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\u201c * * * [A]n action upon a medical * * * claim shall be commenced within one year after the action accrued * *</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">\u201c \u2018Medical claim\u2019 <em>means any claim that is asserted in any civil action against a </em>physician, podiatrist, or <em>hospital, </em>against any employee or agent of a physician, podiatrist, or hospital, or against a registered nurse or physical therapist, <em>and that arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">A careful reading of R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) and (D)(3)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> demonstrates that not all claims asserted against a hospital are \u201cmedical claims\u201d subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>period of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11(B)(1). Rather, a claim against a hospital is a \u201cmedical claim\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2305.11(D)(3), and is subject to the one-year limitation period set forth in R.C. 2305.11(B)(1), only if the claim arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person. The terms \u201cmedical diagnosis\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d are terms of art having a specific and particular meaning relating to the identification and alleviation of a physical or mental illness, disease, or defect. See, generally, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990), at 453-454 and 1502. Conversely, the word \u201ccare\u201d is a general word without a specific legal meaning until placed in a particular context. Under the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule of statutory construction, \u201ccare\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) (where the word is preceded by terms such as \u201cphysician,\u201d \u201chospital,\u201d \u201cnurse,\u201d and \u201cmedical diagnosis\u201d) means the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. Thus, the term \u201ccare\u201d in R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) should not be broadly interpreted when the context in which it is used is properly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">With the foregoing discussion in mind, we believe that claims asserted against a hospital for negligent credentialing do not arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person. Negligent credentialing claims arise out of the <em>hospital\u2019s </em>failure to satisfy its independent duty to grant and continue staff privileges only to competent physicians. This independent duty does not directly involve diagnosis or the medical care and treatment of a patient. While the acts or omissions of a hospital in granting and/or continuing staff privileges to an incompetent physician <em>may </em>ultimately lead to an act of medical malpractice by the incompetent physician, the physician\u2019s ultimate act of medical malpractice is factually and legally severable and distinct from the hospital\u2019s acts or omissions in negligently credentialing him or her with staff membership or professional privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that an action against a hospital for bodily injury arising out of the hospital\u2019s negligence in credentialing a physician is neither \u201cmalpractice\u201d nor a \u201cmedical claim\u201d to which the limitations period found in R.C. 2305.11 applies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Discovery Rule \u2014 R.C. 2305.10</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">If a negligent credentialing cause of action is not a claim for malpractice or a medical claim, the obvious question becomes: What is it? It is, simply, a claim for bodily injury arising out of negligence which is not covered by the limitation periods found in R.C. 2305.11. Thus, we look to R.C. 2305.10, which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201cAn action for bodily injury or injuring personal property shall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">A cause of action for negligent credentialing of a physician by a hospital which results in bodily injury is an action falling under the umbrella of R.C. 2305.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Pursuant to R.C. 2305.10, the two-year period of limitations begins to run when a cause of action for bodily injury \u201carose,\u201d while the R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) statute of limitations for \u201cmedical claims\u201d begins to run when a cause of action \u201caccrued.\u201d However, we believe that the terms \u201carose\u201d and \u201caccrued\u201d are synonymous and that the rule of discovery long recognized in Ohio as applicable to the \u201caccrual\u201d of causes of action should be applied to the R.C. 2305.10 statute of limitations for claims of hospital <em>negligence </em>in credentialing a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">The history of the so-called discovery rule in Ohio is long and storied. The rule of discovery was originally recognized by this court in the medical malpractice context, but the rule has been generally accepted and applied in numerous areas of the law. See <em>Shover v. Cordis Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 213, 223-227, 574 N.E.2d 457, 464-467 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Of particular significance, the discovery rule has been judicially applied to the general statute of limitations for bodily injury actions under former R.C. 2305.10. In <em>O\u2019Strieker v. Jim Walter Corp. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 84, 4 OBR 335, 447 N.E.2d 727, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus, this court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">\u201c1. Absent legislative definition, it is left to the judiciary to determine when a cause \u2018arose\u2019 for purposes of statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">\u201c2. When an injury does not manifest itself immediately, the cause of action does not arise until the plaintiff knows or, by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that he had been injured by the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>defendant, for purposes of the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 2305.-10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><em>O\u2019Stricker </em>was decided under a version of R.C. 2305.10 in effect prior to the 1980 amendment to the statute. The 1980 amendment to R.C. 2305.10 specifically adopted a discovery rule for bodily injury actions caused by exposure to asbestos and chromium. 138 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3412. In <em>Burgess v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 59, 609 N.E.2d 140, where a discovery rule provided by the General Assembly for DES-related injuries was found to be insufficient, we again had occasion to announce that a discovery rule applies to the R.C. 2305.10 general statute of limitations for bodily injury actions. Here, we extend the discovery rule to bodily injury actions resulting from a hospital\u2019s negligence in credentialing a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\u201cCognizable Event\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Although not directly applicable to the claims of hospital negligence in the cases before us, the rule of discovery for the accrual of causes of action for medical malpractice under R.C. 2305.11 was explained in <em>Allenius, supra, </em>as requiring the occurrence of a \u201ccognizable event\u201d \u201cwhich does or should lead the patient to believe that the condition of which the patient complains is related to a medical procedure, treatment or diagnosis previously rendered to the patient and where the cognizable event does or should place the patient on notice of the need to pursue his possible remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Today, we <em>borrow </em>from <em>Allenius </em>in constructing a rule of discovery applicable to R.C. 2305.10 for bodily injury actions arising from negligent credentialing by a hospital. We emphasize, however, that <em>Allenius </em>and our cases governing the accrual of causes of action for medical malpractice are not applicable to causes of action for hospital negligence in credentialing a physician. By its very nature, the discovery rule (concept) must be specially tailored to the particular context in which it is to be applied. Our decisions concerning the accrual of causes of action for medical malpractice are not applicable to determine the accrual date of claims not related to the medical malpractice of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The court of appeals found that the critical inquiry for determining, the accrual date of the negligent credentialing causes of action requires pinpointing when the victims should have discovered that SEMC had failed to \u201cprovide adequate supervision or review of\u201d Dr. Burt (and Dr. Blue in the <em>Browning </em>case). The court of appeals found no evidence that Mitchell or Browning discovered or should have discovered that SEMC had failed to perform its legal duties until the women viewed the television program in October 1988 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and realized that other former patients of Dr. Burt suffered from maladies similar to their own. Thus, the court of appeals held that summary judgment on the basis of the R.C. 2305.11(B)(1) statute of limitations was not proper in either case, since the complaints were filed within one year of the discovery of pertinent facts which placed appellees on notice to pursue a remedy against the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We agree with the court of appeals that in both cases the October 1988 television program was the event which triggered the running of the statute of limitations on Browning\u2019s and Mitchell\u2019s claims against SEMC \u2014 although it is the R.C. 2305.10 period of limitations which should have been applied. The court of appeals was absolutely correct in recognizing that the facts or events which might trigger the running of the statute of limitations for <em>medical malpractice claims against a doctor </em>do not necessarily commence the running of a statute of limitations on claims against a <em>hospital for hospital negligence </em>unrelated to the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person. We, mildly and respectfully, disagree with the court of appeals to the extent that it found the \u201ccognizable event\u201d test of <em>Allenius </em>to be directly applicable in determining the accrual date of appellees\u2019 negligent credentialing claims. Mere mention of <em>Allenius </em>and the \u201ccognizable event\u201d test conjures up images of medical malpractice (to anyone who is familiar with our cases in this area), which may be one reason for the confusion in the court of appeals, resulting in application of the wrong statute of limitations to appellees\u2019 causes of action for hospital negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cAlerting Event\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In tailoring a rule of discovery applicable to R.C. 2305.10 for bodily injury actions arising from negligent credentialing by a hospital, we hold that a cause of action for negligent credentialing arises when the plaintiff knows or should know that he or she was injured as a result of the hospital\u2019s negligent credentialing procedures or practices. In our judgment, the only evidence of any perspicuous event which should have alerted appellees Browning and Mitchell to pursue their negligence claims against SEMC occurred in October 1988. Upon viewing a television program, Browning and Mitchell became aware that many of Burt\u2019s ex-patients suffered from abnormalities similar to their own as a consequence of Burt\u2019s surgical practices at SEMC. The record is devoid of evidence that appellees knew or should have known prior to October 1988 that SEMC may have done something wrong in granting or continuing privileges to Dr. Burt or Blue. The \u201cspecial Burt consent\u201d form in Browning\u2019s and Mitchell\u2019s hospital records would not have apprised Mitchell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and Browning that their doctor(s) may have committed a number of harmful, improper or unwarranted surgeries upon a number of unsuspecting patients such that SEMC\u2019s credentialing practices could reasonably be brought into question. Accordingly, the R.C. 2305.10 statute of limitations was triggered in October 1988, and the complaints against SEMC were filed well within the applicable two-year period of limitations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Obviously, we do not hold that a television program like the one at issue in these cases is necessary to trigger the running of the R.C. 2305.10 statute of limitations in every case of negligent credentialing. It is sufficient if a plaintiff discovers or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered some definitive information that would reasonably warrant investigation of the hospital\u2019s credentialing practices. Such an occurrence might be termed an \u201calerting event,\u201d if for no other reason than to contrast the occurrence triggering the commencement of the statute of limitations for negligence in R.C. 2305.10 from the \u201ccognizable event\u201d of R.C. 2305.11 limitation periods. However, discovery of a physician\u2019s medical malpractice does not, in itself, constitute an \u201calerting event\u201d nor does such discovery implicate the hospital\u2019s credentialing practices or require investigation of the hospital in this regard. To hold otherwise would encourage baseless claims of negligent credentialing and a hospital would be named in nearly every lawsuit involving the malpractice of a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">R.C. 2305.25</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">SEMC and <em>amicus curiae, </em>Ohio Hospital Association, suggest that hospitals are immune from liability for the acts, omissions and decisions of their peer review committees by virtue of R.C. 2305.25 and that, therefore, a hospital cannot be liable for negligent peer review. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">R.C. 2305.25 provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\"><em>\u201cNo hospital, </em>no state or local society, and no individual <em>who is a member </em>or employee <em>of any of the following committees shall be liable in damages to any person for any acts, omissions, decisions, or other conduct within the scope of the functions of the committee:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\"><em>U </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201c(E) A peer review committee, professional standards review committee, or arbitration committee of a state or local society composed of doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathic medicine and surgery, doctors of dentistry, doctors of optometry, doctors of podiatric medicine, psychologists, or registered pharmacistsf.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Following a listing of the specific review boards and committees, R.C. 2305.25 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201cNothing in this section shall relieve any individual or hospital from liability arising from treatment of a patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\u201cThis section shall also apply to any member or employee of a nonprofit corporation engaged in performing the functions of a peer review committee of nursing home providers or administrators or of a peer review or professional standards review committee. No person who provides information under this section and provides such information without malice and in the reasonable belief that such information is warranted by the facts known to him shall be subject to suit for civil damages as a result thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The purposes of R.C. 2305.25 are clear. The statute extends limited protection to those who provide information to certain review boards and committees to encourage the free flow of information without threat of reprisal in the form of civil liability. See, generally, <em>Jacobs v. Frank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 573 N.E.2d 609, 612. The statute also seeks to protect those serving on committees and committee employees for the obvious reason that it could be difficult to staff a committee absent such protections. However, the cases at bar do not involve a situation where SEMC has been either the provider of information to a committee (see, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 1742.141), or the participant on a committee. It is clear to us that R.C. 2305.25 does not provide blanket immunity to a hospital for negligence in granting and/or continuing staff privileges of an incompetent physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">SEMC protests that R.C. 2305.25 and 2305.251 prevent a hospital from defending itself against claims for negligent peer review. According to SEMC, these statutes require that no evidence as to any matter brought to the attention of peer review committees, or actions taken by those committees, can be introduced into evidence in the hospital\u2019s defense. We reject SEMC\u2019s contentions for a number of reasons, but quoting from the following portion of R.C. 2305.251 should dispel any notion that SEMC\u2019s arguments are meritorious:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\u201c * * * Information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as being unavailable for discovery or for use in any civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of a committee nor should any person testifying before a committee or who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>a member of the committee be prevented from testifying as to matters within his knowledge, but the witness cannot be asked about his testimony before the committee or opinion formed by him as a result of the committee hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Summary of Holdings re Claims Against SEMC</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">In summarizing our discussion concerning the claims against SEMC, we hold that:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">1. Hospital negligence arising out of the \u201ccare\u201d of a patient is a \u201cmedical claim\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) and is subject to the period of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11(B)(1). \u201cCare\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.-11(D)(3) is the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">2. Negligent credentialing of a physician by a hospital is not \u201cmedical diagnosis, care, or treatment\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2305.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">3. An action against a hospital for bodily injury arising out of the negligent credentialing of a physician is subject to the two-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">4. The period of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.10 commences to run when the victim knows or should have discovered that he or she was injured as a result of the hospital\u2019s negligent credentialing procedures or practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">5. R.C. 2305.25 does not provide a hospital with immunity from liability for the hospital\u2019s negligence in granting and/or continuing the staff privileges of an incompetent physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">For the reasons stated herein, which differ, in part, from the reasoning of the court of appeals, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in case No. 91-2121 (Mitchell) and that portion of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in case No. 91-2079 (Browning) which reversed the judgment of the trial court with respect to the dismissal of the action against SEMC.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">Consortium Claim of Lawrence Browning Against Blue</p>\n<p id=\"b687-17\">The only remaining question before us concerns the appeal of Dr. Blue in case No. 91-2079 (Browning) regarding the reinstatement of Lawrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Browning\u2019s consortium claim against Blue. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Blue contends that Lawrence Browning did not appeal to the court of appeals and, thus, the appellate court had no jurisdiction to reverse the judgment of the trial court on any issue relating to Lawrence\u2019s claim against Blue. However, the record does not support this contention and, therefore, we reject Blue\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Blue also suggests that the court of appeals abused its discretion in finding that the R.C. 2305.09 statute of limitations applied to Lawrence\u2019s consortium claim against Blue, since no party briefed or argued the issue or raised the question in an assignment of error to the court of appeals. We find no abuse of discretion. The law is clear that spousal consortium claims arising from medical malpractice are governed by the R.C. 2305.09(D) four-year period of limitations, when the principal claim for malpractice accrued, as it did here, prior to the effective date of the October 1987 amendment to R.C. 2305.11. <em>Hershberger, supra, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 6, 516 N.E.2d at 208.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, the issue decided by the court of appeals did not involve the constitutionality of a statute and, thus, the case of <em>State v. 1981 Dodge Ram Van </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 168, 522 N.E.2d 524, is distinguishable. A number of other cases cited by Blue merely recite the general rule of law that issues may be treated as waived if not raised at the first opportunity or assigned as error in the court of appeals. However, there is no general prohibition in App.R. 12(A) requiring that issues be treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Finally, Blue suggests that even under the R.C. 2305.09 statute of limitations, Lawrence Browning\u2019s action against Blue for loss of consortium was untimely filed. Specifically, Blue urges that Mrs. Browning\u2019s malpractice claim against Blue \u201caccrued\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2305.11 as early as 1983 and, thus, Lawrence Browning had four years from that time to commence suit against Blue, but failed to do so. However, Mrs. Browning\u2019s malpractice claim against Blue was found by the trial court and court of appeals to have accrued in August 1987 at the latest. Since the R.C. 2305.09(D) four-year period of limitations on Lawrence\u2019s claim against Blue commenced to run on the same date that the R.C. 2305.11 one-year period of limitations began to run on Browning\u2019s malpractice claim against Blue, <em>Hershberger, supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus, Lawrence\u2019s claim was timely filed. This is especially true given the fact that Browning continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>her treatment with Blue until August 1987. See <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">In reaching our conclusions, we do not pass judgment (since issues of alleged liability are yet to be determined) on Dr. Blue or SEMC, although it is tempting to do so given what the record shows has happened to these two women. Perhaps now they, and others, will have their day in court, where the\u2019 conspiracy of silence in the local medical community which permitted the atrocities to be committed, and the atrocities themselves, can be more fully explored. Further, nothing in our opinion should be read to stand in the way of the proper performance of progressive medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">For all the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the difficult and courageous judgments of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b689-11\">A.W.

The malpractice of Dr. Burt has been established in both cases by virtue of the default judgments entered against him even the causes of action for malpractice against Dr. Burt were untimely filed.

I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of Lawrence Browning\u2019s consortium claim against Dr. Blue. However, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because (1) a \u201cnegligent credentialing\u201d cause of action is a \u201cmedical claim\u201d and is subject to the one-year limitations period set forth in former R.C. 2305.11, and (2) plaintiffs\u2019 claims against St. Elizabeth Medical Center (\u201cSEMC\u201d) had already accrued and were time-barred by the time plaintiffs viewed the \u201cWest 57th\u201d television program..</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">Because the majority\u2019s newly styled \u201cnegligent credentialing\u201d cause of action is created from the language of a previous decision of this court, it is important to first consult that language before analyzing the cases <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, we recognized, as an exception to the independent contractor rule, the right of a plaintiff to hold an employer directly liable for injuries proximately caused by the employer\u2019s own negligence in selecting or retaining an independent contractor. We applied this rule to the hospital setting and held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>hospital can be held liable for the medical malpractice of a staff physician where the injured party can prove that the hospital was negligent in granting or in continuing the staff privileges of the independent physician. Paragraph two of the syllabus of that decision reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">\u201cIn regard to staff privileges, a hospital has a direct duty to grant and to continue such privileges only to competent physicians. A hospital is not an insurer of the skills of private physicians to whom staff privileges have been granted. In order to recover for a breach of this duty, a plaintiff injured by the negligence of a staff physician must demonstrate that <em>but for the lack of care in the selection or the retention of the physician, the physician would not have been granted staff privileges, and the plaintiff would not have been </em>injured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The above-emphasized language underscores a crucial point underemphasized by the majority\u2019s opinion: under <em>Albain, </em>claims against a hospital for negligent retention or selection of a staff physician are dependent on an underlying medical malpractice claim against the staff physician. In order to prevail in a cause of action for negligent credentialing against a hospital pursuant to <em>Albain, </em>the plaintiff must establish not only negligent selection and/or retention of a physician, but also that but for the hospital\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff would not have been injured. That is, <em>Albain </em>requires that the underlying malpractice of the physician be proven before the plaintiff can recover damages against the hospital for its own negligence. Without an underlying harm to the hospital\u2019s patient through medical malpractice, an action against the hospital for negligent credentialing will never arise. Although medical malpractice claims against the doctor and negligent credentialing claims against the hospital are separate causes of action, with separate and distinct duties owed to a singular class of individuals, both causes of action fail without proof that the physician\u2019s failure to abide by ordinary standards of care proximately caused the patient\u2019s harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Having failed to fully appreciate the significance of the interdependence between the negligent credentialing claims and the underlying malpractice claims, the majority has also erroneously held that a negligent credentialing cause of action is subject to the two-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.10, rather than the one-year period found in former R.C. 2305.11.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Under the version of R.C. 2305.11 in effect at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action arose, \u201cmedical claim\u201d was defined in R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) as \u201cany claim asserted in any civil action against a physician, podiatrist, or hospital <em>arising out of </em>the diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 139 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2154. Although former R.C. 2305.11 did not explicitly state that a \u201cmedical claim\u201d is subject to the one-year limitations period contained in former R.C. 2305.11(A), I believe that the one-year statute of limitations is nonetheless applicable. As Justice Holmes correctly explained in his dissent in <em>Lombard v. Good Samaritan Med. Ctr. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 471, 475-476, 23 O.O.3d 410, 413, 433 N.E.2d 162, 165, the General Assembly intended the words \u201cmalpractice\u201d and \u201cmedical claim\u201d to be used interchangeably:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201c * * * The second paragraph of R.C. 2305.11(A) allows one to serve written notice, prior to expiration of the time in R.C. 2305.11(A), upon a person and extend the time in which a suit may be brought against that person by up to 180 days from the time notice is given. This paragraph does not refer at all to malpractice. Rather, it uses the phrase \u2018medical claim.\u2019 This is evidence that the General Assembly considered the words \u2018malpractice\u2019 and \u2018medical claim\u2019 to be synonymous, for if the legislative intent was to give these words different meanings, it would make little sense to include actions such as the present one in a subsection that did not apply to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">I would, therefore, hold that a negligent credentialing cause of action against a hospital, like a medical malpractice lawsuit brought against a physician, is subject to the one-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.11. Claims asserted against a hospital for negligent credentialing do <em>arise out of </em>a patient\u2019s medical diagnosis, care, or treatment. In every instance, the plaintiff-patient is alleging that the staff physician has rendered him or her substandard diagnosis, care, or treatment which proximately resulted in plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries. The negligent credentialing claim against the hospital would not have arisen but for the underlying medical malpractice. Accordingly, the instant actions against the hospital are \u201cmedical claim[s]\u201d within the meaning of former R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) and the plaintiffs had one year from the time of accrual in which to file their lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">What remains to be determined is the proper accrual date of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent credentialing causes of action against SEMC. Our prior decisions establish that a cause of action for medical malpractice accrues when the patient discovers or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered the resulting injury, or when the physician-patient relationship for that condition terminates, whichever occurs later. <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337, syllabus. The term \u201ccognizable event\u201d was used in <em>Allenius v. Thomas </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 131, 538 N.E.2d 93, to identify the point in time when the patient in fact discovers or reasonably should have discovered the resulting injury. <em>Allenius </em>cited the following language of <em>Oliver v. Kaiser Community Health Found. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 111, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438, paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201c \u2018Under R.C. 2305.11(A), a cause of action for medical malpractice accrues and the statute of limitations commences to run when the patient discovers, or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the resulting injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allenius, supra, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 133, 538 N.E.2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Therefore, a \u201ccognizable event\u201d is an occurrence \u201cwhich does or should lead the patient to believe that the condition of which the patient complains is related to a medical procedure, treatment or diagnosis previously rendered to the patient and where the cognizable event does or should place the patient on notice of the need to pursue his possible remedies.\u201d <em>Allenius, supra, </em>at syllabus. Concurring in that opinion in order to emphasize that it is discovery of the physical injury \u2014 not discovery of the legal claim \u2014 which triggers the statute of limitations, I stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\u201c[I]n determining when the statute of limitations is triggered, \u2018 \u201c[t]he test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation.\u201d \u2019 * * * As indicated by the majority, it is a cognizable event such as the occurrence of pain or injury \u2018 * * <em>* </em>rather than knowledge of its legal significance that starts the running of the statute of limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allenius, supra, </em>at 135, 538 N.E.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">That proposition was recognized in a later decision by this court in <em>Flowers v. Walker </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 546, 549, 589 N.E.2d 1284, 1287-1288:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">\u201cMoreover, <em>constructive </em>knowledge of facts, rather than <em>actual </em>knowledge of their legal significance, is enough to start the statute of limitations running under the discovery rule. * * * A plaintiff need not have discovered all the relevant facts necessary to file a claim in order to trigger the statute of limitations. * * * Rather, the \u2018cognizable event\u2019 itself puts the plaintiff on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>notice to investigate the facts and circumstances relevant to her claim in order to pursue her remedies. * * * \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The facts or circumstances which give rise to a \u201ccognizable event\u201d for purposes of discovery of a medical malpractice claim do not automatically give rise to a claim against a hospital for negligent credentialing. \u201cA physician\u2019s negligence does not automatically mean that the hospital is liable, and does not raise a presumption that the hospital was negligent in granting the physician staff privileges.\u201d <em>Albain, supra, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 258-259, 553 N.E.2d at 1046. As noted by the majority, the statute of limitations for negligent credentialing begins to run when the \u201cplaintiff discovers or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered some definitive information that would reasonably warrant investigation of the hospital\u2019s credentialing practices.\u201d Here, the majority has followed the lead of the court of appeals in determining that there was no evidence before the trial court that the plaintiffs knew or should have known that the hospital had failed to perform its legal duty toward them until plaintiffs viewed the \u201cWest 57th\u201d television show. I strongly disagree because I believe the plaintiffs had earlier notice of SEMC\u2019s negligence in granting staff privileges to the defendant-physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The record indicates that both Browning and Mitchell signed the following acknowledgement on SEMC letterhead prior to having Dr. Burt perform vaginal reconstruction surgery:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u201cDear Patient:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">\u201cThe Executive Committee of the Medical Staff of St. Elizabeth Medical Center wishes to inform you that the \u2018female coital area reconstruction\u2019 surgery you are about to undergo is:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">\u201c1. Not documented by ordinary standards of scientific reporting and publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">\u201c2. Not a generally accepted procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">\u201c3. As yet not duplicated by other investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">\u201c4. Detailed only in non-scientific literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">\u201cYou should be informed that the Executive Committee of the Medical Staff considers the aforementioned procedure an unproven, non-standard practice of gynecology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">The majority completely overlooks the impact of the signed consent form in determining when the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent credentialing causes of action against SEMC accrued. Instead, the majority holds that plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action accrued no earlier than the date Browning and Mitchell viewed the \u201cWest 57th\u201d television program. In this regard, the majority asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>notice of a hospital\u2019s negligent credentialing practices only occurs where the patient has been apprised that his or her doctor \u201cmay have committed a number of harmful, improper or unwarranted surgeries upon a number of unsuspecting patients such that [a hospital\u2019s] credentialing practices could reasonably be brought into question.\u201d I disagree and would hold, contrary to the majority opinion, that the plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action against SEMC could accrue even without notice that other former patients were suffering from similar conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">One is not left to imagine the purpose SEMC had in supplying this form letter to patients about to undergo Dr. Burt\u2019s unusual surgery. SEMC was clearly attempting to insulate itself from liability. In doing so, the hospital was telling its patients that Dr. Burt\u2019s specific brand of reconstruction surgery was unlike any other known form of reconstruction surgery. The experimental nature of this surgery therefore carried with it additional risks not associated with standard and generally \u00e1ccepted surgical procedures. Because it is not before this court, we leave unresolved the issue whether the hospital can effectively assert this letter as a defense to the Browning and Mitchell lawsuits. However, the letter\u2019s relevance in placing these former patients on notice that SEMC itself may have breached a duty owed to them by allowing such surgeries to be performed on its premises should not likewise go unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">If the majority properly applied <em>Allenius </em>and <em>Flowers </em>to these facts, the conclusion would be that the form letter was effective to place both Browning and Mitchell on notice that SEMC may have failed to properly perform its credentialing duties by permitting a physician\u2019s questionable surgical procedures. The next question to be answered is when the statute of limitations began to run on the patients\u2019 negligent credentialing causes of action against SEMC. Obviously, the statute did not begin to run when Browning and Mitchell were supplied with the form letter because the surgeries had yet to be performed and they, therefore, could claim no resulting injury. Since they had no reason to believe they were harmed, it is equally unfair to hold that the statute of limitations was triggered when the operations were first performed. In medical malpractice cases, the running of the statute of limitations is delayed from the traditional date of injury to the date a \u201ccognizable event\u201d is discovered, in order to eliminate unfairness to medical malpractice plaintiffs. See <em>Flowers, supra, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 550, 589 N.E.2d at 1288. Accordingly, it was not until Browning and Mitchell became aware that the injuries they complained of were related to the doctors\u2019 surgeries that they should have appreciated the significance of the hospital\u2019s form letter. <em>Allenius </em>clearly envisions and requires that the patient investigate and pursue all \u201cpossible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>remedies\u201d once he or she has been put on notice by the cognizable event. See <em>Allenius, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 131, 538 N.E.2d 93, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Among the \u201cpossible remedies\u201d of a plaintiff harmed by the malpractice of a physician are claims against a hospital for negligent credentialing procedures when that patient has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry that the hospital may have breached a duty owed to him or her. At the time their causes of action against the doctors accrued, the form letter provided notice to plaintiffs of a possible claim against SEMC or at least should have alerted them to the need to investigate such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In case No. 91-2079, Browning informed Dr. Blue at the latest in August 1987 that he had committed malpractice on her. By that time, Browning had undergone approximately sixteen surgeries and her physical and emotional health was continuing to decline. The trial court, therefore, correctly found that August 1987, at the very latest, was the time when Browning was put on notice by a \u201ccognizable event\u201d to pursue her medical malpractice claim and the one-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.11 began to run. To hold otherwise is to cast aside the \u201ccognizable event\u201d test this court announced just four years ago in an effort to give trial courts some useful standard in medical malpractice cases. Because Browning should also have been aware of SEMC\u2019s negligence in permitting her doctor\u2019s experimental surgery, her cause of action against the hospital for negligent credentialing and retention also accrued on this date. Both causes of action were barred because Browning filed her complaint on April 17, 1989, outside the one-year period of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In case No. 91-2121, Mitchell underwent Dr. Burt\u2019s reconstruction surgery in January 1985. The medical problems to be alleviated by this surgery (which, included urinary incontinence, bladder and vaginal infections and painful sexual intercourse) actually worsened within a few months after the January 1985 surgical procedure. The record indicates that by mid-1985, intense pain and massive vaginal bleeding made it impossible for Mitchell to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. Mitchell was also aware of the unusual appearance of her vagina at this time. She discovered that her vagina \u201cwas covered over\u201d and \u201csewn up.\u201d Certainly, these occurrences gave rise to a \u201ccognizable event\u201d for purposes of Mitchell\u2019s discovery of her medical malpractice claim. Like Browning, the SEMC form letter could reasonably be expected to place Mitchell on notice of the need to pursue her \u201cpossible remedy\u201d against the hospital. Since Mitchell\u2019s complaint against the hospital was filed more than three years after she was placed on notice, the trial court correctly found it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals as it relates to the claims of plaintiffs against SEMC and reinstate the grants of summary judgment by the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b696-5\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. Current R.C. 2305.11(B)(1), unlike the former version of the statute, specifically states that an action on a \u201cmedical * * * claim\u201d (like those actions based upon a dental, optometric, or chiropractic claim) is required to be commenced within one year after the action accrued. Under R.C. 2305.11(D)(3),- \u201cmedical claim\u201d includes claims which seek to hold a hospital responsible for its <em>own </em>torts as well as those alleging the hospital is vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of its employees and agents. In both cases, the claim must be one that <em>\u201carises </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>out of </em>the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person\u201d before the one-year limitations period is applicable. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2305.11(D)(3) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-9\">\u201c \u2018Medical claim\u2019 means any claim that is asserted in any civil action against a physician, podiatrist, or <em>hospital, </em>against any employee or agent of a physician, podiatrist, or hospital, or against a registered nurse or physical therapist, <em>and that arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. </em>\u2018Medical claim\u2019 includes derivative claims for relief that arise from the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b696-6\">Weight, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASK\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. Along with the Chief Justice, I agree with the majority\u2019s disposition of Lawrence Browning\u2019s consortium claim, but disagree with the majority\u2019s disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligent credentialing claims against St. Elizabeth Medical Center. Unlike the Chief Justice though, because I believe a <em>negligent </em>credentialing claim is necessarily grounded in negligence, I agree with the majority\u2019s holding in paragraph three of the syllabus that \u201c[a]n action against a hospital for bodily injury arising out of the negligent credentialing of a physician is subject to the two-year limitations period set forth in R.C. 2305.10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">However, I find it completely unnecessary to create a new event, the \u201calerting event,\u201d as the accrual date for the running of the statute of limitations. The \u201ccognizable event\u201d which we recognized in <em>Allenius v. Thomas </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 131, 538 N.E.2d 93, the event by which \u201c \u2018the patient discovers, or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the resulting injury,\u2019 \u201d is the event which \u201cplacets] the patient on notice of the need to pursue his possible remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 538 N.E.2d at 95, and at syllabus (quoting, in part, <em>Oliver v. Kaiser Community Health Found. </em>[1983], 5 Ohio St.3d 111, 5 OBR 247, 449 N.E.2d 438, paragraph one of the syllabus). One of the \u201cpossible remedies\u201d of which the plaintiff is on notice is a negligent credentialing claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">I certainly agree with the majority that not every case of malpractice will give rise to a negligent credentialing claim. However, as the Chief Justice points out, every negligent credentialing claim will by necessity arise out of a malpractice claim because the plaintiff must have been injured by the hospital\u2019s actions in negligently credentialing the physician in question. Therefore, it seems to me that the cognizable event which is the accrual date for a malpractice action is the same point in time at which, as the majority writes, the \u201cplaintiff discovers or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered some definitive information that would reasonably warrant <em>investigation </em>of the hospital\u2019s credentialing practices.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">I disagree with the majority that use of this cognizable event to trigger the statute of limitations for a negligent credentialing claim will \u201cencourage baseless claims of negligent credentialing and a hospital would be named in nearly every lawsuit involving the malpractice of a physician.\u201d The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>overlooks the fact that the malpractice action has a one-year limitations period while the negligent credentialing claim will have a two-year limitations period. This allows plaintiffs additional time to investigate whether the injury caused by the malpractice was a result of the hospital\u2019s negligent credentialing of the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">My view of the record is that the \u201ccognizable event\u201d as to both appellees with respect to the hospital took place at a far earlier time than the television show described by the majority. Accordingly, I would remand the matter to the trial court to determine the precise time frames involved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
