Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, directed the commission to \u201cspecifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision. An order of the commission should make it readily apparent from the four corners of the decision that there is some evidence supporting it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 567 N.E.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The commission concedes that its order does not satisfy <em>Noll </em>since it does not explain the reasoning behind the order but merely identifies evidence that the commission deemed relevant. Mere recitation of claimant\u2019s age, education and work history does not constitute an <em>explanation </em>of the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">However, a <em>Noll </em>violation does not mandate substitution of the commission\u2019s denial with an order granting permanent total disability benefits. Under similar facts, we rejected this proposition, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">\u201cA lack of \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting denial of permanent total disability compensation does not automatically translate into \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting its award. <em>State ex rel. Lampkins v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 14, 542 N.E.2d 1105. Accordingly, we return the cause to the commission for further consideration of the application.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wilcox v. Ashtabula Cty. Highway Dept. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 593 N.E.2d 1390, 1391-1392.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Claimant responds that the commission must be instructed to find permanent total disability upon remand if claimant\u2019s allowed conditions together with nonmedical evidence and nonallowed medical conditions remove him from sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Claimant\u2019s assertion arises from language in <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, in which this court ordered the commission, for the first time, to consider nonmedical disability factors in evaluating applications for permanent total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>disability compensation. <em>Stephenson </em>directed the commission to \u201clook at the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, <em>and all other factors, such as physical, </em>psychological and sociological, that are contained within the record in making its determination of permanent total disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 173, 31 OBR at 374, 509 N.E.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Claimant misreads <em>Stephenson. </em>The commission must \u201clook at\u201d all relevant factors in the record that may affect a claimant\u2019s ability to work. However, <em>Stephenson </em>was never intended to permit the commission to base an award of permanent total disability on non-allowed medical conditions, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b564-9\">Resnick, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
