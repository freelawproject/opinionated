First, relators\u2019 request to compel reclassification is moot, since reclassification occurred on July 1,1992. Second, relators\u2019 request that this court declare the special THA classifications unconstitutional ignores our express refusal to address that issue in <em>Minutemen, supra, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 158, 580 N.E.2d 777. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>For the reason expressed in <em>Minutemen, </em>the constitutional question dpes not merit examination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Disposition of these questions leaves one matter for determination \u2014 the period over which relators may be reimbursed. Relators urge repayment from July 1, 1985, citing R.C. 2305.07 and 2305.14. Respondents counter with Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-17(C)\u2019s two-year limitation. We agree with the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">R.C. Chapter 2305 governs timely commencement of civil actions. The timeliness of this action is not at issue. Ohio Adm,Code 4121-7-17(C), however, is directly on point:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cThe Commission and Bureau shall * * * have the right to make adjustments as to * * * premium rates and/or amount of premium. No adjustments, however, shall be made in an employer\u2019s account which result in reducing the amount of premium below the amount of contributions made by the employer to the fund for the periods involved, except in reference to adjustments for the semi-annual and/or adjustment periods ending within twenty-four months immediately prior to the beginning of the current payroll reporting period, when such errors affecting the reports and the premium are brought to the attention of the Commission and Bureau by an employer through written application for adjustment or found by the Commission and Bureau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-17(C)\u2019s applicability to premium reimbursement cases was recently reaffirmed in both <em>State ex rel. Harry Wolsky Stair Builder, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 222, 569 N.E.2d 900, and <em>State ex rel. Granville Volunteer Fire Dept., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 518, 597 N.E.2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The existence of a specially applicable limitations period distinguishes this case from, for example, <em>State ex rel. Madden v. Windham Exempted Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 86, 537 N.E.2d 646. In <em>Madden, </em>relator\u2019s tenure as a teacher with respondent school district was interrupted by an eight-year hiatus for maternity reasons. When she returned during the 1979-1980 school year, she was misclassified for salary purposes and continued at the wrong pay level until the 1985-1986 term. In 1986, relator filed a mandamus petition to compel compensation at the appropriate level as well as back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Among other defenses, respondent in <em>Madden </em>claimed that relator was not entitled to any reimbursement, since her suit, respondent alleged, was untimely. Respondent argued that relator\u2019s cause of action arose in 1979, placing her 1986 suit beyond R.C. 2305.07\u2019s six-year limitations period. This court disagreed, finding that each year in which relator had been misclassified constituted a \u201cseparate and distinct claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 90, 537 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>N.E.2d at 649. The court thus ordered that \u201c[pjursuant to R.C. 2305.07, relator should be compensated for the six years prior to the filing of her complaint.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Relators in the instant case have broadly interpreted this language as blanket authority for a recovery period dating back six years from the filing of the complaint any time any party seeks reimbursement from a defendant whose liability was created by statute. This construction fails for two reasons. First, R.C. Chapter 3317, from which the back pay claim in <em>Madden </em>stemmed, had no statute of limitations for reimbursements. Second, R.C. 2305.07 was used in <em>Madden </em>only to determine the timeliness of the complaint. The actual right to reimbursement flowed automatically under R.C. 3317.14. <em>Madden, </em>accordingly, is distinguishable from this case, as are <em>State ex rel. Gingrich v. Fairfield City. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 244, 18 OBR 300, 480 N.E.2d 485, <em>Zion Nursing Home, Inc. v. Creasy </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 221, 6 OBR 293, 452 N.E.2d 1272, and <em>State ex rel. Country Court v. Creasy </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 419, 16 O.O.3d 446, 406 N.E.2d 521, on which relators also rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Having determined that Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-17(C) controls, we must ascertain how far back adjustments that result in refunds may be made to relators\u2019 accounts. Respondents maintain that the date from which reimbursement should run is July 1, 1990 \u2014 two years prior to the beginning of the payroll period in which separate THA rates were abandoned. Relators argue that under this rule they are entitled to reimbursement starting July 1, 1989\u2014 two years before the beginning of the payroll period in which the <em>Minutemen </em>decision fell. We favor the second alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-17(C) permits repayment from the point at which the \u201cerrors affecting the reports and the premiums are brought to the attention of the Commission and Bureau * * * or found by the Commission and Bureau.\u201d In this case, at the latest, respondents knew of the \u201cerror\u201d as of December 4, 1991 (July 1, 1991 payroll period) \u2014 the date <em>Minutemen </em>was decided. However, if an individual THA can prove that it notified the respondents of the error prior to that date, the applicable commencement date may vary accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Relators lastly urge us to prohibit respondents\u2019 overpayment audits as unnecessary and time-consuming. Relators\u2019 request, however, ignores respondents\u2019 fiduciary duty to the State Insurance Fund. Included among respondents\u2019 responsibilities is a duty to ensure that disbursements \u2014 here, as refunds \u2014 are accurate. <em>Indus. Comm. v. Dell </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 389, 396-397, 135 N.E. 669, 672. Respondents\u2019 audits will help ensure accurate reimbursement, benefitting both the THAs and the State Insurance Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Relators have a clear legal right to reimbursement of premiums unlawfully assessed by respondents, with the two-year restriction of Ohio Adm.Code 4121-7-17(0) controlling. A writ of mandamus is accordingly granted to this extent only.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>Writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
