He also claims that due process was violated by the appellate court. We disagree with both assertions and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Claimant\u2019s due-process argument is apparently twofold \u2014 that he was denied the opportunity to seek summary judgment and that the appellate court erroneously disposed of the case on Civ.R. 12(B)(6) grounds. Both acts, claimant urges, deprived him of notice and an opportunity to be heard. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Claimant initially contends that the denial of his leave to file summary judgment eliminated his \u201cright to participate\u201d in summary judgment proceedings. Contrary to claimant\u2019s representation, however, he has no <em>right </em>to file a motion for summary judgment. Ohio Civ.R. 56 permits a motion for summary judgment \u201conly with leave of court\u201d if the case has been set for trial or pretrial, and not as a matter of course. Claimant, moreover, was not excluded from summary judgment participation. Claimant filed both a response to appellees\u2019 joint motion for summary judgment and objections to the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Claimant also opposes, on due-process grounds, the appellate court\u2019s decision to sustain appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, arguing that \u201c[t]he referee never authorized the dismissal motion nor gave actual notice to the relator so he could respond.\u201d This argument is unconvincing since a dismissal motion, unlike that for summary judgment, does not require leave of court. It is also unclear as to what notice claimant believes he was entitled to. Claimant responded to the summary judgment portion of appellees\u2019 \u201cJoint Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d so he knew that the dismissal motion was also awaiting disposition. Claimant could have opposed the 12(B)(6) motion when he challenged summary judgment, but chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We also affirm the appellate court\u2019s dismissal of claimant\u2019s action as being premature. At this point, claimant\u2019s ability to establish a <em>clear </em>legal right to relief is compromised by his inability to demonstrate any loss. In this case, the commission\u2019s reconsideration order effectively continued permanent-total-disability benefits pending a merit reconsideration of his application, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to <em>Noll, supra. </em>Since no deprivation has yet occurred, there is nothing from which claimant can seek relief. If the commission ultimately denies permanent-total-disability benefits, then a mandamus review of the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to reconsider may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
