That the Fourth Defense of respondent places at issue that \u201cThe Complaint is barred by the decision of the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s Office which is final pursuant to Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3501.11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">2. That R.C. 3501.11 reads, in part, that \u201c[i]n all cases of a tie vote or a disagreement in the board, if no decision can be arrived at, the director or chairman shall submit the matter in controversy to the secretary of state, who shall <em>summarily </em>decide the question <em>and his decision shall be final.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>3. That the respondent, pursuant to R.C. 3501.11 and its tie vote, did certify the question at issue to the Secretary of State for his determination and tie-breaking vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">4. That the Secretary of State, finding he had a personal conflict, did properly designate, pursuant to R.C. 111.04, his Assistant Secretary of State to cast the required tie-breaking vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">5. That the Assistant Secretary of State cast his vote and ruled that the rezoning issue in question should be placed on the election ballot and voted on at the election to be held on May 4, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">6. That, pursuant to R.C. 3501.11, the decision of the Secretary of State (or his designate) is final and not subject to. appeal. In addition, there is no showing by relators that the decision of the Secretary of State (or his designate) involved any fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or clear disregard of statutes or court determinations to warrant granting the extraordinary writs of mandamus and/or prohibition. See <em>State ex rel. Ruehlmann v. Luken </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 1, 598 N.E.2d 1149; <em>State ex rel. White v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 5, 598 N.E.2d 1152; and <em>State ex rel. White v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 45, 600 N.E.2d 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED by the court that the request of relators for writs of mandamus and/or prohibition be denied and that the cause herein is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-9\">A.W.

Today\u2019s decision conflicts with the entry issued by this court in this case on April 14, 1993. That judgment was a unanimous decision of this court. Now, for some reason, the terms of that judgment are being altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">R.C. 3501.11 makes the tie-breaking vote of the Secretary of State, in matters where a county board of elections is deadlocked, final. I would follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the law as set forth in R.C. 3501.11 and I continue to adhere to the position that I set forth in <em>State ex rel. Ruehlmann v. Luken </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 1, 598 N.E.2d 1149, <em>State ex rel. White v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 5, 598 N.E.2d 1152 (\u201c <em>White I\"), </em>and <em>State ex rel. White v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 45, 600 N.E.2d 656 <em>(\u201cWhite I\").</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
