Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. The present commission decision was based on a combination of medical and nonmedical factors \u2014 Dr. Baldoni\u2019s conclusion that claimant could do sedentary work, as well as claimant\u2019s youth and education. These factors provide \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the denial of permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Claimant\u2019s attack on Dr. Baldoni\u2019s report lacks merit. Claimant\u2019s contention that the report is deficient because it did not diseuss nonmedical factors ignores the language in <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 171, 31 OBR 369, 373, 509 N.E.2d 946, 950, which specifically instructed physicians to limit their opinions to medical impairment. Similarly, <em>State ex rel. Lawrence v. American Lubricants Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 533 N.E.2d 344, 346, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">\u201cThe court of appeals held that because Dr. Hutchison\u2019s report commented solely on impairment it was of no evidentiary value. * * * We disagree * * *. In <em>Stephenson, </em>we indicated that \u2018impairment,\u2019 not \u2018disability,\u2019 is the proper subject of medical reports. Therefore, it is inconsistent to .discard as nonprobative reports that confine themselves to a discussion of impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Claimant\u2019s citation to contrary evidence of record ignores our consistent refusal to reweigh evidence. <em>Burley, supra, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 20-21, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E.2d at 938. The commission is solely responsible for evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>Id.; State ex rel. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v.

Having found the commission\u2019s decision to be supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d we reject claimant\u2019s challenge going to the evidence before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Accordingly, the writ of mandamus is denied..</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
