The third paragraph of the opinion, found at 66 Ohio St.3d 37-38, 607 N.E.2d 829, 830, is amended to read as follows for the bound volume of Ohio St.3d: In 1989, Marcella Dennis contacted Morgan about a contract dispute involving a recently purchased house. Morgan assigned the case to his associate. Dennis eventually lost patience with the associate\u2019s handling of her case and contacted Morgan, who informed her that the associate had left the firm. Morgan apologized and pledged to take personal charge of the case. Morgan stipulates that he did not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>supervise the associate\u2019s work. In May 1990, Dennis brought Morgan a second case, this one over a cemetery\u2019s refusal to honor a contract to bury Dennis\u2019 sister. Dennis gave Morgan two contracts between her and the cemetery. Morgan did no work on either of Dennis\u2019 cases, did not return her calls, and failed to return her contracts.</p>\n<judges id=\"Ae3R\">A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E.
