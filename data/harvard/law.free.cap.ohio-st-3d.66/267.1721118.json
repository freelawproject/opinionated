The emphasized language underlies appellant\u2019s claim that <em>res judicata </em>bars all future temporary total disability compensation. <em>Res judicata\u2019s </em>application to workers\u2019 compensation cases, however, is limited. <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 569 N.E.2d 496; <em>State ex rel. Cramer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 135, 29 O.O. 176, 57 N.E.2d 233. This court observed in <em>B.O.C.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u201c \u2018It is almost too obvious for comment that res judicata does not apply if the issue is claimant\u2019s physical condition or degree of disability at two entirely different times * * *. A moment\u2019s reflection would reveal that otherwise there would be no such thing as reopening for change in condition. The same would be true of any situation in which the facts are altered by a change in the time frame * * V\u201d <em>Id., </em>58 Ohio St 3d at 201, 569 N.E.2d at 498, quoting 3 Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1989), Section 79.72(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">The reference to \u201creopening for change\u201d equates to the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.52. That statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cThe jurisdiction of the industrial commission over each case shall be continuing, and the commission may make such modification or change with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto, as, in its opinion is justified. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Continuing jurisdiction\u2019s applicability to a change in condition was recently discussed in <em>State ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177. Rejecting an assertion that a finding of permanency precluded all future temporary total disability compensation, this court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201cIn enacting this statute [R.C. 4123.52], the General Assembly recognized that an employee, because of an injury or series of injuries suffered in the course of employment, may find herself, more than once in her lifetime, temporarily unable to work. Under R.C. 4123.52, the commission is vested with continuing jurisdiction to revisit a case and make later awards of temporary total disability compensation where circumstances warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426, 575 N.E.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We find that the circumstances justify further consideration here. Claimant returned to work on October 27,1987. He visited the plant physician later that day complaining of pain and spasm \u2014 the result of an apparent flare-up of his condition. Moreover, it was <em>appellant\u2019s </em>physician who \u201crelapsed [claimant] to disability\u201d and sent claimant home from work because of his back pain on October 27, 1987. This directive prompted claimant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Accordingly, we find that the commission\u2019s exercise of continuing jurisdiction was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Turning then to the evidentiary review mandated by <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, this court finds that the commission\u2019s decision is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d namely, Dr. Speelman\u2019s report. Contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, consideration of the report is not barred by <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, which directs that evidence that the commission has earlier rejected cannot be revived in support of a later decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In this case, we agree with the court below that Dr. Speelman\u2019s February 12, 1988 report was not implicitly rejected by the regional board, and thus the commission, in affirming the original termination of temporary total disability compensation. Dr. Speelman\u2019s report notes claimant\u2019s unsuccessful subsequent attempt to return to work, and is not, therefore, inconsistent with the commission\u2019s earlier action.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>A.W.
