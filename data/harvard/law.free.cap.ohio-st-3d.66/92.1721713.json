It also explained how the commission reached that conclusion; In this case, the commission found that claimant\u2019s age and education aided his retraining for an occupation consistent with his physical abilities. The order, therefore, satisfies <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Despite his assertions to the contrary, claimant\u2019s assault on the commission\u2019s order deals far more with the commission\u2019s interpretation of the nonmedical factors \u2014 particularly claimant\u2019s education \u2014 than to the order\u2019s form or content. Claimant\u2019s position, however, contradicts the commission\u2019s role as exclusive evaluator of both disability, <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 172-173, 31 OBR 369, 374, 509 N.E.2d 946, 951, and evidentiary weight, <em>Burley, supra, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 20-21, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E.2d at 938. The commission\u2019s present order indicates consideration of nonmedical evidence. The commission and claimant simply differed on the impact of claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The commission exercised its prerogative in concluding that, at age fifty-one, claimant was young, not old, and that his age was a help, not a hinderance. So, too, is the conclusion with regard to claimant\u2019s education, which also derives support from the record. More so than claimant\u2019s age, his education can be interpreted as either an asset or a liability. While his grade school level of spelling and below-average reading ability clearly can be perceived negatively, the same rehabilitation report that determined these academic skills to be a limitation nonetheless concluded that his high school education was an asset. The commission was persuaded by the latter conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Claimant strongly suggests that the commission was bound by another report from the commission\u2019s rehabilitation division that concluded that claimant was unemployable. This claim fails. Specialized vocational or rehabilitation reports are not accorded greater weight than other evidence. See <em>State ex rel. Speelman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 757, 598 N.E.2d 192. To bind the commission to a rehabilitation report\u2019s conclusion makes the rehabilitation division, not the commission, the ultimate evaluator of disability, contrary to <em>Stephenson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">For the reasons given above, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W- Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b218-10\">Resnick, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
