We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court upholding SERB\u2019S order that appellee board of education offer appellant reinstatement and award him back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">In <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 259-261, 533 N.E.2d 264, 266-267, this court explained that different standards of review are to be applied by a common pleas court and by a court of appeals when reviewing an order of SERB in a ULP case. When a common pleas court reviews a SERB order, the court must determine whether the order is supported by substantial evidence in the record. This standard of review for a common pleas court is supplied by R.C. 4117.13(D), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>provides that \u201c[t]he findings of the board [SERB] as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, on the record as a whole, are conclusive.\u201d See <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>at 259, 533 N.E.2d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">An appellate court, on the other hand, plays a more limited role than a trial court in reviewing the same SERB order. The role of the appellate court is to determine whether the trial court has abused its discretion. The appellate court must affirm the judgment of the trial court if no abuse of discretion occurred. <em>Id., </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 260-261, 533 N.E.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The trial court in this case reviewed SERB\u2019S order and determined that substantial evidence in the record supported SERB\u2019S conclusion that the board of education committed a ULP. The court of appeals, in reversing the judgment of the trial court, held that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling as it did. We thus examine the decision of the court of appeals, to determine if that court was correct in holding that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The court of appeals based its decision that the trial court abused its discretion on the trial court\u2019s failure to remand the cause to SERB upon determining that SERB had ruled improperly that the allegations of the complaint were to be deemed admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We recognize that the trial court could have remanded the cause to SERB, to allow SERB to consider the facts surrounding the allegations improperly deemed admitted. The initial question we address is whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to remand the cause to SERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The court of appeals held that the trial court had a duty to remand this cause to SERB, and that the failure to remand constituted an abuse of discretion. It appears that the court of appeals believed that when the trial court conducted its own review of the evidence not considered by SERB, the trial court usurped SERB\u2019S role as the finder of fact in ULP cases. However, even though we may agree that the trial court should have remanded the cause to SERB, it must be remembered that a court of appeals must affirm a trial court decision on a SERB order in a ULP case unless the trial court abused its discretion. \u201cAn abuse of discretion \u2018 \u201c \u2018 * * * implies not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>moral delinquency.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 261, 533 N.E.2d at 267, quoting <em>State ex rel. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc. v. Lancaster </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 191, 193, 22 OBR 275, 277, 489 N.E.2d 288, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion by not remanding this cause to SERB for further findings of fact. A thorough examination of the record in this case reveals that the board of education encouraged the trial court to conduct its own consideration of the evidence not considered by SERB. The board of education requested that the trial court use evidence not considered by SERB to find that the decision to nonrenew appellant was not retaliatory. Specifically, the board of education urged the trial court \u201cto reject SERB\u2019S jaundiced \u2018in part\u2019 standard of proof and find that the Board of Education has rebutted Kelley\u2019s prima facie case of discrimination and that SERB\u2019S Opinion and Order should be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In considering the evidence which SERB had refused to consider, the trial court did as the board of education desired. However, the trial court found circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent in the record, and upheld SERB\u2019S finding that a ULP had been committed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find it incongruous that the board of education should encourage the trial court to examine the evidence, and then benefit from a ruling by the court of appeals that the trial court abused its discretion when it examined the evidence. We hold that the trial court, in the circumstances of this case, did not abuse its discretion when it did not remand the cause to SERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Our inquiry does not stop there. We also consider whether the trial court abused its discretion when it found substantial evidence in the record to support the determination that a ULP occurred. It is apparent that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard. The trial court recognized that the good evaluations given to appellant, as well as Principal Grooms\u2019s recommendation that appellant be given a continuing contract, were substantial circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory motive behind the decision to nonrenew appellant. These factors, considered along with appellant\u2019s improvement in setting work schedules and adhering to them (a finding we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>accept as factually established based on our discussion in Part IA of this opinion), clearly constitute substantial evidence to support the determination that a ULP occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The trial court in this case, after examining the evidence, determined that the board of education\u2019s decision to nonrenew appellant was motivated both by legitimate and illegitimate reasons. The trial court then applied what was SERB\u2019s approach at that time in \u201cmixed motive\u201d cases, the \u201cin part\u201d test adopted in <em>In re Gallia, supra. </em>Because the employer\u2019s action was motivated at least in part by a desire to retaliate for the participation in a protected activity (filing a grievance), the trial court found that a ULP had occurred, and upheld SERB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Upon appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in applying the \u201cin part\u201d test, because that test cannot reasonably be reconciled with R.C. Chapter 4117. In ordering this cause remanded to SERB, the court of appeals noted that SERB has announced that it will now apply the so-called \u201cbut for\u201d test, which has been applied by the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) since 1980. See <em>In re Ft. Frye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(July 17, 1991), SERB No. 91-005. The court of appeals determined that the \u201cin part\u201d test can lead to absurd results, because a ULP can be found under that test when an employer\u2019s actions are motivated mainly by legitimate reasons, and only in small part by discriminatory ones. Thus, the appellate court found that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is mandated by R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We do not accept the conclusions drawn by the court of appeals. We therefore examine the \u201cin part\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d causation tests in light of R.C. Chapter 4117. We seek to determine which test, if either, comports with the goals of the General Assembly when it enacted those statutes, particularly R.C. 4117.11 (which defines ULPs) and R.C. 4117.12 (which guides SERB in its disposition of ULP charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The motivation behind an employer\u2019s decision to take an action regarding an employee is the central question that must be resolved in a ULP case. R.C. Chapter 4117 makes it SERB\u2019s responsibility to evaluate the factual situation surrounding a ULP charge, and to determine whether a ULP has in fact occurred. Determining the motivation. underlying an employer\u2019s decision almost always presents difficulties which are not easily overcome. Motivation is rarely clear. An employer charged with a ULP will almost always claim that the particular action was taken for sound business reasons, totally unrelated to the employee\u2019s participation in protected activities. The employee will almost always claim that the action was taken to retaliate for his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>her exercise of protected rights. Since evidence of the employer\u2019s motivation is rarely direct, SERB must rely on a good deal of circumstantial evidence in arriving at its conclusion. To facilitate consideration of ULP cases, administrative agencies <em>{e.g., </em>SERB and the NLRB) utilize causation tests to provide some uniformity in evaluating ULP charges and to give a reviewing court a framework for determining if substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s decision. The \u201cin part\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d approaches are two examples of such causation tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">R.C. Chapter 4117\u2019s treatment of ULP cases is modeled to a large extent on the federal statutes that empower the NLRB to resolve ULP charges in cases within its jurisdiction. Larson, Ashmus, Bumpass &amp; Ward, Public Sector Collective Bargaining: The Ohio System (1984) 100. Thus, consideration of the NLRB\u2019s experience in applying the \u201cin part\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d tests can be instructive in resolving which test, if either, best accomplishes the goals embodied in Ohio\u2019s statutes regarding ULPs.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Between the 1930s and 1980, the NLRB, when evaluating ULP charges, applied the \u201cin part\u201d test. The NLRB construed the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), Section 151 <em>et seq., </em>Title 29, U.S.Code, to provide that a ULP has occurred when the NLRB finds that an employer\u2019s action was taken at least in part to discriminate against an employee for engaging in protected activities, regardless of other reasons for the action. See, <em>e.g., Consumers\u2019 Research, Inc. </em>(1936), 2 N.L.R.B. 57, 73 (if antiunion animus plays any part in a discharge decision, a violation of the NLRA occurs); <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>(1939), 13 N.L.R.B. 993, 1023, enforced in relevant part (C.A.6, 1941), 117 F.2d 455 (a violation occurs if the employer acts out of antiunion bias \u201cwhether or not the [employer] may have had some other motive in addition to that of repressing [protected activity] and without regard to whether or not the [employer\u2019s] asserted motive was lawful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In 1980, in <em>Wright Line, Div. of Wright Line, Inc. </em>(1980), 251 N.L.R.B. 1083, enforced (C.A.1, 1981), 662 F.2d 899, certiorari denied (1982), 455 U.S. 989, 102 S.Ct. 1612, 71 L.Ed.2d 848, the NLRB changed the analysis it applied in resolving ULP cases. In <em>Wright Line, </em>the NLRB adopted a causation test commonly called the \u201cbut for\u201d test, in an attempt to alleviate dissatisfaction over the \u201cin part\u201d test expressed by several federal courts of appeals. <em>Id., </em>251 N.L.R.B. at 1083.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In <em>Wright Line, </em>251 N.L.R.B. at 1089, the NLRB set forth the following test to evaluate employer motivation in ULP cases: \u201cFirst, we shall require that the General Counsel [of the NLRB] make a <em>prima facie </em>showing sufficient to support the inference that protected conduct was a \u2018motivating factor\u2019 in the employer\u2019s decision. Once this is established, the burden will shift to the employer to demonstrate that the same action would have taken place even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The <em>Wright Line </em>test allows the employer to present its alleged legitimate reasons for its actions as an affirmative defense. This causation test is commonly called the \u201cbut for\u201d test because it establishes that a ULP has occurred when the evidence shows that \u201cbut for\u201d the exercise of protected activity, the employer\u2019s action <em>(e.g., </em>a discharge) regarding the employee would not have been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The <em>Wright Line </em>test was not uniformly embraced by the federal courts of appeals. See Comment, <em>Transportation Management: </em>The Validation of <em>Wright Line </em>(1984), 2 Hofstra Labor L.J. 185, 193-194. However, in <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. Transp. Mgt. Corp. </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 393, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667, the United States Supreme Court held that the NLRB\u2019s <em>Wright Line </em>test was a permissible construction of the NLRA, and was entitled to deference. The court also found that the \u201cin part\u201d test applied before <em>Wright Line </em>\u201cwas plainly rational and acceptable.\u201d <em>Transp. Mgt., </em>462 U.S. at 399, 103 S.Ct. at 2473, 76 L.Ed.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">As we have said, the ULP provisions of Ohio\u2019s R.C. Chapter 4117 are modeled in many respects upon the NLRA. Since the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 4117 to be effective in 1984, we may safely assume that that body was aware of the controversy in the federal courts concerning the NLRB\u2019s application of the \u201cin part\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d tests, and of <em>Wright Line </em>and <em>Transp. Mgt. </em>Both appellant and the board of education in this case argue that the General Assembly intended to codify a causation test in R.C. Chapter 4117, although they of course disagree as to which test was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>A ULP occurs when an employer takes an action regarding an employee that is motivated by antiunion animus. See R.C. 4117.12(A) and 4117.11(A). R.C. 4117.12(B) details the procedure SERB is to follow in taking evidence, and in evaluating that evidence, to determine if a party has engaged in a ULP. R.C. 4117.12(B)(3) requires SERB to decide, based upon the preponderance of the evidence, whether the charged party has engaged in a ULP, and to act on its determination by issuing an order. The order to be issued by SERB is further explained in R.C. 4117.12(B)(4). That statute specifically provides: \u201cNo order of the board [SERB] shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or require the payment to him of any back pay, if the suspension or discharge was for just cause not related to rights provided in section 4117.03 of the Revised Code * *</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellant reads R.C. Chapter 4117, and particularly R.C. 4117.12(B)(4), as requiring the \u201cin part\u201d test to determine causation in ULP cases. The board of education urges that R.C. Chapter 4117 mandates the <em>Wright Line </em>\u201cbut for\u201d method of analysis. The trial court in this case found that appellant\u2019s interpretation was correct. The court of appeals, in reversing the trial court, held that the \u201cin part\u201d test is not a reasonable interpretation. Furthermore, SERB, in <em>Ft. Frye, supra, </em>has abandoned the \u201cin part\u201d test in favor of the \u201cbut for\u201d test. In <em>Ft. Frye, </em>SERB specifically cited the trial court\u2019s opinion in this case, and disagreed with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117. Thus, both the court of appeals in this case and-SERB in <em>Ft. Frye </em>have found that the <em>Wright Line </em>approach is the correct test to determine employer motivation in ULP cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Initially, we cannot agree with the court of appeals that the \u201cin part\u201d test is not a reasonable interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117. The \u201cin part\u201d test, because it focuses on the employer\u2019s motivation and requires a finding that a ULP has been committed when it is established that the motivation is improper, obviously comports with R.C. Chapter 4117. Clearly, when a preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that an employer acted at least in part to discriminate against an employee for the exercise of protected rights, SERB\u2019S finding of a ULP is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We also do not agree with the court of appeals that R.C. Chapter 4117, and in particular R.C. 4117.12(B)(4), call for the \u201cbut for\u201d test. In our view, the <em>Wright Line </em>\u201cbut for\u201d method cannot be reconciled with R.C. Chapter 4117. Allowing the employer to present, as an affirmative defense, all the alleged legitimate reasons supporting the action against the employee turns the focus of the inquiry away from the employer\u2019s motivation. The inquiry instead then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>becomes focused on the employee\u2019s work record, and SERB\u2019S factual consideration becomes subsumed by both the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s evidence on that question. Even though SERB has necessarily already concluded that the employer was motivated by improper reasons before the employer needs to present this evidence, the employer\u2019s improper motivation is sanctioned so long as the employer can convince the factfinder to accept its view of the employee\u2019s work history.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Contrary to the assertions of the board of education, R.C. 4117.12(B)(4) does not authorize the \u201cbut for\u201d test. That statute provides that SERB may not order the reinstatement of any individual \u201cif the suspension or discharge was for just cause not related to rights provided in section 4117.03 of the Revised Code * * *.\u201d We find that this statute, by limiting SERB\u2019S order when the employer\u2019s action was \u201cnot related to\u201d protected rights, further emphasizes that a ULP must be found when an employer\u2019s motivation is improper. The \u201cbut for\u201d test, because it turns the inquiry away from the employer\u2019s motivation, is not a reasonable interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Even though we have found the \u201cbut for\u201d approach to be inconsistent with R.C. Chapter 4117, we also find that, unless the employer is given an opportunity to counter the evidence presented by the employee, the \u201cin part\u201d approach will not be the most accurate test. When, for example, it is determined that antiunion animus played a minuscule part in the employer\u2019s decision regarding an employee, a literal application of the \u201cin part\u201d test would appear to mandate a finding that the employer committed a ULP. We find that R.C. Chapter 4117 does not require SERB to conclude that a ULP occurred in that circumstance. The \u201cin part\u201d test must not be applied so narrowly. Rather, the \u201cin part\u201d approach must be broad enough to take into account the actual or true motive of the employer. Thus, only when the employer\u2019s decision regarding the employee was actually motivated by anti-union animus must a ULP be found. In determining actual motivation in the context of the \u201cin part\u201d test, the requirements of R.C. Chapter 4117 are best fulfilled when SERB considers the evidence before it in the framework of a single inquiry, focusing on intent of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Hence, we hold that the \u201cin part\u201d test to determine the motivation of an employer charged with a ULP is mandated by R.C. Chapter 4117. We further hold that under the \u201cin part\u201d test to determine the actual motivation of an employer charged with a ULP, the proponent of the charge has the initial burden of showing that the action by the employer was taken to discriminate against the employee for the exercise of rights protected by R.C. Chapter 4117. Where the proponent meets this burden, a prima facie case is created which raises a presumption of antiunion animus. The employer is then given an opportunity to present evidence that its actions were the result of other conduct by the employee not related to protected activity, to rebut the presumption. SERB then determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether a ULP has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">When the \u201cin part\u201d test is properly applied it results in a determination of the actual motive of the employer in taking the action. This approach allows SERB to consider the employee\u2019s work history, but only as circumstantial evidence of the employer\u2019s motivation, and not as a separate inquiry characterized as an affirmative defense. Thus, application of the \u201cin part\u201d test in this manner allows SERB, in resolving ULP charges, to focus on the important inquiry \u2014 the motivation of the employer. The problems associated with the \u201cbut for\u201d test and its burden-shifting, wrongly focused, bifurcated inquiry are avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We realize that recognizing actual motivation to be a component of the \u201cin part\u201d test will not necessarily make SERB\u2019S task in determining employer motivation an easy one. SERB must still evaluate the evidence presented to determine if antiunion animus actually motivated the employer to take the action against the employee. However, we are confident that this causation analysis will allow SERB to comport more closely with the requirements of R.C. Chapter 4117 in resolving ULP cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In applying the preceding discussion to the facts of this case, we find that the trial court did not err in applying the \u201cin part\u201d test to determine causation. At the time the trial court rendered its judgment, the \u201cin part\u201d test of <em>In re Gallia </em>was the approach applied by SERB to resolve ULP cases. As explained above, that approach was a reasonable interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Based on our discussion in Part I of this opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant\u2019s nonrenewal was motivated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>antiunion animus. Based on our discussion in Part II of this opinion, we hold that the trial court correctly applied the law to its finding to reach an appropriate conclusion. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b624-5\">A.W.

Because no appeal was taken from the trial court\u2019s determination that SERB erred in ruling that the allegations of the complaint were to be deemed admitted, we must assume that the trial court ruled correctly, and that the allegations of the complaint should not have been deemed admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">. It is significant that SERB\u2019S record contained other circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motivation in addition to those factual allegations of the complaint which were deemed admitted. The trial court did not conduct a new consideration of all factual material, only of that which it found SERB should have considered but did not. This was not a situation in which the trial court made factual findings based totally on evidence never considered by SERB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\">. The NLRB in <em>Wright Line </em>borrowed the causation test from the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mt. Healthy City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Doyle </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471, in which an employee asserted that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>discharge was motivated by a desire to retaliate against him for his exercise of First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court in <em>ML Healthy </em>held that the plaintiff first had to show that the employer\u2019s dissatisfaction with the plaintiff\u2019s exercise of First Amendment protected activity played some role in the employer\u2019s decision to discharge him. Once that showing was established, the burden then was on the employer to show that the discharge would have occurred even if no motive to punish the plaintiff for his First Amendment activity had been present. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576, 50 L.Ed.2d at 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">.

The board of education argues that that case, which involved application of R.C. Chapter 4112 to a discrimination case, compels application of the \u201cbut for\u201d test in the present case.

While I am able to join Parts I, 11(A), 11(C), and III of the majority opinion, I cannot join Part 11(B) or the syllabus. There is simply no support in R.C. Chapter 4117 for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the chapter \u201cmandate[s]\u201d the use of the \u201cin part\u201d test. Moreover, the majority deviates from this court\u2019s precedent and the scheme of R.C. Chapter 4117 by substituting its judgment for SERB\u2019S.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act, codified in R.C. Chapter 4117, creates \u201ca comprehensive framework for the resolution of public-sector labor disputes by creating a series of new rights and setting forth specific procedures and remedies for the vindication of those rights.\u201d <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 167, 169, 572 N.E.2d 87, 90. The linchpin in this framework is SERB, the entity in which primary authority for the administration of this system of rights and remedies is vested. This court\u2019s precedent holds that in the adjudication of unfair labor practice (\u201cULP\u201d) charges, SERB\u2019S interpretation of the Act is to be given broad deference by the courts. See <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 533 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">\u201cIt was clearly the intention of the General Assembly to vest SERB with broad authority to administer and enforce R.C. Chapter 4117. * * * This authority must necessarily include the power to interpret the Act to achieve its purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 533 N.E.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Thus, in reviewing a SERB decision in a ULP case, the courts \u201cmust accord due deference to SERB\u2019S interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If courts could interpret R.C. Chapter 4117 without regard to SERB\u2019S construction, the General Assembly\u2019s creation of \u201ca specialized administrative agency * * * to make determinations\u201d would have been pointless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>This court\u2019s decision in <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>mirrors the approach that has been taken by the federal courts. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests\u201d presented in labor cases. <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. Truck Drivers Local Union No. 449, Internatl. Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of Am., A.F.L. </em>(1957), 353 U.S. 87, 96, 77 S.Ct. 643, 648, 1 L.Ed.2d 676, 682. The court wrote that \u201c[t]he function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. Erie Resistor Corp. </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 221, 236, 83 S.Ct. 1139, 1150, 10 L.Ed.2d 308, 319 (\u201cwe must recognize the Board\u2019s special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities of industrial life\u201d); <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. J. Weingarten, Inc. </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 251, 266, 95 S.Ct. 959, 968, 43 L.Ed.2d 171, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Thus, when SERB construes the Act in a <em>permissible </em>fashion, the courts should not interfere. It is only when the agency makes a decision that is without support under the law that we may impose our construction of the statute. See, <em>e.g., Ohio Historical Soc. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 466, 613 N.E.2d 591 (SERB\u2019S ruling that historical society is a public employer was without support in the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The majority admirably sets forth the terms of the debate over the \u201cin part\u201d and the \u201cbut for\u201d tests. In my view, however, its discussion of the law leads inexorably to the conclusion that <em>both </em>tests are permissible under R.C. Chapter 4117 and <em>neither </em>is \u201cmandated.\u201d It is precisely on this point that the majority errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Prior to 1991, SERB used the \u201cin part\u201d test in mixed motive cases. In <em>In re Gallia-Jackson-Vinton Joint Vocational School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Nov. 13, 1986), SERB No. 86-044, SERB adopted the \u201cin part\u201d test and expressly declined to follow the \u201cbut for\u201d test. On two subsequent occasions SERB expressly declined to abandon the \u201cin part\u201d test. See <em>In re Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(Oct. 8, 1987), SERB No. 87-020; <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. v. Adena Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(Dec. 29, 1989), SERB No. 89-034. For many of the reasons enunciated in the majority opinion, I believe that this test is permissible under R.C. Chapter 4117 in mixed motive cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In 1991, however (after this case had been decided by SERB, appealed to and decided by the common pleas court, and appealed to the court of appeals), SERB changed its position and expressly adopted the \u201cbut for\u201d test of <em>Wright Line, Div. of Wright Line, Inc. </em>(1980), 251 N.L.R.B. 1083. <em>In re Ft. Frye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(July 17, 1991), SERB No. 91-005. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>explained, \u201cthe time has come for SERB to change its initial \u2018in part\u2019 test to the more balanced, more mature and more reasonable \u2018but for\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>SERB now feels, as many state labor boards do, \u201cthat the existence of discrimination on the basis of protected rights is most accurately determined by asking whether the disciplinary act would have occurred but for the protected activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It has decided that labor and management interests are most effectively balanced by using the \u201cbut for\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>SERB\u2019S written opinion in <em>Ft. Frye, supra, </em>persuades me that the \u201cbut for\u201d test is also permissible under R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In <em>Natl. Labor Relations Bd. v. Transp. Mgt. Corp. </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 393, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667, the United States Supreme Court considered whether the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s use of the <em>Wright Line </em>\u201cbut for\u201d test was proper under the National Labor Relations Act. The court deferred to the board; it held that the <em>Wright Line </em>test would not be disturbed because it is not \u201can impermissible construction of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 103 S.Ct. at 2475, 76 L.Ed.2d at 676. This court should now adopt the same position with regard to both the \u201cin part\u201d and the \u201cbut for\u201d tests as used by SERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">R.C. Chapter 4117 neither mandates nor prohibits the use of either the \u201cin part\u201d or the \u201cbut for\u201d tests. The Act is worded broadly enough to easily accommodate both approaches and I believe that this is just what the General Assembly intended. The majority, in fact, does not hold that the language of the Act leads to the conclusion it reaches.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The majority, instead, treats its decision as a labor policy choice \u2014 a political choice. And, of course, it is. The majority has made the essentially political decision that \u201cthe requirements of R.C. Chapter 4117 are <em>best fulfilled </em>\u201d when SERB uses the \u201cin part\u201d test. (Emphasis added.) But the judgment as to what \u201cbest. fulfill[s]\u201d the requirements of the Act has been vested by the General Assembly in SERB \u2014 not this court. Our inquiry in ULP cases should begin, and end, with the question of whether what SERB did was <em>permissible </em>\u2014 not whether it was \u201cbest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Moreover, there are serious questions in my mind as to whether SERB will be able to apply the test promulgated by the majority. The test amounts to the \u201cin part\u201d test with a caveat: the antiunion animus must be more than a \u201cminuscule part\u201d of the employer\u2019s motivation. The majority writes that \u201conly when the employer\u2019s decision regarding the employee was <em>actually motivated </em>by antiunion animus must a ULP be found.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This sounds to me as much like the \u201cbut for\u201d test as the \u201cin part\u201d test. Under the \u201cbut for\u201d test a ULP occurs if the employee would not have been disciplined but for his or her protected activities. Under the majority\u2019s test, SERB is charged with finding whether the employer was \u201cactually motivated\u201d by the employee\u2019s exercise of protected activities. These two inquiries seem much the same to me and my concern is that SERB will be as confused as I am and will not be able to effectively apply the majority\u2019s test. Of course, this problem would not arise if SERB, instead of this court, was allowed to formulate and follow its own permissible tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">This case was decided by the common pleas court when SERB was using the <em>Gallia-Jackson </em>\u201cin part\u201d test. That court appropriately deferred to the SERB test and found a ULP. The court of appeals, however, erred by substituting its judgment for SERB\u2019S and mandating the \u201cbut for\u201d test. Although it reaches a different conclusion, a majority of this court now commits the same sort of error \u2014 it substitutes its judgment for SERB\u2019S in order to obtain the political result it desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Both precedent and sound judicial policy require that we consistently show deference to SERB\u2019S handling of ULP cases. We have held that SERB, a \u201cspecialized administrative agency\u201d with \u201cconsiderable expertise in labor-management relations,\u201d is entitled to deference. <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn., supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 260, 533 N.E.2d at 267. Yet the majority seems willing to extend this deference to SERB only if SERB reaches the conclusion the majority would have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">I express no opinion as to which of the two tests I prefer or believe to \u201cbest fulfill\u201d the goals of the Act. I would merely hold that both the \u201cin part\u201d and \u201cbut for\u201d tests are permissible under R.C. Chapter 4117 and that the court of appeals erred by mandating the \u201cbut for\u201d test.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-9\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. The majority begins Part 11(B) of its opinion by observing that in 1984, when the Act was passed, the General Assembly must have been aware of the debate over the test to be used in mixed-motive cases. It also correctly states that by 1984 the National Labor Relations Board was firmly committed to the <em>Wright Line </em>\u201cbut for\u201d test and that the use of this test had been sanctioned by the United States Supreme Court. Contrary to the majority\u2019s implication, I would guess that, given the state of the law at the time, if the General Assembly had considered which test would be used in mixed-motive cases, it would have believed that SERB would adopt the \u201cbut for\u201d test. But, as I have stated, the language of the Act is broad enough to tolerate both tests and that, I believe, is exactly what the legislature intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
