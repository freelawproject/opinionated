We answer in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The court of appeals held that appellant had not \u201cpresented] any proper purpose justifying disclosure pursuant to law.\u201d The idea that a proper purpose is required to obtain a public record derives from our decision in the <em>Wooster Republican </em>case, <em>supra. </em>In that case, we devised a test to balance the requirements of the Privacy Act, R.C. Chapter 1347, with the disclosure requirements of the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, as then in force. The test had three elements. One element was the \u201cextent or value of the public interest, purpose or object of the individuals seeking disclosure[.]\u201d 56 Ohio St.2d at 135, 10 O.O.3d at 317, 383 N.E.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">However, following the announcement of the <em>Wooster Republican </em>decision, the General Assembly did its own balancing. It enacted Am.Sub. S.B. No. 62 of the 113th General Assembly, 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 245, in which it added language to both the Privacy and Public Records Acts, in the words of the bill\u2019s title, \u201cto make clear that Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not affect section 149.43 of the Revised Code[.]\u201d The legislative intent was most clearly reflected in permanent law by the language of what is now R.C. 149.43(D):</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u201cChapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the provisions of this section.\u201d 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The phrase \u201cdoes not limit\u201d leaves no room for judicial balancing. Therefore, we conclude that enactment of Am.Sub. S.B. No. 62 of the 113th General Assembly effectively overruled the balancing test announced in <em>Wooster Republican. </em>Since that test is invalid, the court of appeals erred by basing its decision on an element of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The demise of the <em>Wooster Republican </em>balancing test precludes the idea that the purpose of a person in requesting public records has any bearing on his or her right to inspect and copy them. R.C. 149.43(B) states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u201cAll public records shall be promptly prepared and made available for inspection to <em>any person </em>at all reasonable times during regular business hours. Upon request, a person responsible for public records shall make copies available at cost, within a reasonable period of time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201cAny person\u201d means any person, regardless of purpose. <em>State ex rel. Clark v. Toledo </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 55, 57, 560 N.E.2d 1313, 1314. See, also, 1990 Ohio Atty. Gen. Ops. No. 90-050, at 2-210. Therefore, a person seeking public records is not required to establish a proper purpose or any purpose; rather, \u201c[a] governmental body refusing to release records has the burden of proving that the records are excepted from disclosure by R.C. 149.43.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 79, 526 N.E.2d 786, paragraph two of the syllabus. So holding, we harmonize Ohio law with the federal and most state freedom-of-information Acts. See Annotation, Who Has Standing to Seek Access to Agency Information Under Freedom of Information Act (1987), 82 A.L.R. Fed. 248, 259, Section 3; 2 Braverman <em>&amp; </em>Chetwynd, Information Law (1985 and 1990 Supp.) 905, Section 24-3.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We must emphasize that we have previously recognized that not all items in a personnel file may be considered public records. A \u201cpublic record\u201d is \u201cany record that is kept by any public office * * *.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). However, a \u201crecord\u201d is something that is \u201ccreated or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office * * * which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d R.C. 149.011(G). To the extent that any item contained in a personnel file is not a \u201crecord,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>does not serve to document the organization, etc., of the public office, it is not a public record and need not be disclosed. To the extent that an item is not a public record and is \u201cpersonal information,\u201d as defined in R.C. 1347.01(E),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a public office \u201cwould be under an affirmative duty, pursuant to R.C. 1347.05(G), to prevent its disclosure.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>State ex rel.
