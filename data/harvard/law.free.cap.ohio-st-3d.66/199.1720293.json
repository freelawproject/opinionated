First, Canon 3(A)(6) permits public judicial comment to explain court procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s defense of his sentencing order, while less than judicious, was provided to publicly explain his procedure in the underlying criminal case. Thus, we cannot discipline respondent for conduct the canon expressly authorizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Second, neither respondent\u2019s attempt to defend his order nor his articulated reluctance to comply with the court of appeals\u2019 ruling is sufficiently pernicious to .justify any disciplinary sanction. Respondent\u2019s disagreement with the court of appeals\u2019 disposition was already suggested from each court\u2019s judgment. Moreover, respondent ultimately did file a second sentencing order as the court of appeals instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Gov.Bar R. V(8)(D) requires us to enter the order we find proper in all disciplinary matters that come before us. In this case, we consider a dismissal of the complaint against respondent the only just result. Thus, we take no disciplinary action and dismiss the instant complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A.W.

Canon 3(A)(6) states, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">\u201cA judge should abstain from public comment about a pending or impending proceeding in any court, and should require similar abstention on the part of court personnel subject to his direction and control. <em>This subsection does not prohibit judges </em>from making public statements in the course of their official duties or <em>from explaining for public information the procedures of the court.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b325-5\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7m\">concurring. I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint against respondent. In finding that respondent violated Canon 3(A)(6), the board crossed the bright line marking respondent\u2019s First Amendment right to speak freely.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
