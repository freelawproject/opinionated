This proposition has merit. \u201cThe conduct of a prosecuting attorney during trial cannot be made a ground of error unless the conduct deprives defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24, 514 N.E.2d 394, 400. Thus, although we have \u201cexpress[ed] our mounting alarm over the increasing incidence of misconduct * * * in capital cases,\u201d we have not treated prosecutorial misconduct as reversible error \u201cexcept in rare instances.\u201d <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 288, 528 N.E.2d 542, 556. This case presents an aggravated example of such misconduct. Here, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s pattern of misconduct throughout much of the trial and during closing argument did deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL OPINIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The prosecutor argued to the jury during the guilt phase that defense counsel\u2019s conduct of the case showed that they were \u201cnot looking at this objectively. They are paid to do that. They are paid to get him off the hook.\u201d A defense objection was overruled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our view, this comment imputed insincerity to defense counsel, thus suggesting that they believed Keenan guilty. It was therefore improper. Balske, Prosecutorial Misconduct During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Closing Argument (1986), 37 Mercer L.Rev. 1033, 1055-1056; Gershman, Prosecutorial Misconduct (1985) 10-29, Section 10.4(b). Such comment is forbidden because it is both irrelevant and prejudicial. The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument insinuated even more strongly that defense counsel thought Keenan guilty: \u201cNot once did they tell you their client was innocent. Not once did they tell you to find him not guilty.\u201d The personal opinion of defense counsel of their client\u2019s guilt or innocence is no more relevant than the opinion of the prosecutor. Yet, if the jury believes that even the defendant\u2019s own advocates think him guilty, that belief will naturally carry great weight in their deliberations. The jury is also likely to resent defense counsel\u2019s perceived insincerity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Moreover, the jury is likely to believe a prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that defense counsel are mere \u201chired guns.\u201d The prosecutor carries into court the prestige of \u201cthe representative * * * of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest * * * is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. * * * Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314, 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">DENIGRATION OF DEFENSE COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The prosecutor compounded his error by disparaging defense counsel, in the jury\u2019s presence, for objecting. The prosecutor said: \u201cWell, I certainly object. It\u2019s argument. We don\u2019t want him off the hook.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">It is improper to denigrate defense counsel in the jury\u2019s presence for making objections. Such conduct infringes on the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and penalizes him for attempting to enforce procedural rights. Cf. <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 88, 571 N.E.2d 97, 118; see, generally, Gershman, <em>supra, </em>at Sections 10.4 and 10.4(a). In light of Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous-objection requirement, such conduct is especially reprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Yet the prosecutor repeatedly chose to attack the defense for objecting. At one point, this exchange occurred before the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\u201cMR. SHAUGHNESSY: We\u2019ll object, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">\u201cMR. MARINO: Yes, we\u2019ll object. Did we object to Adam [sic] Klann being killed? We\u2019ll object. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Later, the prosecutor derided defense counsel for having objected during Nancy Somers\u2019s testimony: \u201cObjection. Yes. We don\u2019t want to hear that because that answer means, yes, he agrees with the murder of an innocent human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">APPEAL TO EMOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The prosecutor consistently substituted emotion for reasoned advocacy in his closing arguments. He expressly encouraged the jury to react emotionally to the evidence, specifically the gruesome photographs of Klann\u2019s corpse. \u201cWhen you see what has been done to him, then you will know the outrage that we feel over it, that it is justifiable.\u201d Though the prosecutor added, \u201cThat is not meant to sway your sympathy or feelings,\u201d the issue here is the effect his conduct actually had on the jury, not the effect it was meant to have. See <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947, 71 L.Ed.2d 78, 87 (the issue \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The prosecutor soon adverted again to the photographs:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u201cSo that you understand how the law enforcement community and people like me and Mr. Allen feel about this, I want you to look at these photographs. I\u2019m going to show them to you for a few seconds so that when I talk to you in the next 30 or 40 minutes you\u2019re going to understand just exactly what this case is about.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">\u201cThat was once a living human being. * * * If it bothers you, then you are a moral, decent person. If the defense trys <em>\\sic </em>] to tell you that was done to inflame you, you should say any person meeting their death like Anthony Klann did would inflame any decent citizen\u2019s feelings, emotions and morals.\u201d Again the prosecutor referred to the photographs: \u201cYou will understand more fully that this is a capital case when you look at that photograph and the other photographs of Mr. Klann and you look at the knife.\u201d Finally, the prosecutor said: \u201cWhen you see those pictures you\u2019ll dream about it. They will not leave your memory. When you recount the facts of this case you will be shocked. You will be upset, at least as upset as I am, at least.\u201d Although gruesome photographs may be admissible in a capital case, the state may not use them \u201cto appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions and to prejudice them against the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 15, 514 N.E.2d 407, 420. Such photographs \u201care charged with such immediacy and emotional impact,\u201d <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 311, 533 N.E.2d 701, 712, fn. 2, that they inherently present some danger of inflaming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the jury in any case; that is why we have insisted, as a prerequisite to admissibility, that each gruesome photograph have a probative value that outweighs its prejudicial effect. See <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E.2d 267, 273-274; cf. Evid.R. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Assuming the photographs were admissible, the prosecutor focused not on what the photographs proved, but on the \u201cfeelings\u201d and \u201cemotions\u201d they evoked. Worse, he encouraged the jurors to regard those feelings as relevant \u2014 indeed, central \u2014 to their task. In the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the role of the photographs was not evidentiary; it was visceral.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s reliance on emotion did not stop there. At one point, the prosecutor actually stabbed a large knife into a counsel table in the presence of the jury. He urged the jury to \u201cstand there just like * * * Anthony Klann was made to stand there when those two men * * *, who were well over six foot, then remember those two men, and then remember Mr. Espinoza, as this man made him put his * * * head back and sliced open his neck. That\u2019s our society. That\u2019s our presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">After describing Keenan\u2019s alleged acts, the prosecutor asked: \u201cThat\u2019s a human being?\u201d Answering his own question, he called Keenan an \u201canimal.\u201d Such invective is not unfair <em>per se, </em>see <em>Darden v. Wainwright </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 168, 180-183, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 2471-2472, 91 L.Ed.2d 144, 156-158; <em>Wiles, supra, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 87, 571 N.E.2d at 117, but here the epithet added to the emotional smoke screen surrounding the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">PERSONAL OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The prosecutor spoke of his personal outrage. He told the jury: \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019m burned. I\u2019m burned in that same * * * six letter word that Espinoza used. * * * In my time I haven\u2019t got emotional too often but it\u2019s genuine.\u201d Finally, he said: \u201cI\u2019m all talked out for now, but you better believe what I told you was heartfelt, was true to these facts, was exactly how me and my friend, [Detective] Allen * * * feel about this case.\u201d A prosecutor may not express his personal opinion about the guilt of the accused, unless he bases that opinion on the evidence presented in court. Here, the prosecutor made only glancing reference to the \u201cfacts\u201d of the case; this comment was really about the state of his own emotions and the fervor with which he believed in Keenan\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">To be sure, any capital trial generates strong emotions. Furthermore, we agree with Judge Learned Hand\u2019s observation that \u201cthe truth is not likely to emerge, if the prosecution is confined to such detached exposition as would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>appropriate in a lecture, while the defense is allowed those appeals in misericordiam <em>[sic </em>] which long custom has come to sanction.\u201d <em>United States v. Wexler </em>(C.A.2, 1935), 79 F.2d 526, 530. And so we have consistently held the prosecution entitled to \u201csome latitude and freedom of expression\u201d in summation. <em>State v. Woodards </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 14, 26, 35 O.O.2d 8, 14, 215 N.E.2d 568, 578. Realism compels us to recognize that criminal trials cannot be squeezed dry of all feeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">But it does not follow that prosecutors may deliberately saturate trials with emotion. We have previously announced that \u201ca conviction based solely on the inflammation of fears and passions, rather than proof of guilt, requires reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 23 OBR 13, 17, 490 N.E.2d 906, 911. Excessively emotional arguments may deny due process. In our view, the prosecutor\u2019s histrionic approach to this case crossed the line that separates permissible fervor from a denial of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">BAD CHARACTER</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The prosecutor made another gravely improper argument when he used the bad character of Keenan\u2019s friends to attack Keenan\u2019s own character. Discussing the testimony of Paul Lewis, the prosecutor said: \u201c[Y]ou have Paul Lewis, who is Stoney, and there is no question in my mind that * * *, as Mr. Shaughnessy suggested, he had been stoned a few times, but he is this man\u2019s [Keenan\u2019s] acquaintance * * *. That tells you something about this man. Tell me who your friends are and I\u2019ll tell you what you are like.\u201d Likewise, the prosecutor reminded the jury that Keenan was \u201cthe employer of [Espinoza and D\u2019Ambrosio]. You want those two men working for you? This man does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In relying on the \u201cthoroughly discredited doctrine\u201d of guilt by association, the prosecutor violated \u201ca fundamental principle of American jurisprudence, inhabiting a central place in the concept of due process.\u201d <em>People v. Chambers </em>(1964), 231 Cal.App.2d 23, 28-29, 41 Cal.Rptr. 551, 555. A defendant cannot be adjudged guilty on the ground that he or she associates with bad people. Such arguments are highly prejudicial. <em>United States v. Labarbera </em>(C.A.5, 1978), 581 F.2d 107, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">By arguing explicitly that the bad character of Keenan\u2019s friends reflected on Keenan\u2019s character, when that character was wholly irrelevant, the prosecutor ignored the fact that \u201c[u]nder longstanding principles of Anglo-American jurisprudence, an accused cannot be convicted * * * by proving he * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>is a bad person.\u201d <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 184, 552 N.E.2d 180, 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">PREJUDICIAL ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Having held the prosecutor\u2019s behavior improper, we must determine whether it constituted a denial of due process. We consider the effect the misconduct had on the jury in the context of the entire trial. See <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 643-645, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871-1872, 40 L.Ed.2d 431, 436-438; <em>Darden v. Wainwright, supra, </em>477 U.S. at 181-182, 106 S.Ct. at 2471-2472, 91 L.Ed.2d at 157-158.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">One factor relevant to the due-process analysis is whether the misconduct was an isolated incident in an otherwise properly tried case. See <em>Donnelly, </em>416 U.S. at 645, 94 S.Ct. at 1872, 40 L.Ed.2d at 438. That was not true here. To the contrary, the prosecutor\u2019s errors were part of a protracted series of improper arguments, \u201ca textbook example of what a closing argument should not be.\u201d <em>State v. Liberatore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 589, 23 O.O.3d 489, 493, 433 N.E.2d 561, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The defense did not object to most of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks; nonetheless, all such remarks are relevant to our due-process analysis. We have held that error not objected to is waived on appeal. However, we have also said: \u201cThe closing argument must * * * be reviewed in its entirety to determine if the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Moritz </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 150, 157, 17 O.O.3d 92, 97, 407 N.E.2d 1268, 1273. Moreover, the state here is in no position to claim waiver after the prosecutor attacked the defense for objecting. Having poisoned the well, the prosecution cannot now complain that the defense refused to drink from it. Thus, even though the defense waived objection to many remarks, those remarks still form part of the context in which we evaluate the effect on the jury of errors that were not waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">As the foregoing discussion shows, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct consists of much more than trivial errors. We have searched in vain for other factors that might indicate lack of prejudice. The trial court gave no curative instruction, see <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 645, 94 S.Ct. at 1872, 40 L.Ed.2d at 438; indeed, it overruled an objection, giving the prosecutor\u2019s comment its approval in the jury\u2019s eyes. Nor was the comment an invited response to anything said by the defense. Cf. <em>Darden, </em>477 U.S. at 182, 106 S.Ct. at 2472, 91 L.Ed.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Finally, the evidence here was not overwhelming. Espinoza, the sole eyewitness to the murder, had participated in the crime. Facing the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>penalty for aggravated murder, he pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and other noncapital crimes pursuant to a plea agreement; testifying was his end of the bargain. Moreover, Espinoza himself admitted past quarrels with Klann, and the way he treated Klann at Coconut Joe\u2019s made his feelings clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Credible evidence contradicts Espinoza\u2019s testimony that Klann was kidnapped during the search for Lewis and killed because he did not tell Keenan where Lewis was. Espinoza and Lewis testified that the night of Klann\u2019s kidnapping was \u201cTequila Night\u201d at Coconut Joe\u2019s. They thought this was a Friday, but the bar\u2019s employees testified that Coconut Joe\u2019s always held \u201cTequila Night\u201d on Thursdays, and this testimony was unshaken on cross-examination. Also, Espinoza testified that it was raining when Keenan picked up Klann in the truck, early in the morning. According to the NWS statement, it rained in the Cleveland area in the early hours of Friday morning, but not at all on Saturday. Although Espinoza, Carolyn Rosell, and three other witnesses testified that Keenan looked for Lewis on Friday night, Espinoza and Rosell conceded that it could have been Thursday night, while the others seemed to have trouble recalling dates in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Thus, substantial evidence suggests Keenan\u2019s search for Lewis took place on Thursday night-Friday morning, September 22-23. Yet the coroner concluded that Klann probably died on Saturday morning, September 24, and in any case well after 8:15 a.m. Friday, September 23. This tends to refute Espinoza\u2019s account of the murder, weakening the state\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Espinoza also claimed that when police came to his apartment on September 26, Keenan fled. But the state never explained how Keenan could have escaped with Detective Allen at the apartment door and the building surrounded by eight officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Without overwhelming evidence of guilt, we cannot know what the verdict might have been had not the prosecutor clouded the jury\u2019s vision with improper tactics. Cf. <em>Darden, </em>477 U.S. at 182, 106 S.Ct. at 2472, 91 L.Ed.2d at 158. To declare as nonprejudicial the conduct of the assistant prosecutor in this case would be to announce a new standard for the prosecution of death penalty cases \u2014 a standard that falls dramatically short of that which is guaranteed to any person accused of a capital crime by both the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">In his fifth proposition of law, Keenan complains that the prosecution improperly impeached its own witness, Adam Flanik, with a prior inconsistent statement, violating Evid.R. 607. This proposition of law also has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Flanik testified that he saw D\u2019Ambrosio holding Klann in Keenan\u2019s truck at knifepoint. The prosecutor asked if Klann was crying. Flanik replied: \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>seemed like it, but I really couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d \u201cQ. If I show you your statement, would that refresh your recollection?\u201d \u201cA. I guess.\u201d The prosecutor handed Flanik a copy of his statement to police. After Flanik reviewed it, the prosecutor again asked, \u201cWas he crying?\u201d \u201cA. I couldn\u2019t really tell.\u201d \u201cQ. Did you tell the police he was crying in your statement here?\u201d After rereading the statement, Flanik answered: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Under Evid.R. 607, a party may not impeach its own witness with a prior inconsistent statement without showing surprise and affirmative damage. The prosecutor\u2019s use of Flanik\u2019s statement violated this rule. Flanik did not cause affirmative damage by testifying that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell\u201d whether Klann was crying; such a \u201cneutral answer,\u201d Staff Note to Evid.R. 607, provides no basis for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Nor can we accept the state\u2019s argument that Flanik\u2019s statement was admissible as \u201cpast recollection recorded.\u201d That doctrine does not apply unless the witness \u201chas insufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.\u201d Evid.R. 803(5). Flanik did not testify that he could not remember whether Klann was crying; rather, he testified that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t really tell.\u201d What Flanik did not remember was whether he <em>told police </em>Klann was crying. (The state also attempts to apply the \u201cpresent recollection refreshed\u201d doctrine, but that doctrine does not allow a party to bring an out-of-court statement before the jury. See <em>State v. Scott </em>[1972], 31 Ohio St.2d 1, 5-6, 60 O.O.2d 1, 3, 285 N.E.2d 344, 347-348.) We conclude that the prosecutor violated Evid.R. 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Alone, such a violation might have been harmless; here, we believe it contributed to the unfairness of Keenan\u2019s trial. The fact that Klann was crying was but marginally relevant to the kidnapping charge, yet it had considerable emotional impact<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 impact intensified by the prosecutor\u2019s plea that the jurors envision themselves in Klann\u2019s place. In the emotional atmosphere the prosecutor created with his closing arguments, we doubt the jury could properly evaluate the information that Klann was crying. We therefore find the violation of Evid.R. 607 prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On this record, we do not believe Keenan received a fair trial. The judgments of conviction cannot stand. Accordingly, we sustain Keenan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>second and fifth propositions of law, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals upholding his convictions, and remand the cause to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b537-7\">A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b537-8\">Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-12\">. This was the only error preserved by an objection at the closing argument of the guilt phase. While Keenan made other objections to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we find no merit in them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">. The prosecutor must have badly wanted the jury to hear that Klann was crying, despite the quite limited relevance of that fact; he rephrased his questions to Flanik several times, trying to meet defense objections and extract the answer he wanted. His persistence illustrates the statement\u2019s high potential for prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b537-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVir\">dissenting. I would affirm both the defendant\u2019s convictions and the imposition of the death sentence. The prosecutorial conduct in the trial did not rise to the level of reversible error. Both defense counsel and prosecutor were afforded wide latitude to present their arguments. All attorneys took full advantage of this freedom during the Keenan trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The majority narrowly focuses on the behavior of the prosecutor and has failed to acknowledge that the defense counsel was also permitted to argue his case in an aggressive and arguably prejudicial manner. In closing arguments, one of the appellant\u2019s defense counsel continually branded Edward Espinoza, the key prosecutorial witness, as a \u201cpiece of garbage.\u201d The same defense counsel also shared his own opinion of Espinoza\u2019s credibility by asking the question \u201cIs he believable?\u201d and then answering \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">The defense counsel\u2019s conduct did not end when he concluded his evaluation of Mr. Espinoza. He told the jury of his own personal disagreement with the expert opinion of Dr. Elizabeth Balraj, the coroner who performed an autopsy on the victim. In closing arguments, defense counsel commented that <em>\u201cI think I can disagree with Dr. Balraj </em>without being disagreeable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Later, the same attorney reinforced his evaluation of the expert by adding, \u201cI disagree with the lady.\u201d A defense attorney lacks any foundation to personally evaluate a medical doctor\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">In the heated atmosphere of a capital offense trial, one of the trial judge\u2019s most important responsibilities is to make sure that the state and the defense are trying the case on the same field. In this case, Judge Michael J. Corrigan fulfilled his responsibility by providing each side with an opportunity to present its case forcefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">In a vacuum, the prosecutor\u2019s behavior could have constituted prosecutorial misconduct severe enough to warrant reversal. However, the leeway that Judge Corrigan gave to the prosecutor was also given to the defense counsel. By overturning the appellant\u2019s conviction on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, this court is sending a strong message to the bench and bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Prosecutors must now try these ugly cases handcuffed by the demand of dispassionate presentation. Defense counsel remain entitled to argue with no holds barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Second, the prosecutor did not impeach his own witness as the majority has alleged. After being asked if the victim had been crying, the state\u2019s witness, Adam Flanik, responded, <em>\u201cIt seemed like it,\u201d </em>and then added the qualification \u201cbut I really couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In general, this is an affirmative response to the prosecutor\u2019s question. The subsequent questioning by the prosecutor merely tried to elicit a clearer, more affirmative response from Flanik. Because the prosecutor never attempted to directly contradict the testimony of his witness, no impeachment occurred. To hold that any attempt by an attorney to obtain a more definitive response from his witness constitutes impeachment is a dangerous precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Finally, this jury, on the facts presented, properly convicted Keenan and sentenced him to die. Keenan\u2019s murder of Anthony Klann was cold-blooded mayhem. The jury knew it. The trial judge knew it. The prosecutor\u2019s conduct did not change the inevitable outcome of this trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-7\">Resnick, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
