Under the original version of the three strikes law a recidivist with two or more prior strikes who is convicted of any new felony is subject to an indeterminate life sentence. The Act diluted the three strikes law by reserving the life sentence for cases where the current crime is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying factor. In all other cases, the recidivist will be sentenced as a second strike offender. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, 1170.12.) The Act also created a postconviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 167-168. [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901].)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Shortly after the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act or Proposition 36) went into effect, real party in interest Alfredo Cervantes, an inmate serving a 50-year-to-life term following conviction of felonies that were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>violent (as defined by \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for recall of sentence, seeking resentencing under the Act. The trial court determined Cervantes qualified (was eligible) for resentencing and set the matter for further hearing on the issue of whether resentencing Cervantes would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The People now seek review of the trial court\u2019s eligibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that an inmate serving an indeterminate life term under the three strikes law may be found to have been \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d in the commission of his or her current offense(s), so as to be disqualified from resentencing under the Act, even if he or she did not carry the firearm on his or her person. In the unpublished portion, we hold the People are entitled to writ review of the trial court\u2019s contrary conclusion. Accordingly, we grant the People\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">On September 11, 1995, Cervantes sold one ounce of heroin to an undercover narcotics officer. The sale took place in front of Cervantes\u2019s home. Cervantes also negotiated to sell the officer 10 pounds of methamphetamine and another four ounces of heroin. On September 21, 1995, a search warrant was executed at Cervantes\u2019s residence. When officers entered, they found Cervantes standing inside the doorway. Heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and scales were found in the kitchen. A loaded semiautomatic handgun was found in the adjacent bedroom, in a purse belonging to Cervantes\u2019s wife. The gun was about eight feet from the heroin. Cervantes admitted the firearm and some of the drugs were his.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In March 1996, a jury convicted Cervantes of selling heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352, subd. (a); count 1), possessing heroin for sale (id, \u00a7 11351; count 2), being a felon in possession of a firearm (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1), now see \u00a7 29800, subd. (a); count 3), and making a building available for preparing or storing heroin (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11366.5, subd. (a); count 5). Jurors found Cervantes was personally armed with a firearm in the commission of count 2. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (c).) Cervantes was further found to have suffered two prior \u201cstrike\u201d convictions. (\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(A).) On April 25, 1996, he was sentenced to prison for a total unstayed term of 50 years to life plus four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">On November 7, 2012, Cervantes petitioned the trial court for a recall of sentence and a new sentencing hearing pursuant to section 1170.126. The People opposed the petition on the ground Cervantes did not qualify because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>in connection with his current offenses, the prosecution pled and proved Cervantes was armed with a firearm. Cervantes argued: (1) The electorate\u2014 most of whom were lay persons\u2014would have understood the phrase \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d to refer to a crime in which the offender was carrying a firearm, not one in which the firearm was in a separate room; (2) Since the firearm was not in the same room as the heroin Cervantes was convicted of possessing, the jury necessarily relied on constructive possession in order to find the section 12022, subdivision (c) allegation to be true; and (3) Since the \u201carmed\u201d exclusion included in Proposition 36 was narrower than the \u201carmed\u201d element of the enhancement, the jury\u2019s finding under section 12022, subdivision (c) did not disqualify Cervantes from relief under section 1170.126.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">On March 21, 2013, a hearing was held on the petition. After argument on the issue, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to accept the defendant\u2019s position . . . and find that armed for purposes of Prop 36 means actual possession rather than constructive possession of the firearm .... So I\u2019m going to find that Mr. Cervantes . . . [is] not excluded.\u201d The matter was then set for a resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The People petitioned this court for a writ of prohibition and/or mandate overturning the trial court\u2019s ruling. They further requested that we stay the resentencing hearing. On April 9, 2013, we issued an order to show cause why the relief prayed for should not be granted, and stayed proceedings in the trial court pending our further order.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">I. <em>The People are entitled to writ review of the trial court\u2019s </em>ruling.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">II. <em>Cervantes was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of the Act, and so was disqualified from resentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Insofar as we are concerned, Cervantes\u2019s current conviction was for a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11351, during the commission of which he was \u201cpersonally armed with a firearm\u201d in violation of section 12022, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A person is \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>section 12022 if he or she \u201chas the specified weapon available for use, either offensively or defensively.

Although section 12022, subdivision (c)\u2019s requirement that the defendant be \u201cpersonally armed\u201d limits liability to one who actually commits the prohibited conduct, as opposed to imposing vicarious liability <em>(People v. Bland, supra, </em>at p. 998, fn. 3; contra, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), it does not require that the defendant physically carry the firearm on his or her person <em>(People v. Smith </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 196, 204 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 645]; <em>People v. Gonzales </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1658, 1661-1663 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 267]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendival </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 562, 573-574 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 566]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Pomilia) (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1464, 1471-1472 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 386]).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The question before us is whether, having been \u201cpersonally armed with a firearm\u201d in the commission of his current offense within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (c), Cervantes \u201cwas armed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii). If he was not, then he is qualified for resentencing under the Act. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) As previously described, the trial court ruled that \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d for purposes of the Act means actual possession, i.e., carrying the firearm on one\u2019s person. The issue is one' of the interpretation of a statute and its applicability to a given situation, a question of law we review independently. <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Lozano </em>(2010) 47 Cal.4th 1327, 1332 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 219, 223 P.3d 77]; <em>Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 652, 659, fn. 8 [102 Cal.Rptr. 766, 498 P.2d 1014]; see <em>People v.

[Citations.] When the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. [Citations.] When the language is susceptible of more than one\" reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007-1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) We also \u201c \u2018refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rizo, </em>supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 685.) \u201cUsing these extrinsic aids, we \u2018select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Sinohui </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 212 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 783, 47 P.3d 629].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence; the words must be construed in context, and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mohammed </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 920, 928 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 372].) \u201c \u2018[W]e do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Horwich v.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Woodhead, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1008.) When \u201cthe words themselves provide no definitive answer, we . . . look to extrinsic sources.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Cervantes says that because our aim is to interpret the <em>voters' </em>intent, we must give the language \u201cits ordinary meaning <em>as understood by the electorate,\" </em>i.e., \u201cthe average voter, unschooled in <em>the </em>patois of criminal law . . . .\u201d <em>(Robert L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 901, 902 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951], italics added.) Based on his view of \u201ccommon lay person understanding,\u201d which he supports with various dictionary definitions, Cervantes says the electorate understood being \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d to occur where the defendant was carrying a firearm on his or her person while in the perpetration of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">For the most part, however, the dictionary definitions are not so limited.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For instance, the first definition of \u201carmed\u201d given by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) at page 119 is \u201cfurnished with weapons of offense or defense.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary (2d college ed. 1985) at page 128 defines \u201carmed\u201d as \u201c[e]quipped with weapons.\u201d As commonly understood, the state of being furnished or equipped with weapons is broader than carrying a weapon on one\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Moreover, Cervantes\u2019s argument ignores the fact it has long been settled that \u201c[t]he enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380]), \u201cand to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof\u2019 <em>(People v. Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078]). \u201cThis principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{People v. Weidert, supra, </em>at p. 844.) Indeed, where, as here, \u201cthe language of a statute uses terms that have been judicially construed, \u2018 \u201cthe presumption is almost irresistible\u201d \u2019 that the terms have been used \u2018 \u201cin the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] This principle [likewise] applies to legislation adopted through the initiative process. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 845-846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">In enacting Proposition 36, the voters are thus deemed to have been aware of the long-standing statutory and judicially construed definition of \u201carmed with a firearm.\u201d Yet they failed to expressly limit the term when amending sections 667, subdivision (e) and 1170.12, subdivision (c) and enacting section 1170.126. This strongly suggests they intended to disqualify from resentencing those inmates who had a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively, and not merely those who carried a firearm on their person. (See <em>Robert S. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1417, 1421-1422 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 489].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>A conclusion \u201carmed with a firearm,\u201d as used in sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii), and as disqualifies an inmate from resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), extends to situations in which the defendant had the firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively, is supported by an examination of the statutory scheme as a whole. The purpose of the three strikes law has been variously stated as being \u201c \u2018to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Young </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 900, 909 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 48, 87 P.3d 797]) and \u201cto promote the state\u2019s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing recidivism\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gipson </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1070 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 478]). Although the Act \u201cdiluted\u201d the three strikes law somewhat <em>(People v. Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167), \u201c[enhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 175). Moreover, section 12022 was enacted \u201cto deter those engaged in felonies from creating a risk of death or injury by having a firearm at the scene of the crime. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">That such a construction of the term comports with voters\u2019 intent is supported by the ballot materials related to Proposition 36. The \u201cOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\u201d stated in part that the initiative \u201c [continues to impose life sentence penalty if third strike conviction was for certain nonserious, non-violent sex or drug offenses <em>or involved firearm </em>possession.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) official title and summary, p. 48, italics added.) In summarizing then existing law, the legislative analysis of Proposition 36 listed, as examples of violent felonies, murder, robbery, and rape; as felonies that were serious but not violent, assault with intent to commit robbery; and as felonies not classified as violent or serious, grand theft (not involving a firearm) and possession of a controlled substance. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 36 by Legis. Analyst, p. 48.) In summarizing how the initiative measure would shorten sentences for some third strikers, the Legislative Analyst explained there would be some exceptions to the shorter sentence: \u201cSpecifically, the measure requires that if the offender has committed certain new or prior offenses, including some drug-, sex-, <em>and gun-related felonies, </em>he or she would still be subject to a life sentence under the three strikes law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49, italics added.) The legislative analysis further described how certain current third strikers would be resentenced, but explained that Proposition 36 \u201climits eligibility for resentencing to third strikers whose current offense is nonserious, non-violent and who have not committed specified current and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>prior offenses, such as certain drug-, sex-, <em>and gun-related felonies.\u201d </em>(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>at p. 50, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In their \u201cARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 36,\u201d the measure\u2019s proponents spoke in terms of making the punishment fit the crime, saving California money, and making room in prison for dangerous felons. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 36, p. 52.) In their \u201cREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 36,\u201d the proponents stated, in part: \u201cProp. 36 requires that murderers, rapists, child molesters, <em>and other dangerous criminals </em>serve their full sentences, [f] . . . [f] Today, dangerous criminals are being released early from prison because jails are overcrowded with <em>nonviolent offenders who pose no risk to the public. </em>Prop. 36 prevents dangerous criminals from being released early. <em>People convicted of shoplifting a pair of socks, stealing bread or baby formula don\u2019t deserve life sentences.\u201d </em>(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 36, p. 53, italics added &amp; omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Section 1 of the proposed law found and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThe People enact the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 to restore the original intent of California\u2019s Three Strikes law\u2014imposing life sentences for <em>dangerous criminals </em>like rapists, murderers, and child molesters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\u201cThis act will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">\u201c(1) Require that murderers, rapists, and child molesters serve their full sentences\u2014they will receive life sentences, even if they are convicted of a new minor third strike crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">\u201c(2) Restore the Three Strikes law to the public\u2019s original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a defendant\u2019s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">\u201c(3) Maintain that repeat offenders convicted of <em>non-violent, nonserious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession </em>will receive twice the normal sentence instead of a life sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-12\">\u201c(4) Save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year for at least 10 years.

Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of proposed law, \u00a7 1, p. 105, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The foregoing materials expressly distinguished between dangerous criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of <em>simple </em>drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public and did not deserve life sentences. We do not view the electorate as deeming someone with a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively, in the commission of a felony to be nondangerous or to pose little risk to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Cervantes observes that the Act refers to specific statutory definitions in some places (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iv)), but not in the context of the \u201carming\u201d definition. He argues this implies the electorate intended the common, lay definition for the term. We disagree. There are multiple statutes in this state\u2019s codes that refer to arming. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (a)(2), 12022; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.1, subd. (a).) Some expressly define the term (e.g., \u00a7 1203.06, subd. (b)(3); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.1, subd. (a), 2d par.), while others rely on judicial construction (e.g., \u00a7 12022; <em>People v. Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 997). By not specifically including any, the electorate excluded none. (See <em>Gikas v. Zolin </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 841, 852 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 500, 863 P.2d 745] [under canon of construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>expression of some things in statute necessarily means exclusion of other things not expressed].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">We conclude the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in finding Cervantes qualified for resentencing under the Act. The People are entitled to the relief they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The petition for writ of prohibition and/or mandate is granted. Let a writ of mandate issue directing the Superior Court of Tulare County to vacate the order filed in case No. VCF036841-95 on March 21, 2013, finding real party in interest not excluded from resentencing under Proposition 36, and to enter a new and different order denying real party in interest\u2019s petition for recall of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The order filed on April 9, 2013, staying the proceedings in Tulare County Superior Court case No. VCF036841-95 shall remain in effect only until this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>opinion is final in all courts in this state or the Supreme Court grants a hearing herein, whichever shall first occur.

Accordingly, we have no occasion to (and do not) decide whether possession of a firearm by a felon constitutes a disqualifying conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> The People assert, in their supplemental letter brief, that <em>People v. White </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 512 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 328], petition for review pending, petition filed March 10, 2014, could be read to limit exclusion from resentencing to those defendants who physically possessed a firearm during the commission of their commitment offense. We do not read <em>White so </em>narrowly. White was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon and the issue was whether he fell within the exclusion of having been \u201carmed with a firearm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 519, 520.) The <em>White </em>court found the \u201carmed-with-a-firearm exclusion\u201d applied because the record showed the defendant \u201cwas in physical possession of a firearm\u201d and, therefore, had \u201cready access\u201d to it. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 523-524.) The <em>White </em>court did not hold physical possession was the only circumstance in which a defendant could be found to be armed with a firearm within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii), and section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> Because we are not confronted in this case with vicarious arming, which exists when a defendant who is not personally armed is a principal in a crime and another principal is armed, possibly without the defendant\u2019s knowledge (see \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1); <em>People </em>v. <em>Paul </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 698, 706 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 660, 958 P.2d 412]; <em>People v.
