The jury at appellant\u2019s first trial acquitted him of first degree murder but convicted him of second degree murder. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirmed the conviction. <em>(People v. Prock </em>(May 22, 2002, B150248) [nonpub. opn. by Yegan, J., with Gilbert, P. J., and Perren, J., conc.].) The California Supreme Court denied review. In 2007, a federal district court granted appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus and ordered a new trial after ruling that the trial court prejudicially erred when it instructed the jury that second degree implied-malice murder is a general intent crime. It also ruled that this court\u2019s analysis of harmless error was \u201cperfunctory\u201d and \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d At the second trial in 2011, the jury again convicted appellant of second degree murder with the finding that he personally used a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Appellant contends: (1) The prosecutor was collaterally estopped to argue this killing was premeditated and that the trial court erred when it permitted that argument; (2) The trial cou,rt erred when it gave instructions limiting his theories of perfect and imperfect self-defense and when it declined to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter and on a third theory of voluntary manslaughter; (3) The prosecutor committed misconduct in his closing arguments when he incorrectly defined the provocation required for heat of passion voluntary manslaughter; and (4) his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated when a pathologist, who did not perform the autopsy, testified concerning the condition of Vasquez\u2019s body and the cause of his death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Eduardo Vasquez drove his car to the ampm market in Carpinter\u00eda about 11:30 p.m. on the night of May 15, 2000. Three of Vasquez\u2019s friends were in the car with him: Justin Rosenberger, Mark Covarrubias, and Manuel Ortega. Vasquez parked the car next to the gas pump island, so that the driver\u2019s side of the car was close to a concrete post guarding the pump island. The four men got out of the car and were standing around it when appellant walked out of the ampm market. Instead of walking around the car, appellant walked between it and the concrete post. In doing so, he physic\u00e1lly bumped Vasquez and Rosenberger.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">As appellant walked away from the group, Vasquez said to him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? You have the whole gas station to walk through, you know.\u201d Vasquez and Rosenberger exchanged profanities with appellant. Appellant threatened to kill them and said: \u201cI have guns and knives, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d No one threatened to harm appellant. Then, appellant walked quickly away.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Vasquez, Rosenberger and Covarrubias went inside the market to buy snacks and cigarettes. Ortega stayed outside, standing near the front bumper of Vasquez\u2019s car. A few minutes later, appellant reappeared in the parking lot. Covarrubias, who had just left the market, was surprised to see appellant approaching him. Appellant looked agitated and ready to fight. He was concealing something in his right hand but neither Ortega nor Covarrubias could tell what it was. Ortega told him, \u201cNo problems here.\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cWho\u2019s got the problem?\u201d Covarrubias said he did not want any problems. Appellant responded with something like, \u201cWhere\u2019s your friend? Your friend have a problem?\u201d It seemed to Covarrubias like appellant was looking for Vasquez. Covarrubias told him, \u201cYou should probably go. Don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">At that point, Vasquez and Rosenberger came out of the market. Appellant was standing about 15 feet away from Vasquez. When Vasquez saw appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>he tossed his hamburger to Ortega and said, \u201cI\u2019ll handle this.\u201d Vasquez took a couple of steps toward appellant. He put his hands up near his face, with the palms out, as if to defend himself. He did not clench his fists. Appellant lunged forward and, in an overhand and downward swinging motion, stabbed appellant in the chest. He immediately jumped back and moved 10 or 12 feet away from Vasquez and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do now, punk?\u201d Vasquez did not reply. He looked at his friends and walked backwards a few steps. Vasquez\u2019s friends heard a woman say, \u201cMatthew [(appellant\u2019s first name)], let\u2019s go.\u201d He got into the passenger seat of a white SUV and it drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Vasquez told Rosenberger to take him to the hospital because he had been stabbed. He lost consciousness during the drive and was not responsive when they arrived at the hospital. He died as a result of the stab wound that penetrated six inches into his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Appellant testified at the first trial. His testimony was read to the jury at his second trial. According to appellant, bumping into Vasquez and Rosenberger on his way out of the market was an accident. Vasquez immediately started yelling at appellant. \u201cHe was using profanity and the other three were yelling too. They joined in right behind him, came \u2019forward and started yelling at me too.\u201d Appellant left the parking lot as they yelled at him. Appellant was upset with himself because he had acted like a coward. He testified, \u201cI wanted to go back and I wanted ... to tell them, show them pretty much that I wasn\u2019t scared of them, that I wasn\u2019t a coward.\u201d He ran to his nearby apartment, retrieved a knife from his kitchen and then returned to the ampm parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Appellant testified that, when he got to the parking lot, he got to within six to 10 feet of Ortega and Covarrubias. He pulled the knife out of his pocket and said to them, \u201c \u2018If you\u2019ve got a problem with me do something about it now.\u2019 \u201d Appellant intended to scare them. He believed they would not try to beat him up if he was holding the knife, but he had no intention of using the knife. \u201cThen about five, five, 10 seconds later, [Vasquez] came out of the store. Somebody came behind him too. When he came out of the store and saw me he came at me. He came pretty fast towards me in my direction and he handed . . . one of his friends something that was in his hand, and he did say, \u2018I\u2019ll handle this.\u2019 He just came at me. He came all the way up to me. And I remember that it happened really fast, because he came at me really fast. And I did take one step towards him, and I\u2014and I did stab with the knife, but it\u2014it kind of\u2014I turned my head and closed my eyes kind of when I did it and it felt like we kind of collided. And right as it happened, I turned and started to run from him . . . .\u201d Appellant soon realized no one was following him, so he went back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>On cross-examination, appellant agreed that he was the aggressor in his confrontation with Ortega and Covarrubias, but he denied asking them where their friend was. He also denied saying, during the first confrontation, that he would return with a gun and a knife to kill them. Appellant agreed that Vasquez and his friends did not have weapons in their hands and that no one hit him. No one threw anything at appellant. When he left the parking lot the first time, no one chased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Appellant explained, \u201cI believe I did take a step when it happened, right as he ran into me, right as he came into me.\u201d Appellant denied that he intended to use the knife when he returned to the parking lot. However, he admitted that when Vasquez approached him, he \u201cplunged\u201d the knife into Vasquez\u2019s chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t even thought <em>[sic: </em>think] ... it just happened really fast. He just ran up to me. I wasn\u2019t thinking, oh, I want to stab this guy in the chest. That\u2019s not what I was thinking.\u201d Appellant had the knife \u201cin the ready position,\u201d and then stabbed Vasquez. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aiming specifically for his chest or anything, just kind of did it. Closed my eyes .... We just kind of ran into each other. I didn\u2019t really even see where I had stabbed him or anything.\u201d Appellant believed that, if he had not had the knife, Vasquez would have \u201cstarted beating me up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The trial court instructed the jury on both express malice and implied malice second degree murder. In addition, the trial court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter on heat of passion and imperfect self-defense theories. The jury was also instructed on self-defense. No involuntary manslaughter instructions were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\n<em>Collateral Estoppel/Jeopardy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Appellant contends the prosecutor, in his closing arguments, improperly urged the jury to convict appellant of second degree murder on the theory that he planned or premeditated the killing. Because appellant was acquitted of first degree murder in his first trial, appellant contends that jeopardy principles collaterally estopped the prosecutor from making that argument. Appellant forfeited appellate review of this issue by failing to raise it in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 821 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305] [if double jeopardy claim is not affirmatively raised in the trial court, \u201cany claim on that ground is not preserved for review.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1185 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 615].)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">On the merits, we conclude the prosecutor\u2019s arguments did not violate collateral estoppel principles because appellant\u2019s acquittal at the first trial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>not a factual finding that he acted without planning or premeditation. Moreover, the jurors in appellant\u2019s second trial were never asked to decide whether the killing was premeditated. There was no relitigation of an issue necessarily decided in appellant\u2019s first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal. <em>(North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 711, 715 [23 L.Ed.2d 656, 89 S.Ct. 2072].) Collateral estoppel is one component of double jeopardy. <em>(Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 436, 445-446 [25 L.Ed.2d 469, 90 S.Ct. 1189].) As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201ccollateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue decided at a previous trial \u2018if (1) the issue necessarily decided at the previous trial is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated; if (2) the previous trial resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and if (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior trial.\u2019 <em>([People v. Taylor </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 686,] 691 [117 Cal.Rptr. 70, 527 P.2d 622].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawley </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 163 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 38 P.3d 461].) Appellant has the burden to establish the factual predicate for application of the doctrine. <em>(People v. Morales, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 1187.) Specifically, appellant must \u201cdemonstrate that the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was actually decided in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>(Dowling </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 342, 350 [107 L.Ed.2d 708, 110 S.Ct. 668].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Appellant focuses on several portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to support his contention that the prosecutor sought to relitigate the issue of whether he acted with premeditation and deliberation, requirements for a first degree murder conviction. At various times, while discussing the express malice form of second degree murder, the provocation required for voluntary manslaughter, and appellant\u2019s claim of imperfect self-defense, the prosecutor referenced the undisputed facts that appellant left the ampm market, retrieved a knife from his apartment, returned to the market, confronted the victim and stabbed him. The prosecutor argued these facts were sufficient to prove express or implied malice second degree murder, and that they foreclosed appellant\u2019s claims that he acted in the heat of passion or in imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Appellant contends these arguments invited the jury to convict him on the theory that he premeditated and deliberated the killing, a theory that, he contends, was foreclosed by his acquittal of first degree murder at the first trial. We disagree. The not guilty verdict at appellant\u2019s first trial shows only that the jury had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt on the degree of the murder. It does not amount to a factual finding that appellant did <em>not </em>premeditate or deliberate the killing. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Watts </em>(1997) 519 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>148, 155 [136 L.Ed.2d 554, 117 S.Ct. 633]; <em>Santamar\u00eda </em>v. <em>Horsley </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 133 F.3d 1242, 1246.) As the Supreme Court explained in <em>United States v. Watts, </em>\u201c \u2018acquittal on criminal charges does not prove that the defendant is innocent; it merely proves the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms </em>[(1984)] 465 U.S. 354, 361 [79 L.Ed.2d 361, 104 S.Ct. 1099].\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Watts, supra, </em>519 U.S. at p. 155.) Because \u201cit is impossible to know exactly why a jury found a defendant not guilty on a certain charge,\u201d the jury \u201ccannot be said to have \u2018necessarily rejected\u2019 any facts when it returns a general verdict of not guilty.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, the jury in appellant\u2019s first trial cannot be said to have \u201cnecessarily decided\u201d that he did not factually plan to kill Vasquez. The prosecutor was not, therefore, collaterally estopped to argue that the evidence appellant returned to the ampm after retrieving the knife from his apartment was sufficient to prove he acted with express or implied malice and not in the heat of passion or in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The second jury was correctly instructed on the express and implied malice forms of second degree minder. It received no instructions on premeditated and deliberate first degree murder and was never permitted to consider appellant\u2019s guilt of that offense. Among other things, it was informed that malice aforethought \u201cis a mental state that must be formed before the act that causes death is committed. It does not require deliberation or the passage of any particular period of time.\u201d In light of this instruction, the prosecutor properly argued that appellant\u2019s conduct before the stabbing was evidence that he acted with malice aforethought.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The prosecutor did not argue that appellant committed a premeditated murder. Instead, he argued that appellant acted with express or implied malice. For example, the prosecutor stated: \u201c[At] the time that [appellant] walked back to the AM/PM and confronted Eddie Vasquez and drove a knife deep into his chest, he did so intending to take his life. Not necessarily intending to stab him only or intending to cause a problem, but intending to cause his death by that action. That is express malice, and if you find that he intended to kill him walking back to the AM/PM, then you have established malice aforethought in its express form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The prosecutor made similar comments when discussing the provocation required for voluntary manslaughter and the concept of a cooling off period. For example, the prosecutor argued that the victim\u2019s conduct and that of his friends did not amount to provocation that would \u201crequire or cause a person of average disposition to do anything rash, never mind go home, grab a knife and kill somebody.\u201d He later reiterated, \u201cThe provocation has to be such that a person of average disposition would have been provoked. Defendant goes home, he gets a knife, and he returns. He\u2019s about five minutes away before he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>comes back, immediately goes up to the two men who are now outside[,] . . . he displays the knife, he challenges them to a fight, makes it very clear he has the knife.\u201d When those two men do not respond, appellant encounters the victim. No blows are exchanged before appellant stabs the victim. As the prosecutor argued, \u201cMr. Vasquez never made any contact whatsoever with [appellant]. [Appellant] wasn\u2019t injured in any way. He wasn\u2019t touched in any way. [Appellant] had the knife in his hand the entire time and this incident was over in seconds. [][] Appellant came back to the AM/PM for purposes of killing someone, and that someone specifically was Eddie Vasquez. Provocation had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">While addressing the concept of a cooling-off period, the prosecutor stated, \u201cWell first of all, [appellant] was never hot. He was angry but he wasn\u2019t hot in that response. In the time he got home, and as he says' in his own testimony in 2001, he made the decision to get a knife before he actually went into his apartment. He wasn\u2019t reacting to this intense provocation that had occurred which robbed him of his ability to think clearly. He was thinking clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The prosecutor rebutted appellant\u2019s imperfect self-defense theory of voluntary manslaughter by arguing that appellant did not actually believe he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. \u201cHe put himself in that situation. He created the danger that he then found himself in and he never found himself in any danger. It never crossed his mind that anybody was going to hurt him. He was the one armed with a knife and he came there intending to inflict injury, not to receive injury. He didn\u2019t go there on a kamikaze mission believing that he was going to get hurt. That\u2019s why he had the knife.\u201d The prosecutor later repeated the argument: \u201cSelf-defense may not be claimed by a defendant who willfully and without any necessity for his own protection creates a danger with which he is thereupon threatened. Isn\u2019t that exactly what we have? He goes home, he gets a knife, he\u2019s angry, he\u2019s upset, and so he goes back to confront the people who he thinks insulted him. He\u2019s looking to [exact] revenge. It has nothing to do with that kind of emotional response to provocation. This is pure revenge.\u201d These arguments do not ask the jury to find that appellant premeditated or deliberated the killing. Rather, they use the undisputed facts of that night to argue that appellant acted with malice aforethought and to rebut his claims that he acted in the heat of passion or in imperfect self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">An acquittal on first degree murder alters the legal, but not factual, landscape for retrial purposes on lesser offenses. Here, for example, it seems apparent that appellant went home to get a knife. He was thinking about getting a knife before he picked it up and returned to confront the victim. This is planning activity. A prosecutor may argue \u201cplanning\u201d to show murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>in the first degree. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 26 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942].) But such planning may also show express malice to prove second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Appellant contends the trial court erred because it failed to give a sua sponte \u201cpreclusive\u201d instruction forbidding the jury to base a guilty verdict \u201cwholly or partially upon a finding that [appellant\u2019s] pre-homicide actions prove [appellant] then intended to kill and is therefore guilty of murder.\u201d The trial court had no such obligation. First, the proposed instruction is not a correct statement of the law. Second, the jury was not required to ignore evidence that appellant acted with express malice in his \u201cpre-homicide actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We also reject the contention that appellant received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. Counsel had no duty to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments or to request an instruction concerning the collateral estoppel effect of the verdict in appellant\u2019s first trial. The collateral estoppel argument was incorrect for the reasons we have already stated. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise an objection that lacked merit or to request an instruction that is an incorrect statement of the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cudjo </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 585, 616 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 863 P.2d 635].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">[[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\n<em>Response to Federal Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">As indicated, the United States District Court for the Central District of California adopted the report and recommendation of a United States Magistrate Judge (hereafter, the federal opinion) granting appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. It vacated appellant\u2019s conviction because our harmless error analysis in the first appeal was \u201cperfunctory\u201d and \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d We have an obligation to respond to the federal opinion. The comments made by Division Two nearly 40 years ago in <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 194 [149 Cal.Rptr. 204] are apt. There, when confronted with a federal trial court order to show cause on a habeas corpus petition, the court said, \u201cWe consider the order by the federal district court to be an affront to the judges of the courts of this state.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The present matter is worse. Here, there is a full opinion condemning the harmless error analysis as \u201cperfunctory\u201d and \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The former statement is, at the very least, disrespectful, and raises the issue of integrity. The Court of Appeal has a \u201c \u2018bounden duty to protect the integrity of [the] court.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018However willing [the individual judge or justice] may be to forego the private injury [to reputation], the obligation is upon him by his oath to maintain the respect due to the court \u201d <em>(In re Ciraolo </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 389, 394-395 [74 Cal.Rptr. 865, 450 P.2d 241]; see <em>In re Buckley </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 237, 249 [110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201].) We understand that the federal courts have the power and right to vacate state court final judgments. Having the power and right does not make it right. .</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The California Court of Appeal is tasked with many duties. One of them is to follow our state\u2019s constitutional mandate to reverse a judgment if a miscarriage of justice has occurred. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13.) Any harmless error analysis involves both a legal and a factual appraisal. To some extent, the Court of Appeal is called upon to weigh the facts in deciding whether a conviction should be reversed. Such a factual determination of that question is apparently entitled to no weight in the central district. The federal opinion cited cases stating that the standard of review in a habeas corpus case is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and requires that a state court decision be \u201cgiven the benefit of the doubt.\u201d (See <em>Lindh v. Murphy </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 320, 336 [138 L.Ed.2d 481, 117 S.Ct. 2059] <em>Woodford v. Visciotti </em>(2002) 537 U.S. 19, 24 [154 L.Ed.2d 27, 123 S.Ct. 357].) It does neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The original opinion stated that the trial court should not have instructed the jury that second degree murder is a general intent crime. It stated this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, citing <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824], as well as two controlling California Supreme Court opinions and one California Court of Appeal opinion, to support our legal and factual determination that any deficiency in the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury was harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swain </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 593, 601-603 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 909 P.2d 994]; <em>People v.

Lyons </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1456, 1462 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In reaching this ruling, the original opinion did not denigrate the instructional phase of a trial. It seemed obvious, however, that in this fact-specific case, no amount of jury instruction would change the basic facts or alter their legal significance. After the initial confrontation, appellant announced he would be back to kill the victim and his companions with guns or knives. He went home, armed himself with a knife, and returned. He confronted the victim\u2019s companions. The victim came out of the store. Consistent with appellant\u2019s earlier announced intention of killing someone, he fatally stabbed the unarmed victim in the chest. This sounds like murder. The objective reader will make up his or her own mind. Given these stark facts, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>court\u2019s single and erroneous use of the legal term of art, \u201cgeneral criminal intent,\u201d could not have adversely affected the jury\u2019s deliberations or verdict. Thus, the original opinion concluded the instructional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">To grant the writ of habeas corpus, by contrast, the federal opinion had to adopt a factual premise that even it characterized as \u201cimplausible.\u201d Adopting one version of the defense theory at trial, the federal opinion concluded it was possible the victim \u201cinflicted the mortal wound on himself as he charged Petitioner, who was holding the knife in his outstretched arm.\u201d Based on the totality of facts and circumstances, and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, we would go even farther. The defense theory was not just \u201cimplausible,\u201d it was preposterous. This scenario would not even work if the victim was Jesse Owens reincarnate, sprinting toward appellant with his chest jutting out, so that a stationary kitchen knife could penetrate six inches into his thoracic cavity and heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The implausibility of the defense theory lead us to the original and terse harmless error analysis. In theory, any legal analysis by any court could be longer. Here it was unnecessary. The original opinion\u2019s treatment of appellant\u2019s contentions was not \u201cperfunctory.\u201d This word is defined as; \u201cdone or acting routinely and with little interest or care.\u201d (American Heritage Diet. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 922.) The original opinion was not routinely written with little interest or care.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Apart from the \u201c \u2018bounden duty to protect [and defend] the integrity of [the] court,\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Ciraolo, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 389, 394) there is another reason why this response is appropriate. The questioned harmless error analysis is not an aberration in the Second Appellate District. It is a typical analysis and thus, the issue transcends the present matter. If the former harmless error analysis was faulty, other similar analyses from our court are also vulnerable to successful collateral attack in the central district. We hope that is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Finally we disagree with the federal opinion\u2019s conclusion that the harmless error analysis was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Based upon the facts, circumstances, and the reasonable inferences which flow therefrom, the objective reader will make up his or her own mind. Nothing in <em>Ho </em>v. <em>Carey </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 332 F.3d 587 or <em>Inthavong v. Lamarque </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 420 F.3d 1055, 1059 compelled the grant of habeas corpus relief and the vacation of the original murder conviction. To the extent that these cases stand for the proposition that habeas corpus relief is required as a matter of law, they work as a judicial repeal of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub.L. No. 104-132 (Apr. 24, 1996) 110 Stat. 1214). \u201cThis situation . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>is a good example of why the criminal justice system is so often criticized for failing to achieve certainty and finality in its judgments.\u201d' <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. 199.)
