Under the original version of the three strikes law a recidivist with two or more prior strikes who is convicted of any new felony is subject to an indeterminate life sentence. The Act diluted the three strikes law by reserving the life sentence for cases where the current crime is a serious or violent felony or the prosecution has pled and proved an enumerated disqualifying factor. In all other cases, the recidivist will be sentenced as a second strike offender. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, 1170.12.) The Act also created a postconviction release proceeding whereby a prisoner who is serving an indeterminate life sentence imposed pursuant to the three strikes law for a crime that is not a serious or violent felony and who is not disqualified, may have his or her sentence recalled and be sentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126.)\u201d <em>(People v. Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 167-168 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901].)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">After the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (the Act or Proposition 36) went into effect, Florentino Felix Osuna (defendant), an inmate serving a term of 25 years to life in prison following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined by \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition to recall sentence, seeking resentencing under the Act. The trial court determined defendant did not qualify (was ineligible) for resentencing and denied the petition. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">In the published portion of this opinion, we hold (1) disqualifying factors need not be pled and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>there are facts in the record of conviction that show an inmate was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d\u2014had the firearm available for immediate offensive or defensive use\u2014during the commission of his or her current offense, the inmate is disqualified from resentencing under the Act even though he or she was convicted of possessing the firearm, and not of being armed with it; and (3) being \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d \u201cduring the commission of the current offense,\u201d for purposes of the Act, does not require the possession be \u201ctethered\u201d to, or have some \u201cfacilitative nexus\u201d to, an underlying felony. In the unpublished portion, we hold that a trial court\u2019s order finding a defendant not eligible for resentencing is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">On the morning of November 5, 2009, defendant, who was driving Yvette Zendejas\u2019s car, sped through a school zone at approximately 55 miles per hour and refused to yield to an officer who attempted to pull him over. When defendant finally stopped and got out of the car, he was holding a black handgun in his left hand. He ran down the street and climbed over a fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Officers established a perimeter. Approximately 20 minutes later, defendant stepped out of Zendejas\u2019s house, which was inside the perimeter, and was arrested. Defendant denied having a gun and said he had been carrying a cell phone. Officers searching the home found a nine-millimeter handgun in an air-conditioning duct. The gun\u2019s magazine was missing. Officers searching outside the home found a loaded nine-millimeter magazine in the direct path from the fence over which defendant climbed to the house. Officers searching the car found a second nine-millimeter magazine and a coin purse containing additional live nine-millimeter ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">On February 23, 2010, a jury convicted defendant of being a felon in possession of a firearm (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1), now see \u00a7 29800, subd. (a)(1)) and obstructing a peace officer in the performance of his or her duties (\u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant was found to have suffered seven prior \u201cstrike\u201d convictions. On April 6, 2010, he was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>On March 4, 2013, defendant petitioned the trial court for a recall of sentence pursuant to section 1170.126. The People opposed the petition on the ground defendant was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d during the commission of his current offense and was therefore disqualified from further consideration for resentencing. The People argued the facts of defendant\u2019s current offense demonstrated he was armed during commission of that offense; that factual determination need only be made by a preponderance of the evidence and did not include a pleading and proof requirement, so <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi) </em>was inapplicable; the existence of disqualifying factors was not based on proving or imposing an enhancement, or on the existence of an offense separate from possession of a firearm; and legislative history supported the conclusion defendant was armed. Defendant took the opposite position, specifically arguing simple possession of a firearm was not the same as being armed with a firearm, and the record did not show defendant had a firearm available for offensive or defensive purposes; \u201carming\u201d required a \u201ctethering felony\u201d; and the drafters of the Act did not intend that a conviction for violating section 12021 would make otherwise eligible defendants ineligible for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On June 24, 2013, a hearing was held on defendant\u2019s petition. The trial court concluded, based on the facts adduced at the trial of defendant\u2019s current offense, that jurors necessarily found defendant personally possessed the firearm and had it available for offensive or defensive use; consequently, defendant was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of the Act and so was ineligible for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">I. <em>The trial court\u2019s ruling is </em>appealable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">II. <em>Defendant was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of the Act, neither tethering nor a facilitative nexus need be shown, and the trial court did not violate pleading and proof requirements or rules of statutory construction by finding him disqualified from resentencing as a result.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Insofar as is pertinent to this appeal, an inmate is ineligible for resentencing under the Act if his or her current sentence was \u201cimposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>(C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2).) Thus, an inmate is disqualified from resentencing if, inter alia, \u201c[d]uring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\u201cArmed with a firearm\u201d has been statutorily defined and judicially construed to mean having a firearm available for use, either offensively or defensively. (E.g., \u00a7 1203.06, subd. (b)(3); Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.1, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 991, 997 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 898 P.2d 391] <em>(Bland) </em>[construing \u00a7 12022].) \u201cThe enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted\u201d <em>(People v. Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 844 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380]), \u201cand to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 321, 329 [256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078]). \u201cThis principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Weidert, supra, </em>at p. 844.)</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Where, as here, \u201cthe language of a statute uses terms that have been judicially construed, ' \u201cthe presumption is almost irresistible\u201d \u2019 that the terms have been used ' \u201cin the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] This principle [likewise] applies to legislation adopted through the initiative process. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Weidert, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at pp. 845-846.)  Accordingly, we conclude the electorate intended \u201carmed with a firearm,\u201d as that phrase is used in the Act, to mean having a firearm available for offensive or defensive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Defendant\u2019s current conviction was for violating section 12021, subdivision (a)(1), which makes it a felony for a person previously convicted of a felony to own, purchase, receive, or have in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control, any firearm. The elements of this offense are conviction of a felony and ownership or knowing possession, custody, or control of a firearm. <em>(People v. Snyder </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 590, 592 [186 Cal.Rptr. 485, 652 P.2d 42]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jeffers </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 917, 922 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 86].) \u201cA defendant possesses a weapon when it is under his dominion and control. [Citation.] A defendant has actual possession when the weapon is in his immediate possession or control. He has constructive possession when the weapon, while not in his actual possession, is nonetheless under his dominion and control, either directly or through others. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Pe\u00f1a </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1083-1084 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 656].) \u201cImplicitly, the crime is committed the instant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>felon in any way has a firearm within his control.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ratcliff </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1401, 1410 [273 Cal.Rptr. 253], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">A firearm can be under a person\u2019s dominion and control without it being available for use. For example, suppose a parolee\u2019s residence (in which only he lives) is searched and a firearm is found next to his bed. The parolee is in possession of the firearm, because it is under his dominion and control. If he is not home at the time, however, he is not armed with the firearm, because it is not readily available to him for offensive or defensive use. Accordingly, possessing a firearm does not necessarily constitute being armed with a firearm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The facts in defendant\u2019s case, however, support a finding he had a firearm available for offensive or defensive use. According to the appellate opinion affirming the conviction, which we may properly consider <em>(People v. Woodell </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 448, 456-457 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 950 P.2d 85]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Trujillo </em>(2006) 40 Cal.4th 165, 180-181 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 718, 146 P.3d 1259]), defendant was actually holding a handgun when he first got out of the car. Thus, factually he was \u201carmed with a firearm\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Defendant does not expressly dispute this. He contends, however, that for disqualification under the Act, there must be an underlying felony to which the firearm possession is \u201ctethered\u201d or to which it has some \u201cfacilitative nexus.\u201d He concludes one cannot be armed with a firearm during the commission of possession of the same firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Defendant would be correct if we were concerned with imposition of an arming enhancement\u2014an additional term of imprisonment added to the base term, for which a defendant cannot be punished until and unless convicted of a related substantive offense. <em>(People v. Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 500 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035]; see <em>People v. Izaguirre </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 126, 134 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 148, 164 P.3d 578].) In <em>Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 991, the California Supreme Court construed the enhancement contained in section 12022, which imposes an additional prison term for anyone \u201carmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>with a firearm in the commission of\u2019 a felony. The court concluded that \u201ca defendant convicted of a possessory drag offense [is] subject to this \u2018arming\u2019 enhancement when the defendant possesses both drugs and a gun, and keeps them together, but is not present when the police seize them from the defendant\u2019s house.\u201d <em>(Bland, supra, </em>at p. 995.) The court elaborated:</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201c[Contemporaneous possession of illegal drugs and a firearm will satisfy the statutory requirement of being \u2018armed with a firearm in the commission\u2019 of felony drug possession only if the evidence shows a nexus or link between the firearm and the drugs. The federal courts, in interpreting the federal counterpart to California\u2019s weapons enhancement law [citation], have described this link as a \u2018facilitative nexus\u2019 between the drugs and the gun. [Citation.] Under federal law, which imposes specified prison terms for using or carrying a firearm \u2018 \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d \u2019 a crime of drug trafficking, \u2018the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.\u2019 [Citation.] So too in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\u201c. . . [F]or a defendant <em>to be subject to additional punishment for being armed with a firearm, </em>California law requires the \u2018arming\u2019 to be \u2018in the commission or attempted commission\u2019 of the underlying felony. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1).) With respect to felony drug possession, a defendant is armed \u2018in the commission\u2019 of that crime so long as the defendant had the firearm available for use in furtherance of the drug offense at some point during the defendant\u2019s possession of the drugs. Thus, by specifying that the added penalty applies only if the defendant is armed with a firearm \u2018in the commission\u2019 of the felony offense, section 12022 implicitly requires <em>both </em>that the \u2018arming\u2019 take place during the underlying crime <em>and </em>that it have some \u2018facilitative nexus\u2019 to that offense. Evidence that a firearm is kept in close proximity to illegal drugs satisfies this \u2018facilitative nexus\u2019 requirement: a firearm\u2019s presence near a drug cache gives rise to the inference that the person in possession of the drugs kept the weapon close at hand for \u2018ready access\u2019 to aid in the drug offense.\u201d <em>(Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1002, italics added &amp; omitted; see <em>In re Tameka C. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 190, 197-198 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 730, 990 P.2d 603] [\u201cin the commission of\u2019 a felony, as used in \u00a7 12022.5, means during and in furtherance of the felony].)</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">As <em>Bland </em>makes clear, for a defendant to be \u201carmed\u201d for purposes of section 12022\u2019s additional penalties, he or she must have a firearm \u201cavailable for use <em>to further the commission of the underlying felony.\u201d (Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 999, italics added.) \u201c[W]hen the underlying felony is a continuing offense, it is sufficient if the defendant has a gun available at any time during the felony <em>to aid in its commission. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Becker </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 294, 297 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 354], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Having a gun available does not further or aid in the commission of the crime of possession of a firearm by a felon. Thus, a defendant convicted of violating section 12021 does not, regardless of the facts of the offense, risk imposition of additional punishment pursuant to section 12022, because there is no \u201cfacilitative nexus\u201d between the arming and the possession. However, unlike section 12022, which requires that a defendant be armed <em>\u201cin </em>the commission of\u2019 a felony for additional punishment to be imposed (italics added), the Act disqualifies an inmate from eligibility for lesser punishment if he or she was armed with a firearm <em>\u201cduring </em>the commission of\u2019 the current offense (italics added). \u201cDuring\u201d is variously defined as \u201cthroughout the continuance or course of\u2019 or \u201cat some point in the course of.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Diet. (1986) p. 703.) In other words, it requires a temporal nexus between the arming and the underlying felony, not a facilitative one. The two are not the same. <em>{Bland, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1002 [\u201c \u2018in the commission\u2019 of\u2019 requires both that \u201c \u2018arming\u2019 \u201d occur during underlying crime <em>and </em>that it have facilitative nexus to offense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\"><em>In re Pritchett </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1754 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 296] illustrates the difference. Pritchett struck his former girlfriend on the head with the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun. He was convicted of possessing the gun under former section 12020, subdivision (a), and his sentence was enhanced, pursuant to section 12022.5, subdivision (a), for use of the firearm in commission of that offense. <em>{Pritchett, supra, </em>at pp. 1755-1756.) On appeal, the People argued the enhancement was valid, because Pritchett used the shotgun to strike the victim in the commission of possessing the gun. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1757.) The Court of Appeal disagreed, explaining: \u201cAlthough Pritchett used the shotgun as a club <em>during </em>his possession of it, he did not use it \u2018in the commission\u2019 of his crime of possession. Possession was complete without use of the shotgun. In addition to possessing it, he did use it, but using it as a club in no way furthered the crime of possession.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Following this reasoning, defendant was armed with a firearm <em>during </em>his possession of the gun, but not \u201cin the commission\u201d of his crime of possession. There was no facilitative nexus; his having the firearm available for use did not further his illegal possession of it. There was, however, a temporal nexus. Since the Act uses the phrase \u201c[d]uring the commission of the current offense,\u201d and not in the commission of the current offense (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iii), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(iii)), and since at issue is not the imposition of additional punishment but rather eligibility for reduced punishment, we conclude the literal language of the Act disqualifies an inmate from resentencing if he or she was armed with a firearm during the unlawful possession of that firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Defendant says, however, that under the language of the pertinent statutes, \u201ca defendant is ineligible for resentencing only where an enhancement . . . has been pled and proved.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">As amended by the Act, the three strikes law provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f a defendant has two or more prior serious and/or violent felony convictions as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 that have been pled and proved, and the current offense is not [a serious or violent felony as defined in the three strikes law, the defendant shall be sentenced as a second strike offender] <em>unless the prosecution pleads and proves </em>any of the following: [f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [][] (iii) During the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C), italics added, 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C), italics added.) Thus, when an initial sentencing for a current offense is at issue, there is a clear statutory pleading and proof requirement with respect to factors that disqualify a defendant with two or more prior strike convictions from sentencing as a second strike offender. <em>(People v. Yearwood, supra, </em>213 , Cal.App.4th at p. 170; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kaulick) </em>(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1303, fn. 26 [155 Cal.Rptr.3d 856] <em>(Kaulick).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Fairly read, however, section 1170.126 does not impose the same requirements in connection with the procedure for determining whether an inmate already sentenced as a third strike offender is eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender. (See <em>Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1298-1299, fn. 21.) Subdivision (e) of section 1170.126 provides: \u201cAn inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [f] . . . [][] (2) The inmate\u2019s current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\u201d This language refers specifically to the disqualifying factors, and does not incorporate the pleading and proof requirements contained in other portions of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C). Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, such a construction neither creates an ambiguity where none existed nor reads the pleading and proof requirement out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Defendant points out that his current sentence was \u201cnot imposed for any of the offenses appearing\u201d in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(i) through (iii) or section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2)(C)(i) through (iii), as stated in section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2). We recognize this is the literal language of the statute. The literal language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the lawmakers\u2019 intent, however. <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299]; <em>People v.

We do not regard the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2) as indicating an intent to require a tethering offense, or the pleading and proof of an enhancement (which, as we have seen, is <em>not </em>an offense), in order to trigger the disqualifying factors contained in subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iii) of section 667 and subdivision (c)(2)(C)(iii) of section 1170.12. As previously set out, those factors are: \u201cDuring the commission of the current offense, the defendant used a firearm, was armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.\u201d We are aware of no provision criminalizing, or permitting imposition of an additional sentence for, the mere intent to cause great bodily injury to another person. Moreover, the drafters of the initiative knew how to require a tethering offense or enhancement if desired. (See \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(i) [disqualifying inmate if current offense is controlled substance charge in which enumerated enhancement allegation was admitted or found true], 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(C)(i) [same].) Thus, we believe the electorate intended the disqualifying factors to have a broader reach than defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute would give them.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\u201cIn interpreting a voter initiative like [the Act], we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.

[Citations.] When the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. [Citations.] When the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, however, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007-1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].)

But . . . \u2018that rule applies \u201conly if two reasonable interpretations of the statute stand in relative equipoise.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The rule of lenity does not apply every time there are two or more reasonable interpretations of a penal statute. [Citation.] Rather, the rule applies \u201c \u2018only if the court can do no more than guess what the legislative body intended; there must be an <em>egregious </em>ambiguity and uncertainty to justify invoking the rule.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Nuckles </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 601, 611 [155 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 298 P.3d 867].) \u201cFurther, ambiguities are not interpreted in the defendant\u2019s favor if such an interpretation would provide an absurd result, or a result inconsistent with apparent legislative intent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

(c)(2)(C)(iii), and as disqualifies an inmate from resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2), extends to situations in which the defendant was convicted of violating section 12021 but also had the firearm he or she was convicted of possessing available for use, either offensively or defensively. This is so even when we take into account section 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2)\u2019s proviso that an inmate is eligible for resentencing if his or her current sentence was \u201cnot imposed for any of the offenses appearing\u201d in those clauses of sections 667 and 1170.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The purpose of the three strikes law has been variously stated as being \u201c \u2018to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>felony offenses\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Young </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 900, 909 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 48, 87 P.3d 797]) and \u201cto promote the state\u2019s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing recidivism\u201d <em>(People v. Gipson </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1070 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 478]). Although the Act \u201cdiluted\u201d the three strikes law somewhat <em>(People v. Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167), \u201c[enhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 175).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In enacting section 1170.126 as part of Proposition 36, the issue before the voters was not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular aspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for a lesser term. By including as a disqualifying factor an inmate\u2019s mere intent, during commission of the current offense, to cause great bodily injury to another person, the electorate signaled its own intent that disqualifying conduct not be limited to what is specifically punishable as an offense or enhancement. Apparently recognizing the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u2014the expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed <em>(Gikas v. Zolin </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 841, 852 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 500, 863 P.2d 745])\u2014voters rendered ineligible for resentencing not only narrowly drawn categories of third strike offenders who committed particular, specified offenses or types of offenses, but also broadly inclusive categories of offenders who, during commission of their crimes\u2014and regardless of those crimes\u2019 basic statutory elements\u2014used a firearm, were armed with a firearm or deadly weapon, or intended to cause great bodily injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">That such a construction comports with voters\u2019 intent is supported by the ballot materials related to Proposition 36. The \u201cOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\u201d stated in part that the initiative \u201c[c]ontinues to impose life sentence penalty if third strike conviction was for certain nonserious, nonviolent sex or drug offenses <em>or involved firearm </em>possession.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) official title and summary, p. 48, italics added.) In summarizing then existing law, the legislative analysis of Proposition 36 listed, as examples of violent felonies, murder, robbery, and rape; as felonies that were serious but not violent, assault with intent to commit robbery; and as felonies not classified as violent or serious, grand theft <em>(not </em>involving a firearm) and possession of a controlled substance. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 36 by Legis. Analyst, p. 48.) In summarizing how the initiative measure would shorten sentences for some third strikers, the Legislative Analyst explained there would be some exceptions to the shorter sentence: \u201cSpecifically, the measure requires that if the offender has committed certain new or prior offenses, including some drug-, sex-, <em>and gun-related felonies, </em>he or she would still be subject to a life sentence under the three strikes law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 49, italics added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>legislative analysis further described how certain current third strikers would be resentenced, but explained that Proposition 36 \u201climits eligibility for resentencing to third strikers whose current offense is nonserious, non-violent and who have not committed specified current and prior offenses, such as certain drug-, sex-, <em>and gun-related felonies.\u201d </em>(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>at p. 50, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In their \u201cARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 36,\u201d the measure\u2019s proponents spoke in terms of making the punishment fit the crime, saving California money, and making room in prison for dangerous felons. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 36, p. 52.) In their \u201cREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 36,\u201d the proponents stated, in part: \u201cProp. 36 requires that murderers, rapists, child molesters, <em>and other dangerous criminals </em>serve their full sentences, [f] . . . PO Today, dangerous criminals are being released early from prison because jails are overcrowded with <em>nonviolent offenders who pose no risk to the public. </em>Prop. 36 prevents dangerous criminals from being released early. <em>People convicted of shoplifting a pair of socks, stealing bread or baby formula don\u2019t deserve life sentences.\u201d </em>(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 36, p. 53, italics added &amp; omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Section 1 of the proposed law found and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cThe People enact the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 to restore the original intent of California\u2019s Three Strikes law\u2014imposing life sentences for <em>dangerous criminals </em>like rapists, murderers, and child molesters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\u201cThis act will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201c(1) Require that murderers, rapists, and child molesters serve their full sentences\u2014they will receive life sentences, even if they are convicted of a new minor third strike crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201c(2) Restore the Three Strikes law to the public\u2019s original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a defendant\u2019s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">\u201c(3) Maintain that repeat offenders convicted of <em>non-violent, non-serious crimes like shoplifting and simple drug possession </em>will receive twice the normal sentence instead of a life sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">\u201c(4) Save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year for at least 10 years.

Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of proposed law, \u00a7 1, p. 105, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The foregoing materials expressly distinguished between dangerous criminals who were deserving of life sentences, and petty criminals (such as shoplifters and those convicted of simple drug possession) who posed little or no risk to the public and did not deserve life sentences. It is clear the electorate\u2019s intent was not to throw open the prison doors to <em>all </em>third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public. A felon who has been convicted of two or more serious and/or violent felonies in the past, and most recently had a firearm readily available for use, simply does not pose little or no risk to the public. \u201c[T]he threat presented by a firearm increases in direct proportion to its accessibility. Obviously, a firearm that is available for use as a weapon creates the very real danger it will be used.\u201d <em>(People v. Mendival </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 562, 573 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In light of the clear evidence of voters\u2019 intent, we reject the claims that disqualification for resentencing under Proposition 36 requires an underlying offense or enhancement to have been pled and proved, and that a conviction for possession of a firearm cannot constitute being \u201carmed\u201d with a firearm for eligibility purposes. We further conclude disqualifying factors need not be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt where eligibility for resentencing under section 1170.126 is concerned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 provides that, \u201c[u]pon receiving a petition for recall of sentence under this section, <em>the court shall determine </em>whether the petitioner satisfies the criteria in subdivision (e).\u201d (Italics added.) We see no reason to depart from the literal language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Of course, constitutional requirements supersede statutory language.  Considered in conjunction with each other, the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require that each element of a crime or sentence enhancement be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(United States v. Gaudin </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 506, 509-510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>[115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444]; <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 616, 631 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 485].) \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Apprendi, </em>supra, 530 U.S. at p. 490.) This is so whether the fact increases the statutory maximum penalty or a mandatory minimum penalty. <em>(Alleyne </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2013) 570 U.S._,_[133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160].) \u201cJuries must find any facts that increase either the statutory maximum or minimum because the Sixth Amendment applies where a finding of fact both alters the legally prescribed range <em>and </em>does so in a way that aggravates the penalty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._, fn. 2 [133 S.Ct. at p. 2161, fn. 2].) \u201cWhen a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense and must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[133 S.Ct. at p. 2162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\"><em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny do not apply to a determination of eligibility for resentencing under the Act. As the Court of Appeal explained in <em>Kaulick, </em>supra, 215 Cal.App.4th 1279:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">\u201cThe maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was originally sentenced. While Proposition 36 presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">\u201cMoreover, the United States Supreme Court has already concluded that its opinions regarding a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward sentence modifications due to intervening laws. <em>(Dillon v. United States </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 817, [828] [177 L.Ed.2d 271, 130 S.Ct. 2683] <em>(Dillon).) </em>At issue in <em>Dillon </em>was a modification to the sentencing guideline range for the offense of which the defendant was convicted. The law provided that a prisoner\u2019s sentence could be modified downward when the range had been lowered; however, the law provided that a sentence could only be lowered if consistent with applicable policy statements. . . . The Supreme Court had already held that, in order to avoid constitutional problems, the federal sentencing guidelines were advisory, rather than mandatory. The issue in <em>Dillon </em>was whether the policy statement, which did not permit reducing a sentence below the amended range except to the extent the original term was below the original range, must also be rendered advisory. <em>(Id. </em>at p. [819].) The Supreme Court concluded that it remained mandatory. This was so because the statute allowing resentencing when the sentencing range was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>lowered was, itself, not a plenary resentencing in the usual sense. Instead, the statute simply authorized a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. [826].) The court stated, \u2018Notably, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized by [the statute] are not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no constitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles defendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the benefit of subsequent Guidelines amendments. Rather [the statute] represents a congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines. []Q Viewed that way, proceedings under [this statute] do not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge at a [modification downward] proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion within that range.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. [828].) Such decisions, stated the court, simply do not implicate Sixth Amendment rights. (560 U.S. at [pp. 828-829].)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\u201cThe language in <em>Dillon </em>is equally applicable here. The retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not provide for wholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at such a proceeding ... do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1303-1305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">We recognize that <em>Kaulick </em>was concerned with a trial court\u2019s discretionary determination whether an inmate who was eligible for resentencing nevertheless should not be resentenced due to his or her dangerousness. Its reasoning applies with equal force to the initial eligibility determination, however. A finding an inmate is not eligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 does not increase or aggravate that individual\u2019s sentence; rather, it leaves him or her subject to the sentence originally imposed. The trial court\u2019s determination here that defendant was armed with a firearm during the commission of his current offense did not increase the penalty to which defendant was already subject, but instead disqualified defendant from an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which defendant was not constitutionally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Because a determination of eligibility under section 1170.126 does not implicate the Sixth Amendment, a trial court need only find the existence of a disqualifying factor by a preponderance of the evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 115; see <em>Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305 [addressing determination of dangerousness].) The record in this case amply established defendant was disqualified from resentencing as a second strike offender because he was armed with a firearm during the commission of his current offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Levy, Acting P.
