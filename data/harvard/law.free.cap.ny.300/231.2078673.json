The purpose of the street-opening project was to connect Broadway with the village business district located along Central Avenue \u2014 the next parallel street to the north. To accomplish that end the village board instituted this proceeding for the acquisition of all lands lying within Frost Lane, owned by the nonappealing defendants, and three additional parcels of outlying land. Of those three outlying parcels we are concerned upon this appeal with only two.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Formerly Frost Lane for its entire length of 481 feet extended along the east line of a 3-acre plot of land constituting an extensive residence property owned by an estate represented by the appellant Gottesman. No land was taken from the Gottesman property by the present proceeding except a small triangular parcel located at the southerly end of Frost Lane, having a frontage of 20 feet on Broadway and a depth along Frost Lane of 140 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The second parcel of land taken was owned by the appellant Lawrence-Pinewood Corp.\u2014 a corporation of which the appellant Gottesman is the sole stockholder. This second parcel has a frontage of 50 feet on the southerly side of Central Avenue and a depth of 226.60 feet extending south to a point where it meets the northerly or dead end of former Frost Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">At County Court an award by the commissioners of appraisal to the appellant Gottesman in the amount of $6,010 was confirmed. That award included $1,050 for the taking of the triangular parcel mentioned above and \u2014 incidental to such taking \u2014 four items totaling $4,960 which covered allowances for trees, shrubs and fencing removed and the cost of relocating gateposts and a short segment of an entrance driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">County Court also confirmed an award of $11,287 to the defendant-appellant Lawrence-Pinewood Corp. in payment for the parcel of land having a frontage on Central Avenue and extending southerly to the dead end of former Frost Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Upon separate appeals to the Appellate Division by the defendants Gottesman and Lawrence-Pinewood Corp., the order of County Court was unanimously affirmed. The case comes to us, by our leave, upon a single notice of appeal by the appellants Gottesman and Lawrence-Pinewood Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The appellants do not question the items which in total comprise the sum of $6,010 awarded in connection with the taking of the small triangle of land from the Gottesman property. However, on that branch of the case the appellants assert that the commissioners of appraisal erred by failing to award the owners of that property substantial consequential damages due, according to their claim, to a loss of privacy caused by changing Frost Lane from its former character as a dead-end, private way into a public thoroughfare. As, to that item of alleged damage the record discloses that after viewing the Gottesman property and receiving evidence offered in support of and opposed to the claim for consequential damages the commissioners included in their report the statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u201c We further report that in making the determination as hereinabove stated, we were mindful of the general principles which govern the making of awards under the Condemnation Law; that claimants are entitled to just compensation for the land taken from them and that the Village of Lawrence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>required to pay no more than the fair and reasonable market value on the date of the taking; <em>that where part of a larger tract of land is taken, a claimant is entitled to consequential damages, if any caused to such residue by reason of the </em>taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u2018 \u2018 With respect to Parcel 0 [the triangle of land at intersection of Broadway and Frost Lane], we found that the claimant did not sustain any consequential damages to the remainder of the property owned by the claimant, The Gottesman Trust, as a result of the taking of said Parcel * * * .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Insofar as that excerpt from the commissioners\u2019 report contains a statement of the law which governed their determination of appellants\u2019 claim for consequential damages, we think it accords with applicable rulings by this court. <em>(South Buffalo Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Kirkover, </em>176 N. Y. 301; <em>Town of Fallsburg </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>260 App. Div. 532, 533, affd. 286 N. Y. 594; <em>Matter of City of New York [East Riv. Drive], </em>264 App. Div. 555, 560, affd. 298 N. Y. 843.) Insofar as the report by the commissioners is a factual determination of damages suffered by the Gottesman property due to the taking of the small triangle of land and any consequential damages resulting therefrom, the order of the Appellate Division affirming the confirmatory order of County Court is not within our power to review. (N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We come then to the problem which prompted us to grant leave to appeal. That problem involves an evidentiary ruling made by the commissioners during their receipt of evidence bearing upon damages incurred by the appellant Lawrence-Pinewood Corp. by the taking of its lot fronting on Central Avenue. By that ruling there came into the record, over the appellants\u2019 objection and exception, testimony by an expert called by the village who, on direct examination, stated the purchase price paid on two sales of comparable property in the neighborhood. The challenged testimony is not criticized as referable to sales too remote in time or involving property too remote in location; nor is it argued that the two sales involved property not fairly comparable to the subject lot. Indeed, the two sales to which the testimony referred involved lots which were vacant \u2014 as was' the Lawrence-Pinewood Corp. lot \u2014 one of which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>located 50 feet away from the subject lot and was sold two and one-half years prior to the appropriation date. The other lot was slightly more remote but only 350 feet away from the appellants\u2019 lot and was sold within three and one-half months of the appropriation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The objection interposed by the appellants on the hearing and now urged upon this appeal is that an expert witness called for the purpose of proving value may not testify on <em>direct-ex </em>animation as to sales prices of other comparable property in the neighborhood because, we are told, such evidence presents collateral issues involving a variety of considerations. We are mindful that such was the rule \u2014 and such was the reason given for that rule \u2014 in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>New York Elevated R. R. Co. </em>(175 N. Y. 219, 222). (See, also, <em>Jamieson </em>v. <em>Kings County Elevated Ry. Co., </em>147 N. Y. 322, 325; <em>Matter of Thompson, </em>127 N. Y. 463, 468-469; <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill, </em>118 N. Y. 365, 378, 379.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We note, however, that adherence to the <em>Robinson </em>case rule <em>{supra), </em>now invoked by the appellants, has not been consistently maintained. Legislatively, a definite trend is discernible toward permitting proof of value by direct evidence of sales of comparable property in the neighborhood. (See Court of Claims Act, \u00a7 16; Public Housing Law, \u00a7 125, subd. 4; Tax Law, \u00a7 293; Village Law, \u00a7 318-a; Decedent Estate Law, \u00a7 122; Debtor and Creditor Law, \u00a7 24; Administrative Code of City of New York, \u00a7 B15-16.0.) A like trend judicially, within our own jurisdiction, is also discernible. . (See <em>Heiman </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>272 N. Y. 83, 88; <em>Matter of Board of Water Supply of City of N. Y., </em>277 N. Y. 452, 457-459; <em>Matter of City of New York [Newtown </em>Creek], 284 N. Y. 493, 498, 501; <em>People ex rel. Parklin Operating Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>287 N. Y. 126, 129; also cases in foreign jurisdictions collated in 2 Wigmore on Evidence [3d ed.], \u00a7 463, pp. 503-512; Orgel on \"Valuation under Eminent Domain, \u00a7\u00a7 135, 139-148; \u201c The Unrealistic Buie Excluding Testimony as to Comparable Sales in Condemnation \u201d by John E. Egan, 66 Beport of New York State Bar Assn., p. 232 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">We have considered the implications fairly to be drawn from those legislative and judicial trends away from the <em>Robinson </em>case rule <em>{supra), </em>in the light of the reason given for that ruling. That reason was not the irrelevancy of testimony as to sales of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>comparable property but rather \u2014 as said in the opinion at page 222 <em>\u201411 </em>* * * to permit evidence of the rental or fee value of other premises would raise in each case a collateral issue to be tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We no longer adhere to the rule which was decisive in the <em>Robinson </em>case <em>(supra). </em>Although conditions prevalent during the cluttered era of the elevated railroad litigation \u2014 when the statement last quoted above was written \u2014\u25a0 may have supplied the reason for the ruling then made, we know of no conditions affecting the trial of cases today which warrant the exclusion of relevant testimony in favor of trial expediency. Upon this problem the terse comment by Judge Holmes, as he then was, is apposite \u2014 <em>\u201c * * * </em>so far as the introduction of collateral issues goes, that objection is a purely practical one, a concession to the shortness of life.\u201d <em>(Reeve </em>v. <em>Dennett, </em>145 Mass. 23, 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"Amd\">Value, in a commercial sense, is the money estimate of marketable property. Where, as here, the inquiry goes to the market value of a parcel of vacant land taken by condemnation, we believe that evidence of sales of other comparable land in the vicinity, reasonably near in point of time to the appropriation date, may properly be received on direct examination as a criterion in evaluating the land in controversy. In short, proof of the price paid for one is relevant in arriving at the value of the other. \u201c \u2018 A non-compulsory sale between a willing seller and buyer is ordinarily regarded as a good test or criterion * * * in determining the value of the land in controversy. The opinion of the buying public so expressed in a free market is what usually determines value.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Epstein </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authority, </em>317 Mass. 297, 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Instances there may be where proof of sales of comparable, property may prompt a line of inquiry which will develop collateral issues likely to confuse the fact-finders and prolong the trial. We regard such disadvantages, however, as more than compensated by the benefit to be gained by the receipt of such evidence subject to the exercise, by the tribunal which fixes value, of its discretionary power to draw the line of exclusion wherever confusion is created by collateral issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">We are thus led to conclude that, in that branch of the case involving the award to the defendant Lawrence-Pinewood Corp., the admission, over defendants\u2019 objection and exception, of evidence given on direct examination of the purchase prices paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>on sales of other comparable parcels of land in the vicinity and within reasonable time from the appropriation date, Was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Loughban, Oh. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Fuld and Bromley, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
