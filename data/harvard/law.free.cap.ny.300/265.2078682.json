The court erred as a matter of law in holding that the city was free from liability to New York Dock Company, that the elevated roadway constituted a street use, and that there had been no taking of easements. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Cress, </em>243 U.

The evidence amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the highway improvement will not damage appellant\u2019s property. <em>(Matter of City of New York, </em>190 N.

The Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway is being constructed in part in the bed of Furman Street and in part on newly acquired property to the east, no part of which newly acquired property belonged to appellant. This highway is a public highway, and therefore a permissible street use. Accordingly, any impairment of appellant\u2019s property (which abuts on the west side of Furman Street) resulting from the construction and use of the highway is <em>damnum absque injuria.

Respondent\u2019s cause of action rests on allegations that the Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway, constructed in the bed of Furman Street, a legally opened public street, is not a permissible street use. Inasmuch as the highway is a street use as a matter of law, the complaint is legally insufficient. <em>(Story </em>v. <em>New York Elevated R. R. Co., </em>90 N. Y. 122; <em>Lahr </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated Ry. Co., </em>104 N. Y. 268; <em>Pappenheim </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Elevated Ry. Co., </em>128 N.

Every issue raised in the instant complaint was proffered by respondent to the condemnation court and decided on the merits by that court in a proceeding brought by the city for the purpose of carrying out the Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway improvement. The final decree in the condemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>proceeding is therefore determinative of the issues raised in the instant action and is accordingly a complete bar to such action. <em>(Matter of City of New York [Ely Ave.], 217 </em>N.

The courts below properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on that ground. <em>(Sielcken-Schwarz </em>v. <em>American Factors, Ltd., </em>265 N. Y. 239.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b304-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akk\">The City of New York in 1946 instituted condemnation proceedings in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County, seeking to acquire real property on the east side of Furman Street in Brooklyn. This property was needed for the construction of a link in the Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway which, at this point, is elevated and cantilevered over the bed of Furman Street. The New York Dock Company, owner of almost all of the land between the west side of Furman Street and the East River, filed a claim for damages in those proceedings, asserting that construction of the structure would constitute an \u201c interference \u201d with \u201c easements of light, air, and access \u201d appurtenant to its land.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The court entertained the Dock Company\u2019s claim, took extensive testimony, which fills four volumes of over 1,800 printed pages, viewed the property and received a large number of exhibits. After all the proof had been heard and weighed, the claim was dismissed on the merits upon two grounds: first, the improvements were for street purposes and the city had the <em>\u201c </em>right to use the bed of Furman Street \u201d for such purposes \u201c without incurring any liability to the New York Dock Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>pony \u201d and, second, in any event, \u201c the improvement * * * not only does not damage claimant\u2019s properties hut will confer a distinct benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">There is more than ample evidence in the record before us to support the court\u2019s findings, and, since the Appellate Division has upheld them, they are decisive, and an affirmance in this court necessarily follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In view of that disposition, and since the Supreme Court had unquestioned jurisdiction to entertain the condemnation proceedings and to dispose of the Dock Company\u2019s claim upon the merits (see, e.g., <em>Matter of City of New York [East Riv. Drive], </em>298 N. Y. 843, affg. 273 App. Div. 884, 264 App. Div. 555; cf. <em>Sauer </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>180 N. Y. 27, 30-31, affid. 206 U. S. 536; <em>Matter of Board of R. T. R. R. Comrs., </em>197 N. Y. 80, 99), the decree in condemnation is conclusive upon all points at issue between the parties. Consequently, the equity suit which the Dock Company later instituted for an injunction against the construction or use of the roadways above Furman Street or, in the alternative, for money damages, was barred under settled principles of <em>res judicata. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Slote </em>v. <em>Cascade Holding Corp., </em>276 N. Y. 239, 244-245; <em>Schuylkill Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Nieberg Realty Corp., </em>250 N. Y. 304, 307; see, also, 2 Lewis on Eminent Domain [1909], \u00a7 893.) The motion by the city to dismiss the complaint upon that ground should therefore have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The order of the Appellate Division in the condemnation proceeding should be affirmed, with costs in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The orders in the equity suit should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the city in all courts, the first question certified answered in the negative and the second question certified not answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Bromley, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">In proceeding: order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In action: orders reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
