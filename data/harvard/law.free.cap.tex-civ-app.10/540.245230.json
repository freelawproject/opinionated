Charge of Court\u2014Pleading and Evidence Warranting Issue.\u2014Where the defendant telegraph company pleads that the delay was caused by its wires being out of order without its fault, and there is evidence that the delay was caused by a swinging wire, it is proper for the charge of court to submit the issue of defendant\u2019s negligence in respect to the condition of its wires.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-14\">3.

The court erred in submitting the question of negligence in respect to the condition of appellant\u2019s wires, for the reason that there was no testimony tending to show any negligence on the part of the defendant in that regard, or to justify the submission of the question of negligence in respect to the condition of said wires; and for the further reason, that there was no pleading authorizing or requiring such an issue to be submitted to the jury. Tel. Co. v. Bennett, 1 Texas Civ. App.,558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-6\">2. The mere fact that plaintiff's name was changed from Boots to to Booth in the transmission of the message in suit, is not of itself sufficient proof of negligence in the transmission and delivery of said message, and the court should have so charged. Tel. Co. v. Neill, 57 Texas, 283; Womack v. Tel. Co., 58 Texas, 176; Tel. Co. v. Hearne, 77 Texas, 83; Tel. Co. v. Edsall, 63 Texas, 668; Tel. Co. v. Smith, 3 Wills. C. C., sec. 62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-7\">3. The verdict was unsupported by the evidence, and is contrary to the law and the evidence, because the proof showed that the contract under which said message was to be transmitted and delivered was made in Oklahoma Territory, and was to be partly performed in said Territory and partly in the State of Texas, and is therefore an interstate message, and must be governed by the common law as administered in the United States courts, and under the decisions of those courts there can be no recovery for mental distress alone, unconnected with physical injuries.

T., 4 /19 /1893. To James Boots, Gainesville, Texas; Come at once. Wife dying. Team will wait here for you. J. B. Couch\u201d\u2014was received at Roble, Oklahoma Territory, by appellant\u2019s agent, a little after midnight, April 19, 1893. It left Roble at 8:13 a. m., April 20th, and reached Gainesville at 9:30 a. m. of that day. The north-bound train left Gainesville at 9 a. m., which appellee would have taken, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>reaching his wife before her death, had he received the message five or six minutes before 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\">The evidence tended to show that the message ought to have reached Gainesville and been delivered by 8:30, and that the delay was due to the negligence of appellant. It should have left \u00a1Noble at least by 8; and although it had to pass through the \u201crelay\u201d offices at Arkansas City, Kansas City, and Dallas, fifteen minutes at Kansas City and five minutes at each of the other places gave sufficient time, according to the evidence, to make the transfers, .the transit between points being instantaneous. A \u201cswinging \u201d wire, however, north of Parsons, Kas., seems to have caused the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">One special defense alleged in the answer of appellant was, that if the message had been delayed, \u201cthe same was caused by the defendant\u2019s wires being out of working order, such condition being without fault or want of care on the part of defendant.\u201d The evidence tended to prove that it was within appellant\u2019s power to show what caused the wires to be out of working order, but this it did not attempt to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Having made a prima facie case of negligence by showing the delay, apparently due to neglect, it was not incumbent on appellee, in the first instance, to do more. On the other hand, appellant having undertaken to account for this delay, should have gone further, and shown that it was not the fault of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The third paragraph of the charge, to the effect that appellant had the right to establish and maintain relay offices and fix reasonable business hours, was all that the evidence or the closing argument of appellee\u2019s counsel required. The first assignment is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The objection to the fourth paragraph of the charge, in that it submitted the issue of negligence in respect to the condition of the wires, is not tenable on either of the grounds urged, namely, (1) that the evidence did not raise the issue; (2) that the pleadings did not raise the issue. As already seen, both by the pleading and evidence of appellant, this matter was put in issue. The second assignment is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Appellant\u2019s requested charge number 2 was properly refused, because, for the court to tell the jury that a given circumstance is \u201cnot of itself sufficient proof of negligence,\u201d as there requested, in reference to the error in transmitting the name \u201cBooth\u201d instead of \u201cBoots,\u201d is as objectionable as to tell them that a given circumstance is sufficient proof of negligence. This overrules the fourth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The above conclusions of fact overrule the fifth assignment, complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. The evidence tended to show that appellee was at his usual place of business in Gainesville when the message should have been received, and that within five minutes after receiving it he could and would have taken the train. He testified, that if it had been received before 9 o\u2019clock, he could and would have reached his wife before she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Ho objection is made to the amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The only remaining assignment is the sixth, complaining of the verdict, because the evidence showed the message to be an interstate one, and therefore that the law of Texas is not applicable. This assignment we also overrule; and as none others are found in the brief, the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Delivered May 29, 1895.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
