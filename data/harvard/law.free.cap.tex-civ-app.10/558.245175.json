The defendant appealed. The testimony to the execution and delivery of the deed in accordance with the alleged agreement is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-12\">On Saturday, December 10, 1892, Fowler and Diehl went together to look at the lots with the purpose of settling the note by sale to Fowler, if they suited him. They examined the property. Fowler was satisfied, and they then and there agreed upon settlement, Diehl to make deed to the lots in consideration of the payment of the note. They returned to the city. It was then late Saturday evening. Fowler\u2019s note was in some bank in the city, and not accessible at that time. Diehl wanted to leave to see sick family that night. It was agreed between them that Diehl should make the deed and leave it with J. B. Scarborough, and on Monday following Fowler was to call and get it and deliver the note. Diehl made the deed as agreed upon. On Tuesday or Wednesday following, Scarborough met Fowler and told him that the deed was there for him; Fowler stated that he had not time to attend to it, but to keep the deed for him, the trade was. all right, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>he would call in a day or two and get it. A similar conversation took place some days later. Some weeks after, Scarborough and Fowler again met, and he was requested again to come for his deed, and he replied that he had heard an attachment had been levied on the land. He was assured that if any attachment had been levied on his lots that it was by mistake, and they would be released. The attachment was released, and the deed and release tendered to him and his attorneys before this suit was filed. Fowler also stated he declined to take the land, because some months after he had made the agreement with Diehl parties out there had reduced the price of land above one-half, and he did not think the lots worth what he had agreed to give for them.

It appears from the facts that Scarborough was the intermediary, selected by both Diehl and Fowler, to whom the deed was delivered in order to be handed over to Fowler. Fowler was notified that Scarborough had the deed, and promised to come and get it, and we think, under the understanding between the appellee and the appellant at the time the deed was executed, and the circumstances connected with its delivery to Scarborough before and after that time, establishes in legal effect a delivery to Fowler. The transaction was not such as is embraced within the meaning of the statute of frauds; but as to this issue, it was not raised by the pleadings in the case (53 Texas, 14; 5 Texas, 552; 56 Texas, 299; 82 Texas, 394), and, under the pleadings, this issue was not before the court. The evidence shows, without contradiction, that the deed in question was executed for the purpose of satisfying the note sued on. The consideration for the deed, as appears from the facts, was the satisfaction and payment of this note. It does not appear from the evidence that appellant has sustained any damages by reason of the levy of the attachment, otherwise we would reverse and remand the case, so that the matter of damages might again be passed upon. But in view of the entire facts as stated by the record, we think it best to here reverse and render judgment in favor of the appellant, and it is so accordingly ordered, that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>below (appellee here) recover nothing against the appellant, and that \"appellant go hence with his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Delivered May 15, 1895.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
