HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">This appeal presents the issue whether a defendant\u2019s statement that \u201cI have a gun\u201d during the commission of a bank robbery constitutes a \u201cthreat of death,\u201d thus warranting a two-level increase in the offense level pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). We have not addressed this issue since the amendment of the guideline in November 1997 removed a requirement that the threat of death be \u201cexpress.\u201d We now conclude that such a statement may qualify as a \u201cthreat of death\u201d and affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">Jimmy 0. Soto-Martinez (\u201cSoto\u201d) approached a bank teller with a note that read: \u201cI have a gun. I just want money. Start with the $100.00. Stay Quiet!!!\u201d When the teller replied that she did not have any $100 bills, Soto told her to pass the note to the other tellers. After a second teller read the note, Soto stated, \u201cI want all your money.\u201d The second teller provided money, and Soto then told a third teller to \u201churry up\u201d with her money. When Soto left the bank, he also left behind the demand note that eventually led to his arrest. Soto was charged by information with bank robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He waived indictment and pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a two-level increase in Soto\u2019s offense level pursuant to guideline \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because the demand note stated that Soto had a gun, which the PSR explained \u201cwould instill a fear of death in a reasonable person.\u201d The district court overruled Soto\u2019s objection to the increase, finding that his actions, coupled with the teller\u2019s decision to \u201ccompl[y] with him after he told her that he had a gun,\u201d indicated that \u201cthere was a threat of death being made by this defendant during the time of this robbery.\u201d The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced Soto to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">This court reviews an application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and reviews factual findings for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the facts of the robbery are undisputed, we review the application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>two-level increase under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) provides that \u201cif a threat of death was made\u201d during the course of a robbery, the offense level is increased by two levels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201cthreat of death\u201d may be \u201can oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combination thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commentary gives various examples of threats of death, including \u201cGive me the money or I will kill you,\u201d \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you,\u201d and \u201cGive me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commentary also states that the intent of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) is to provide \u201can increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, a fear of death.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Soto\u2019s note simply stated that he had a gun; he did not make an express threat of death, and there is no indication that his actions otherwise implied the actual presence of a gun. However, when considered together, Soto\u2019s statements in the note that \u201cI have a gun\u201d and \u201cI just want money\u201d are similar to the example in the guideline commentary, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you.\u201d The only difference is that Soto\u2019s note required a slight inferential step: that if he were not provided with the money, he would use the gun he claimed to have.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such an inference is entirely reasonable, particularly amid the stress and tension of a bank robbery. We conclude that a reasonable person, when presented with a note demanding money and stating that the robber has a gun, normally and reasonably would fear that his or her life was in danger, and therefore the enhancement was not erroneous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-20\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-18\">. <em>United States v.

The only difference between the two statements is that Jennette\u2019s statements required the teller to draw a single inference \u2014 that is, that Jennette was willing to use the gun that he claimed to have, if the teller did not comply with Jennette's demand. This is a very small inferential step for a teller to make, particularly during the confusion and understandable anxiety of a robbery.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"ATf\">. This conclusion is consistent with the decisions of a majority of the other circuits that have considered this question. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Murphy, </em>306 F.3d 1087, 1088-90 (11th Cir.2002) (\"We conclude that, under the amended guideline, the written note given to the bank teller that the defendant had a gun constituted a 'threat of death' even though no express threat to use the gun was made.\u201d); <em>United States v. Winbush, 296 </em>F.3d 442, 443 (6th Cir.2002) (holding that \"a robber's note saying T have a gun\u2019 constitutes a threat of death under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F)\u201d because \"[s]uch language would instill in any reasonable bank teller a belief that a failure to comply with the robber\u2019s instructions would result in being fatally shot\u201d); <em>Jennette, </em>295 F.3d at 290-92 (\"[W]e conclude that a reasonable teller, when faced with a bank robber who demands money and states that he has a gun, normally and reasonably would fear that his or her life is in danger.\u201d); <em>United States v. Day, </em>272 F.3d 216, 218 (3d Cir.2001) (\"Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>when \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) required an 'express' threat of death, we held ... that the exact words 'I have a gun' would suffice to trigger a two-point sentence enhancement. Day argues, however, that under the amended Guideline, in which the word 'express\u2019 has been removed, the same words somehow no longer qualify as a threat of death. This argument does not make sense. The deletion of the word 'express\u2019 plainly broadened the Guideline rather than narrowed it. Even if, contrary to [our prior holding], the words 'I have a gun' did not constitute an express threat of death, under the current Guideline language they would still qualify for the enhancement because they are an <em>implicit </em>threat of death.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>155 F.3d 844, 846-47 (7th Cir.1998) (reasoning that although every situation in which a defendant announces that he has a gun may not constitute a threat of death, \"[w]e think 'a reasonable teller would ordinarily experience a fear of being shot when the robber confronting her announces he has a gun\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
