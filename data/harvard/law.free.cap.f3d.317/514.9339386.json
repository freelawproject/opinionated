Because Rioja remained beyond this temporary period, removal proceedings were instituted against him. Through retained counsel, Rioja admitted to all allegations against him in the removal proceedings and conceded removability. As relief from removal, Rioja sought political asylum, withholding of removal, and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. On July 27, 1999, after conducting a hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied all of Rioja\u2019s requests for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">On August 26, 1999, Rioja filed a timely notice of appeal, in which Rioja specified that he would be submitting a separate written brief or statement. On September 25, 2000, Rioja\u2019s counsel filed a request for a new briefing schedule regarding the filing of the separate brief or statement, as well as a motion to withdraw as Rioja\u2019s counsel, which was filed at Rioja\u2019s request. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw was granted, and a new briefing schedule was issued requiring Rioja to submit his separate brief or statement by October 27, 2000. On February 27, 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) summarily dismissed Rioja\u2019s appeal because: (1) Rioja\u2019s notice of appeal form failed to apprise the BIA adequately of the bases for his appeal; and (2) Rioja had failed to submit a separate brief or statement as he had indicated he would on the notice of appeal form.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Rioja now petitions this court for review of the BIA\u2019s order summarily dismissing his appeal from the denial of his application for asylum. We review a summary dismissal by the BIA for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Medrano-Villatoro v. INS, </em>866 F.2d 182, 134 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1986). Summary dismissal is authorized if the appellant indicates on the notice of appeal form \u201cthat he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(D) (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Rioja cites to <em>Medrano-Villatoro v. INS, </em>866 F.2d 132, 134 (5th Cir.1989), in support of his contention that he was not required to file a separate brief or statement. However, at the time <em>Medrano-Villatoro </em>was decided, a petitioner\u2019s failure to submit a separate brief or statement after indicating on the notice of appeal that such would be filed was not listed in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d) as a basis for summary dismissal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d) (1988). That basis for summary dismissal was added in 1992. <em>See </em>57 Fed.Reg. 11568, 11570 (Apr. 6, 1992). Accordingly, this court\u2019s holding in <em>Medrano-Villatoro </em>is not controlling in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Rioja also contends that his failure to file a separate brief or statement should be excused due to the withdrawal of his counsel and his insufficient command of English. However, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw was filed after Rioja asked his counsel to cease his representation. Moreover, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(D) specifically allows for lenity to an appellant who, within the filing deadline, reasonably explains his or her failure to file the promised brief or statement. Despite the lengthy period of time between the withdrawal of his counsel and the summary dismissal of his appeal, Rioja failed to seek any such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The BIA was within its statutorily designated discretion to summarily dismiss Rio-ja\u2019s appeal after he indicated on the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of appeal form that a separate brief or statement would be filed and then failed to submit such brief or statement before the filing deadline. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d) (2) (i) (D). Accordingly, this court need not consider whether the BIA abused its discretion by summarily dismissing Rio-ja\u2019s appeal for failing to apprise the BIA adequately of the bases for his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Rioja\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. This subsection is now located at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(2)(i)(E) in the 2002 edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
