Waddle were married August 22, 1872, at Wheeling, in West Virginia, the domicile of both, and where Archibald Woods has since resided. In the early part of 1874 they separated, and she went to the state of Tennessee, and on August 14, 1875, applied for divorce and alimony. On March 23,1877, she obtained a decree \u201cthat complainant be and she is hereby divorced <em>a vinculo </em>from Archibald Woods, and is hereby restored to all the rights and liabilities of <em>a feme sole, </em>with her maiden name, Pauline V. Waddle, forever free from the control and dominion of Archibald Woods. But this cause is retained as to the matter of alimony and for no other purpose.\u201d And on July 1, 1880, the decree as to alimony was as follows: \u201c It appearing that defendant is a non-resident, the court, on motion of the plaintiff, dismisses this cause as to alimony without prejudice to the plaintiff, so that e'he may be enabled to proceed in a foreign jurisdiction for recovery thereof, or do any other act necessary therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">On February 19,1881, she began suit in Belmont county, Ohio, for alimony onty, alleging her <em>bona fide </em>residence in Ohio \u201cfor the year last past.\u201d She charged Archibald Woods with habitual drunkenness from the time of their marriage, and with extreme cruelty about January 10, 1874. She described certain land owned b3 him in that county, and asked for alimon3 and other equitable relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">A demurrer to the petition was sustained in the court of common pleas, and the case was appealed to the district court.

It is therefore considered, ordered, and adjudged by the court that the plaintiff, Pauline V. Waddle, recover from the defendant, Archibald Woods, the said sum of $1,000, allowed her as alimony aforesaid, and that said defendant also pay the costs of this action, which are here adjudged against him.

Nor can it be allowed upon a foreign <em>ex parte </em>divorce, or after such divorce, or for cause which occurred before such divorce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-8\">After the termination of the proceedings in Tennessee, the defendant in error could not obtain alimony in another jurisdiction for the same cause whieh enabled her to obtain her divorce. The Ohio courts had no jurisdiction, because Ohio is not the domicile of the parties, of the marriage, or of the <em>delictum..</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-9\">The Ohio statute provides for three kinds of alimony: (1) temporary alimony, known as alimony <em>pendente </em>lite, provided for in section 5701, Revised Statutes; (2) alimony without divorce, section 5702; (3) permanent alimony upon the granting of a divorce <em>a vinculo </em>and in the same proceeding, sections 5699, 5700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-10\">If the wife petition for alimony alone, it can only be granted when the husband has committed one or more of the acts specified in section 5702. In such case it is not incident to a divorce, and is only allowed during the existence of the marriage relation, and not after the marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>has been dissolved.

The husband and wife were both domiciled in Ohio. The husband deserted his wife and went to Indiana for and procured an <em>ex parte </em>divorce. Here the wife deserts her husband and her <em>bona fide </em>domicile and procures an <em>ex parte </em>divorce in a' foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">In <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox the </em>court relied upon <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>10 Ohio, 30; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>8 Yerg. 67; <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Meginnis, </em>1 Gill. &amp; J. 463; s. c., 19 Am.

It is authority on two points: (1) the domicile of the wife is not affected by the husband\u2019s desertion ; (2) where a person leaves his domicile and procures an <em>exporte </em>divorce in another jurisdiction, it is fraudulent and not valid at the domicile. <em>Van Fossen </em>v. <em>State, </em>37 Ohio St. 317.

Worthington, 24 Ark. 529, the wife left her husband\u2019s domicile and obtaiued a legislative divorce in Kentucky and then commenced proceedings for alimony in Arkansas, the husband\u2019s domicile. The court held that \u201c alimony being an incident to the divorce, courts can only allow it in connection with the decree of divorce, and have no power to decree it on a separate application for alimony,\u201d reviews all the cases, repudiates <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>approves <em>Fischli </em>v. <em>Fischli, </em>1 Blackf. 360, and holds the position taken by the courts of Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Alabama to be against principle and authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">Alimony is an incident to a divorce. <em>Fischli </em>v. <em>Fischli, supra; Moon </em>v. <em>Baum, </em>58 Ind. 194; <em>Muckenburg </em>v. <em>Holler, </em>29 Ind. 139; <em>Chestnut </em>v. <em>Chestnut, </em>77 Ill. 346; <em>Trotter </em>v. <em>Trotter, </em>77 Ill. 510; <em>Prosser </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>47 Vt. 667; <em>McGee </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>10 Ga. <em>477; Goss </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>29 Ga. 109; <em>Blythe </em>v. <em>Blythe, </em>25 Iowa, 266; <em>Harshberger </em>v. <em>Harshberger, </em>26 Iowa, 503; <em>McEwen </em>v. <em>McEwen, </em>26 Iowa, 375; <em>Cole </em>v.

Danford, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-6\">That alimony, in Ohio, is an independent remedy, which may be pursued by itself, where a divorce is not sought, is a proposition too plain for discussion. Every section of the chapter of the statutes on the subject of divorce and alimony shows it. See a discussion of the subject in <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>36 Iowa, 310; <em>s. c., </em>14 Am. Rep. 525; Bish. Mar. &amp; Div., sec. 350.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-7\">When we get the distinction between the old English rule that alimony is a mere incident to a divorce and the Ohio statute thoroughly in mind, we have cleared away the difficulty that surrounds the case. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>15 B. Mon. 364; 14 Am. Law Rep. 311; Walker &amp; Bates Dig. 35; Bish. Mar. &amp; Div., sec. 360.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-8\">Eollett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABj\">It is not claimed that Fauline Y. Waddle was not rightly divorced and restored to her maiden name; neither is it claimed that her right to alimony had ever been passed upon in any prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">It is not questioned that the amount of the alimony decreed is just and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">If she had not been divorced she was the wife of plaintiff in error; and, if residing in Belmont county, without doubt as a wife, under section 5702 of the Revised Statutes, she could file her petition for alimony alone. Section 5702 provides . . . ; \u201c the wife may file her petition for alimony alone, or, if a petition for divorce lias been filed by the husband, she may file her cross-petition for alimony, with or without a prayer for the dissolution of the marriage contract,\u201d and \u201chabitual drunkenness\u201d is specified as a <em>cause </em>for alimony. The old English doctrine that \u201c alimony has no independent existence,\u201d is not the law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">As to <em>where </em>and by <em>whom </em>a petition for alimony may be filed, section 5690 of the Revised Statutes provides as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff, except in an action for alimony alone, shall have been a resident of the state at least one year before filing the petition; all actions for divorce, or for alimony, shall be brought in the county where the plaintiff has a <em>bona fide </em>residence at the time of filing the petition, or in the county where the cause of action arose; and the court shall hear and determine the same, whether the marriage took place or the cause of action occurred, within or 'without the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">No question is made by the record as to her alleged <em>bona fide </em>residence in Belmont county, as is required by law. The record shows legal service and the personal presence of the parties in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The language of the statute is : \u201c The eourt shall hear and determine the same, whether the <em>marriage </em>took place or the <em>cause </em>of\u201d divorce (or, as here, alimony) \u201coccurred within or <em>without </em>the state.\u201d And the court found the plaintiff in error \u201c guilty of habitual drunkenness, as alleged in the petition.\u201d This is the \u201c cause \u201d for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Thus the language of the statute answers nearly all the questions presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">It is not claimed that this woman\u2019s right to alimony had been passed upon by any court; and the Tennessee court, not having jurisdiction of this matter, did not pass upon it, and it could not adjudge alimony in that case. 2 Bish. Mar. &amp; Div., sec. 170; Whar. Ev. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">So far as appears the action in Belmont county was the <em>first </em>in which the defendant in error could recover alimony from the plaintiff in error, and no limitation is claimed. But the words of the statute (\u00a7 5702 Rev. Stat.) are: \u201cthe <em>wife </em>may file her petition for alimony alone.\u201d May the word \u201cwife,\u201d as used in this statute, include a woman divorced, as was this defendant in error ?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">In the case of <em>Cox </em>v. Cox, 19 Ohio St. 502, this eourt allowed the benefits of this statute to a woman whose husband had been divorced from her by a court in Indiana, while she remained domiciled in Ohio. In that case, on page 512, White J., said:. \u201c It is hot essential to the allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>anee of alimony that the marriage relation should subsist up to the time it is allowed.- On appeal, alimony may be decreed by the district court, notwithstanding the subsisting divorce pronounced by the court of common pleas. It is true the statute speaks of the allowance as being made to the wife. But the term \u2018 wife \u2019 may be regarded as used to designate the person, and not the actual existing relation; or the petitioner may still be regarded as holding the relation of wife for the purpose of enforcing her claim to alimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">He thus shows that the word <em>wife </em>designates the person divorced after the divorce is granted. He further considered the questions at length and the court there held: \u201c That the decree of divorce was no defense to her petition for alimony.\u201d The principles there stated and held sustain this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Here there is no showing of fraud on the part of the defendant in error, nor any claim that the plaintiff in error has been wronged by having the alimony suit tried in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\"We think that, under the law of this state, the district court, in allowing alimony to the defendant in error, did not err. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
