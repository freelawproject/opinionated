Nipgen, duly authorized to take applications for life insurance in the company of defendant, and to receive the cash premium thereon, applied to plaintiff at his home, \u201cPyle Farm,\u201d in Ross county, and requested him to take a policy of insurance in defendant\u2019s company upon the life of plaintiff. At first, plantiff refused to do so on account of having no money, when Nipgen offered to advance to or loan plaintiff the money to make the first payment on the policy, to which proposition plaintiff acceded, and then told Nipgen that he, plaintiff, had failed in getting a policy of insurance, in June, <em>1871, in </em>the Charter Oak Insurance Company, of which Mr. Schutte was agent, on account of something being the matter with his pulse. Nipgen then asked plaintiff if the application had been sent to the company. Plaintiff replied that it had not as he knew of. To which Nipgen responded, that if it had not gone any farther than that it did not make any difference; and, thereupon, plaintiff agreed with defendant, acting by its agent, to make application for a policy of insurance upon his life in defendant\u2019s company for the sum of ten thousand dollars, the same to be paid at the office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendant, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Ede Pyle, wife of plaintiff, if she survived him \u2014 if not, to the children of plaintiff, or their legal representatives, etc. The said Nip-gen, having a blank application, then commenced asking plaintiff the questions required to be asked of an applicant by the \u201cstatement of particulars respecting the person whose life is proposed for insurance, and which statement forms a part of the contract of insurance,\u201d and which are the same questions attached to the policy afterward issued by defendant, and plaintiff answered them until Nipgen came to the question, \u201cHas any company ever declined to grant insurance on your life?\u201d when he, said Nipgen, said he would just answer that question \u201cNo.\u201d Plaintiff'told him \u201cit was something he knew nothing about; that he could do just as he pleased about that.\u201d Said Nipgen thereupon put down, in answer to the question, \u201cno.\u201d Plaintiff and Nipgen, on the same day, went to Hallsville, to Doctor Gildersleeve, who, owing to the absence of the regular examining physician of the defendant, examined plaintiff, and thereupon Nipgen told Gildersleeve to answer all the medical questions \u201c noj\u201d meaning the \u201c Questions to be answered by the medical examiner 0of the Connectical, Mutual Life Insurance Company,\u201d and they were so answered. Plaintiff then signed said application for his wife and himself as required, and executed his note, payable to the order of Nipgen at the First National Bank of Chillieothe, Ohio, four months and ten days after date, for the sum of $219.20, with interest, being the amount of \u201c cash premium \u201d required to be paid, and which note, having been indorsed by Nipgen, plaintiff, afterward, at maturity, paid. The application was sent to the company, and a policy, No. 119,633, of date August 31, 1872, in said amount, on plaintiff\u2019s life, issued, and shortly afterward delivered to plaintiff. Upon reading the policy, about a month afterward, plaintiff' found it contained, among others, the following conditions and agreements:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\">\u201c This policy is issued and accepted upon the following express conditions and agreements :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201c1. That the answers, statements, representations, and declarations, contained in or indorsed upon this application for this insurance \u2014 which application is hereby referred to and made part of this contract \u2014 are warranted by the insured to be true in all respects : and that if this policy has been obtained by or through any'fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment, that this policy shall be absolutely null and void. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">\u201c 4. That in every case in which this policy shall cease and determine, or shall become null and void, all premiums paid in respect of the same shall be forfeited to the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">At the foot of the application, and a part thereof, is the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">\u201cIt is hereby declared and warranted that the above are fair and true answers to the foregoing questions; and it is acknowledged and agreed by the undersigned that this application shall form a part of the contract of insurance, and that if there be, in any of the answers herein made, any untrue or evasive statements, or any misrepresentations, or concealment of facts, then any policy granted upon this application#shall be null and void; and all payments made thereon shall be forfeited to the company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">Plaintiff then called on Nipgen, and, referring him to the terms of the policy, told him that he thought it was of no account, owing to the answer, \u201cno,\u201d to the question whether any company had ever declined to grant insurance on his life. He said the plaintiff should bring the policy in and get it corrected, and that he would write to the company about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-9\">Plaintiff took the policy to Nipgen, and Nipgen wrote to the company, stating that said question should have been answered \u201cyes,\u201d instead of \u201c no,\u201d and stated how far the Charter Oak matter had gone in plaintiff's case. Plaintiff signed the letter, and Nipgen mailed it. About three or four weeks afterward, plaintiff inquired of Nipgen about the matter, and was told that the company had said that plaintiff had better go before Doctor Scearce, and be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>examined. About a week after, plaintiff did so, and was asked about liis heart, and answered that it bothered him sometimes; that, after working hard, he got weak and nervous sometimes; that he took whisky and ginger for it. Plaintiff left, and they made out the application. Plaintiff called on Nipgen repeatedly about the matter, and he claimed that he had not yet heard from the company; then, about two months after that, Nipgen claimed the application, meaning the new or corrected one, had been mislaid in the Cincinnati office of defendant. Then Nipgen and Scearce made out another application, and sent it on. This was the third application, and was made without the knowledge of plaintiff. When plaintiff again called on Nipgen, he was informed by him that the company had declined his application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">There were attempts to get a new or corrected policy in place of the original one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\">On August 1, 1873, or thereabouts, plaintiff informed Nipgen that he was ready to make payment whenever he, Nipgen, would get it fixed. The defendant, upon receiving the third application, and without the knowledge or consent of plaintiff, canceled and annulled said policy of August 31, 1872. This was, as plaintiff thinks, at or about the expiration of one year from the time it was issued. Upon being informed of said cancellation of said policy, some time in September, 1873, the precise time not now remembered, plaintiff:' demauded from said agent and said company, the re-payment of his money so paid as premium, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">Wherefore plaintiff prays judgment against said defendant for said sum of $219.20, with interest thereon, from August 31, 1872; or, if the court shall be of opinion that an action to recover back the money paid is not the proper action, then that the plaintiff may recover from the defendant the sum of $500, his damages herein sustained; or that defendant, upon being paid the back premiums on said policy, may be ordered to rescind the cancellation and annulling of said policy, and to correct the same as to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>answer mentioned, according to the fact, and for other proper relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\">A demurrer to this petition was overruled, and the insurance company answered, denying that plaintiff \u201c told said Nipgen that he,plaintiff, had failed in getting a policy of insurance in June, 1871, in the Charter Oak Insurance Company, of which Mr. Scbutte was agent, on account of something being the matter with his pulsethat \u201cNipgen then asked plaintiff if the application had been sent to the company;\u201d that \u201cplaiutiff replied that it had not as he knew of, to which Nipgen responded that if it had not gone farther than that, it did not make any difference,\u201d and says that no such conversation took place between the plaintiff and Nipgen ; also, the company denied other specific allegations, but it did not deny that its agent, .Nipgen, wrote the application. To this answer plaintiff replied, denying some specific allegations of the answer. On the trial, by request of defendant, the court found, as its conclusions of fact, that in addition to the facts admitted by the pleadings, that several of the answers to questions contained in the application of the plaintiff, on which the policy of insurance was issued, were erroneously answered, which answers were by the terms of the policy made warranties, but the court further finds that all of said questions so erroneously answered by the plaintiff', were so answered under an innocent misapprehension of the purport of the questions and the answers, and the answers that should have been made thereto, and without any intent to perpetrate a fraud of any kind upon the defendant. The court further finds that the untruth of several of said answers was upon questions material to the risk, and that by the terms of said policy and the application which became and was a part thereof, the untruth of said answers constituted breaches of the warranties in respect thereof contained in said policy, and that by its terms the breach of said warranties was to make said policy null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">The court finds as conclusions of law, that the -plaintiff is not entitled to have the cancellation of said policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>insurance set aside, nor to have the same reformed in any particular, and that the same is wholly void, and of no effect whatever, and was so from the moment it was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\">The court further finds as a conclusion of law, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendant the sum of $219.20, the premium paid, with interest from the 21st day of August, 1872, to which the defendant, by counsel, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-6\">A motion for a new trial was overruled, and the ruling excepted to, and judgment was entered for Pyle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">The district court affirmed this judgment, and plaintiff in error now seeks to reverse these judgments.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-8\"><em>Lawrence T. Neal, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-9\">This is not a case in which the rule that the premium must be returned where the risk has not attached or commenced to run, can be applied. Upon the filing of the application, the payment of the premium, and the issuing of the policy, the contract between the parties was complete, and the risk then attached. This was not prevented by the declarations in the application and policy that fair and true answers should be given to the questions in the application, and that any untrue or evasive statements, or any misrepresentation or concealment of facts, should nullify the policy. These provisions were inserted for the benefit of the company. The policy was not void, but simply voidable at the option of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-10\">The company might have waived the provisions which authorized it to declare the policy void upon the terms and conditions named therein, and, in that event, the risk, which did run for one year, would have continued to run, <em>Insurance Company </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>96 U. S. 234.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-11\">The premium was, therefore, rightfully retained by the company when it elected to annul the policy, the rule being that if the risk once attaches the premium can not be returned.

Co., </em>7 Ohio (2 pt.), 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-12\">The rights of the parties are to be determined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>contract between them, and by the express terms of this contract the premium was to be forfeited to the company if there should be in any of the answers of Pyle \u201cany <em>untrue </em>or evasive statement, or any misrepresentations or concealment of facts.\u201d The terms of this agreement can not be altered or varied by interpolating new words, or by giving to the words used by the parties other than their ordinary meaning. It has been repeatedly held, in like cases, that the premium can not be recovered.

But there was a consideration. The responsibility assumed by the company, the risk and inconvenience to which it was exposed, and the expense incurred in commissions to its agents, and otherwise, constituted a sufficient consideration. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Mut.

Such wrong should be imputed to the company, and not to the insured. <em>Insurance Company </em>v. Williams, 39 Ohio St. 584, 588; <em>Massachusetts Life Ins.

Such warranties are, however, in the nature of conditions precedent. <em>O\u2019Niel </em>v. <em>Buffalo Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 N. Y. 122; <em>Ripley </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Ins. Co., </em>30 N.

The answers being in certain particulars untrue \u2014 incorrect\u2014 and the truth of these answers being made warranties by the terms of the policy, the policy itself never took effect as a coutract of insurance. Pyle was at no time insured, for the company was at no time bound by the policy ; and the questions having been answered under an innocent mistake as to their import, and without any intention to deceive, the premium should be returned. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. *341, *342; <em>Steinback </em>v. <em>Rhinelander, </em>3 John.

And though the application was thus made, the policy was canceled for its untrue statements innocently made on the part of. Pyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The application and the policy together form the contract. The terms of the contract are plain and free from doubt or ambiguity. It is agreed in the application, \u201cthat this application shall form a part of the contract of insurance, and that if there be, in any of the answers herein made, any untrue or evasive statements, or any misrepresentations or concealment of facts, then any policy granted upon this application shall be null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">And the policy provides that \u201c this policy is issued and accepted upon the following express conditions and agreements : 1. That the answers, statements, representations, and declarations, contained in, or indorsed upon this application for this insurance \u2014 which application is hereby referred to, and made part of this contract \u2014 are warranted by the insured to be true in all respects; and that if this policy has been obtained by or through any fraud, misrepresentation. or concealment, that this policy shall be absolutely null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>I. Did the policy ever attach, or was it ever valid ?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The court finds as conclusions of fact, that \u201c several of the answers to questions contained in the application of the plaintiff, on -which the policy of insurance was issued, were erroneously answered;\u201d and the \u201ccourt further finds that the untruth of several of said answers was upon questions material to the risk, and that, by the terms of said policy and the application which became and was a part thereof, the untruth of said answers constituted breaches of the warranties in respect thereof contained in said policy, and that <em>by its terms </em>the breach of said warranties was to make said policy null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">And the court finds as a conclusion of law, that the policy \u201cis wholly void, and of no effect whatever, and was so from the moment it was issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">But the plaintiff in error insists that the policy took effect and was in force until it was cauceled. To sustain such a claim would ignore the expressed terms of both the application and the policy, as well as the <em>cause </em>of the cancellation of the policy. These <em>terms </em>the plaintiff in error has never waived, but it-has insisted upon them and acted upon the strict letter.of the agreement, and has canceled the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">This is not a new question in the courts. In the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Manufacturer's Ins. Co., 2 </em>Woodb. &amp; M. 472, the court held: \u201cA warranty is generally a stipulation made and described in the policy itself, and must be complied with, whether material or not.\u201d \u201cWhere a material fact is suppressed in such representations, the insurance is avoided, and the policy does not attach, whether the suppression happens by neglect or fraud.\u201d In <em>Friesmuth </em>v. <em>Agawam Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>10 Cush. 587, \u201cthe application contained an untrue representation that the property was unincumbered,\u201d and the court held, \u201c that the policy was wholly void.\u201d In <em>Foot </em>v. <em>The \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., </em>61 N. Y. 571, the court held: \u201c If a policy of insurance declare that the statements made in the application shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>part and parcel of the policy, such statements become warranties, and must be true, whether material or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201cA contract of insurance, like other contracts, is avoided by an untrue statement by either party as to a matter vital to the agreement, though there be no intentional fraud in the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>The Co-operative Life Ass\u2019n of Miss. </em>v. Leflore, 53 Miss. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On a similar coutract the supreme court of the United States, in <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>22 Wall. 47, held : \u201cAny <em>answer untrue </em>in fact, and known by the applicant for insurance to be so, <em>avoids the policy, </em>irrespective of the question of the materiality of the answer given, to the risk.\u201d And in the opinion, Mr. Justice Hunt says: \u201cNothing can be more simple. If he makes any statement in the application, it must be true. If he makes any declaration in the application, it must be truc. A faithful performance of this agreement is made an express condition <em>to the existence </em>of a liability on the part of the company.\u201d And this is approved in the case of <em>\u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>France, </em>91 U. S. 510, and there the court also held, \u201cthat the company was not liable if the statements made by the insured were not true. The agreement of the parties that the statements were absolutely true, and that their falsity in any respect should void the policy, removes the question of their materiality from the consideration of the court or jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">This court, in <em>Union Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McMillen, </em>24 Ohio St. 67, held: \u201cWhere a life policy is made and accepted, upon the expressed condition that if the annual premium is not fully paid within the time specified, the policy \u2018 shall be null and void, and wholly forfeited,\u2019the <em>failure </em>to pay the premium avoids the policy;\u201d and that was where the policy had attached. But in such a case, in <em>Union Central Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>33 Ohio St. 459, the court held, where \u201cthe uniform custom of the insurance company has been to give notice of the time when the premiums fall due, and to collect the same at the residence of the policy-holder, through a local agent residing in his neighborhood, good faith requires that this mode of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>collection should not be discontinued, and payment required at the company\u2019s office, without notice to the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">There are mistakes jm policies that may be disregarded or corrected and the policy enforced. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Columbiana County Mutual Ins. Co., </em>18 Ohio, 116, and <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Williams, supra. </em>But in this case the court did not err in holding the policy \u201c is wholly void and of no effect whatever, and was so from the moment it was issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALa\">II. Should the premium be returned ?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The court finds as a conclusion of law that Pyle is entitled to recover of the insurance company the premium paid, with proper interest. The court thus held, not only because the policy was void <em>ab initio, </em>but because it also found \u201cthat all of said questions so erroneously answered were answered by the plaintiff under an <em>innocent misapprehension </em>of the purport of the questions and the answers, and the answers that should have been made thereto, and without any intent to perpetrate a fraud of any kind upon the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">There was no actual fraud, at least on the part of Pyle. On this policy, no risk ever attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In 1777, in the case of <em>Tyrie </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>Cowp. 666, 668, Lord Mansfield stated the general rule to be, \u201cthat where the risk has not been run, whether its not having been run was owing to the fault, pleasure, or will of the insured, or to any other cause, the premium shall be returned, because a policy of insurance is a contract of indemnity. The underwriter receives a premium for running the risk of indemnifying the insured, and whatever cause it be owing to, if he does not run the risk, the consideration, for which the premium or money was put into his -hands, fails, and therefore he ought to return it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">In 1800, in the case of <em>Delavigne </em>v. <em>United Ins. Co., </em>1 Johns. Cas. 310, the court held, \u201cwhere a policy becomes, void by a failure of the warranty, the insured is entitled to a return of the premium, if there be no actual fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC9\">\u201cWhere a policy is avoided by concealment or by misrepresentation not fraudulent, the assured is entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>return of the premium, and the policy is conclusive evidence of the receipt of the premium by the insurer.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>8 Exch. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">And such is now the general rule. See 3 Kent, *341, and May on Ins. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The rule is different where the risk has attached or there is actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Tet it is urged here that \u201c we must leave the premium paid by the insured to be disposed of according to the terms of his contract with the insurer.\u201d No such terms exist. There is no <em>contract </em>between Pyle as the \u201cinsured\u201d and the company as the \u201cinsurer.\u201d Under this policy Pyle never was <em>insured, </em>and the company never was an <em>insurer </em>of Pyle. The policy has always been void, and this claim, based on the contract, is as void as the policy. From all that appears Pyle was not in fault, and the agent should not have obtained the premium, and the insurance company should not retain Pyle\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Of course, we have not considered how far the provisions of such a policy may be waived by the acts of the parties, nor to what extent such parties may be bound by their subsequent acts, and in connection with such provisions, and what was done in procuring such application and policy. The court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
