It was an action of debt, upon an administrator\u2019s-bond, executed in 1824, brought against the administrator and-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>'his securities. The declaration set out the bond and condition, . and averred that, after administration granted, the administrator received a large amount of assets. It is also alleged, that Lowry, for whose use the action was brought, had recovered judgment against the administrator for a sum specified, due from the intestate ; that a writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>had issued against the goods and chat-tels of the intestate in the administrator\u2019s hands, to be adminis- \u25a0 tered, upon which the sheriff returned he could find no such goods, and that he had made demand of the administrator, who refused to show him any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">The defendants pleaded various matters, upon which issues were made, but as the case turned upon the validity of the declaration, it is unnecessary to state them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-7\">Crane, for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq3\">insisted that the case of Stewart, and Chaplin v.

We think this case can not be distinguished from it. The cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Montgomery county, with leave for the plaintiff to become nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
