Morrison was indicted for that one Driskell, on January 1, 1829, stole a certain gelding, the property of a person to the jurors unknown, and that he (Morrison) on January 2,1829, did conceal said Driskell in his (Morrison\u2019s) dwelling house, knowing him to be a horse-thief. Section 27 of the act for the punishment of crimes, 29 Ohio JB. 141, provides that if any person shall conceal any horse-thief, knowing him to be such, he shall, upon conviction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary not more than fifteen nor less than three years. . The bill of exceptions with the record.in this case shows that during the trial, upon the issue of not guilty, the state, in order to prove that Driskell had stolen the horse mentioned in the indictment, called a witness to detail his confessions made in the presence and hearing of Morrison. This was objected to for the prisoner, but admitted. It shows also that the prisoner, by his counsel, insisted to the court that in the trial of this indictment, before Morrison could be convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>legally, the prosecution was bound to prove that Driskell had been-convicted of the crime of stealing the horse mentioned in the indictment, which objection was overruled by the court.

On the trial, it is claimed that the court of common pleas illegally admitted proof of Driskell\u2019s declarations to Mora\u00fason to establish the allegation that Driskell had stolen the horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>described. The question is, were the confessions or declarations of Driskell competent evidence against Morrison to prove the fact</p>\n<p id=\"AR5\">Any voluntary confessions of one accused of crime is evidence against him at common law. 2 Stark. Ev. 51. But such confessions are only evidence <em>\u201c </em>against the person himself who confesses, not against other persons, although they may have been proven to be his accomplices.\u201d 1 Phil. Ev. 77; Kazer\u2019s case, 5 Ohio, 280. The allegation in this indictment that Driskell had stolen the horse was material, and to be proven by the prosecution. That fact, and the prisoner\u2019s knowledge of it, imparted to the alleged concealment of him its 'criminal character. The efforts of the counsel for the state, in the argument to assimilate Driskell '-|:and Morrison to conspirators, in order to open the door for proof of the acts of each against both, and of the declaration of one made at the time against his fellow, are not in our opinion well grounded. Though the authorities cited sustain the positions assumed, yet they do not relieve the case from the objections taken. The case made does not rest on the position that Driskell and Morrison <em>combined together </em>for an illegal purpose, npr is the confession of Driskell of an act done in pursuance of a preconcerted plan, and in reference to a <em>common object. </em>The concealing a horse-thiefr knowing him to be such, is a distinct, independent offense, both upon principle and under the provisions of our statute. 29 Ohio L. 141; 1 Blackf. 429. The thief must be named in the indictment against the receiver, if known; and, before conviction, he is a competent witness against the person concealing him. 1 Leach, 418; Arch. C. Pl. 154. If the record showed that proof had! been introduced to satisfy the jury that Driskell had stolen the horse mentioned in the indictment, and upon that the prosecution had sought to establish Morrison\u2019s knowledge of the guilt when he concealed him, proof of what Driskell told Morrison would have been both competent and sufficient, unless the communication was attended by circumstances to induce a disbelief of the tale. This case is different. The proof here was not directed to make out a <em>scienter </em>in Morrison, but the fact of Driskell\u2019s having stolen the horse. In this view it appears to us the court admitted the declaration of one not a party to the record, nor a confederate, to sustain the material allegation, that said third person was a horse-thief in general terms; and that, too, without any proof that a horse had in fact been stolen by or from any person known or un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>known. Such declarations, for such a purpose, we think clearly incompetent. See Daniel <em>v. </em>Patten, Moody &amp; R. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">This opinion requires of us to reverse the judgment, to set aside the proceedings subsequent to the issue, and to award a new trial. The other questions discussed it is unnecessary to examine at this time, and we leave them wholly untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"A70_\">*This decision will be certified to the clerk of the Supreme Court in Jefferson county to be there recorded, and the keeper of the penitentiary will be directed to remove the prisoner to that \u25a0county for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
