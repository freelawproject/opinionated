The terms of the writ were, that the defendants be summoned \u201c to answer to Lewis C. Levin, by his next friend, Edward Hodge, in a plea,\u201d etc. The declaration set out, that the defendants \u201c were summoned to answer to Lewis C.

Levin, the plaintiff, was a minor, or that any legal cause existed for the prosecution of the said suit, in the name of the said Hedge, as the next friend of saidLevin.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">The mere statement of this error is its own best answer. If it does not appear by the record, that Levin was a minor, the court can not presume that he was, and there is certainly no error on this behalf, in the record. The record nowhere shows Levin to be a minor. And the court can not look beyond the record itself. This point is so well settled, that their honors, Judges Hitchcock and Wright, would not hear an argument upon it, at their late sitting in Hamilton county. See also 2 Bac. Ab., title Error, 489, Phil, ed., where it is laid down, that if errors did not appear by the record, even <em>\u201c </em>though the matter assigned for error should be proved by witnesses of the best credit, yet the judges *would not admit of it.\u201d See also Id. 486; 2 Tidd\u2019s Prac. 1051; 2 Saund. 101,n. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">With regard to the introduction of the name of Edward H. Hedge, as Levin\u2019s next friend, admitted by leave of the court, it is unobjectionable on three grounds: 1. Because it is mere surplusage, and therefore does not vitiate. Jacob\u2019s L. Die., title Verdict; 3 Saund. 308; 1 Chit. Pl. 218, 233, 234; 1 Arch. Pl. 160. 2. Because it was admitted by leave of the court, and the court is-presumed to do what is right where it has jurisdiction. 2 Starkie\u2019s Ev. 802, 803; 1 Arch. Pl. 178. 3. Because it might have been taken advantage of by special demurrer, and whatever can-be taken advantage of by demurrer or abatement is cured bv verdict. 2 Bac. Ab. 492; 1 Saund. Pl. 2; 1 Chit.

Nor do his authorities, in several instances, support the points he represents \u2014 viz: that' from Com. Dig., title Pleader, 2 C. 1, 556. No authorities that I can find, require that the record should show the party suing to be of full age. If the record does not show the contrary, the party\u2019s competency to sue-is presumed of course. If he should not be competent, advantage must be taken at the trial, by abatement or demurrer. 1 Arch. Pl. 539; Id. 178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">The second error assigned is in these words: \u201cIn that it appears that the said Levin prosecuted said suit in the name of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Hedge, or his next friend, but nevertheless the said proceedings, to wit, the declaration and the several replications to the defendant\u2019s several pleas, are all filed by the attorney of said Levin ; whereas, by the law of the land, if said Levin was a minor, he could not appear, nor prosecute, by his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFD\">The learned and important case of Apthorp <em>v. </em>Backus, Kir. Conn. 407, puts this objection, as well as those assigned under'the first head, completely to rest. The argument, upon all these matters, is there most fully and learnedly gone into, by Chief Justice Law and Judge Ellsworth. It is there expressly decided, that an infant\u2019s appearance by ^attorney can not be taken advantage of after verdict. The whole of this highly important case is recommended to the special consideration of the honorable court in bank, as covering the whole ground of the errors assigned in the present case, and as being amply sufficient to sustain the judgment and verdict. See also 1 Amer. Dig., title Verdict, under Connecticut head, sec. 2, p. 385; 1 Bing. Inf. 126; Cone <em>v. </em>Bowles, 1 Salk. 205.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">. But it will be j&gt;erceived that this second assignment of error .also assumes that Levin was a minor, though no such fact appears by the record. And the statement of the opposite counsel, in his argument, that such fact may be inferred, belongs to his own fancy, and to no law that I can find. If, however, such an inference can be acted on by the court in bank, the ease in Kirby, 407, is perfectly satisfactory. It is an American decision, by very eminent judges, and therefore entitled to much more weight than foreign decisions. See also Bing. Inf. 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">The statute of jeofails of Ohio is quite as broad as that of Connecticut, or of England, and covers all the errors that are here as.signed, even if the errors assigned fully existed in the record. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APd\">There is no principle in law more fully established by the best' authorities than that all errors are cured by verdict, that might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, abatement, or any other special plea. 2 Bac. Ab. 492; 1 Saund. 227, 228, and particularly note 1; 1 Arch. Pl. 178; and numerous authorities there cited; 1 Pet. Cond. 326, notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">Advantages of personal disabilities, of either plaintiff or defendant, must be taken by plea in abatement. 1 Tidd\u2019s Prac. 684, 685; Arch. Pl. 539; 1 Saund. Pl. 2; 2 Bac Ab. 492; 1 Chit. Pl. 547; Bing. Inf. 127; 1 Salk. 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>There is, however, another ground on which the plaintiffs in error must fail to support their assignment ot errors. The defendants all pleaded generally in bar, and after a general plea in bar, no personal disability of the plaintiff can'be taken advantage of on error. 2 Bac. Ab. 492. This case is put: \u201c If a <em>feme covert </em>bring an action in her own name, <em>per attornatum, </em>and the defendant plead in bar to the action, *he shall never afterward assign the coverture for error.\u201d See also 1 Arch. Pl. 177, Gould\u2019s edition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">The third error assigned is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">\u201cIn that there are four distinct issues presented in said record for the finding of the jury. Three of which issues are on the separate pleas of the several defendants; and the jury have passed upon and found but one issue, whereby three of said issues are yet undetermined and have not been passed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-7\">The verdict of the jury is in these words:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-8\">\u201cWe, the jury, find the defendants guilty, as the plaintiff in declaring has alleged, and assess the damages sustained by the plaintiff to three hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-9\">The declaration alleges, that the defendants all committed the assault and battery. To this the defendants all plead, \u201c not guilty,\u201d . the general issue. This is their first plea. Then they all plead separate pleas of justification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-11\">How it can be correctly said, under this state of things, that the verdict does not cover all the issues, or the whole case, I am unable to divine. The verdict finds defendants guilty as charged in the declaration. This, then, certainly is the same as to say, gentlemen, you have all committed the injury, you are all guilty, you had no justification, no legal excuse, and your pleas are therefore not true. It certainly covers all the issues in the fullest extent. The defendants, by their first plea, put the fact of their committing the injury distinctly at issue. The reason why verdicts are set aside for uncertainty is that they afford no bar to other actions. But there is no such uncertainty in the case before us. The defendants are all found guilty, as they are alleged to be in the declaration. Of course, if they are all guilty on the general issue they can have no justification separately, or legal excuse, and the verdict expresses just as much as if it expressly said so. The following authority shows that this verdict is amply sufficient. In 2 Seld. N. P. (Wheaton\u2019s), 1033, are these words: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>\u201c </em>If, in an action of trespass, a verdict be found on any fact or title distinctly put in issue, such verdict may be pleaded by way of estoppel in another action between the same parties or their privies, in respect to the same fact or title.\u201d The fact of all the ^defendants unlawfully committing the assault was distinctly put in issue, and therefore-this verdict would be a bar against another action against all or any of the defendants. It is impossible, if they all committed the injury, as the declaration alleges, that any one of them could be justified in committing it. The verdict not only says they were all guilty, but assesses the damages at three hundred and fifty dollars against them all; for they all said, in their first plea, that they were \u201c not guilty.\u201d Of course, if the jury had considered any of them justified, or any way legally excused, they would not have assessed damages against them. Can any reasonable man imagine for a moment that it was not the intention of the jury to find all the issues against all the defendants? It is impossible. I can scarcely conceive how-the jury could have expressed themselves more clearly, or in language less susceptible of misconstruction. But if the intendment of the jury can be clearly perceived it is sufficient. Eastman <em>v. </em>Chapman, 1 Day\u2019s Cases in Error, 50; Spencer <em>v. </em>Overton, Id. 183; Hawks <em>v. </em>Crofton, 2 Burrows, 699, 700; 10 Mass. 64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-4\">The record does not show that leave had been obtained from the court to file separate pleas, though the common formality to that effect is alleged in the pleas themselves. But it is presumed\" there should have been a special order of court. But the defendants, after pleading generally, notwithstanding the statute, had no legal right to put in separate defenses inconsistent with the general plea. No such construction can be given the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">They had no right to put in \"pleas of justification. Schemerhorn et al. <em>v. </em>Tripp, 2 Caine, 108; Smith <em>v. </em>Bouchien, 2 Strange, 993; Drake et al. <em>v. </em>Barrymore, 14 Johns. 166; 2 Seld. N. P. (Wheaton\u2019s), 1029; 1 Saund. 28, n. 2. Their separate pleas, therefore, are mere nullities, and the jury were not bound to notice them, Consequently the separate pleas, and the replications to-them, being void in law, the court is bound to regard them as mere surplusage. Jacob\u2019s L. Dic., title Verdict; 1 Chit. Pl. 218, 233, 234; 1 Arch. Pl. 160; 3 Saund. 308. If this position be correct, then the verdict applies only to the general issue, and its-sufficiency in this behalf admits of no doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>^Should the court, however, not regard the separate pleas and replications as mere surplusage and void, I have yet ample authority to sustain the verdict. And 1 now solicit the special attention of the court to several very important cases, completely analogous to the one under consideration, and which put the sufficiency of the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\">I shall first refer to the case of Hawks <em>v. </em>Cropton, 2 Burr. 698. In this case the declaration, pleas, and verdict are precisely similar to that of Levin\u2019s, a\u00f1d the judgment was sustained. This case first lays down the undoubted fact, \u201c that verdicts shall be favorably construed\u201d \u2014 then if the meaning of the jury can be ascertained it is sufficient. Lord Mansfield says, the question is \u201cwhether tjiis verdict is so uncertain that the court can not give judgment upon it, but must award a <em>venire facias de novo?\u201d </em>He says: \u201c I think the present case is such a clear case, that the court may here give judgment upon the substantial finding; though the clerk may have been irregular and faulty in, point of form, it is very clear wbat the jury meant.\u201d The verdict in this case is a general verdict upon two distinct issues. All the judges refer to -a case in Hobart, 54, with great approbation, and cite therefrom this \u201cvery just rule:\u201d \u201cThat though the verdict may not conclude formally or punctually in the words of the issue, yet if the point in issue can be concluded out of the finding, the court shall make fhe verdict serve.\u201d This case is quite full upon the subject, and is of itself, in my judgment, entirely sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">But I shall now cite another yet stronger. The case is an American case, and emanates from one of the best authority. It \u2022is, therefore, doubly valuable. I refer to the case of Porter <em>v. </em>Rummery, 10 Mass. 64. Here the whole doctrine is very learnedly discussed by Mr. Justice Sewall, who establishes beyond controversy the sufficiency of the verdict under consideration. In the case of Rummery, issue was joined on two distinct issues, and the verdict is general. The. court holds this language, and which is go entirely'applicable to the case of Levin, that it can not fail to be conclusive: \u201cIn one view of the case, which may be ^suggested, this verdict seems capable of a construction, in which it may be understood as comprehending both issues, and sufficiently to warrant the judgment upon it for the tenant. The court are competent to collect the meaning of the jury, from the terms of their verdict, and one verdict may be a sufficient finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>upon several issues\u201d \u2014 p. 66. Certainly, the verdict in Levin\u2019scase, \u201cmay be understood to comprehend all the issues,\u201d especially as verdicts are to be favorably construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">These two very learned and important cases are supported more or less by the following authorities: Hobart, 54; Gostwicke v. Mason, 1 Mod. 3; Redman <em>v. </em>Edolfe, Id.; Jacob\u2019s Law Dic., title Verdict; Eastman <em>v. </em>Chapman, 1 Day\u2019s Cases in Error, 30; Spencer <em>v. </em>Overton, Id. 183; Apthorp <em>v. </em>Backus, 1 Kirby, 415; Jaques <em>v. </em>C\u00e6sar, 2 Saund. 100, 101; 3 Saund. 308.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">\u201c Where the jury in debt on a bond, and <em>nil debet </em>pleaded, found <em>nil debet </em>to part, and <em>debet </em>to the rest, it was held sufficient.\u201d Hadley <em>v. </em>Styles, 15 Petersdorff Abridgment, 336.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">There is a difference where the verdict is founded on a contract- and a wrong. In the latter case it is maintainable, if any part of the issue is found. Jacob\u2019s L. Dic., title Verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">The fourth error assigned is in these words: \u201cIn that judgment ought to have been rendered for the defendants, and not for the said plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\">\u201c This assignment is considered as a mere matter of form, and of no consequence whatever. The court is not bound to inquire into errors, if the party does not show them.\u201d 2 Bac. Ab. 486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">On a review of the whole case, the honorable court will perceive that all the authorities and arguments of the counsel for plaintiffs in error are based upon false and untenable premises. - It was-first assumed that Levin was a minor, though no such fact appears upon the record. The arguments and authorities under the two first assignments, all proceed upon this assumption. His next, assumption is, that the verdict does not cover all the issues. This is also positively denied, on the reasoning and authorities before advanced. It is manifest, therefore, however much good law the gentlemen may have adduced, that it is not applicable to the present case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVW\">*Storer and Fox, for plaintiffs in error, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-12\">The first error alleged is, that the suit is brought in the name of Edward Hedge, as the next friend of Levin, and there -is noaverment that Levin is a minor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-13-pl-split\">The reason that an infant must appear by <em>pro. ami, </em>and prosecute, is that he is not personally liable for costs, and in all cases-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>when he does thus prosecute, the <em>pro. ami </em>is alone liable. 1 Tidd, 72; Morrell <em>v. </em>Pickman, 2 Esp.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-4\">In Turner <em>v. </em>Turner, Strange, 708, Lord King says, that he could find no ease where the infant was held personally liable to pay costs. Hence, in England, -none but responsible persons were permitted \u00a1to sue as the next friends of infants; and they must have been first approved by the courts, or some judge at his chambers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-5\">If\u00a1.then, the <em>pro. ami </em>alone is liable, it is because the plaintiff is an infant; if he is not an infant, his name on the record can create no responsibility on the part of the <em>pro. ami, </em>and as it creates no-responsibility, it is error for it to be thus inserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">All the forms require the insertion of the fact that the plaintiff is a minor. 2 Chit. 32; 2 Saund. 117, n. 1. Bingham on Infancy, 120, says, that in the King\u2019s Bench the form is similar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-7\">It is a universal principle, that the capacity in which the plaintiff sues must be stated. If he sues as executor or administrator, he must make it appear that the testator or intestate is dead.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">If he does not appear to be a minor, it follows that he is represented on the record as of full age ; and it is clear, if it does not thus appear, it is erroneous. 2 Com. Dig., title Pleader, 2 C. 1, 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-9\">There is no legal act that can be done by an infant unless through the intervention of a <em>pro. </em>ami; he can not sue, or even file errors on the record. Bing. 122.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\"><em>Error Second. </em>That even if it could be inferred that the plaintiff was an infant, still, as he has appeared and pleaded by attorney, it is error. Formerly, the appearance of an infant plaintiff, by attorney, was error, but after verdict, the ^defect was cured Fy the statutes 21 Jas. I., c. 13; 4 and 5 Anne, c. 16. The statute, 21 Jas. I., c. 13, provides, that \u201cjudgment shall not be stayed or reversed, for that the plaintiff in ejectment, or other personal action, being under age, appeared by attorney. The statute 4 and 5 Anne, c. 16, \u201ccures the effect of a warrant of attor: ney not being filed,\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-11\">The law as to the appearance of an infant defendant by attorney is unchanged; it is universally held to be error, if he thus appears. 2 Tidd, 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-12\">5 Com. Dig. 556, \u201c In all actions, real, personal, or mixed, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>appeal\u2019 by attorney, it is error.\u201d Brey <em>v. </em>Grobe, Cro. Jas. 10; Bing, on Inf. 123; Sampson et al. <em>v. </em>Jackson, Cro. Jas. 641; Dewitt <em>v. </em>Post, 11 Johns. 460; Arnold <em>v. </em>Sandford, 14 Johns. 423.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">The statutes of jeofails of this state is general; it is confined to matters of form, and does not specify the particular defects that are cured as by the English statutes. The same reason holds, it would seem, to reverse the judgment when the plaintiff appeared by attorney, as when the default appeared, and'more especially, as the defendant is literally taking an undue advantage, when he is permitted to obtain a reversal of a judgment on that ground. The plaintiff is bound to bring his action in legal form. The defendant is compelled to answer at all hazards; hence the propriety of requiring the plaintiff to commence his suit in a proper manner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\"><em>Error Third. </em>For that all the issues are not found by the jury, nor have they passed on the whole case, as the several defendants have pleaded separate pleas, which are found by the verdict to be true and untrue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">When the jury find less than the whole matter in issue, a \u201c <em>venire facias de novo\u201d </em>will be granted. 2 Tidd, 831. In Hooper <em>v. </em>Shepherd, 2 Str. 1089, the judgment was reversed because the jury did not find a verdict to cover the whole case. The action was on a charter party, at fifty guineas per month; plaintiff stated that six hundred and fifty-two qiounds was due for the whole one hundred and fifty-two pounds, ten of which had been received, and the remainder was five hundred qeounds, for which the suit was brought. The defendant qDleaded that he had paid at the rate of fifty guineas per *month for all the time the ship was in his service; issue was taken on the plea; the jury decided that three hundred and fifty-seven pounds remained unpaid; but say nothing as to the rest of the five hundred pounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">In Rex <em>v. </em>Dean of St. Asoph, Lord Mansfield says, \u201cIf the verdict omitting finding anything within the province of the jury to find, no judgment could be given, and there must be a <em>venire de novo.\u201d </em>3 Term, 426, in notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">\u201c A verdict that finds qjart of the issue and finding nothing for the residue; this is deficient for the whole, because they have not tried the whole issue wherewith they are charged.\u201d Thomas\u2019 edition of 3 Coke Lit. 539. \u201c As an information for intrusion into a house and one hundred acres of land, if the verdict finds against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u2022the defendant for the land and says nothing about the house, it is void for the whole.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">\u201c In trespass against husband and wife, for beating his horse \u2022and other trespasses, a verdict that the wife beat the horse and for the residue not guilty, but says nothing about the husband, whether he beat the horse or not, is bad.\u201d Drury <em>v. </em>Dennis, Yelverton, 10 C.

Kilboun <em>v. </em>Wateron et al., Kirby, 124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">In Yon Bethysen <em>v. </em>Dewitt et al., 4 Johnson, 313. \u201cIf no damages are assessed upon the breaches assigned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, it is error.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">In Patterson <em>v. </em>United States, 2 Wheaton, 225, it is decided \u201c that .a verdict is bad if it varies from the issue in a substantial matter, or if it find only a part of that which is in issue. The reason of .the rule is obvious, it results from the nature and the end of pleading ; whether the jury find a general or a special verdict, it is their duty to decide the *very point in issue, and although the court in which the cause is tried may give form to a general finding, so as to make it harmonize with the issue, yet if it appears to that court or the appellate court that the finding is different from the issue, or is confined only to a part of the matter in \u25a0issue, no judgment can be rendered upon the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-10\">In my judgment, says Judge Story, in Steams et al. <em>v </em>Banet, where a verdict is not expressed substantially in the terms of the issue, the cause ought to be extremely clear, that should induce the court to make it the ground of a final judgment. 2 Mason, 173.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-11\">Judge Dane</author>\n<p id=\"APE\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The two first points are easily disposed of. The plaintiff has declared by <em>prochein ami, </em>but the record nowhere shows that he is ,a minor. Unless such fact appear, we must presume him of age, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and may well reject the curatorship as surplusage, which does not vitiate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The second plea, upon which the second point is predicated, sets forth the hypothetical assumption, correct in point of law, that if a minor he should sue <em>by prochein ami. </em>Minority is a fact which should be distinctly averred, that it may be traversed. It is not so alleged, and does not so appear of record, consequently, if true, it can not avail the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The tbi-rd point has given us more difficulty. It is plain .that the verdict of the jury should respond to all the questions submitted by the issues, and where an issue is left unanswered no judgment should be rendered. The court in which the verdict is given exercises the power of amending it, and of conforming it to the-issue, whenever the meaning of the jury can be distinctly ascertained, and when it appears they have acted and decided on the' whole merits. 3 Ohio, 384. It sometimes happens that the finding of one issue concludes the whole, although some are unanswered. The pleas of not guilty and justification in tort illustrate this. The finding of not guilty is enough, since it shows that no facts are proven, which it is necessary to expuse.</p>\n<p id=\"ADEq\">*In the present case, no doubt would arise but that the court of common pleas, when the present verdict was returned to them, might with propriety have applied it to all the issues, and have amended it, so as to have made it a full answer to each. The intention of the jury is sufficiently manifest, and the verdict contains enough. We entertain the opinion that the verdict <em>per se, </em>unamended, is no answer to any other plea than the general one. Had it been \u201c not guilty,\u201d by negativing the assault, it would have been a sufficient answer to the justification, for no fact would have been left to justify. But a verdict of \u201c guilty,\u201d may, and must be found,' before the jury proceed to the other question, and it may be truly found, while the justification is fully proved, and fully available as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8-pl-split\">Is it within the authority of this court to make the amendment?' By some of the English statutes of jeofails, the authority to amend is conferred in all its latitude, not only upon the court where the judgment was rendered, but in the court to which the record is-removed by error. And now, by the English practice, amendments may not only be made in the court to which the error is triable, but the court will disregard such errors as are amendable, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>by intendment will sometimes consider the amendment as made,, without any actual alteration of the record. But the statute of Ohio limits the right of amendment to the time before bringing writ of error. And for many years past, it has been held settled, that after the allowance of error, the right to amend is taken away; I am sure this effect is not conducive .to justice, and believe, that if the question were new at this time, that the statute might properly receive a different construction. But a majority of the court think themselves bound by this long-continued practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Two cases are cited by the plaintiff in error, which deserve-notice. In 10 Mass. 66, where an action was disseizin, plea not guilty as to part, and non-tenure for remainder, .a verdict of not guilty only, the court rest their opinion upon the point that the-state of the record lays no foundation for a verdict for one. But they fully recognize the position, that the - court below \u201c might work it into form,\u201d and make it answer the justice of the case, and they do not decide the *form of the verdict, as it then stood, was an answer to both pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The case in 2 Burr. 698, seems precisely in point, to show that the verdict is good. A more minute examination of that case,, leads us to believe, that decision was made with reference to their peculiar mode of practice, in amending in the court of error, and of holding an error that might be amended not to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Upon the whole, a majority of the court believe that the verdict, until amended, is no answer to the three last pleas, and that it can' not be amended in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
