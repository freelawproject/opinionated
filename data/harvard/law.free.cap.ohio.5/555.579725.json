The object of the bill was to charge the real estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the late Arthur St. Clair, deceased, in the hands of the defendants, with the payment of a debt of the intestate. Administration had been granted, and all the estate, real and personal, disposed of, by the administrator, who died after.the commencement of this suit. No administrator <em>de bonis non </em>having been appointed, a question was made whether the cause could proceed without such appointment, and the person receiving it being party defendant to the suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-9\">Caswell and Starr, and Hammond, for the complainant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoa\">in-sisted that an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>need not be appointed. The whole estate having been disposed of, and the defendants being alone interested in resisting the debt, and in protecting the property against being subjected to the payment of it, there was nothing fo\u2019r an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>to do.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-11\">N. Wright and Worthington, for the respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQe1\">suggested . that if the court were of opinion th^t a valid decree could be \u00ab\u2022made, as the case stood, they were satisfied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b514-12\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">It is safest to make the appointment. It has always been held -that to charge a decedent\u2019s estate with his debts, there must be a \u25a0personal representative to proceed against. We are not willing to make a new precedent. The cause will be continued that the ap,;pointment may be made, and the party brought before the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
