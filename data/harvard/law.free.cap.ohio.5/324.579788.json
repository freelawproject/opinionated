That defendant\u2019s house was and is situate near the junction of several leading and public roads, Upon which there was much traveling, and that it was usual and customary for travelers to make the defendant\u2019s house a stopping place either for breakfast, dinner, horse-feed or lodging; that such were in the habit of stopping there without invitation, and with no more ceremony than is usually practiced ata tavern. That the defendant was never known to turn any such persons away, but, on the contrary, furnished food and lodging, stabling and horse-feed, as desired, receiving therefor reasonable compensation.\u201d It was further proved that the defendant did not, during such time, sell, vend, or retail any vinous or spirituous liquors to any person ; that he did not give or furnish any such liquors to his guest\u00bb or any other person, and that he did not keep any in his said house. Upon the foregoing facts, the court of common pleas charged the jury that if they should find the facts as stated in the bill of exceptions to be true, such facts constituted a tavern-keeper within the statute, and an offense under the statute. The jury found the defendant guilty, and he was adjudged to pay a fine of ten dollars and costs. To reverse this judgment the present writ of error was brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-7\">Goddard and Converse for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUg\">contended that the term <em>tavern, </em>as used in the statute, embraced onty those who kept public houses for supplying guests with liquors, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>food and lodgings. They cited Johnson\u2019s Dictionary, Shakespeare, and Swift, and, as being in principle analogous, Parkhurst <em>v. </em>Foster, 1 Salk. 387.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-5\">Nye, for the state,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALaa\">argued, that persons who made it a business regularly, and whenever called upon, to supply travelers and their horses with entertainment, for compensation, *and who was' notoriously known as furnishing such supplies, were tavern-keepers, within the statute, and subject to its penalties. On the construction of the statutes, he cited 6 Bac. Ab. 380; 2 Cranch, 386. The case cited from Salkeld was considered as bearing no analogy to this.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The court were divided in opinion : Judges Hitchcock and Uollet, for reversing the judgment; Judges Lane and Wright, for affirming it.
