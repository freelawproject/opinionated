We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In September 1983, Nancy Jane Dudley Maxwell Pugh Hall (whose surname is now Smith) was indicted in the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg for the murder on October 31, 1970, of her then husband, Donald Wayne Pugh. At a jury trial in December 1984, she was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. In December 1985, her petition for appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals. We granted an appeal limited to the question set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Donald Wayne Pugh was killed by gunshot wounds while he was riding as a passenger in an automobile driven by his wife, the defendant, on the Lynchburg Expressway. Immediately after the shooting, the defendant gave several conflicting accounts of the event to the effect that one or more black males, unknown to her, had fired the shots into the car. Susan Sowell, a girl 13 years of age in 1970, gave a statement to a police investigator two years later in which she said that the defendant had told her before the shooting that she disliked Pugh, that she thought she was a beneficiary on his insurance policy, and that she had arranged for James Ward, with whom the defendant was then carrying on an extramarital sexual relationship, to murder Pugh. The investigator subsequently died and his notes were lost. The defendant was not indicted until 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Susan Sowell and another witness tending to prove that James Ward had killed Pugh at the defendant\u2019s behest. The Commonwealth did not call Ward as its witness. After the Commonwealth had rested its case, Ward was called as a witness for the defense. On direct examination, he admitted that he had a sexual relationship with the defendant during her marriage to Pugh, but denied that he was involved in Pugh\u2019s murder and denied that he had ever discussed any such thing with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Commonwealth then cross-examined Ward as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Q. Do you remember being interviewed by Investigator Wingfield, with the police, back on September 15th, 1983, about 2:00 p.m.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">Q. Okay. Do you remember being asked the following questions and giving the following answers by Investigator Wingfield? All right. Let me start at the beginning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>[Reading from a transcript]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">\u201cQ. [by Wingfield] So you tell me you have some knowledge of it, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cQ. (by Wingfield) What\u2019s the knowledge of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cA. (by Ward) I was just offered a proposition to get rid of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cQ. (by Wingfield) What do you mean get rid of him? \u201cA. (by Ward) I reckon kill him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cQ. (by Wingfield) When did she \u2014 meaning Nancy, if you read the entire statement, the defendant \u2014 tell you about all this? When did she ask you this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201cA. (by you, Ward) I can\u2019t recall right offhand. It was a pretty long time ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201cQ. (by Wingfield) Okay. Now he was killed Halloween night, do you remember whether it was the same day he was killed or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">\u201cA. (by Ward) No, it was way before that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">\u201cQ. (Wingfield) Way before that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">\u201cA. (Ward) Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">\u201cQ. (Wingfield) Do you have any idea how much before that it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">\u201cA. (Ward) Uh-huh.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">Q. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">A. Not all of it. Well, see, that was not right. He asked me a whole lot of questions and kept jumping around asking me did I know anybody gun running and stuff like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">Q. It was tape recorded. Here\u2019s the transcript. (Indicating.) You\u2019re more than welcome to read it and refresh your recollection. Tell the jury if you remember saying all that stuff and a whole lot more in there before we go into it any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-20\">A. (Witness complied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-21\">Q. Do you remember making those statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-22\">A. Some of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-23\">Q. Well, were they true, or were you lying to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-24\">A. Well, he was badgering on me so much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-25\">Q. Well, did you lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Q. So all this you told the police was a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Q. Now did \u2014 let me ask you again, did the defendant ever</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">ask you if you would be interested in killing her husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">Q. Do you remember being asked by the detective the following question and giving the following answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cQ. (Wingfield) \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">[Defense Counsel]: If Your Honor please, it strikes me that the jury probably should be told right at this stage that this is not evidence against Mrs. Pugh. It\u2019s merely an attempt to impeach this witness, and I don\u2019t think the jury should get the concept of this anyway if it\u2019s not evidence against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">THE COURT: My jury instructions will cover that. It goes to credibility of this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">[Defense Counsel]: I think it should be sufficiently pointed out so it will be no question about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll do it at the proper time. This is not the proper time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Later, the court ruled that the Commonwealth was not entitled to read the entire statement taken by Wingfield from Ward, but that the Commonwealth could ask the witness if he recalled the questions and if his answers had been truthful. Ward admitted some recollection of giving the statement, denied it in part, and added: \u201cIf I said it, I must have been lying.\u201d In rebuttal, the Commonwealth called Investigator Wingfield and sought to introduce the statement he had taken from Ward into evidence. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the formal introduction of the statement. The court then permitted Wingfield to testify that he had taken the statement, recorded it accurately, and given it to the Commonwealth, but the statement was not introduced as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">At the close of all the evidence, the defendant again requested that the court include, as a part of the general jury instructions, an instruction that Ward\u2019s statement to Wingfield \u201cis not evidence against this accused.\u201d The court declined to do so on the ground that such an instruction would be a comment on the evidence, and that the matter was sufficiently covered by the court\u2019s general in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>struction on the subject of credibility, which told the jury that it might consider any prior inconsistent statements in weighing the credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The Court of Appeals, in its order denying the defendant\u2019s petition for appeal, concluded that the trial court had not erred in refusing a cautionary instruction because Ward\u2019s prior inconsistent statement \u201cwas not admitted into evidence.\u201d Because the jury heard the content of the statement, we think that to be a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It is fundamental to the right of cross-examination that a witness who is not a party to the case on trial may be impeached by prior statements made by the witness which are inconsistent with his present testimony, provided a foundation is first laid by calling his attention to the statement and then questioning him about it before it is introduced in evidence. <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Downes, </em>177 Va. 451, 459, 14 S.E.2d 345, 348 (1941). <em>See also Roberts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 264, 269, 337 S.E.2d 255, 258 (1985). Prior inconsistent statements of this kind, however, are inadmissible hearsay if they are offered to prove the truth of their content because they suffer from all of the usual disabilities of hearsay, <em>e.g., </em>they were made out of court, under circumstances which the jury cannot evaluate; the witness was not under oath when they were made; the jury was unable to observe the demeanor of the witness when making them; and the witness was not available for cross-examination when they were made. For these reasons the common-law rules of evidence, to which we adhere, have consistently required that when such statements are offered for impeachment, the opposing party is entitled, upon request, to a cautionary instruction advising the jury that the statements are to be considered only insofar as they may affect the credibility of the witness, and may not be considered as proof of the truth of their content. <em>Stoots </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 857, 866, 66 S.E.2d 866, 871 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-403, applicable to civil and criminal cases alike, expressly provides that an adverse witness may be impeached by proof of a prior inconsistent statement, but \u201c[i]n every such case the court, if requested by either party, shall instruct the jury not to consider the evidence of such inconsistent statements, except for the purpose of contradicting the witness.\u201d The statute applies only to witnesses on direct examination who \u201cshall in the opinion of the court prove adverse.\u201d The common-law rule dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>cussed above, however, is broader than the statute, and includes witnesses impeached on cross-examination at any stage of the case. The rule is well summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">[P]rior inconsistent statements are admitted solely to attack the credibility of the witness who has told different stories at different times. They are not evidence of the truth of the content of the statements, <em>and the court must so instruct the jury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">C. Friend, The Law of Evidence in Virginia \u00a7 28, at 73 (2nd ed. 1983) (emphasis added). The opposing party may, of course, waive the benefit of a cautionary instruction if he so chooses, <em>Manetta </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 123, 127, n.2, 340 S.E.2d 828, 830, n.2 (1986), but here the defendant insisted on her right to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Commonwealth argues on appeal that the rule is inapplicable because Ward\u2019s statement was never actually introduced in evidence. Because Ward, at least partially, denied making it, the Commonwealth would have had the right to introduce the statement into evidence, for the limited purposes of impeachment, after laying a proper foundation, followed by an appropriate cautionary instruction. The Commonwealth proceeded to lay such a foundation by calling the statement to the attention of the witness and asking him whether he made it. In the course of laying this foundation, the Commonwealth read the relevant questions and answers in the jury\u2019s hearing. The effect of that procedure on the jury was the same as if the statement had been formally introduced, and the court\u2019s refusal to admit the statement in evidence is immaterial. <em>See Roberts </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. at 269, 337 S.E.2d at 258-59 (cautionary instruction properly given where adverse witness impeached by prior inconsistent statement partially read to jury but not introduced in evidence).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Finally, the Commonwealth argues that even if the trial court erred in refusing a cautionary instruction, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. We cannot agree. The direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime consisted entirely of incriminating admissions testified to by Susan Sowell. It was corroborated by circumstantial evidence consisting of the defendant\u2019s conflicting explanations given just after the killing, and the testimony of Garnett Merryman, who testified to Ward\u2019s relationship with the defendant and Ward\u2019s communication with her and subsequent suspicious behavior on the night of the killing. After Ward, as a defense witness, had denied criminal knowledge or participation, his statement to the police that the defendant had solicited him to murder her husband was compelling and persuasive corroboration of Susan Sowell\u2019s testimony. It might have been the only factor inducing the jury to believe her. We cannot, therefore, say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be vacated, the order appealed from reversed, and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the same to the trial court for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> As the Commonwealth notes on brief, some writers assume that juries are unable or unwilling to follow cautionary instructions, that they are uniformly disregarded, and that such an instruction is a \u201cmere verbal ritual\u201d or \u201ca pious fraud.\u201d <em>See United States </em>v. <em>De </em>Sisto, 329 F.2d 929, 933 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 979 (1964). We are not persuaded to that view. The many records of jury trials which we review on appeal demonstrate no pattern showing routine disregard of the trial court\u2019s instructions. Indeed, so contrary is our view that we presume, unless the record expressly shows otherwise, that juries conscientiously follow an explicit cautionary instruction promptly given. <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
