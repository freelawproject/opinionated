During the times pertinent to this case, CVEC purchased substantially all its electric power at wholesale rates from Virginia Electric Power Company (VEPCO). The electric power sold by VEPCO to CVEC was metered in Nelson County, which then had no local business license tax on utilities. Amherst County had such a tax, but was unable to impose it on the electric power sold by VEPCO to CVEC because no such sales were made in Amherst County.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Amherst County imposed its local business license tax on CVEC, based on CVEC\u2019s gross receipts from retail sales to its Amherst County customers. In February 1982, CVEC first filed a report with Amherst County showing its gross receipts without deduction and paid for its 1982 local business license. Three days later, CVEC filed an amended report seeking a deduction from its gross receipts based on the prorated wholesale cost of the electric power it had purchased from VEPCO in Nelson County and sold to retail customers in Amherst County. The amended report sought to recover the overpayment CVEC contended it had made based on its original report. The Commissipner of Revenue of Amherst County (the Commissioner) denied a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">In January 1983, CVEC applied to the Commissioner for a 1983 business license, reporting as its gross receipts the balance remaining after deducting its prorated cost of wholesale power purchased from VEPCO. CVEC also attempted to offset its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>claimed 1982 overpayment against the local business license tax due in 1983. As a result, the Commissioner refused to issue a 1983 business license.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">CVEC brought a motion for declaratory judgment against the Amherst County Board of Supervisors and the Commissioner. After a bench trial, the court ruled that CVEC was entitled to deduct the prorated cost of its wholesale purchases of power from its gross receipts in Amherst County and entered an order directing the Commissioner to pay CVEC its claimed refund and to issue it a 1983 business license. We granted Amherst County an Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The case is controlled by former Code \u00a7 58-603, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">(2) Any city, town or county may impose a license tax under \u00a7 58-266.1 upon such corporation for the privilege of doing business therein, which shall not exceed one-half of one percent of the gross receipts of such business accruing to such corporation from such business in such city, town or county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">(6) There shall be deducted for purposes of this section from the gross receipts of any electric cooperative, as defined in \u00a7 56-209, which is engaged in sales to ultimate consumers, and every corporation engaged in the business of furnishing heat, light and power by means of electricity the amount paid in such taxable period by such cooperative or corporation to purchase electricity from a vendor subject to the state franchise tax.<footnotemark>[*]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Code \u00a7 58-603(6) was plain and unambiguous. It provided a deduction \u201cfor purposes of this section.\u201d Thus, it affected \u00a7 58-603, of which it was a part, including all sub-parts of that section. One sub-part so affected was \u00a7 58-603(2), which was the sole enabling statute permitting localities to impose business privilege license taxes on public service corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>It is true, as Amherst County points out, that \u00a7 58-603(2) said that the localities may impose a license tax \u201cunder \u00a7 58-266.1, \u201d but an examination of the latter section makes clear that it was, with respect to public service corporations, not a grant of local power to tax, but rather a limitation on that power. Code \u00a7 58-266.1 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">(1) No city, town or county shall levy any license tax in any case in which the levying of a local license tax is prohibited by any general law of the Commonwealth, <em>or on any public service corporation </em>except as permitted by other provisions of law, nor shall this section be construed as repealing or affecting in any way any general law limiting the amount or rate of any local license tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(Emphasis added). We therefore construe the words \u201cunder \u00a7 58-266.1, \u201d as contained in \u00a7 58-603(2), to mean \u201csubject to the limitations contained in \u00a7 58-266.1.\u201d Any other construction would impair the power of the localities to impose the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Because the power to impose the tax emanated from Code \u00a7 58-603(2), and because that section was made subject to a deduction for the wholesale cost of power by \u00a7 58-603(6), we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[*]\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">* When Title 58 was repealed and recodified as Title 58.1, effective January 1, 1985, these provisions were replaced by \u00a7\u00a7 58.1-3731 and 3732 which make no provision for deduction of the wholesale cost of electricity from gross receipts for the purposes of local business license taxes. Code \u00a7 58.1-2627 does, however, continue such a deduction in effect with respect to the annual state license tax imposed by \u00a7 58.1-2626.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
