The decree was entered on evidence taken by deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Timothy and Pamela Collins were married in 1973. In 1982, Pamela filed a bill seeking a divorce on the ground of constructive desertion. Timothy answered and filed a cross-bill seeking a divorce on the ground of desertion or, in the alternative, a no-fault divorce as provided in Code \u00a7 20-91(9). By final decree entered January 12, 1984, the chancellor dismissed Pamela\u2019s bill, granted Timothy\u2019s prayer for a no-fault divorce, awarded Pamela custody of the four children born of the marriage (the oldest of whom was 10 years of age), and ordered Timothy to pay Pamela $540 per month for child support and $350 for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">In a letter opinion, the chancellor held that \u201c[t]he wife will not be entitled to spousal support\u201d, and that ruling was expressly reaffirmed in the final decree. On appeal, Pamela confines her complaint to that ruling. Specifically, she contends that \u201c[t]he court below erred in failing to consider the provisions of [Code] \u00a7 20-107\u201d, and she asks us to remand the cause for a spousal-support determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Our decision in this case is guided by three recent decisions of this Court. In <em>Brooker </em>v. <em>Brooker, </em>218 Va. 12, 235 S.E.2d 309 (1977), the no-fault divorce decree was silent on the question of spousal support. We remanded the cause for a determination of that question because the chancellor failed to make \u201cany finding respecting the various factors required to be considered under Code \u00a7 20-107.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 235 S.E.2d at 310. In the no-fault divorce decree entered in <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Bristow, </em>221 Va. 1, 267 S.E.2d 89 (1980), the chancellor ruled that \u201cthe wife \u2018is not entitled to either further support ... or any future support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 267 S.E.2d at 90. The husband defended the ruling as an act of judicial discretion. We held that \u201cthe statute [Code \u00a7 20-107] commands that, in order to exercise its discretion, \u2018[t]he court shall . . . consider\u2019 the specific factors contained therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the chancellor felt it necessary to consider only one of the six statutory factors, we remanded the cause and instructed the chancellor to \u201chear such additional evidence as may be relevant to consideration of all the factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 20-107\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 267 S.E.2d at 90-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In <em>Thomasson </em>v. <em>Thomasson, </em>225 Va. 394, 398, 302 S.E.2d 63, 66 (1983), we defined the two-step process required in the determination of an application for spousal support. Unlike the decisions in <em>Brooker </em>and <em>Bristow, </em>we affirmed a no-fault decree which made no provision for spousal support because the record before us, including a letter opinion, made it clear that \u201cthe chancellor gave careful consideration to all of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 302 S.E.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The letter opinion and the decree now under review contain no findings underlying the chancellor\u2019s ruling that \u201c[t]he wife will not be entitled to spousal support.\u201d Because the ruling is purely conclusory, we cannot tell whether it was based upon a finding that Pamela was guilty of marital fault amounting to a ground for divorce (see Code \u00a7 20-91 (9) (c)), or that Timothy was unable to make support payments, or that Pamela did not need support.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Reaffirming the rule distilled from the opinions we have cited, we hold that when a divorce decree, grounded in Code \u00a7 20-91(9), denies an award of spousal support (whether expressly or by failure to address the issue), the decree will be reversed and the cause remanded unless the record on appeal reveals that the chancellor made a finding, supported by credible evidence, either (a) that the appellant was guilty of a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-91(1), (3), or (6) or \u00a7 20-95, or (b) that, in consideration of the several factors enumerated in Code \u00a7 20-107.1,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the equities of the parties weighed against an award of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">We will reverse the decree insofar as it denies Pamela spousal support and remand the cause with instructions to conduct a new evidentiary hearing and to enter a decree in compliance with the rule we have defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\"><em> </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1 is the statutory descendant of Code \u00a7 20-107 which was repealed by Acts 1982, c. 309.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
