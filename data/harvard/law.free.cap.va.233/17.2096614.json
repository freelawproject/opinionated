W. Yeatts, Inc. (Yeatts), a highway contractor, against the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation (VDH&amp;T) for additional compensation allegedly due under a contract for certain grading and excavation work performed by Yeatts on a highway project in Campbell County. The trial court awarded Yeatts a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>against the VDH&amp;T. We granted an appeal limited to the question whether Yeatts gave the VDH&amp;T sufficient notice of intent to file a claim, as required by the contract and by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In granting the appeal, we also directed the parties to address the question whether this Court or the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to decide the case. We raised this question because, under Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1), the Court of Appeals is given jurisdiction of any case involving a \u201cfinal decision of a circuit court on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency,\u201d and it was our impression that this appeal might involve just such a case. After briefing and argument, we conclude we do not have jurisdiction in the case and must dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In resolving the question of jurisdiction, it is necessary to inquire whether VDH&amp;T is an administrative agency and, if so, whether a court challenge to a VDH&amp;T decision is an appeal. In this connection, certain statutory provisions are pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Under Code \u00a7 33.1-386,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a highway contractor may file a claim with the VDH&amp;T for the amount alleged to be due under con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tract. The VDH&amp;T must notify the contractor of its decision within 90 days after receipt of the claim. If dissatisfied with the decision, the contractor must give notice that he desires to appear before the State Highway Commissioner (the Commissioner) and present additional facts and argument in-support of his claim. The Commissioner must schedule a hearing within 30 days of receipt of the notice and must notify the contractor of his decision within 45 days after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Under Code \u00a7 33.1-387, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the contractor is permitted to file an action in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, or the circuit court where the project is located, for any portion of the claim denied by the Commissioner. The action is instituted by the filing of a petition, and trial is without a jury. Prior submission of the claim to the VDH&amp;T as prescribed in Code \u00a7 33.1-386 is made a condition precedent to bringing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">With respect to the question whether the VDH&amp;T is an administrative agency within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1), we noted in <em>Va. Beach Beautification Comm. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Zoning, </em>231 Va. 415, 344 S.E.2d 899 (1986), that \u201c[t]he statutes dealing with the Court of Appeals do not define \u2018administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 344 S.E.2d at 901. We noted further, however, that in the Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:1 to -6.14:25, \u201cthe General Assembly has established a definition of \u2018agency\u2019 applicable to the general field of administrative decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>According to the definition in the Administrative Process Act, the term \u201c\u2018[ajgewcy\u2019 means any authority, instrumentality, officer, board or other unit of the state government empowered by the basic laws to make regulations or decide cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(A) (italics in original). The State Highway Commission, charged with reviewing and approving policies of the VDH&amp;T, Code \u00a7 33.1-12(7), is an administrative department of the State, <em>Southern Railway </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>159 Va. 779, 786, 167 S.E. 578, 579, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>290 U.S. 190 (1933), and, hence, a unit of state government. The Commission is empowered by the basic laws to make regulations concerning, among other things, \u201ctraffic on and the use of systems of state highways.\u201d Code \u00a7 33.1-12(3). The State Highway Commissioner is the chief executive officer of the VDH&amp;T, and, hence, an officer of state government. He is empowered by the basic laws to decide cases. Code \u00a7 33.1-386.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Furthermore, the VDH&amp;T has filed its regulations with the State Registrar of Regulations, as required for all agencies defined in the Virginia Register Act. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.15 to -6.22. <em>See </em>Va. Code, Administrative Law Appendix (1986-87) 96. Significantly, the definition of the term \u201cagency\u201d contained in the Register Act at \u00a7 9-6.16 is virtually identical with the definition of the term in the Administrative Process Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Clearly, therefore, the Administrative Process Act\u2019s definition of the term \u201cagency\u201d includes the VDH&amp;T. Indeed, the VDH&amp;T tacitly concedes that it is an administrative agency. It insists, however, that exemptions contained in the Administrative Process Act, combined with this Court\u2019s rationale in the <em>Beautification Comm, </em>case, make clear that jurisdiction in the present appeal is vested in this Court and not in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The <em>Beautification Comm, </em>case involved the question whether a board of zoning appeals is an administrative agency whose decisions, after review by a circuit court, may be appealed only to the Court of Appeals. After borrowing from the Administrative Process Act for a definition of the term \u201cagency\u201d as meaning \u201cany . . . board ... of the state government,\u201d we noted that the Act exempted from its provisions municipal corporations and counties. 231 Va. at 417, 344 S.E.2d at 901. We then said that a board of zoning appeals is not a board of State government but an entity established by either a municipality or a county. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we stated that the General Assembly did not intend to include a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>board of zoning appeals within the meaning of the term \u201cadministrative agency\u201d in Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The exemptions relied upon by the VDH&amp;T exclude from the provisions of the Administrative Process Act certain \u201cagency actions,\u201d including those relating to damage claims arising from state contracts for the construction of public facilities. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.1(B)(1), (2), and (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From these exemptions and the <em>Beautification Comm, </em>rationale, the VDH&amp;T argues that when, as here, it reviews construction contract claims under Code \u00a7 33.1-386, it is not acting in an agency status and, hence, is not an administrative agency within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1) at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We disagree with the VDH&amp;T. In borrowing from the Administrative Process Act for a definition of the term \u201cadministrative agency,\u201d we did not incorporate all the provisions of the Act into Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1). We merely cited one of the Act\u2019s exemptions to prove the point that a board of zoning appeals is not a board of State government. We could just as well have turned to the Virginia Register Act for a definition of the term \u201cadministrative agency\u201d and avoided the implication that we are bound by all the provisions of the Administrative Process Act in construing Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In examining both the definition and the exemptions in the Administrative Process Act, we were searching for legislative intent. Superimposing all the Act\u2019s provisions upon Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1) might well tend to thwart that search and produce absurd results, an eventuality we should seek to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">For example, to say that the VDH&amp;T acts in an agency status in some cases but not in others would produce the result that some VDH&amp;T decisions would be appealed to this Court and others to the Court of Appeals. In every case, counsel would be put at risk trying to decide in which court his particular appeal might lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We are confident the General Assembly did not intend this sort of confusion, and we think the application of a test enunciated in <em>Beautification Comm, </em>will serve to give effect to the true legislative intent. There, analyzing Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">Significantly, the statute focuses on the nature of the entity making the decision rather than the substance of the decision itself. That is, the statute deals with a decision made by an administrative agency and not with an administrative decision made by some entity that is not purely an administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">231 Va. at 417, 344 S.E.2d at 901. Application of the test to this case demonstrates clearly that the VDH&amp;T is an administrative agency occupying an agency status even when deciding construction contract claims under Code \u00a7 33.1-386.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This brings us to the question whether the civil action permitted by Code \u00a7 33.1-387 is an appeal within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1). The VDH&amp;T argues that what is permitted is not an appeal but an independent action which is tried de novo in the appropriate circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The VDH&amp;T submits that our decision on this point is controlled by <em>Allstar Towing, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Alexandria, </em>231 Va. 421, 344 S.E.2d 903 (1986). There, we said that an independent action filed to protest the administrative award of a contract is not an appeal from an administrative agency within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1). Consequently, we held that this Court and not the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction over an appeal from the judgment in the independent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Substantial differences in available statutory remedies distinguish <em>Allstar. </em>There, we pointed out that \u201cCode \u00a7 11-66 permits a bidder to protest the decision to award a contract by invoking administrative procedures under Code \u00a7 11-71 <em>\u2018or in the alternative </em>by instituting legal action as provided in \u00a7 11-70.\u2019\u201d 231 Va. at 424, 344 S.E.2d at 905 (emphasis added). Section 11-70, we said, \u201cpermits the bidder to bring an action at law in the appropriate circuit court challenging the decision by the public body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that the bidder had brought the action under \u00a7 11-70 \u201cand not under the administrative appeals procedure authorized by \u00a7 11-71\u201d and, hence, we held that appellate jurisdiction lay with this Court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Here, Yeatts had no alternative but to pursue the administrative procedures authorized by Code \u00a7 33.1-386, and the submission of its claim in the time and manner prescribed by that Code section was a condition precedent to the right to file a civil action under \u00a7 33.1-387. In other words, Yeatts\u2019 right to bring a civil action was dependent upon having first invoked administrative procedures. Hence, the action permitted by \u00a7 33.1-387 is dependent and not independent.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Admittedly, \u201cappeal\u201d and \u201ccivil action\u201d ordinarily are not considered synonymous terms. Divining legislative intent, however, is not a contest of labels but an exercise in common sense interpretation of statutory language. Considering the administrative context in which both terms are used in the statutes in question, we think the \u00a7 33.1-387 civil action is, in legislative intendment, a \u00a7 17-116.05(1) appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Because this case involves a \u201cfinal decision of a circuit court on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency,\u201d Code \u00a7 17-116.05(1), the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction, and we do not. Accordingly, as previously indicated, we must dismiss this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> \u00a7 33.1-386. <em>Submission of claims; initial investigation and notice of decision; appearance before Commmissioner; further investigation and notice of decision; settlement. </em>\u2014 A.
