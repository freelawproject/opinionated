McClelland in the commission of robbery, Code \u00a7 18.2-31(d), the robbery of McClelland, the abduction of Mc-Clelland, the use of a firearm in the commission of each of those felonies, and the arson of McClelland\u2019s automobile. The robbery occurred on May 2, 1985, at Murphy\u2019s Mart store in the City of Portsmouth where McClelland was the manager. A jury convicted Gray of all counts, fixing his punishment at life imprisonment on the robbery charge, life imprisonment on the abduction charge, 10 years in the penitentiary on the arson charge, and four years in the penitentiary on each of the firearm charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Pursuant to the bifurcated-trial procedure for capital murder cases, a separate penalty trial was conducted on the capital murder conviction. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4. In the penalty trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence of aggravating factors and Gray introduced evidence in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The jury fixed Gray\u2019s sentence at death. Following a sentencing hearing conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, the trial court imposed the death sentence. Thereafter, the trial court entered judgments on all the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">We have consolidated the automatic review of Gray\u2019s death sentence with his appeal from his conviction of capital murder, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1 (A) and -110.1(F), and have given them priority on our docket, Code \u00a7 17-110.2. By order entered May 8, 1986, the appeals of the other convictions were certified from the Court of Appeals and consolidated with the capital murder appeal. Code \u00a7 17-116.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS A</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\n<em>Constitutionality of the Death Penalty Statute.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Gray makes various challenges to Virginia\u2019s death penalty statute, each of which we have previously rejected. He first contends that the death penalty violates the proscription against cruel and unusual punishment contained in the Federal and Virginia Constitutions. In accord with our previous decisions, we again reject this contention. <em>See, e.g., Boggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 501, 505, 331 S.E.2d 407, 411 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1031 (1986); <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 134, 314 S.E.2d 371, 378, <em>cert. denied, 469 </em>U.S. 873 (1984); <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 66, 77-78, 286 S.E.2d 162, 168-69, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 882 (1982); <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 844, 851, 284 S.E.2d 844, 849 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 938 (1982); <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 267, 257 S.E.2d 808, 814 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1091, 1095, 254 S.E.2d 116, 118-19, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 919 (1979); <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 698-99, 251 S.E.2d 202, 211-12, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924 (1979); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 476, 248 S.E.2d 135, 148 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Gray next contends that the aggravating factors which a jury must find in order to impose the death penalty, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and \u201can open invitation to allow an arbitrary and irrational decision.\u201d We reaffirm our previous rejection of this contention. <em>See, e.g., Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 490, 331 S.E.2d 422, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>437-38 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986); <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 134-35, 314 S.E.2d at 378; <em>Bunch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 423, 441, 304 S.E.2d 271, 281, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 977 (1983); <em>Smith, </em>219 Va. at 476-78, 248 S.E.2d at 148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Finally, Gray argues that Virginia\u2019s sentencing scheme is \u201coverbroad, vague and facially unconstitutional\u201d because Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 allows a jury to examine an accused\u2019s \u201cpast criminal record\u201d while Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for examination of his \u201cprior history.\u201d For reasons expressed in previous decisions, we again reject this argument. <em>See Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 487, 331 S.E.2d at 435-36; <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 564, 593-94, 304 S.E.2d 644, 660 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\n<em>Admissibility of Statements Made by Gray to the Police.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Gray contends that his statements to the police were \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d He argues that his statements were not voluntary under either the requirement set forth in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), or the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Gray gave statements to the police on two occasions. The first statement was given to Officer Freeman on the morning of May 22, 1985. The second statement was given to Sergeant Lilley and Detective Bunker on the evening of May 23, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Freeman testified at the suppression hearing that at 8:30 a.m. on May 22, 1985, Gray, who was in a holding cell at the Suffolk jail, \u201cshouted out that he wanted to talk to me.\u201d Freeman walked to the cell, and Gray said he \u201cwanted to get something off his mind that had been bothering him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Approximately 9:30 a.m., after Gray had eaten breakfast, he was brought to Freeman\u2019s office. Freeman told Gray that he would not talk to him unless Gray executed a \u201cLegal Rights Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>vice Form.\u201d Freeman then presented Gray with a form and read each question on the form to him. Gray executed the form, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">SUFFOLK POLICE DIVISION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Legal Rights Advice Form</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Date May 22, 1985</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">1.

Bur</p>\n<p id=\"APv\">Exact Location Exact Location</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Freeman testified that after executing the form, Gray, without any questioning by Freeman, became \u201cemotional,\u201d and began walking around the room, hitting the wall and exclaiming, \u201cthe man wasn\u2019t supposed to die.\u201d Freeman suggested that Gray \u201c[c]alm . . . down, just sit down [and] [t]ell me what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Without any questioning or interruption by Freeman, Gray proceeded to give him a detailed account of how the offenses had occurred. Gray admitted he had participated in the commission of the crimes with Melvin Tucker, but stated that Tucker actually shot McClelland. Gray told Freeman: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you write anything. When we get into court it will just be your word against mine.\u201d After the interview, Freeman immediately returned to his office and reduced his recollection of Gray\u2019s statements to typewritten form.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">On the evening of May 22, Gray told Detective Lilley that he wanted to talk with him, saying he would tell \u201ceverything.\u201d Lilley told Gray that he would talk with him after the arraignment the following day. On the morning of the 23rd, Gray again told Lilley that he wanted to talk with him. Lilley first contacted Gray\u2019s court-appointed counsel and arranged for him to interview Gray. When he arrived at the police station, Gray\u2019s counsel conducted a lengthy interview with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">After his attorney left, Gray again \u201cdemanded\u201d in the presence of the Suffolk Chief of Police and Detective Bunker that he be allowed to speak with Lilley. Bunker testified at the suppression hearing that Gray asked him what he should do. Bunker asked Gray, \u201c[W]hat did your attorney tell you to do?\u201d Gray said, \u201cMy attorney told me to not say anything,\u201d to which Bunker responded, \u201cWell, then you should do what your attorney said.\u201d Gray, however, said, \u201cNo, I want to talk to Sergeant Lilley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Thereafter, Lilley was contacted and he, Bunker, and Gray went to Lilley\u2019s office. Gray executed another rights form containing essentially the same questions and answers as the one he had executed for Freeman the preceding day. Gray then gave Lilley a lengthy and detailed statement in question and answer form. The statement was tape-recorded on a machine that was in full view of Gray at all times, and he saw tapes being changed. When transcribed, the statement consisted of 78 typewritten pages. In his statement to Lilley, Gray again admitted his participation in each of the crimes for which he was charged, but continued to assert that Melvin Tucker was the person who shot McClelland.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Gray contends on appeal, as he did at the suppression hearing, that he would not have made any statements had he known that an unwritten statement could be used against him. He also claims he did not fully understand what his signature on the rights form meant. Additionally, Gray claims that the police made certain statements to him that were coercive or threatening or that contained promises of leniency. The police denied making threats, promises, or coercive statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The trial court found that Gray desired to make the statements and did so without promises, inducements, or intimidation. The court also concluded that Gray understood thoroughly his constitutional rights as set forth in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid only if the waiver is made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 475. Whether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S. Ct. 445, 450 (1985). Subsidiary factual questions, however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 106 S. Ct. at 451. The test to be applied in determining voluntariness is whether the statement is the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u201d or whether the maker\u2019s will \u201chas been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, courts look to \u201cthe totality of all the surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 226, including the defendant\u2019s background and experience and the conduct of the police, <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 464, 352 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987); <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 140, 314 S.E.2d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Gray was nearly 28 years old at the time of the offense. He possessed a high school equivalency diploma and stated that he could read and write. Gray initiated both conversations with the police. He stated that he understood the legal rights advice form, and his 12-year involvement with police and law enforcement procedures corroborates his statement. In addition to carefully explaining the waiver forms, the police repeatedly told him that they could make no promises or guarantees, and Gray indicated he understood. The police told Gray numerous times that he had a right to have his attorney present, a right to stop answering questions at any time, and that anything he said could be used against him. Gray indicated that he understood and repeatedly told the police that he wanted to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Our review of the record reveals that Gray\u2019s right to have counsel present and his privilege against self-incrimination were \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d by the police. <em>See Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 103 (1975). From an assessment of the totality of all the surrounding circumstances of the present case, we conclude, as did the trial court, that Gray\u2019s statements to the police were made freely, knowingly, and voluntarily and that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Gray\u2019s Telephone Statement to Officer Moore.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Gray moved to suppress certain statements that he made over the telephone to Officer Moore, contending that there was an insufficient identification of Gray as the party with whom Moore spoke. The trial court refused to suppress the statements, concluding that the matter was a question for the jury\u2019s consideration, and Gray assigned error to this ruling. Because a proper foundation had been laid for the admission of these statements, we find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\n<em>Searches and Seizures.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Gray contends that the seizure of certain evidence pertaining to McClelland\u2019s murder found in his home violated his Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Amendment rights. He also claims that the search of his automobile was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On May 10, 1985, police officers went to Gray\u2019s residence armed with a search warrant that authorized a search of his house for marijuana, paraphernalia, and other drug-related items. During the search, the officers found and seized a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The police also seized other items, unrelated to the drug charge, that connected Gray to the McClelland murder. Among the items seized were a quantity of .32-caliber cartridges, a pistol holster, a jewelry box and jewelry bearing Murphy\u2019s Mart price tags, and \u201cgym bags\u201d similar to those reported missing from Murphy\u2019s Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Gray does not contest the validity of the search warrant as it related to the drug charge; nor does he question the propriety of the seizure of the drug-related items. Moreover, he concedes that during the conduct of a valid search, the police are entitled to seize evidence of other crimes or contraband without securing an additional warrant. <em>See Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U.S. 145, 155 (1947). Gray also concedes that given the character of the evidence specified in the warrant, the police were permitted to search the places where evidence of the murder was found. <em>See Holloman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 947, 949, 275 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1981). Gray contends, nonetheless, that the search for drug-related evidence was a sham; he says the true purpose of the search was to look for evidence related to the McClelland murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The Attorney General acknowledges that the police knew that Gray was a potential suspect in the McClelland murder when they secured the search warrant and suspected that evidence pertaining to the murder might be discovered during the course of the drug search. The Attorney General contends, however, that seizure of such evidence was proper. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The validity of the warrant authorizing the search and seizure of drug-related evidence is not an issue in this appeal. Drug-related evidence was found and seized, and Gray was arrested for possessing marijuana. The search was not a sham merely because Gray was a possible suspect in the murder case and the police anticipated that during the drug search they might find evidence relating to the murder. <em>See Horne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 512, 517, 339 S.E.2d 186, 190 (1986). The police had a right to be in Gray\u2019s residence to conduct a search for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>drugs, and in the course of the search, they were entitled to seize evidence of other crimes that was in plain view. <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 483, 490, 303 S.E.2d 881, 885-86 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">After searching the residence and arresting Gray on the marijuana charge, the police asked Gray for permission to search his automobile. Gray consented to the search, and the police seized a gasoline can, a siphon hose, and three pairs of gloves from the trunk of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Gray does not deny that he gave his consent for the search, but he claims the consent was not voluntary. He asserts that in view of all the circumstances, particularly his arrest and being in handcuffs, his consent was the product of police coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The burden is on the Commonwealth to prove that a consent is voluntary. <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 670, 678, 239 S.E.2d 112, 117 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 930 (1978); <em>Hairston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 387, 388, 219 S.E.2d 668, 669 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 937 (1976). Whether a consent to a search was voluntary \u201cis a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 227. The mere fact that a defendant is in custody is not enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced consent to search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424 (1976); <em>Lowe, </em>218 Va. at 678, 239 S.E.2d at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The trial court concluded that the consent was voluntary. Nothing in the record suggests that Gray was threatened or intimidated. When asked if they could search his car, Gray said, \u201cGo ahead and search it.\u201d The police told Gray he could withdraw his consent at any time, and he never retracted it. Moreover, after he was arrested and taken to the Suffolk police station, he executed a form authorizing the search of his car. From a totality of all the circumstances, we conclude that Gray\u2019s consent to search his automobile was given freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\n<em>Identity of Informant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">In a pretrial hearing, Gray sought, <em>inter alia, </em>to discover the identity of the informant relied upon by the police for the issuance of the search warrant. The trial court, after hearing Gray\u2019s testimony and the evidence of the police officer who executed the affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>davit for the warrant, denied the request. The court specifically found that \u201ccredible evidence [shows] that there was an informant [and] that the search warrant was . . . valid,\u201d and concluded that the informant\u2019s identity was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On appeal, Gray argues that \u201c[t]he failure of the Court to allow [him] to examine the alleged informant, or even to confirm his existence, denied [him] the basic rights of the 5th Amendment\u2019s Due Process and the 6th Amendment\u2019s right to confront his accusers.\u201d The Supreme Court rejected these identical constitutional arguments in <em>McCray </em>v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Generally, the identity of a person furnishing the prosecution with information concerning criminal activities is privileged. <em>See Webb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>137 Va. 833, 836, 120 S.E. 155, 156 (1923); Annot. 76 A.L.R.2d 262 (1961 &amp; Supp. 1986). The purpose of the privilege is to further and protect the public\u2019s interest in effective law enforcement. <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 59 (1957). Revealing an informant\u2019s identity would discourage private citizens from furnishing the police valuable information; thus, informants demand anonymity to protect themselves and their families. The police often depend upon professional informants for information about crimes. If the public becomes aware of the dual role played by an informant, the informant becomes useless to the police, and persons who might otherwise provide information are discouraged from rendering assistance. <em>See McCray, </em>386 U.S. at 308-09; <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 59; <em>Webb, </em>137 Va. at 836, 120 S.E.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Although he concedes the existence of the privilege rule, Gray contends, nevertheless, that the circumstances of the present case warrant an exception. He looks to <em>Roviaro </em>as support for his contention. <em>Roviaro, </em>however, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In <em>Roviaro, </em>the informant had been an active participant in the crime. The Court stated that he \u201chad taken a material part in bringing about the possession of certain drugs by the accused, had been present with the accused at the occurrence of the alleged crime, and might be a material witness as to whether the accused knowingly transported the drugs as charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55. After reviewing the particular circumstances of Roviaro\u2019s trial, the Court noted that the informant was the only participant in the crime other than the accused and therefore his possible testimony was \u201chighly relevant,\u201d that he might have \u201cdisclosed an entrapment [,] thrown doubt upon [Roviaro\u2019s] identity or on the identity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>package [, or] . . . testified to [Roviaro\u2019s] possible lack of knowledge of the contents of the package . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64. The Court concluded that \u201cunder these circumstances, the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting the Government to withhold the identity of its undercover employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The circumstances of Gray\u2019s case are altogether different. Nothing in the record suggests that the informant participated in or knew anything about the crimes for which Gray stands convicted. Unlike <em>Roviaro, </em>the informant in the present case could not have been helpful in Gray\u2019s defense of his capital murder charge. Indeed, the affidavit for the search warrant shows that the information furnished was limited to Gray\u2019s drug activities and the informant was a person who had furnished the police with reliable information of narcotic activities in the past. We conclude, therefore, that under the circumstances of the present case the privilege rule applies and the trial court did not err in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Psychiatric Examinations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In response to Gray\u2019s motion, the trial court appointed a private psychiatrist to evaluate Gray and assist in his defense. Gray contends, nonetheless, that the court erred in refusing to provide him with funds so he could choose his own psychiatrist. The contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Before an indigent defendant is entitled to a court-appointed independent psychiatrist to assist the defense in a capital case, there must be a threshold showing that his sanity is likely to be a significant factor in his defense. <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 83 (1985); <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 99, 104, 334 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S__, 106 S. Ct. 3309 (1986). Additionally, when the Commonwealth in a capital sentencing proceeding presents psychiatric evidence of an indigent defendant\u2019s future dangerousness, the Commonwealth must provide the defendant the assistance of a psychiatrist on the issue. <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 86-87; <em>Tuggle, </em>230 Va. at 107-08, 334 S.E.2d at 843-44. It is clear, however, that an indigent accused does not have \u201ca constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own.\u201d <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 83; <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 276, 351 S.E.2d 1, 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(1986); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 232 </em>Va. 521, 528, 352 S.E.2d 342, 346 (1987); <em>Tuggle, </em>230 Va. at 107, 334 S.E.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In the present case, Gray made no threshold showing that his sanity would likely be a significant factor in his defense, and the Commonwealth did not present psychiatric evidence that he would be a danger to society in the future. Nevertheless, the trial court appointed a private psychiatrist to assist the defense. Thus, Gray received more than is constitutionally mandated, and clearly the trial court did not err in refusing to allow Gray to choose his own psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">After furnishing Gray with the private psychiatrist, the trial court, on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, and over Gray\u2019s objection, ordered that Gray be sent to Central State Hospital for a psychiatric examination to determine his mental condition at the time of the offense and whether he might be dangerous in the future. Although Gray complains about the entry of the order, the record shows that he refused to answer all questions posed by the hospital staff. Moreover, no psychiatric evidence was produced at either the guilt phase or the penalty phase of the trial. We conclude, therefore, that Gray\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in ordering the examination is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\n<em>Refusal of Funds for an Investigator and Statistical Reports.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Gray contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for a publicly paid investigator. The contention is without merit. <em>See Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 478, 331 S.E.2d at 430; <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 140-41, 314 S.E.2d at 382; <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 135, 295 S.E.2d 643, 646 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 445-46, 271 S.E.2d 123, 129-30 (1980). A publicly paid investigator for an indigent defendant is \u201can act of judicial grace not constitutionally required.\u201d <em>Quintana, </em>224 Va. at 135, 295 S.E.2d at 646. For the same reasons, we reject Gray\u2019s contention that he is entitled to public funds to secure statistical reports regarding the imposition of the death penalty upon blacks accused of murdering whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>H</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\n<em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Election to Prosecute Gray Rather Than Melvin Tucker.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Both Gray and Melvin Tucker were indicted for capital murder. Afterwards, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney elected to try only Gray on the charge of capital murder and entered into a plea bargain agreement with Tucker whereby he would be tried on a charge of first-degree murder. Gray contends that to vest a prosecutor with such unbridled discretion renders the imposition of the death sentence upon Gray \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Ample evidence of motive and means supports the Commonwealth\u2019s decision to try only Gray on the capital murder charge. Less than two months prior to the murder, McClelland, manager of a Murphy\u2019s Mart store, had fired Gray\u2019s wife, Melinda, from her job at the store. The day after McClelland terminated Melinda, Gray visited McClelland at the Murphy\u2019s Mart store and discussed her termination with him for about 15 minutes. Eleven days after McClelland discharged Melinda, Gray stole a .32-cali-ber pistol from a friend\u2019s home. The same gun was used to murder McClelland. Gray told one witness several times that he was \u201cgoing to get\u201d McClelland for firing his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In addition to Tucker\u2019s testimony that Gray was the actual perpetrator (the \u201ctrigger man\u201d) of the capital murder, two witnesses testified that Gray had told them he killed McClelland, and another witness testified that he had overheard Gray admit to someone else that he was the killer. Gray told Melvin Tucker and two of the witnesses that he had to kill McClelland because McClelland knew him and could identify him. On the other hand, Melvin Tucker did not have any personal acquaintance with McClelland prior to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The institution of criminal charges is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984). Nothing in the record suggests that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney acted arbitrarily or abused his prosecutorial discretion. We reject the contention that in exercising his discretion he violated the constitutional proscription against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\n<em>Place of Incarceration.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Gray was tried in the City of Suffolk. Immediately after his arrest for capital murder, Gray was moved from the Suffolk City jail to the Newport News City jail. Several weeks before the trial, Gray was transferred to the Hampton City jail. Both the Newport News and Hampton jails are located within 45 miles of Suffolk. The record shows that security problems, including Gray\u2019s own safety, dictated that he not remain in the Suffolk City jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Although Gray concedes that his counsel \u201cconferred in person with [him] on a frequent basis,\u201d he contends, nonetheless, that placing him in other locations when the Suffolk jail was available denied him effective assistance of counsel and due process in violation of the Federal Constitution. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">While Gray\u2019s incarceration in other jails was an inconvenience to his counsel, he was not denied access to counsel. Moreover, the court permitted Gray to remain at the Suffolk City jail for several hours on the evenings of the trial so his attorneys could consult with him. Nothing in the record supports his contention that his counsel was ineffective as a result of his incarceration outside of Suffolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">J</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\n<em>Discovery of Witnesses\u2019 Statements.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">In a discovery motion, Gray sought, <em>inter alia, </em>the opportunity. to inspect and copy statements that Melvin Tucker and the three other witnesses had given to the Commonwealth prior to trial. The trial court ordered that these statements be furnished to Gray \u201cif and when said witnesses testify in this matter and before said testimony is given.\u201d Because Gray believed he should be furnished this information a reasonable time prior to trial, he assigns error to the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">On appeal, Gray argues that \u201cany inconsistencies between the statements these four individuals gave to the Commonwealth and their subsequent testimony at trial would be of tremendous importance to [his] defense and more importantly, possibly exculpatory.\u201d However, Gray has not told us, and the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>disclose, how he has been prejudiced by not receiving these statements earlier. He alleges no inconsistencies between the statements and the witnesses\u2019 testimony; nor does he explain how the statements were exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Gray was furnished these statements before the witnesses testified, and his counsel vigorously cross-examined the witnesses. Because Gray has suffered no harm or prejudice as a result of the court\u2019s ruling, we reject his contention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">JURY MATTERS A</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>Change of Venue or Venire.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Gray claims the trial court erred in refusing to grant a change of venue or, alternatively, a change of venire. He bases his claim on alleged widespread publicity of the crime in the community, but makes no allegation that the publicity was inaccurate or intemperate. Gray presented no affidavits suggesting widespread community bias and submitted only three newspaper articles. The information in the newspaper articles was factually accurate, nonprejudical, and noninflammatory. In response to extensive questioning by the court and counsel during <em>voir dire, </em>each venireman who qualified indicated that his decision would not be affected by anything he had heard or read about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The decision whether to change venue or venire is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its ruling will be reversed only upon an affirmative showing on the record that the discretion was abused. <em>Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 481-82, 331 S.E.2d at 432; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 535, 544, 323 S.E.2d 577, 584 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1111 (1985); <em>LeVasseur, </em>225 Va. at 577-78, 304 S.E.2d at 651; <em>Newcomer </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 64, 67, 255 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1979); <em>Poindexter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 314, 319, 237 S.E.2d 139, 142 (1977). Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a change of venue or venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Composition of the Jury.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Forty-three veniremen, of whom 33 were white and 10 were black, were summoned to appear for Gray\u2019s trial. The record establishes that the venire panel was properly selected at random. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-260, 8.01-343 to -363. Of the 43 veniremen, only 36 prospective jurors underwent a complete, individualized <em>voir dire. </em>Of these 36 veniremen, eight were black. Six of the black veniremen were struck for cause by the trial court because each voiced unequivocal objections to the imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>393 U.S. 898 (1968); <em>LeVasseur, </em>225 Va. at 576, 304 S.E.2d at 650; <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 250, 257 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). On Gray\u2019s motion, the court struck for cause venireman Holt, the seventh black, because Holt\u2019s father had been the victim of a recent robbery-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">After the court had ruled on all challenges for cause and the required number of veniremen had been qualified, only one black, Alknah Thomas, remained. The Commonwealth used its third peremptory strike to remove Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">While recognizing that it is constitutionally permissible for a court to exclude a venireman who voices an absolute objection to the imposition of the death penalty, <em>see Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162 (1986); <em>Witherspoon, </em>391 U.S. at 518, Gray contends that the exclusion of such veniremen in the present case \u201cis a violation of the rights provided to [him] under the 6th [and 14th Amendments] of the U. S. Constitution for an impartial jury\u201d and precluded him from being tried \u201cby a group of his peers.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>contends that because of the views blacks purportedly hold respecting imposition of the death penalty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> their exclusion pursuant to <em>Lockhart </em>and <em>Witherspoon </em>constitutes the use of a \u201cdiscriminatory criterion.\u201d <em>See Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79,_, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 1717 (1986) (reaffirming the general rule that jury members must be selected in accordance with a non-discriminatory criterion).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"ACT\">At the outset, we note that a black defendant is not constitutionally entitled to be tried by members of his own race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at _, 106 S. Ct. at 1716-17; <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 303, 305 (1880); <em>Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 491-92, 331 S.E.2d at 438. A defendant does have a constitutional right, however, to be tried by jury members selected pursuant to neutral and non-discriminatory guidelines. <em>See Martin </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>200 U.S. 316, 321 (1906); <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 339 (1880). As Gray concedes, the Supreme Court recently held in <em>Lockhart </em>that a death-qualified jury does not violate the right of a defendant in a capital case to be tried by an impartial jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community. 476 U.S. at_, 106 S.Ct. at 1764. <em>See also Pruett, </em>232 Va. at 277, 351 S.E.2d at 8; <em>Waye, 219 </em>Va. at 690-91, 251 S.E.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">The <em>Lockhart </em>Court stated that \u201cthe Constitution presupposes that a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community is impartial, regardless of the mix of individual viewpoints actually represented on the jury, so long as the jurors can conscientiously and properly carry out their sworn duty to apply the law to the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Lockhart, </em>476 U.S. at_, 106 S.Ct. at 1770. In Gray\u2019s case, each of the prospective jurors removed for cause stated unequivocally that he or she could not impose the death penalty in any case and, therefore, could not apply the laws of the Commonwealth. The trial court had a duty to remove those veniremen. We conclude, therefore, that the Commonwealth\u2019s removal for cause of the six veniremen who voiced absolute objections to imposing the death penalty was accomplished pursuant to a non-discriminatory criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Gray further contends that he was denied \u201cthe opportunity to be tried by a group of his peers\u201d because the Commonwealth used one of its peremptory strikes to remove venireman Thomas. In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a black defendant.\u201d 476 U.S. at_, 106 S. Ct. at 1719. The Court then concluded that \u201ca defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at_, 106 S. Ct. at 1722-23. To establish such a prima facie case the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">[Fjirst must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group . . . and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits \u201cthose to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u201d . . . Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\"><em>Id. </em>at_, 106 S. Ct. at 1723 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">In the present case, Gray made no timely objection at trial regarding the peremptory striking of Thomas by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney was not afforded an opportunity to explain his reason for the strike, and the trial court had no opportunity to decide whether the reason was constitutionally acceptable. Nevertheless, nothing in the record raises an inference that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney used his peremptory strike to exclude Thomas from the jury on account of his race. Indeed, it seems apparent from a reading of the following excerpt of Thomas\u2019 <em>voir dire </em>that it was highly unlikely he would vote for the death penalty under any circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">THE COURT: Could you in a proper case impose the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>JUROR THOMAS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">THE COURT: You could not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">JUROR THOMAS: (Nods head negatively.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">THE COURT: You could not in any way impose the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">JUROR THOMAS: Yea, I will if I have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s what I said. Could you in a proper case impose the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">JUROR THOMAS: Yes, yes, yes. If I have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">THE COURT: Now, we\u2019re still talking about a capital murder case. Could you also in a proper case impose the lesser penalty of life imprisonment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">JUROR THOMAS: Yea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Your Honor, I would like to just ask a couple of questions to clarify a couple of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">Mr. Thomas, you indicated that in a proper case you said that\u2014 Could you personally vote to impose the death penalty on somebody that\u2019s been convicted of capital murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">JUROR THOMAS: Can I do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Could you vote to give somebody the death penalty in a proper case that\u2019s been convicted of capital murder? You, yourself? Could you vote to give a man the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">JUROR THOMAS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-17\">[COMMONWEALTH]: You could not do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-18\">JUROR THOMAS: If I have to do it I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-19\">[COMMONWEALTH]: I don\u2019t mean if you have to do it. If you had your choice. There are two sentences in this case. He can either be sentenced if convicted of capital murder to life in the penitentiary or to the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-20\">JUROR THOMAS: I vote for the life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-21\">[COMMONWEALTH]: You would vote for life. Would you vote automatically for a life sentence no matter what the facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-22\">JUROR THOMAS: No, it\u2019s got to be what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-23\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-24\">JUROR THOMAS: Depends on what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-25\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Depends on what he did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-26\">JUROR THOMAS: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>[COMMONWEALTH]: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get straight. You said immediately you would vote for the life imprisonment. If you heard the evidence and determined guilt first and you found the person guilty of capital murder and you then had to decide between voting for the death penalty or voting for life imprisonment could you vote, if the facts justified it, to sentence a man to death or vote for the death penalty? Could you personally vote to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">JUROR THOMAS: Yea, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">[COMMONWEALTH]: You could? Okay. I have no further questions, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Clearly, Thomas gave an internally contradictory statement concerning his ability to vote for the death penalty. His equivocation was a reasonable, nonracial basis for the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s strike. Significantly, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney also peremptorily struck two white jurors who, during <em>voir dire, </em>expressed similar uncertainty about imposing the death penalty. We will not infer purposeful discrimination by the peremptory strike of one black, when, as previously noted, the record indicates that there existed a neutral and non-discriminatory basis for the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\n<em>Venireman Duplissey.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Gray assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude venireman William Duplissey for cause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Duplissey is a former police officer, having served for 15 years in the County of Nansemond and the City of Suffolk. He later served as a security guard at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. His occupation at the time of trial did not involve police or security duties. He last testified in court in 1974. On <em>voir dire, </em>he stated that he could render a fair and impartial verdict based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">A person is not automatically excluded from a jury because of an association with law enforcement personnel, provided he demonstrates that he can be impartial. <em>Clozza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 129, 321 S.E.2d 273, 276 (1984), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>nied, </em>469 U.S. 1230 (1985). Whether a venireman should be excluded from a jury is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. Because the trial court observes the venireman, its finding is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless manifest error exists. <em>Watkins, 229 </em>Va. at 480, 331 S.E.2d at 431-32; <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 258-59, 307 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Duplissey\u2019s answers on <em>voir dire </em>support the trial court\u2019s finding that, notwithstanding his previous employment in police work, he would be fair and impartial. Thus, we cannot say the court abused its discretion in refusing to strike Duplissey for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>Alternate Juror Murphy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court asked a group of veniremen that included George Murphy this question: \u201cAre you or any members of your immediate family employed by any law enforcement agency?\u201d Murphy made no response to the question. Subsequently, Murphy became one of the two alternate jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Prior to the second day of trial, Gray\u2019s counsel learned that Murphy\u2019s son was currently a member of the Virginia State Police. Gray moved to declare a mistrial, and the trial court denied the motion. Gray assigns error to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">We reject this contention. Murphy was released from the panel before the case was submitted to the jury. Murphy was merely an alternate and, therefore, did not participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations or decision. Because it is clear that Gray has suffered no harm, this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">\n<em>Refusing to Sequester the Jury.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">At the beginning of the trial, Gray moved for the sequestration of the jury, based on the anticipated length of the trial and the publicity it was receiving. The trial court denied the motion. After the jury returned its verdict finding Gray guilty of capital murder, Gray again moved for sequestration of the jury until the penalty phase of the trial commenced the following day. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>denied this motion. Although Gray makes no specific allegation that failure to sequester the jury adversely affected the trial, he argues that \u201cas.a matter of policy, sequestration of a jury in a capital murder case, especially after a guilty verdict has been returned, should be the norm rather than the exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">A trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to sequester a jury. Its discretion extends to capital murder cases. <em>Boggs, </em>229 Va. at 513-14, 331 S.E.2d at 417; <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 138, 314 S.E.2d at 380; <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 677, 283 S.E.2d 905, 910-11 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 983 (1982); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 513, 524-25, 273 S.E.2d 36, 43 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1011 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In the present case, the trial court admonished the jury twice each day during the five-day trial not to discuss the case with others and to refrain from having any contact with any news media accounts of the trial. Nothing in the record suggests that the jury disregarded the trial court\u2019s admonitions. From the record before us, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to sequester the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">THE GUILT TRIAL A</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">According to established principles of appellate review, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial. As previously indicated, Richard McClelland was the manager of Murphy\u2019s Mart store in the City of Portsmouth. He and the store\u2019s security guard worked late the evening of May 2, 1985, both having arrived at the store between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">On the same evening, approximately 9:30 p.m., Gray and Melvin Tucker, both \u201chigh\u201d from \u201cfree basing\u201d cocaine, entered the parking lot of Murphy\u2019s Mart in Gray\u2019s automobile to observe the store. They saw McClelland and the guard inside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Shortly before midnight, McClelland and the security guard left the store in separate automobiles. Gray and Tucker followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>them in Gray\u2019s automobile, which Gray was driving. McClelland and the guard went to a fast-food restaurant. McClelland went inside the restaurant, and the security guard went through the \u201cdrive-thru\u201d and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">When McClelland left the restaurant, he drove toward Smith-field. Gray and Tucker continued to follow him. At a stop sign at the intersection of Nansemond Parkway and Bennett\u2019s Pasture Road, Gray pulled his automobile in front of McClelland\u2019s car and blocked McClelland\u2019s way. Gray, armed with a .32-caliber revolver, directed McClelland to get out of his automobile and into Gray\u2019s. Gray struck McClelland, and the two men took Mc-Clelland\u2019s wallet and threatened to harm his family if he did not cooperate. Gray then drove Tucker and McClelland back to the Murphy\u2019s Mart store.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">When they arrived at Murphy\u2019s Mart, Gray forced McClelland at gunpoint into the store while Tucker waited outside in Gray\u2019s automobile. Approximately one-half hour later, Gray and McClelland emerged from the store with a shopping cart containing three gym bags filled with money. Gray, Tucker, and McClelland put the gym bags in the back seat of Gray\u2019s automobile and McClelland was told to get back into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Gray then drove to a service station to obtain gasoline. He put some gas in the tank of the car and filled a gas can that was in the car\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">After paying for the gas purchase, Gray drove McClelland and Tucker to the Frederick campus of Tidewater Community College. After passing the college, Gray backed the car down a small side road and ordered McClelland out of the car. Gray then took McClelland to a place approximately 15 to 20 feet behind the automobile and ordered him to lie down on the ground. McClelland obeyed Gray\u2019s command.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">McClelland begged Gray not to hurt or shoot him, and Gray assured him that he would not be harmed. As McClelland lay face down on the ground, Gray fired six pistol shots in rapid succession into McClelland\u2019s head from a distance of 3 to 18 inches. Gray told Tucker as they drove away that he had had to kill Mc-Clelland because McClelland knew him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Gray and Tucker then drove to the intersection where they had left McClelland\u2019s car. Gray told Tucker that he was going to burn McClelland\u2019s car to destroy evidence. Gray took the can of gasoline from the trunk of his car and doused the interior of McClel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>land\u2019s automobile with gasoline. He lit a match, threw it into Mc-Clelland\u2019s car, and closed the door. Gray and Tucker subsequently returned to Gray\u2019s apartment to count the stolen money, which amounted to between $12,000 and $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Some days later, Tucker and Gray went to the Nansemond Treatment Plant where Tucker was employed, and Gray threw the revolver into a contact tank. The police later recovered the revolver after Gray showed them its location.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The police discovered McClelland\u2019s body at the scene of the crime on the morning of May 3 just a few hours after he had been shot. An autopsy performed later that day established that Mc-Clelland had received six close-range .32-caliber gunshot wounds to the head, any one of which could have caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\n<em>Photographs Depicting Victim\u2019s Body and Wounds.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The trial court, over Gray\u2019s objections, admitted into evidence six color photographs of the victim\u2019s body, including five of his bloody head. Three photographs depicted the victim\u2019s body as found at the scene of the crime; the remaining three photographs were taken at the autopsy. Gray contends the court erred in admitting these photographs because they \u201cserved no purpose other than to inflame the jury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The admission of photographs is a matter resting within the sound discretion of a trial court. <em>Wise </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 322, 330, 337 S.E.2d 715, 720 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1112 (1986); <em>Watkins, </em>229 Va. at 482, 331 S.E.2d at 433; <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 417, 329 S.E.2d 815, 827, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 888, 474 U.S. 865 (1985); <em>Washington, </em>228 Va. at 551, 323 S.E.2d at 588; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 450, 323 S.E.2d 554, 566-67 (1984); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 226 </em>Va. 31, 48, 307 S.E.2d 864, 873 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1109 (1984); <em>Bunch, </em>225 Va. at 436-37, 304 S.E.2d at 278; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 294, 302 S.E.2d 520, 524, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983); <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 41, 51, 286 S.E.2d 172, 177 (1982); <em>Martin, </em>221 Va. at 447, 271 S.E.2d at 130; <em>Stamper, </em>220 Va. at 270, 257 S.E.2d at 816. Photographs of a victim are relevant if they tend to show motive, intent, method, premeditation, malice, or the degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of atrociousness of the crime. <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 144, 314 S.E.2d at 384; <em>Waye, </em>219 Va. at 692, 251 S.E.2d at 208; <em>Smith, </em>219 Va. at 467, 248 S.E.2d at 143. Photographs that accurately portray a scene created by an accused in the commission of an offense are not rendered inadmissible because they are gruesome or shocking. <em>Washington, </em>228 Va. at 551-52, 323 S.E.2d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In the present case, the photographs of the victim, though gruesome, accurately portrayed what the defendant had created and were relevant to establish intent, malice, premeditation, and atrociousness of the crime. We note, moreover, that the trial court rejected two photographs offered by the Commonwealth because they were duplicative of other photographs that were admitted. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the six photographs into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>Admissibility of the Autopsy Report.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Gray contends that because the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the victim testified at trial, the admission of the autopsy report constituted error. He argues that the report has \u201cno probative value and only tends to inflame the jury.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We have previously rejected this identical contention. <em>See Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 630, 292 S.E.2d 798, 806-07 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983). Moreover, Code \u00a7 19.2-188 authorizes the admission of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">\n<em>Requirement that Gray be in Leg Irons.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Gray contends that the trial court erred in requiring him to remain in leg irons during his trial. The court concluded that the restraints should be imposed because of the serious nature of the charges against him and to maintain security. The court, however, took pains to ensure that the jury remained unaware that Gray was shackled. Moreover, when Gray took the witness stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to testify during the sentencing phase, the leg irons had been removed outside the jury\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The conduct of a trial is left to the sound discretion of a trial court. <em>Watkins, 229 </em>Va. at 484, 331 S.E.2d at 433; <em>Justus, 222 </em>Va. at 676, 283 S.E.2d at 910. Requiring leg irons is a proper exercise of a court\u2019s discretion, and the court\u2019s decision need not be made upon a formal evidentiary hearing. <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 381-82, 345 S.E.2d 267, 276 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s ruling was reinforced by Gray\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history and the gravity of the offense for which he was being tried. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring that Gray remain in leg irons during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence of Capital Murder.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Gray claims the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction of capital murder because the testimony of Melvin Tucker, the co-defendant, and the three other prison inmates who testified that Gray admitted killing McClelland is incredible. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">It is a jury\u2019s function to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of their evidence. The jury has the opportunity to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor while testifying, to consider their interest in the outcome of the case, and to determine from all the circumstances of the case which witnesses are more believable. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 525, 528, 298 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1982); <em>Coppola, 220 </em>Va. at 252, 257 S.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The trial judge, who also observed the witnesses and considered the evidence, has approved the jury\u2019s verdict. A trial court\u2019s judgment approving a jury\u2019s verdict is entitled to great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it is contrary to law or plainly wrong. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 145-46, 314 S.E.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">The Commonwealth relied in large measure upon the testimony of Tucker and the other three prison inmates to establish that Gray actually perpetrated McClelland\u2019s murder. Although Gray has attacked their veracity, the jury was in the best position to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>assess their credibility. Moreover, from other circumstances proved, the jury reasonably could infer that Gray was the \u201ctrigger man.\u201d The murder weapon had been stolen by Gray. Gray, not Tucker, was acquainted with McClelland. Because McClelland had fired Gray\u2019s wife from her job at Murphy\u2019s Mart, Gray had a motive to kill McClelland. Indeed, he told a friend that he was \u201cgoing to get\u201d McClelland. The jury and the trial court were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Gray was the perpetrator of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">We cannot say that the judgment is plainly wrong or that the evidence that Gray was the \u201ctrigger man\u201d is incredible as a matter of law. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth successfully proved \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that motive, time, place, means and conduct concur in pointing out the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.\u201d <em>Quintana, </em>224 Va. at 143, 295 S.E.2d at 651 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">THE PENALTY TRIAL A</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>The Sorrell Murders.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">During the penalty phase of the trial, Melvin Tucker testified that Gray told him he had \u201cknocked off\u2019 Lisa Sorrell. According to Tucker, Gray made the statement as he pointed to a picture of Lisa Sorrell in a newspaper while searching for news articles concerning McClelland\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Over Gray\u2019s objection, the court permitted the Commonwealth to present additional evidence showing that two Sorrell murders actually had occurred. The police officer who had investigated the murders testified that he found the body of Lisa Sorrell slumped in the front passenger seat of a partially burned automobile in Chesapeake, a city that shares borders with Suffolk. In the trunk of the automobile was the body of Lisa\u2019s three-year-old child, Shanta Sorrell. The officer identified various photographs of the automobile and the victims. The photographs were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>A State medical examiner who had performed autopsies on the bodies of Lisa and Shanta Sorrell testified about the causes of their deaths. He opined that Lisa was killed by six gunshot wounds to the head, apparently inflicted by a .32-caliber firearm, and that Shanta died of carbon monoxide inhalation. Gray, testifying in the penalty phase, denied any involvement in the Sorrell murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Gray contends on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the Sorrell murders. He argues that the evidence was \u201chighly inflammatory and inherently prejudicial.\u201d Gray points out that at the time of the trial he had not even been charged with the commission of these crimes. Gray says the only evidence linking him to these murders was the testimony of Melvin Tucker, the co-defendant with whom the Commonwealth had reached a plea bargain agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In the penalty phase of a bifurcated capital murder trial, \u201cit [is] desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 204 (1976). Consistent with <em>Gregg, </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) provides that the jury may consider evidence that includes \u201cthe history and background of the. defendant.\u201d Indeed, \u201c[t]he jury has the duty to consider all the evidence relevant to sentencing, both favorable and unfavorable\u201d before determining whether it is probable that the defendant would commit future acts of violence that would constitute a continuing, serious threat to society. <em>Stamper, 220 </em>Va. at 275-76, 257 S.E.2d at 819. \u201c[E]vidence of prior unadjudicated criminal conduct . . . may be used in the penalty phase to prove the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit criminal acts of violence in the future.\u201d <em>Watkins, 229 </em>Va. at 488, 331 S.E.2d at 436. <em>See Quintana, </em>224 Va. at 147-48, 295 S.E.2d at 654. Determining the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly within the province of the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>224 Va. at 528, 298 S.E.2d at 101; <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 252, 257 S.E.2d at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Gray was connected to the Sorrell murders by the testimony of Melvin Tucker. The jury heard and observed both Tucker and Gray and apparently chose to believe Tucker. We cannot say Tucker\u2019s testimony was incredible as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Moreover, the evidence of the police officer and the medical examiner indicated that the Sorrell murders were accomplished in a manner strikingly similar to the execution style of the McClelland murder. Lisa Sorrell also was shot six times in the head, and her automobile, like McClelland\u2019s, was burned after the murder. Thus, the officer\u2019s and doctor\u2019s evidence tended to corroborate Tucker\u2019s testimony of Gray\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Gray\u2019s admission and the information about the particulars of the Sorrell murders were relevant evidence of Gray\u2019s propensity to commit violent acts in the future. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>Criminal Record, History, and Background.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Gray, 28 years old at the time of his trial, has a criminal record dating to 1973. In August 1973, while a juvenile, he was found not innocent of petit larceny and ordered to complete one year of supervised probation. In January 1976, as an adult, Gray was convicted of burglary in Los Angeles, California. For this conviction, he served four days in jail and was placed on probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">In March 1977, Gray was convicted of disturbing the peace and resisting arrest in the City of Portsmouth, for which he was fined $10.00 and sentenced to five days in jail. The jail sentence was suspended on the condition that he be of good behavior for 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In May 1978, also in the City of Portsmouth, Gray was found guilty of malicious wounding, attempted robbery, and use of a firearm. He was sentenced to a total of 21 years in prison. In August 1983, he was released on parole. Gray was on parole at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>time he committed the offenses involved in these appeals. He also has been convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">From November 1983 to May 1984, while on parole, Gray worked at Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria. William Palmer, general manager of the cafeteria, testified that Gray\u2019s employment was terminated because of his use of profanity. Palmer stated that Gray had a \u201cbad attitude.\u201d Thaddeus Eley, a chef at the cafeteria, testified that Gray had told him that he \u201ccould kill\u201d Palmer for firing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Ronald Whitte testified that in July 1977, while he, his wife, and two small children were bicycling, Gray and another man accosted them. Gray displayed a pistol, ordered Whitte to halt, threatened to kill Whitte, and demanded money from him. When Whitte refused to comply, Gray fired several shots from the pistol, wounding Whitte in the arm and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Lawrence Tucker, who is Melvin Tucker\u2019s brother and a convicted felon, testified, that, in May 1985, he had overheard Gray recount to Melvin the details of Gray\u2019s robbery of the Circle Seafood Restaurant. Gray related the incident to relieve Melvin Tucker\u2019s concerns about the Murphy\u2019s Mart robbery. Lawrence Tucker stated, \u201c[H]e told Melvin don\u2019t worry about it, because he got away with something like that and he can get away with this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Melvin Tucker testified that Gray told him \u201che had took the Circle Restaurant off\u2019 and showed Tucker the money taken in the robbery. Melvin Tucker also testified that, within a week after the Murphy\u2019s Mart robbery, he and Gray heard a rumor that a young woman had been talking about the incident. When they saw the woman on the street, Gray told Tucker that if \u201cshe keep on running her mouth [Fm] going to fuck her up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Sylvester Joyner and Gray were both incarcerated in the same cell block in the Suffolk City jail. Joyner testified that Gray told him that he had to leave California because \u201che had killed a guy out there.\u201d The jury also heard evidence pertaining to the Sorrell murders, which has been discussed in the preceding section.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Gray called seven witnesses who gave mitigating testimony. Gray, himself, also testified in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Catrina Hargrove had been a neighbor of Gray for several months preceding his arrest. She had frequent contact with Gray and his wife. She described Gray as a \u201cvery nice person\u201d and stated that she had never seen Gray exhibit any anger or hostility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>toward her or anybody. Hargrove had observed Gray playing with her four-year-old daughter. Hargrove said she was shocked and surprised to learn of Gray\u2019s involvement in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Keith Silver also was a friend and former neighbor of Gray. He had known Gray for approximately four years and for about one year they lived across the hall from each other. He testified that Gray treated Silver\u2019s wife and daughter as if they were \u201cfamily.\u201d Silver said he did not believe that Gray was capable of murdering McClelland because such conduct was totally out of character for Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Kelvin Penny, a friend and former co-worker with Gray at Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, testified that Gray was \u201cgreat,\u201d a \u201cgood guy.\u201d He also believed that the murder was out of character with his friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">David Wilson, a contractor for brick work and former employer of Gray, described Gray as a \u201c[v]ery good worker.\u201d He stated that Gray got along well with everyone, never threatened anyone, and never got into fights. He also said that the murder was out of character with Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Terry Carter, a probation and parole officer in the City of Portsmouth, testified that Gray had been under his supervision from August 1983 to January 1985. He stated that Gray was punctual in keeping appointments and respectful to him. He never observed any hostility in Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Mavis Spitzer, who had been Gray\u2019s probation officer since January 1985, testified that Gray was \u201calways very polite, very well-mannered, very cooperative.\u201d She also stated that on her unannounced visits she found his home \u201calways very neat and clean, very tidy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Rafiq Zaidi, who described himself as a Muslim minister, testified that in January 1985 Gray had been generous in contributing funds to a needy woman and her children. The minister said that the acts involved in the murder were \u201c[tjotally inconsistent\u201d with Gray.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Bishop Maurice Johnson, an elderly retired minister, was well acquainted with Gray. Johnson\u2019s wife is related to Gray, and Johnson performed the marriage ceremony for Gray and his wife. Bishop Johnson described Gray as an outgoing person who never exhibited hostility to him or to anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Gray testified that he was not the \u201ctrigger man.\u201d He denied any involvement in the Sorrell murders and stated that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>acquitted of the murder charge in California. Conceding that the part he played in the McClelland murder was wrong, he reiterated that he did not pull the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>Jury Instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Gray contends that the trial court erred in refusing four jury instructions he proffered at the penalty phase of the trial. They were identified as Instructions 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Instruction 4A would have told the jury that it was not required to impose the death penalty even though it believed beyond a reasonable doubt that one or both of the aggravating factors necessary to support a death penalty had been proved. The court did instruct the jury, however, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">You have convicted the defendant, Coleman Wayne Gray, of capital murder which may be punished by death. You must decide whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the following two alternatives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">(1) That, after consideration of his history and background, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">(2) That his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly \u2022 vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt either of the two alternatives, then you may fix the punishment of the defendant at death <em>or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>If the Commonwealth has failed to prove either alternative beyond a reasonable doubt, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The above-quoted instruction sufficiently and properly states the statutory framework. <em>LeVasseur, 225 </em>Va. at 594-95, 304 S.E.2d at 661. Refused Instruction 4A would have been repetitious of the language that we have emphasized in the granted instruction. \u201cWhen granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u201d <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 145, 314 S.E.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Instruction 4B would have told the jury that life imprisonment must be imposed if the jury had a reasonable doubt as to \u201cany fact or conclusion which is required before the death penalty can be imposed.\u201d This instruction also is repetitious. The last two paragraphs of the granted instruction fully cover the principle of law involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The trial court properly refused Instruction 4C, which listed specific mitigating factors that the jury could consider and would have told the jury that their decision upon the mitigating factors need not be unanimous. Indeed, failure to list mitigating factors inures to the benefit of a defendant. Whereas aggravating factors are limited and must be listed, \u201ca jury is not so limited in considering mitigating factors, but may consider any and all [such] factors.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 212, 257 S.E.2d 784, 791 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980). Moreover, informing the jury that its decision on mitigating factors need not be unanimous could create confusion in the jurors\u2019 minds because they are instructed that unanimity is required to impose the death penalty. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Instruction 4D would have told the jury that it \u201cmust assume that the Defendant will be executed\u201d if it imposed the death penalty. We assume that Gray requested this instruction to evoke the jury\u2019s sympathy. The instruction, a comment upon the obvious, was redundant, and the court properly refused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">SENTENCE REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C) mandates that we review the death sentence. In so doing, we are required to consider and determine whether the death sentence \u201cwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d and whether the sentence \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Contending that the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors, Gray again raises the issue of the court\u2019s failure to immediately exclude alternate juror Murphy who had \u201cclose family ties to . . . law enforcement.\u201d Gray suggests that the trial court \u201cpermitted [Murphy] to communicate his opinion to the other jury members throughout the several days leading up to [Gray\u2019s] conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Elsewhere in this opinion, we have considered and rejected Gray\u2019s contention respecting Murphy. We reiterate, however, that Murphy was merely an <em>alternate </em>juror. He did not participate in the deliberations and decisions of the jury. Moreover, there is absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that Murphy \u201ccommunicate[d] his opinion to the other jury members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Gray again raises the argument that the photographs of the victim were inflammatory, and we will stand on what we have previously said concerning this issue. We also have addressed Gray\u2019s final argument: that the court erred in admitting evidence of the Sorrell murders in the penalty trial. For reasons previously stated, we again reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Gray also argues that in our review of the sentence we \u201cshould consider the cumulative effect of the errors of the trial court.\u201d Because we have found no error in the conduct of either the guilt or penalty trial, we reject Gray\u2019s cumulative-effect argument. <em>See Wise, </em>230 Va. at 335, 337 S.E.2d at 723; <em>Boggs, </em>229 Va. at 522, 331 S.E.2d at 422; <em>Waye, </em>219 Va. at 704, 251 S.E.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">By its verdict, the jury found that both the \u201cdangerousness\u201d and \u201cvileness\u201d predicates had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Gray contends that the evidence does not rise to the level necessary for the imposition of the death sentence based upon either predicate. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Respecting \u201cdangerousness,\u201d we look first to Gray\u2019s lengthy criminal record. It is significant that in July 1977, during the period in which he was under a one-year suspended jail sentence, Gray participated in the crimes against Ronald Whitte that led to his convictions of malicious wounding, attempted robbery, and use of a firearm. More significantly, however, is Gray\u2019s participation in all of the present violent crimes against McClelland while Gray was on parole for the Whitte offenses. His record establishes that from 1976 to 1985 Gray committed 13 felonies, at least nine of which were crimes of violence. This is shocking, especially when we take into account that during this nine-year period Gray was confined in prison for more than five of those years. His record clearly demonstrates a trend towards increasingly violent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">We also look to the testimony relating to Gray\u2019s history and background. From this, we learn that he told others he had committed a robbery at the Circle Seafood Restaurant in May 1985 and had locked the restaurant employees in a food freezer. He told another he murdered the Sorrells in 1984. He has threatened the lives of two persons other than McClelland.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We have considered the circumstances surrounding Mc-Clelland\u2019s murder, especially Gray\u2019s arming himself and engaging in a planned enterprise. Additionally, we have reviewed the evidence presented in mitigation. After considering all aggravating and mitigating factors, we conclude that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Gray posed a continuing, serious threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We turn next to the \u201cvileness\u201d predicate. From the time Mc-Clelland fired Gray\u2019s wife, Gray planned revenge. He stole the gun that he later used in McClelland\u2019s murder. He had his wife sketch the layout of Murphy\u2019s Mart. He solicited Melvin Tucker to assist him with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On the night of the murder, Gray and Tucker waited about three hours for McClelland to come out of the store and followed him until he reached a deserted intersection. Gray ordered Mc-Clelland out of the car at gunpoint, striking him in the face with his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Throughout the ordeal, Gray threatened to harm McClelland\u2019s family. Indeed, before entering Murphy\u2019s Mart, Gray told Mc-Clelland that Tucker would stay outside in the car to \u201ctake care\u201d of McClelland\u2019s family if he were uncooperative. McClelland never resisted and was totally cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Gray originally wanted to push McClelland into a contact tank at the treatment plant. However, Tucker would not use his employee status to escort Gray through the plant\u2019s entrance gate. Consequently, Gray took McClelland to a remote area by Tidewater Community College and had him lie face down on the ground. Without any provocation whatsoever, Gray fired six bullets into McClelland\u2019s head. In retelling the story of McClelland\u2019s murder to an inmate, Gray \u201claugh [ed] about the fact that he shot and killed the guy, as if it was nothing to him.\u201d Gray\u2019s laughter and total lack of remorse prompted the inmate to inform the police of Gray\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">From our review, we believe the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of \u201cvileness\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, Gray\u2019s overall conduct in committing McClelland\u2019s murder was outrageously vile and inhuman, in that it involved depravity of mind and aggravated battery to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated and considered the records of all capital murder cases reviewed by this Court to determine whether \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper, </em>220 Va. at 284, 257 S.E.2d at 824. From this review, we conclude that Gray\u2019s sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to sentences generally imposed by other sentencing bodies in Virginia for crimes similar in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We have considered all 41 of Gray\u2019s assignments of error and find no reversible error in any of them. Accordingly, the judgments of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\n<em>Record No. 860373 - Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\n<em>Record No. 860374 - Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">In assessing the penalty of any person convicted of an offense for which the death penalty may be imposed, a sentence of death shall not be imposed unless the court or jury shall (1) after consideration of the past criminal record of convictions of the defendant, find that there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society or that his conduct in committing the offense for which he stands charged was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim; and (2) recommend that the penalty of death be imposed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-13\"> Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(0) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">The penalty of death shall not be imposed unless the Commonwealth shall prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability based upon evidence of the prior history of the defendant or of the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense of which he is accused that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society, or that his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> Similarly, we reject Gray\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in refusing to declare a mistrial because the Commonwealth failed to disclose the name of Carl Bond, who was incarcerated with Gray for a period of time. Bond\u2019s testimony regarding a conversation with Gray about the McClelland murder contradicted the testimony of another inmate. Because Gray himself discovered Bond\u2019s name and whereabouts and called him as a witness at trial, we conclude that Gray suffered no prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> Gray incorrectly states that \u201c8 out of 10 Negroes or 80%\u201d of the veniremen were struck for cause because they objected to the death penalty. The record clearly shows that only six veniremen were disqualified on this ground. It is not clear from the record that the six veniremen were black. However, because the Commonwealth does not challenge Gray\u2019s assertion that the six were black, we assume they were.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-13\"> Gray presented no empirical data supporting his conclusion that blacks as a group oppose the death penalty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-15\"> The ruling in <em>Batson </em>applies retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review and not yet final. <em>Griffith </em>v.

The co-defendant did not testify and, thus, was not subject to cross-examination. The Supreme Court held that the inability to cross-examine the co-defendant violated the accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at_, 106 S.Ct. at 2063.</p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>In the present case, however, Gray had the opportunity to cross-examine Tucker, and the jury had the opportunity to assess Tucker\u2019s credibility and reliability. We conclude, therefore, that <em>Lee </em>has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
