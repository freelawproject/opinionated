A telephone or equivalent two-way communication facility shall be located on the surface within five hundred feet of all main portals, and shall be installed either in a building or in a box-like structure designed to protect the facilities from damage by inclement weather. At least one of these communication facilities shall be at a location where a responsible person who is always on duty when men are underground can hear the facility and respond immediately in the event of an emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Westmoreland Coal Company (Westmoreland) operates two coal mines, \u201cWentz No. 1\u201d and \u201cWentz B.\u201d The main portals of the two mines are approximately 1700 feet apart. Relying upon federal requirements and Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) as it was interpreted by an Attorney General of Virginia in 1981 (the 1981 opinion), Westmoreland installed a communications system for its mines by locating a telephone within 500 feet of the main portal of Wentz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>No. 1 and another telephone within 500 feet of the main portal of Wentz B. A larger, better equipped central communications facility is located at Wentz No. 1 main portal. A \u201cresponsible person\u201d mans this facility 24 hours per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">Another Attorney General rendered a second opinion in 1982 (the 1982 opinion) overruling the 1981 opinion. His interpretation of Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) required Westmoreland to maintain a <em>manned </em>facility within 500 feet of the main portal of each mine. As a consequence of the 1982 opinion, Westmoreland brought a declaratory judgment proceeding seeking judicial interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The trial court ruled that Westmoreland\u2019s communications system complied with Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). It found that Westmoreland maintains a communication facility located within 500 feet of the main portal of each mine and that the Wentz No. 1 communications system, manned 24 hours per day by a responsible person, serves as a central communications facility for both mines. The court rejected the contention of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (the Department) that the statute required Westmoreland to station an additional person at the Wentz B facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The trial court based its ruling on two independent grounds. First, it found that the General Assembly intended to adopt the federal interpretation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1, which contains language identical to that in Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). Second, the trial court concluded that Westmoreland\u2019s communications system satisfies the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). The Department appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">First, we determine whether Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) is clear and unambiguous. If so, the section\u2019s plain meaning must be accepted without resort to extrinsic evidence and the rules of construction. <em>Ambrogi </em>v. <em>Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 386, 297 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1982); <em>Sanitation Commission </em>v. <em>Chesapeake, </em>218 Va. 696, 702, 240 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Department contends that Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) is unambiguous and its plain language \u201crequires that at all times when men are working underground a communication facility on the surface which is within 500 feet of a main portal of that mine must be manned by a responsible person.\u201d As authority for its contention that the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) supports its position, the Department relies upon the 1982 opinion, 1981-82 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. Rep. 251. In the 1982 opinion, the Attorney General said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>that \u201c[t]he term \u2018at least one of these facilities\u2019 refers to the facilities specified in the immediately next preceding sentence, <em>i.e., </em>those within 500 feet of the portal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252. With no reference to the federal regulation or its interpretation, he concluded that \u201cthe manned facility must be one within 500 feet of the main portal to each mine.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The Department also relies upon <em>Walls </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>162 W. Va. 563, 251 S.E.2d 491 (1978), in which the Supreme Court of West Virginia applied W. Va. Code \u00a7 22-2-42(a) (1977), a statute almost identical to Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). The facts in <em>Walls, </em>however, are quite different from those in the present case. In <em>Walls, </em>the coal company operated seven mines, and a responsible person was no closer than one mile to any of the main mine portals. <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 251 S.E.2d at 496. Moreover, the opinion does not state whether the company maintained an interconnected communications system with a central communications facility or what effect such a system would have had on the decision. Thus, we do not know what the West Virginia Supreme Court would have held had it been presented with facts similar to those in the case at bar. The court did say, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">The statutory mandate is plain and unambiguous and should be applied and not construed . . . and we see no reason to infer that the Legislature did not mean exactly what it said, namely that there shall be a person within 500 feet of <em>at least one </em>main portal who is always on duty while men are working.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 569, 251 S.E.2d at 496. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Westmoreland, reaching a different conclusion, also contends that Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) is unambiguous and that its communications system complies with the section\u2019s provisions. Westmoreland claims that the phrase \u201c[a]t least one of these communication facilities\u201d cannot refer to the <em>one </em>facility that the second sentence requires to be located within 500 feet of a main portal; otherwise the term \u201c [a]t least one\u201d is meaningless because \u201conly <em>one </em>facility within 500 feet is required.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Instead, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cording to Westmoreland, the phrase refers to the \u201ccommunication facilities\u201d required by the first sentence of Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">Westmoreland relies upon the construction placed on the section by the 1981 Attorney General opinion, 1980-81 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. Rep. 245, and by federal agencies charged with enforcing mine safety laws. In the 1981 opinion, the Attorney General concluded that while Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) requires the installation of a communication facility within 500 feet of all main portals, \u201c[i]n reference to the placement of persons, the only requirement is that \u2018at least one of these [attended] facilities\u2019 be \u2018at a location\u2019 where a responsible individual can respond immediately in the event of an emergency.\u201d 1980-81 Va. Att\u2019y Gen. Rep. at 246. Additionally, the Attorney General said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">The Department of Labor and Industry, Division of Mines and Quarries, adopted [the federal] interpretation after the enactment of \u00a7 45.1-81(a) and has enforced the statute in conformity with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">. . . This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the Department . . . has consistently ruled that manned facilities which are over five hundred feet from a particular portal are in compliance with \u00a7 45.1-81 so long as the attended facility is at a location where a responsible person can respond in the event of an emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The trial court adopted Westmoreland\u2019s contention, agreeing with the interpretation given Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) by the Attorney General in 1981 and by federal agencies responsible for mine safety. The court reached this conclusion \u201cbased solely on the interpretation of the language in 45.1-81(a),\u201d stating that if the General Assembly had intended to require a person at each communication facility within 500 feet of a main portal, it \u201cshould have been specific and said so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">We conclude that Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) <em>is </em>ambiguous because it is susceptible to more than one meaning. <em>See Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). The divergent interpretations discussed above demonstrate the difficulty one encounters in trying to ascertain the statute\u2019s meaning. Because the section is ambiguous, we, like the trial court, must resort to extrinsic evidence and the rules of construction to determine legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>lative intent, \u201cthe paramount object of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Vollin </em>v. <em>Arlington Co. Electoral Bd., </em>216 Va. 674, 678-79, 222 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In 1976, the General Assembly established the Coal Mine Health and Safety Commission (Safety Commission) to study coal mine health and safety. Senate Joint Resolution No. 63, Acts 1976, p. 1511. After conducting public hearings, the Safety Commission made certain findings and drafted proposed legislation to implement its findings. Two of its general findings are relevant to our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">A. It was agreed that many technical changes were necessary in order to conform State law with Federal mining requirements. Such changes may be found throughout the proposed Commission legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">E. It was agreed that many general safety rules should be codified in order to promote safety in the mines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">One of the Safety Commission\u2019s proposed changes related to mine communications systems. Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a), as it read at the time of the Study Commission\u2019s report, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">Telephone service or equivalent two-way communication facilities shall be provided between the top and each landing of main shafts and slopes. Adequate communication systems shall be provided to other active sections of the mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The Safety Commission recommended that the second sentence of the section be deleted and replaced with the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">A telephone or equivalent two-way communication facility shall be located on the surface within five hundred feet of all main portals, and shall be installed either in a building or in a box-like structure designed to protect the facilities from damage by inclement weather. At least one of these communication facilities shall be at a location where a responsible person who is always on duty when men are underground can hear the facility and respond immediately in the event of an emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The General Assembly enacted into law the precise language the Safety Commission proposed for Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). Moreover, this language is identical to that contained in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1, the federal regulation promulgated in 1973 by the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MESA) of the United States Department of the Interior. At that time, MESA was the federal agency responsible for coal mine safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">This federal regulation was interpreted by MESA in its publication entitled <em>Coal Mine Health and Safety Inspection Manual for Underground Mines, </em>dated June 1974 and published by the United States Government Printing Office for public sale in 1976 <em>(1974 Underground Manual). </em>MESA interpreted the provision of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><em>*75.1600-1 Communication facilities; main portals: Installation requirements. </em>The second sentence requires that at least one such communication facility be located where a responsible person who is always on duty when men are underground can hear the facility and respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">A telephone or equivalent facility at a central location which may be greater than 500 feet from any portal, will satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of Section 75.1600-1 as it applies to multiple-portals of any one mine or a number of mines within a reasonable geographical area, provided a responsible person at the central location can hear the telephone and respond immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">MESA\u2019s interpretation of the federal regulation has been reaffirmed consistently since 1974 by MESA and its successor agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In 1975, for example, MESA\u2019s Administrator, responding to an inquiry from the United Mine Workers of America, opined that a centrally manned telephone communications system serving several nearby mines met the requirements of the federal regulations. He said that such a communications system is often superior to an individual at a portal telephone \u201cbecause the entire resources of a company of community can be directed to a mine emergency more readily from such a center.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In 1977, the responsibility for federal mine safety and health regulations was transferred from MESA to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the United States Department of Labor. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 961 (1982). MSHA revised and reissued the <em>1974 Underground Manual </em>on March 9, 1978 <em>(1978 Underground Manual), </em>but continued MESA\u2019s interpretation of the communications requirement under 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1. The <em>1978 Underground Manual, </em>like the <em>1974 Underground Manual, </em>explains that the regulation permits a centrally manned communications system which serves nearby mines without requiring the stationing of a person at each portal telephone at all times. MSHA has continued to so interpret the federal regulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">When the General Assembly adopts language substantially similar to that of another jurisdiction\u2019s regulation, a presumption arises that the legislature also intended, to adopt the prior interpretation placed upon the language by the promulgating authority. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>148 Va. 97, 116, 138 S.E. 650, 656 (1927). Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a), as proposed by the Study Commission, contained language identical to 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1, and the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a) exactly as proposed. The trial court found that, in enacting Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a), the General Assembly intended to conform Virginia law with federal mining requirements and to adopt the federal interpretation of the communications regulation. After reviewing the evidence, we reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Our conclusion, like the trial court\u2019s, also furthers the stated legislative purpose of \u201cpromoting] safety in the mines.\u201d As the Department conceded in oral argument, permitting Westmoreland to station one person at a central location to man an interconnected communications system is as safe as stationing an individual at every main portal telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Indeed, evidence exists that in the case of an interconnected communications system, one centrally-manned location may be more efficient, and therefore safer, than an individual at every portal. The \u201cresponsible person\u201d required by Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a), whether centrally located or stationed at a main portal, must remain by the telephone and maintain contact with the emergency response teams and the miners. Neither the central person nor the individual at a single portal telephone can perform on-site rescue activities for which he is not qualified. However, as MESA\u2019s Administrator pointed out, all available emergency resources can be directed to an emergency more readily from a central communications system.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">Additionally, no danger of a \u201cbusy\u201d signal exists if both mines simultaneously attempt to place telephone calls to the \u201cresponsible person\u201d in Wentz No. 1. Each mine\u2019s communication system is connected by a separate line to the central communications facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Moreover, Rule 1 of the \u201cRules and Regulations Governing Disruption of Communication in Mines\u201d promulgated pursuant to Code \u00a7 45.1-104 provides that \u201c[m]ine foremen or their designee shall check the communication system to all sections or part of an underground mine ... at least once every hour to ascertain if the system is in operation.\u201d Thus, the mine foreman, not the \u201cresponsible person\u201d required by Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a), is charged with the responsibility of ensuring uninterrupted mine communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The conclusion we reach, unlike the one urged by the Department, gives reasonable effect to every word of Code \u00a7 45.1-81(a). <em>See Jones </em>v. <em>Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984). Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\"> The emphasized words from this quotation actually suggest a position more aligned with Westmoreland\u2019s, rather than the Department\u2019s contention that there shall be a person within 500 feet of <em>every </em>(not \u201cat least one\u201d) main portal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\"> The Department contends that the trial court erred in admitting the Administrator\u2019s letter interpretation (Exhibit 7) because \u201c[t]here is no evidence that any member of the Commission or of the General Assembly was aware ... of the interpretation . . . prior to the amendment of \u00a7 45.1-81.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In exercising its discretion, the General Assembly \u201cis presumed to have been cognizant at the time it acted of all existing facts and circumstances\u201d bearing upon and relating to its enactments. <em>I.D.A. </em>v. <em>La France </em>Cleaners, 216 Va. 277, 282, 217 S.E.2d 879, 883 (1975). Thus, \u201ca court must look not to what a legislative body . . . knew when it acted, but to what it could have known at that time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\"> The trial court did not, as the Department contends, err in admitting Exhibits 5 and 6, which are Westmoreland\u2019s 1982 request for an interpretation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.1600-1 and MSHA\u2019s response. These exhibits demonstrate that the federal agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulation has been the same from the time of the regulation\u2019s adoption until the time the case was heard in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
