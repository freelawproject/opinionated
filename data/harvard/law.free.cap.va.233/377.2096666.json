Henderson, an employee of Continental Communications Construction Company (Continental), was injured on March 31, 1980, when he fell from a rolling ladder while supervising the addition of trunk lines to the No. 5 Crossbar<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> located in the Charlottesville office of Central Telephone Company of Virginia (Centel). On October 11, 1979, Centel entered into a contract with Continental for the \u201cinstallation and/or maintenance of Central Office Equipment.\u201d At the time he was injured, Henderson, was acting pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">In January 1982, Henderson sued Centel and others. On March 1, 1982, Centel filed a Special Plea challenging the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. Centel contended therein that it was Henderson\u2019s statutory employer and that Henderson\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). Centel asked that it be dismissed from the suit. The matter was heard on November 10, 1982. On December 3, 1982, the trial court rejected the Special Plea, concluding, in effect, that Centel was not Henderson\u2019s statutory employer. Centel filed a motion for reconsideration. Upon reconsideration, the trial court changed its initial deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>sion, granted the Special Plea, and dismissed Centel as a defendant. Henderson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether, at the time of his injury, Henderson was engaged in work that was part of Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. If so, Centel was Henderson\u2019s statutory employer and the trial court was correct in dismissing Centel from the suit. In our opinion, the trial court correctly decided this issue; therefore, we will affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The pertinent facts are as follows: Centel is a public utility regulated by the laws of the Commonwealth and subject to the administrative control of the State Corporation Commission (Commission). Centel is required by statute to provide \u201cadequate service and facilities.\u201d Code \u00a7 56-234. Moreover, pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-35, the Commission issued a document entitled \u201cOperating Service Criteria For Virginia Telephone Utilities.\u201d That document contains the following requirement: \u201cEach telephone company shall provide the necessary equipment and plant facilities within its certificated areas to handle the local and toll traffic so that\u201d certain conditions of service will be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Centel supplied all the materials for the job on which Henderson was working. Continental supplied the labor. None of Centel\u2019s employees worked with Continental\u2019s employees on the installation. Nor did Centel supervise Continental\u2019s work. However, the Continental workers were subject to Centel\u2019s control regarding working hours, access to the facility, and preventing interruptions of existing service. In addition, Centel received progress reports on Henderson\u2019s work. Centel also inspected Continental\u2019s work and noted instances where the specifications were not met. Centel considered compliance with the specifications to be its responsibility. Centel admitted that the work Continental was doing was not a subcontracted portion of a larger contract. On the date he was injured, Henderson was \u201cworking as a telephone equipment installer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Centel was capable of installing the equipment that Continental was installing but chose not to do so for economic reasons related to the \u201cpeaks and valleys\u201d in demand for central office equipment installation and to certain terms in its union contract that made it more costly for it to use its own employees to do central office installation work. Centel employees have, in the past, installed central office equipment of greater complexity than that Henderson was installing. According to Centel, even without using con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tract labor, it could have met its statutory duty to provide adequate service and facilities. To do so, however, Centel would have had to increase its own labor force with a likely increase in its costs and the costs to its customers. When asked whether Centel employees installed central office equipment, one witness testified that Centel employees had, in the past, installed various types of central office equipment including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">subscriber carrier, VF repeaters, pads and transformer units, various and different kinds of signaling equipment and SFDX equipment, program amplifiers for radio stations, traffic measuring equipment, automatic transfer equipment for carrier, main frame protections, the carriers themselves, trunks, recorder announcers, touch call equipment, power saving carrier, to name just a few.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The same witness said that at the time Henderson was making his installation, Centel had six employees who \u201cwere capable of doing any of the work that Mr. Henderson was employed doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In 1979, 50.3% of all central office installation and removal work was done with Centel labor. However, in that same year, only 3.3% of Centel labor was spent on central office equipment construction and only .0016% on work on the No. 5 Crossbar. The balance of the overall central office labor in 1979, 49.7%, was supplied by contract labor. Historically, 60% to 75% of Centel\u2019s installation requirements were met with company employees. In 1979, 72.7% of Centel\u2019s total labor requirements were met with company labor. In 1980, the figure was 75.2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The record discloses that the physical plant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> necessary to provide telephone service is divided into three parts: central office equipment, outside plant, and station apparatus. All three facets of the system must work together to provide telephone service to customers. No one component by itself can provide telephone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">According to Centel, station apparatus are installed by installer-repairmen, complex installer-repairmen, and cable splicers; outside plant network is installed by linemen and cable splicers; and central office equipment is installed by central office equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ment repairmen. Centel used contract labor to work on all three facets of its physical plant. It considered outside labor as \u201ccontract augmentation\u201d to its work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">At least two statutory provisions bear upon the issue under consideration. Code \u00a7 65.1-5 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to make, for the purposes of this Act, the employees of an independent contractor the employees of the person or corporation employing or contracting with such independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Code \u00a7 65.1-29 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">When any person [owner] undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person [subcontractor] for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Code \u00a7 65.1-5 provides, in essence, that the mere fact a business owner engages an independent contractor does not make that independent contractor\u2019s employees statutory employees of the owner. This means that Henderson is not necessarily Centel\u2019s statutory employee. Before the statutory employee/employer status can be established, more must be proved than that Henderson worked for Continental which in turn had a contract with Centel.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Code \u00a7 65.1-29 contemplates that an owner such as Centel can subcontract all its work yet remain liable under the Act. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>232 Va. 302, 351 S.E.2d 14 (1986). This provision is meant to prevent an owner from escaping liability under the Act by the simple expedient of subcontracting away work which is part of its trade, business, or occupation. Such an owner will remain liable under the Act to the extent the work subcontracted is part of that owner\u2019s trade, business, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Thus, determining Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation is critical. But before we can determine Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, we must first settle upon the appropriate test for making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Developing the appropriate test and determining whether activities fall within or without an entity\u2019s trade, business, or occupation is not a simple, straightforward exercise. Deciding what is the trade, business, or occupation of an entity is a \u201cmixed question of law and fact\u201d and is a question that \u201cdoes not readily yield to categorical or absolute standards.\u201d <em>Bassett Furniture </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>216 Va. 897, 902, 224 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In this appeal, Henderson does not seek workers\u2019 compensation coverage from Centel. Because of this, the lawyers have referred to this as an \u201cupside down\u201d case. This is in contrast to the so-called \u201cright side up\u201d case in which the injured worker seeks workers\u2019 compensation coverage. It is significant, however, that even though Henderson does not seek coverage from Centel, our consideration of this appeal is nevertheless governed by the principles that apply in a case where coverage is sought. Those principles are as follows: The Act is highly remedial and should be liberally construed to advance its purpose. <em>See Fauver </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>192 Va. 518, 522, 65 S.E.2d 575, 577 (1951); <em>Bamber </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>138 Va. 26, 121 S.E. 564 (1924). Further, the fundamental purpose of the Act is to give compensation for accidental injuries resulting from the hazards of the employment. <em>Feitig </em>v. <em>Chalkley, </em>185 Va. 96, 98, 38 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">With the foregoing in mind, we turn to Henderson\u2019s argument. Henderson contends the test that should be used to determine whether Henderson was engaged in Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation is the one announced in <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>212 Va. 715, 187 S.E.2d 162 (1972), and utilized in <em>Bassett Furniture </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>216 Va. 897, 224 S.E.2d 323 (1976). In <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>we wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">[T]he test is not one of whether the subcontractor\u2019s activity is useful, necessary, or even absolutely indispensable to the statutory employer\u2019s business, since, after all, this could be said of practically any repair, construction or transportation service. The test (except in cases where the work is obviously a subcontracted fraction of a main contract) is whether this indispensable activity is, in the business, <em>normally </em>carried on through employees rather than independent contractors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>212 Va. at 722, 187 S.E.2d at 167 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">According to Henderson, because Centel has admitted that the work being done by Continental was not a subcontracted portion of a main contract, the exception does not apply. Further, according to Henderson, Centel\u2019s employees did not normally install the particular type of central office equipment on which Henderson was working at the time of his injury. Henderson submits the analysis is simple and the outcome clear \u2014 that he was not Centel\u2019s statutory employee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>test has never been applied by this Court in a case involving either a public utility or a governmental entity. This is so for good reason. The test is merely an approach that is useful in determining an entity\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. It is not designed for every situation. It works best in cases involving private businesses because those entities often define their trade, business, or occupation by their conduct. With regard to such entities, what they do on a day-to-day basis provides a reasonably reliable indicator of their trade, business, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Yet, public utilities and governmental entities are of another class. It is not simply what they do that defines their trade, business, or occupation. What they are supposed to do is also a determinant. Whereas a private business entity is essentially self-defining in terms of its trade, business, or occupation, a public utility has duties, obligations, and responsibilities imposed upon it by statute, regulation, or other means. Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Centel is a telephone company. It is required by law to provide adequate service and facilities. It is mandated by regulations promulgated pursuant to statute to provide \u201cnecessary equipment and plant facilities.\u201d Thus, it would be illogical to disregard what Centel is required by law to do when attempting to determine its trade, business, or occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In addition, to consider only what Centel normally does with its own employees would be to ignore Code \u00a7 65.1-29, which contemplates the use of subcontractors by an owner to do all or part of the owner\u2019s work. If the <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>test is uncritically applied, the result would be that owners who subcontract out all their work would never have workers\u2019 compensation liability because <em>their own </em>employees would never <em>normally </em>do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Moreover, in cases involving government entities, we have consistently considered the laws under which they were created and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>under which they functioned in determining their trade, business, or occupation. We followed this approach in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Construction </em>Company, 201 Va. 266, 110 S.E.2d 396 (1959). The issue in that case was whether Anderson and the construction company were both engaged in the trade, business, or occupation of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority at the time Anderson was injured. The company for which Anderson worked and the construction company which he attempted to sue both had contracts with the Authority involving the construction of the turnpike.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We pointed out that the act which created the Authority authorized it \u201cto construct, maintain, repair and operate the turnpike project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 110 S.E.2d at 397. In <em>Anderson, </em>we quoted with approval the following language from the trial court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">In a very real sense, the Authority was engaged at every step of the way, in the course of its usual trade, business or occupation, from the preliminary surveys, through the acquisition of the right of way, the construction, and the final operation, maintenance and repair of the turnpike. <em>The Legislature has so declared by vesting it with the power and charging it with the responsibility of so doing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 272, 110 S.E.2d at 400 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">To the same effect is <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Gresham Company, </em>201 Va. 457, 111 S.E.2d 498 (1959). There, an employee of the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District was injured while working with an independent contractor on the repair of damaged pilings. The employee sued the contractor. The issue was whether at the time of the injury both the employee and the contractor were engaged in the Ferry District\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. In resolving this question, we considered the provisions of the act which created the Ferry District. The Ferry District was authorized \u201cto acquire, construct, operate and maintain a project to provide vehicular and passenger ferry service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 111 S.E.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The facts in <em>Williams </em>are similar to those in this case. For example, the evidence established that the Ferry District never owned a crane and never attempted on its own to drive piles. Yet, those facts were not dispositive. Upon consideration of the act which created it, we concluded as follows: \u201cThe Commission\u2019s powers and responsibilities are clear. When repairs were being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>made to the ferry slip and the unfortunate accident occurred, Ferry District was <em>executing essential duties imposed upon it.\u201d Id. </em>at 465, 111 S.E.2d at 503 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In our view, the instant appeal is more akin to the <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Williams </em>cases than it is to those relied upon by Henderson. We note that, to some extent, this case is stronger because in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Williams </em>we defined the trade, business, or occupation on the basis of what the governmental entity was <em>authorized </em>to do while here the provision of services and facilities is something Centel is <em>required </em>to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Moreover, the facts and circumstances of this case support the conclusion that springs from the <em>Anderson-Williams </em>analysis. There are three facets to the telephone communication system examined in this case: central office equipment, outside plant, and station apparatus. Each facet is but a part of an interrelated whole which makes up the telephone plant. Centel employees do installation work on each part of the telephone plant. However, their work is augmented, as needed, with contract labor. In short, Centel does install central office equipment. It was capable of installing, and had installed, equipment similar to that being installed by Henderson. However, for economic reasons partly related to their union contract, Centel made the business decision to contract out most of the major central office installations. Thus, Henderson relies on these facts to argue that because Centel did not normally install a specific type of central office equipment, installation of such equipment was not part of Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. This view is too myopic.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In Williams, the Ferry District never used a crane and never drove piles by itself, but driving piles was nevertheless part of its trade, business, or occupation because it was part of maintaining the facility. By the same token, though Centel did not normally install the type of central office equipment that Henderson was installing, the installation of that equipment was nevertheless part of Centel\u2019s trade, business, or occupation because it was an addition to the physical plant that Centel was required by law to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\"> A No. 5 Crossbar is a type of telephone switching equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> The discussion of Centel\u2019s \u201cphysical plant\u201d in this record was limited to the components of the network that were essential to providing telephone service.
