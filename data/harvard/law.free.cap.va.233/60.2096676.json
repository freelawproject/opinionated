Following a decision by this Court in <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Harvie, </em>183 Va. 734, 33 S.E.2d 213 (1945), the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Division I, entered a final decree holding that Mary Jones Carter had a life estate in the funds at issue \u201cwith remainder to her heirs at law, to be determined as of the date of her death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Mary Jones Carter (the decedent or the intestate) died intestate on July 26, 1982. She was survived by her husband, Russell T. Carter, Sr. (Carter), and by two children of her former marriage, William S. Moorefield, Jr., and Margaret Moorefield King. In a proceeding initiated by a petition for distribution of the trust funds in issue, Carter filed a motion for a decree declaring that he was an heir at law of the decedent. In a final decree denying the motion, the chancellor ordered the funds distributed in equal shares to the decedent\u2019s two children, and we granted Carter an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The parties agree that a surviving spouse was not an heir of the decedent at common law, that an heir is generally defined as one entitled by law to inherit a decedent\u2019s estate, and that the question whether a surviving spouse is an heir at law in this Commonwealth is governed by the provisions of Code \u00a7 64.1-1 and related statutes in effect on the date of the decedent\u2019s death. <em>See Semones </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>185 Va. 929, 41 S.E.2d 13 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">As amended by Acts 1982, c. 304, effective July 1, 1982, Code \u00a7 64.1-1 provided in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>When any person having title to any real estate of inheritance shall die intestate as to such estate, it shall descend and pass in parcenary to such of his kindred, male and female, in the following course:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">First. To the surviving spouse of the intestate, unless the intestate is survived by children or their descendants, one or more of whom are not children or their descendants of the surviving spouse, in which case such estate shall pass to the intestate\u2019s children and their descendants subject to the provisions of \u00a7 64.1-19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Code \u00a7 64.1-19 referenced in that statute is entitled \u201cDower or curtesy of surviving spouse.\u201d It reads today as it did on the date of the death of Carter\u2019s wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">A surviving spouse shall be entitled to a dower or curtesy interest <em>in fee simple </em>of one third of all the real estate whereof the deceased spouse or any other to his use was at any time seized during coverture of an estate of inheritance, unless such right shall have been lawfully barred or relinquished. This section shall not change or enlarge the nature of any dower or curtesy interest retained in real estate transferred to a grantee or made the subject of a valid contract or not conveyed by the grantor\u2019s spouse prior to July one, nineteen hundred seventy-seven. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The words \u201cin fee simple\u201d were added to the first sentence of the dower/curtesy statute by Acts 1977, c. 657. Carter argues that \u201c[t]he one-third fee simple interest. . . is an estate of inheritance\u201d and \u201cnot dower and curtesy, as defined by the common law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Characteristically, an estate of inheritance is one qualified to pass through an heir who predeceases an intestate to those derivatively eligible under the statute of descent. A dower/curtesy interest is not such an estate, because the interest never comes into existence if the wife/husband predeceases the intestate. Code \u00a7 64.1-19 defines the right of a surviving spouse in the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>real property as a \u201cdower or curtesy interest\u201d and fixes the scope of that interest. Although the 1977 amendment redefined the <em>dimensions </em>of that interest, it did not change its <em>character. </em>Accordingly, we reject the suggestion that the General Assembly intended the amendment to convert the right to dower or curtesy, a marital right, into a right of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Pursuing his interpretation of the amendment to the dower/ curtesy statute, Carter contends that the 1982 amendment to the statute of descent which, for the first time, named a surviving spouse \u201cin the first class of succession\u201d, must be construed to evince legislative intent to treat the surviving spouse as an heir at law of the decedent whenever, as here, it becomes necessary to identify the heirs of an intestate. \u201c[BJoth from the perspective of legal draftsmen and from the perspective of the intent of parties to [legal] documents,\u201d Carter says, \u201cit is important that the term \u2018heir at law\u2019 have a consistent, uniform definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">But such definition is the prerogative and responsibility of the General Assembly, and the language of Code \u00a7 64.1-1 makes it clear that a surviving spouse may be but is not always an heir of the deceased spouse. On the one hand, a surviving spouse is an heir when (1) the intestate dies without surviving children or their descendants or (2) the surviving spouse is the parent of all the intestate\u2019s children or the ancestor of the descendants of such children. On the other hand, a surviving spouse is <em>not </em>an heir of the decedent when, as here, \u201cthe intestate is survived by children or their descendants, one or more of whom are not children or their descendants of the surviving spouse\u201d. In such case, the \u201cestate shall pass to the intestate\u2019s children and their descendants subject to the provisions of \u00a7 64.1-19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">As we construe the legislative intent underlying the 1982 Act amending Code \u00a7\u00a7 64.1-1 and -11, such children (including the intestate\u2019s children born of his or her marriage to the surviving spouse)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and their descendants are the sole heirs at law of the decedent. As such, they are entitled to inherit the intestate\u2019s estate, both personal and real, subject to the dower or curtesy interest prescribed by Code \u00a7 64.1-19 on the date of the death of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The chancellor ruled that Carter is not an heir at law of the decedent, and we will affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\"> The 1982 Act also contained a conforming amendment to Code \u00a7 64.1-11, the statute which prescribes the course of descent and distribution of the personal estate of an intestate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\"> See Acts 1985, c. 189, adding the word \u201call\u201d as a modifier of the words \u201cthe intestate\u2019s children\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
