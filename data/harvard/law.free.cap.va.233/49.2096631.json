The judgment was based upon the pleadings, a stipulation of facts, the exhibits admitted at trial, and argument by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">The tractor was owned by Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. (Ryder). Ryder leased the tractor to Eppinger &amp; Russell Co. (Eppinger) for a term of 13 months. The accident occurred while Eppinger\u2019s trailer was attached to Ryder\u2019s tractor. Ryder was insured by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National), under a liability policy which limited coverage applicable to this accident to $500,000. Eppinger was insured by Aetna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Casualty &amp; Surety Co. (Aetna) under a liability policy which limited coverage to $1,000,000 for each occurrence. Aetna\u2019s coverage extended to Ryder\u2019s tractor as a \u201cnon-owned vehicle\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">National and Aetna agreed that Eppinger and its employee, the driver of the tractor-trailer, \u201cwere probably legally liable\u201d for the losses sustained in the accident. Negotiations between National and counsel for the claimants resulted in a compromise settlement in the sum of $18,926.84. Because National\u2019s policy contained a deductible clause in excess of that sum, Ryder made the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">National filed a motion for judgment against Aetna, seeking total indemnity for its insured or, in the alternative, contribution of a pro rata share of the payment made to settle the claims. Aetna denied liability, and the trial court granted its motion to join Ryder as a party-plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In a counterclaim, Aetna alleged that Ryder \u201cagreed to afford to . . . Eppinger . . . liability insurance in the sum of $500,000.00 ... at its sole cost, covering both Ryder and [Eppinger]\u201d; that Aetna \u201cis a third-party beneficiary of the terms of this contract\u201d; that if the court should find that Ryder\u2019s policy with National did not provide primary coverage, then Ryder \u201chas breached the terms of its contract\u201d; and that \u201cEppinger . . . and [Aetna] as a third-party beneficiary, are entitled to indemnity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In its order entering final judgment, the trial court held that Aetna should \u201ctake nothing by its Counterclaim against Ryder\u201d. In a letter opinion incorporated by reference in that order, the trial court ruled \u201cthat the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses of the two policies are mutually repugnant, compounded by the provisions of the lease and those of [Code] \u00a7 38.1-381(a3).\u201d Accordingly, the court found \u201cthat plaintiffs are entitled to contribution from Aetna . . . for two-thirds (%) of the sums paid by the plaintiff in [the] settlement\u201d and awarded National and Ryder judgment in the sum of $12,612.88. Aetna assigned multiple errors, and we granted this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Although Aetna assigned no error to the trial court\u2019s ruling on its counterclaim, Aetna, apparently relying on the allegations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>that pleading, argues that National and Ryder were estopped to invoke the provisions of former Code \u00a7 38.1-38 l(a3) (hereinafter, (a3)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aetna reasons that, although the lease contract required that the policy issued to Ryder provide primary coverage, it also required Eppinger to indemnify Ryder against any liability incurred in excess of the limits of Ryder\u2019s policy. \u201cThe language of the lease,\u201d Aetna contends, \u201cvirtually compelled Eppinger ... to purchase excess . . . insurance\u201d. Aetna concludes that Eppinger was induced to believe that if it did so, Ryder would waive its right to invoke the (a3) exception. Further, Aetna says that the premiums on Ryder\u2019s policy were included in the rental fees, and that if Ryder acted with knowledge that the statute would have the effect National claims, \u201cRyder has breached ... its contract . . . to provide <em>primary </em>. . . insurance\u201d. In either case, Aetna charges, the plaintiffs are estopped to rely on the statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We find nothing of record to show that Aetna relied to its detriment upon the actions of Ryder when Aetna issued its policy to Eppinger. Aetna had no contract with Ryder or with National, and Aetn\u00e1, although perhaps an incidental beneficiary, was not a third-party beneficiary under the contract between Ryder and Eppinger. <em>See Valley Company </em>v. <em>Rolland, </em>218 Va. 257, 237 S.E.2d 120 (1977). If any party relied to its detriment on the actions of Ryder, it was Eppinger. But Eppinger was not a party-litigant, and we hold that Aetna has no standing to invoke the doctrine of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Aetna maintains that the trial court erred by invoking the provisions of (a3). National did not include the statutory language in its policy, and Aetna argues that \u201c(a3) at most permits the inclusion\u201d of that clause in a liability policy issued to a long-term lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We disagree. The statute is couched in mandatory terms. Originally, (a3) provided that a garage-keeper\u2019s policy \u201cmay con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tain\u201d the exception. Acts 1968, c. 199. Two years later, the word \u201cshall\u201d was substituted for the word \u201cmay\u201d, Acts 1970, c. 494, and in 1977, the General Assembly amended (a3) to make it applicable to policies issued to long-term lessors, Acts 1977, c. 78. Such statutory provisions are \u201cas much a part of the policy as if incorporated therein.\u201d <em>State Farm Mutual </em>v. Duncan, 203 Va. 440, 443, 125 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">Pursuing its argument that (a3) is inapplicable, Aetna points out that it \u201conly applies when the driver/tort feasor is one \u2018other than the named insured\u2019.\u201d Endorsement No. 13 appended to National\u2019s policy states that \u201cthe coverage provided by this policy, includes as additional insureds any person or organization for whom the named insured is obligated by written agreement to provide liability insurance\u201d. Aetna argues that \u201cEppinger . . . <em>is </em>a named insured by virtue of endorsement <em># </em>13\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">But the very language of the endorsement recognizes a distinction between the named insured and others protected by the policy. National\u2019s policy defines the named insured as \u201cthe person or organization named in Item 1 of the declarations of this policy\u201d, the parties have expressly stipulated that \u201cRyder . . . was a named insured\u201d, (a3) clearly treats a lessee as \u201ca person other than the named insured\u201d, and we reject Aetna\u2019s construction of Endorsement No. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Aetna\u2019s chief complaint is that the trial court, relying upon decisions in other jurisdictions, adopted and applied the rule that coverage should be prorated according to policy limits when \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are conflicting and mutually repugnant. Citing other foreign authority, Aetna contends there was no conflict here because \u201cthe Aetna policy, in providing only excess insurance, did not afford insurance which was \u2018valid and collectible\u2019 as contemplated by the statute\u201d. \u201cIf a conflict exists at all,\u201d Aetna says, \u201cit arises solely by reason of the statutory construction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">As appears from the letter opinion, however, the trial court did not base its decision on a finding that the conflict arose solely by reason of the statute. Rather, the court concluded \u201cthat the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses of the two policies are mutually repugnant, compounded by the provisions of the lease and those of \u00a7 38.1-381(a3).\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding was that (a3) merely contributed to the conflict. Although the lease contract assigned \u201cLiability Insurance Responsibility\u201d to \u201cRyder\u201d to obtain a policy of primary insurance, the trial court apparently construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the statute to import into National\u2019s policy a provision that made its coverage merely excess. It is immaterial whether that construction was correct, for Endorsement No. 2 in National\u2019s policy provided that \u201cwith respect to any automobile . . . which is leased/ rented . . . under an agreement whereby the lessee/rentee agrees to provide . . . liability insurance . . . the insurance under this policy shall be excess insurance\u201d. Eppinger\u2019s policy with Aetna also provided excess insurance, and Eppinger agreed in the lease contract \u201cto release, indemnify, and hold Ryder harmless from and against any claims ... in excess of the limits of Liability Insurance, whether provided by Ryder or [Eppinger]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We agree with the trial court that, read together, the provisions of the statute, the two policies, and the lease contract are virtually identical in effect, irreconcilable, and mutually repugnant. In such case, we need not choose among the precedents in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We have recently held that when \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of two policies are of identical effect in that they operate mutually to reduce or eliminate the amount of collectible insurance available, neither provides primary coverage and that \u201cthe pro rata distribution ordered by the trial court was appropriate.\u201d <em>State Capital Ins. </em>v. <em>Mutual Assurance Soc., </em>218 Va. 815, 820, 241 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1978). <em>Cf. GEICO </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>232 Va. 326, 350 S.E.2d 612 (1986) (\u201cother insurance\u201d clauses reconcilable). We believe that rule is especially applicable when, as here, two or more policies, in anticipation of possible conflicts in \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, expressly provide for pro rata coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Applying the rule adopted in <em>State Capital Ins. </em>to the facts and circumstances in this case, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> In an assignment of cross-error, National complained that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in granting appellees pro rata contribution from Aetna rather than indemnification\u201d, and we extended the scope of the appeal to include National\u2019s assignment. However, National chose not to address that assignment on brief or in oral argument and asks us to affirm the judgment awarding it contribution. Hence, National has endorsed the court\u2019s rationale in its letter opinion and waived its indemnification claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\"> Former Code \u00a7 38.1-381(a3) (now, Code \u00a7 38.2-2205(A)(l)), a restrictive modifier of subsection (a), commonly called the \u201comnibus clause\u201d, creates an exception to that clause. Insofar as relevant here, (a3) provides that every motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued to a \u201cnamed insured\u201d who leases vehicles for a period of six months or more shall contain a provision that the insurance coverage . . . afforded a person other than the named insured . . . shall not be applicable if there is any other valid and collectible insurance applicable to the same loss covering [a permissive user] under a policy with limits at least equal to the financial responsibility requirements specified in \u00a7 46.1-504 of the Code of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> National\u2019s policy provides that \u201c[w]hen both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, . . . the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Aetna\u2019s policy provides that \u201c[w]hen two or more policies cover on the same basis, either excess or primary, we will pay only ... the proportion that the limit of our policy bears to the total of the limits of all the policies covering on the same basis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
