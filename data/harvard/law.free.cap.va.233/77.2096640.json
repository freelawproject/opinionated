In the first trial, the jury hung. In the second trial, the jury found for the defendant. That verdict was set aside by the trial court for alleged juror misconduct and a new trial was awarded the plaintiff. In the third trial, the plaintiff obtained a verdict and judgment for $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">On appeal, the defendant attacks the action of the trial court in entering judgment on the third verdict as well as the court\u2019s action in setting aside the second verdict for juror misconduct. The issues relating to the second trial are dispositive of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">Appellee Dennie E. Hulvey sued appellant Caterpillar Tractor Company for injuries received in July 1978 in Fredericksburg. At the time, the plaintiff was operating a forklift truck manufactured by the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the seat-switch mechanism of the truck malfunctioned, causing his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">The second trial concluded on Friday, February 25, 1983, after the jury had deliberated \u201cfour or five\u201d hours. Within the next several days, juror Joy Ann Reges contacted plaintiffs trial attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Subsequently, plaintiffs counsel arranged for a hearing upon a motion to set aside the verdict based on juror misconduct and sent letters to four jurors \u201cinviting\u201d them to attend the hearing. Two jurors, Reges and Patricia O. Most, appeared voluntarily and testified at a hearing held about a month after the trial. A second hearing on the motion to set aside was held four days later. John F. Olmstead, the juror accused of misconduct, testified at the second hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Olmstead was president of a corporation and an attorney at law. He was licensed to practice in the District of Columbia but not in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The jury list showed his occupation only as \u201ccorporate executive.\u201d The fact that he was an attorney did not become known to the trial participants until after the jury had been sworn and the trial progressed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-353 (any error on the \u201ccopy of the jury panel shall not be grounds for a mistrial or assignable as error on appeal, and the parties in the case shall be responsible for verifying the accuracy of such information\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At the hearing, jurors Reges and Most testified that the trial judge admonished the jurors as the case commenced not to discuss the case among themselves until the issues finally had been submitted to them for decision and to consider only information properly received in evidence. Reges stated that, during a recess on the second day of the four-day trial, Olmstead \u201cat one point opened his briefcase and said ... in passing, \u2018What do you think of this?\u2019 and read us something about people who sue for injuries.\u201d The juror testified, \u201cWhat I recall is, I think he quoted a percentage, but he did say what he was reading said that people who sue for injuries were people who didn\u2019t like to work ... I remember it was derogatory toward people who sue for injuries.\u201d When asked the type of publication from which Olmstead was reading, Reges stated, \u201cI remember him saying it was an insurance weekly. It looked like an insurance newsletter.\u201d The juror assumed Olmstead was \u201can insurance salesman\u201d but, she said, \u201cHe told us he was a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Testifying about this incident, juror Most stated there was \u201ca milkman\u201d on the jury who \u201cwas making little remarks, and thought maybe the jury was sort of a kangaroo court. . . .\u201d Most testified that the milkman\u2019s remarks \u201cprompted the other juror, who was a lawyer ... he opened his briefcase and took out something saying something about . . . there are a lot of people that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>like to take a company . . . .\u201d Most testified that she \u201cgot a little bit upset and said something.\u201d The jury foreman, who already had been selected, then indicated the case should not be discussed at that stage of the proceeding. Most believed Olmstead was reading from \u201ca magazine\u201d and that the article to which Olmstead referred was \u201cvery short.\u201d According to Most, Olmstead read the article, \u201ca paragraph or two,\u201d in the presence of all the jurors and returned the publication to his briefcase. Most stated that she thought \u201cit\u201d was \u201cderogatory because we hadn\u2019t come to the conclusion that [the plaintiff] was trying to take the company . . . .\u201d Most testified she said at the time that she \u201cthought the [plaintiff] was a very high principled young man . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">During the hearing, juror Reges described other incidents involving Olmstead. At one point during a recess, she stated, there were a \u201clot of comments\u201d among the jurors about the case and \u201cMr. Olmstead said this is just a lot of garbage and he seemed to not like being here because it took a lot of his time.\u201d She testified, \u201cOne of the jurors . . . said it looked like somebody was going to fatten his pocketbook, and that pretty much started the conversation.\u201d According to Reges, Olmstead said \u201cthat the lawyers are taking a long time. But then we began to talk about the fact of the injury.\u201d She testified, \u201cIt was discussed by several of the jurors whether [the plaintiff] really was in any pain\u201d and that Olmstead and another juror discussed the fact the plaintiff \u201ccould sit there in the chair for a long time\u201d while the jurors found it difficult to sit in the uncomfortable chairs. Reges further testified that, during this general discussion, \u201cMr. Olmstead and another juror talked about the fact that people were suing corporations these days because they thought they could get a lot of money off of them.\u201d Also, Reges testified that, early in the trial, Olmstead \u201cemphatically\u201d said the trial judge was wrong in one of his rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Describing the effect of Olmstead\u2019s conduct, Reges stated she \u201cwould never serve on another jury with a lawyer or with Mr. Olmstead again.\u201d She said she felt that Olmstead\u2019s legal training \u201cgave him an advantage\u201d and that during deliberations \u201che seemed to be so right; not right about what he was saying, but it was just so difficult that I reached the verdict I did in this case.\u201d Responding to a question from the trial judge, Reges stated that her decision in the case was influenced adversely by the conduct she had described.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Also describing the effect of Olmstead\u2019s conduct, Most stated that the foreman of the jury was \u201claid back a little bit\u201d and that Olmstead \u201csort of took over.\u201d Most said that Olmstead \u201chad a firm opinion\u201d and that because he was \u201ca corporation lawyer,\u201d she \u201cwas a little intimidated.\u201d According to Most, \u201cit just seemed like [Olmstead] was taking over the discussions too much,\u201d and that \u201cafter the verdict was in, I had afterthoughts.\u201d According to Most, the matter \u201cwasn\u2019t over\u201d when she was discharged from service on the case because she was \u201cfeeling very unhappy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Both Reges and Most testified, however, that during the four to five hour period of deliberations everyone on the jury fully discussed the issues, expressed opinions, and \u201cspoke what they wanted to say.\u201d In addition, Most testified that Olmstead waited until the other six jurors had given their final views on the case before he expressed his opinions on the decision to be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Testifying during the second day of the post-trial hearings, Olmstead admitted reading to the jury from a publication carried in his briefcase. Olmstead recalled that the incident occurred during final deliberations on the case, when one of the jurors asked why no information on insurance had been presented. According to Olmstead, he responded that the subject of insurance intentionally was kept from the jury because, he said, it would \u201ctaint\u201d the jurors\u2019 views. At that time, Olmstead stated, he took the opportunity to read from \u201cBoard Room Reports,\u201d a business magazine he had possessed but discarded before the hearing, that reported \u201cnegligence suits are up substantially due to the recession.\u201d Olmstead testified he followed that comment with the statement, \u201cisn\u2019t that ironic they\u2019re saying it\u2019s on the rise and look what kind of case we have.\u201d According to Olmstead, there was no further discussion among the jurors on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Olmstead testified that his \u201cgarbage\u201d comment made in the jurors\u2019 presence was directed toward both counsel in the case who, in his opinion, were spending an undue amount of trial time qualifying expert witnesses by delving into every detail of the expert\u2019s professional background. Olmstead stated that the \u201cwhole jury was disgusted\u201d about the length of time counsel were taking with the expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The trial court sustained the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict on two grounds. In a letter opinion, the court stated that \u201cone of the jurors read to the other jurors in the jury room from an article obtained outside of the jury room, and made the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ment to and in the presence of the other jurors: \u2018This is a lot of garbage.\u2019 \u201d In addition, the trial judge noted, \u201cThe Court cannot overlook the testimony of the lady juror that her verdict in this case was not only influenced by the (mis)conduct by the juror, but that had it not have occurred her verdict would have been different.\u201d The court further found that the conduct \u201cprevented both parties from receiving a fair and impartial trial.\u201d Subsequently, the court entered an order setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Recently, we have reviewed settled principles applicable to attacks upon verdicts based on alleged juror misconduct. In <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Moorefield, </em>231 Va. 260, 343 S.E.2d 329 (1986), we noted that every litigant is entitled to a jury composed of individuals who \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358. We said that a motion to set aside a verdict for juror misconduct is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and, unless there has been an abuse of that discretion, the judgment below will not be reversed on appeal, citing <em>Litz </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>151 Va. 363, 375, 144 S.E. 477, 480 (1928). 231 Va. at 265, 343 S.E.2d at 332. We also noted, however, that \u201cneither the sole fact of irregularity nor the mere suspicion of injustice based upon the irregularity is sufficient to warrant setting aside a verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Quoting earlier cases, we pointed out that the orderly administration of justice cannot be annulled by mere suspicion or possible inferences and that avoiding another trial, when the first trial was fair, is of paramount importance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Virginia has been more careful than most states to protect the inviolability and secrecy of jurors\u2019 deliberations. We have adhered strictly to the general rule that the testimony of jurors should not be received to impeach their verdict, especially on the ground of their own misconduct. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>200 Va. 136, 140-41, 104 S.E.2d 765, 767-68 (1958). \u201cA contrary rule would hold out to unsuccessful parties and their friends, the strongest temptation to tamper with jurors after their discharge, and would otherwise be productive of the greatest evils.\u201d <em>Bull\u2019s Case, </em>55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 613, 632 (1857). Moreover, the unanimous verdict is the best evidence of each juror\u2019s opinion of the case. When a juror denies the truth of the verdict and, if the denial be true, the juror \u201cthereby convicts himself of the highest moral, if not legal perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. We have recognized, however, that there may be exceptional cases where juror testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>might be admissible to impeach their verdict to prevent a miscarriage of justice. In such cases, that testimony should be received with great care and caution. <em>Id. </em>at 632. <em>Accord Margiotta </em>v. <em>Aycock, </em>162 Va. 557, 568, 174 S.E. 831, 835 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Turning to the facts of the present case, we note that the defendant has not been consistent during the trial and appellate proceedings in its reliance on the principle that the testimony of these jurors was inadmissible to impeach their verdict. Although this prohibition was asserted in a memorandum of law filed in the trial court after the hearings below, no specific objection on this basis was made before the jurors testified. And, while the issue is mentioned in defendant\u2019s appellate briefs, its main argument is that the conduct complained of was not a sufficient ground for granting a new trial. Therefore, we will assume, without deciding, that this is one of those exceptional cases in which juror testimony is admissible in support of a motion to set aside the verdict for alleged juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Nevertheless, and because such testimony is to be received with great care and caution, we hold that the evidence fails to support a finding of juror misconduct sufficient to warrant setting aside the verdict and that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling to the contrary. Generally, we have limited findings of prejudicial juror misconduct to activities of jurors that occur outside the jury room. For example, the rule has been applied to expressions of opinion made by a juror to third persons during trial proceedings. <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 325, 329 S.E.2d 17 (1985). In most cases, misconduct outside the jury room has prejudicially affected the jury\u2019s deliberation of the case by injecting facts connected with the case which had not been admitted in evidence. For example, the rule has been applied to an improper jury view, <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>203 Va. 965, 128 S.E.2d 281 (1962); <em>Kearns </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>197 Va. 736, 91 S.E.2d 648 (1956); <em>Crockett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 687, 47 S.E.2d 377 (1948); and <em>Litz </em>v. <em>Harman, supra; </em>and to unauthorized private conversations between jurors and third persons, <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Tractor Company, </em>202 Va. 958, 121 S.E.2d 471 (1961); <em>Dozier </em>v. <em>Morrisette, </em>198 Va. 37, 92 S.E.2d 366 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In the present case, the trial court focused upon the publication read by Olmstead and upon his \u201cgarbage\u201d comment as the bases for setting aside the verdict. That alleged misconduct, however, occurred within the confines of the jury room and did not involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>procurement outside the jury room of specific facts <em>about the case </em>which later were injected into the deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The extraneous news from the publication about the proliferation of damage suits against corporations was nothing more than a reference to information which every individual acquires in his or her everyday experiences. One is naive who labors under the impression that jurors of today are not aware of the proliferation of lawsuits generally and damage suits against corporations specifically. As the evidence demonstrates, many of the jurors, not just Olmstead, discussed whether \u201csomebody was going to fatten his pocketbook\u201d and generally talked about insurance coverage. While such topics are irrelevant to the legal issues in a damage suit, we are convinced that the evil which would result from overturning verdicts based on post-trial disclosure of every irrelevant comment or discussion which occurred during jury deliberations would be more detrimental to the administration of justice than the harm which may possibly result from permitting robust, wide-ranging discussions in the jury room to proceed in an unrestrained manner. Indeed, the evidence here fails to show that the information contained in the publication alone caused any juror to vote for a defendant\u2019s verdict. Rather, Olmstead\u2019s entire \u201cconduct\u201d swayed the two jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">This case is similar factually to <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>another damage suit. There, jurors discussed during deliberations whether defendant carried liability insurance and the extent of the insurance coverage. Some jurors assumed defendant carried insurance. A juror knew defendant\u2019s attorney was an \u201cinsurance lawyer\u201d and two jurors stated that the matter of insurance influenced them in their individual decisions about the case. The trial court set the verdict aside for juror misconduct and this Court reversed, reinstating the verdict. Pointing out that the public and jurors now are conscious of the part insurance plays in damage-suit litigation, we noted \u201cthat such jurors often take that circumstance into consideration to some degree in their deliberations on what damages shall be awarded.\u201d 200 Va. at 143, 104 S.E.2d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The \u201cgarbage\u201d comment, directed to dilatory trial tactics of counsel, and other statements by Olmstead, such as his disagreement with a ruling of the trial judge, were nothing more than the expressions of an opinionated, forceful juror. Under the guise of policing verdicts, we will not encourage trial courts to sift through jury debates to ferret out seemingly derogatory references gleaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>from the whole deliberative process. In many cases, heated debates involving sharp exchanges occur during the process of reaching verdicts. This case was no exception because not only were there statements derogatory to the plaintiff, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cpeople who sue for injuries [are] people who [don\u2019t] like to work,\u201d there also were comments which showed a bias in favor of the plaintiff, <em>e.g., </em>one juror thought plaintiff was \u201ca very high principled young man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Viewed as a whole, the evidence discloses a situation where two jurors were influenced by the opinions of a third, dominant juror who was an attorney, a status which may have rendered him exempt from jury service, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-341(5) (exempts \u201c[licensed practicing attorneys\u201d), but which did not make him incompetent to serve. Having been \u201ca little intimidated\u201d because Olmstead seemed to have an \u201cadvantage\u201d during debate, the complaining jurors had \u201cafterthoughts\u201d and left the case \u201cfeeling very unhappy.\u201d In fact, one juror would not have agreed to the verdict but for the conduct of Olmstead. After the case had terminated, these two jurors assisted the losing party in an effort to annul the verdict by giving testimony which repudiated the jurors\u2019 own conduct in agreeing to the verdict at the time it was rendered. This effort at impeachment has been mounted even though the jury deliberated four to five hours during which, according to the uncontradicted evidence, every juror participated in a full discussion of the issues, expressed opinions, and \u201cspoke what they wanted to say.\u201d Such circumstances do not justify nullification of this verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Consequently, the judgment appealed from rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the third verdict will be reversed, the verdict returned in the second trial will be reinstated, and judgment will be entered here on that verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
