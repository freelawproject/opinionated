The district court denied the requested relief and the plaintiffs appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">On February 1, 1977, the plaintiffs brought this action against various state and federal officers and departments charged with administering the Medicaid program in the State of Alabama. They charged that the reimbursement rate ceilings then in effect<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> failed to provide reimbursement \u201con a reasonable cost related basis\u201d as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). The state officials did not dispute that the reimbursement methodology was not made on a reasonable cost related basis. Rather, they contended the reimbursement rate ceilings were made necessary by the failure of the state legislature to appropriate sufficient funds to pay for the increase in expenditures that would result if rates were set on such a basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">The case was submitted to Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the federal defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and the state defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a memorandum opinion dated July 12, 1977, Judge Johnson determined that the payment methodology utilized by the State of Alabama violated \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). <em>Alabama Nursing Home Ass\u2019n v. Califano, </em>433 F.Supp. 1325 (M.D.Ala.1977). In an order dated July 12,1977, Judge Johnson enjoined the state officials from failing to submit to HEW<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> within sixty days a plan complying with the requirements of \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and from failing to implement the plan once it was approved by HEW.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">On June 28, 1977, state officials notified all Medicaid provider institutions of the state\u2019s intention to impose a ten percent reduction in Medicaid payments for services rendered in August and September, 1977. On September 7, 1977, the plaintiffs filed a motion for supplemental relief in this action, seeking to enjoin the reduction in payments as violative of Judge Johnson\u2019s July 12, 1977, order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This motion for supplemental relief was submitted to Judge Robert E. Varner, who determined that the July 12, 1977, order did not bar the ten percent reduction in Medicaid payments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The sole issue presented for review is whether Judge Johnson\u2019s July 12, 1977, order bars the imposition of the ten percent reduction in Medicaid reimbursement payments. Counsel for the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that any other claims the plaintiffs might have to the funds withheld in August and September, 1977, are barred by the eleventh amendment. <em>See Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 97 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The plaintiffs argue that the ten percent cutback violates the July 12, 1977, order first, because the state based the reduction solely on budgetary considerations, and second, because the reduction, like the underlying reimbursement ceiling, was not made on a reasonable cost related basis. The plaintiffs correctly note that Judge Johnson rejected budgetary considerations as an excuse for failing to comply with federal Medicaid standards. <em>Alabama Nursing Home Ass\u2019n v. Califano, </em>433 F.Supp. at 1330. They also correctly note that Judge Johnson found that the state\u2019s practice of reimbursing nursing homes on something other than a reasonable cost related basis violated \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). <em>Id. </em>at 1331. <em>See </em>note 6, <em>supra. </em>However, the plaintiffs fail to note the precise, pragmatic remedy afforded by Judge Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Every order granting an injunction must be specific in its terms and must describe in reasonable detail the act or acts that are enjoined. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). This requirement of specificity and reasonable detail, based in part on notions of basic fairness, ensures that individuals against whom an injunction is directed receive explicit notice of the precise conduct that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>outlawed. <em>Marshall v. United States, </em>414 U.S. 473, 476, 94 S.Ct. 713, 715, 38 L.Ed.2d 661, 664 (1974); <em>Gunn v. University Committee to End the War in Viet Nam, </em>399 U.S. 383, 388-89, 90 S.Ct. 2013, 2016-17, 26 L.Ed.2d 684, 688 (1970); <em>Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 64, 74-76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 207-08, 19 L.Ed.2d 236, 244-45 (1967). In determining whether a particular act falls within the scope of an injunction\u2019s prohibition, particular emphasis must be given to the express terms of the order. An injunction does not prohibit those acts that are not within its terms as reasonably construed. <em>Sierra Club v. Callaway, </em>499 F.2d 982, 991 (5th Cir. 1974). Great deference is due the interpretation placed on the terms of an injunctive order by the court who issued and must enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The July 12, 1977, order granted a prospective remedy. Although recognizing that the reimbursement rate ceilings then in effect violated \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E), the order did not require the immediate implementation of a conforming plan. Rather, it expressly provided for a sixty-day period during which the state officials were to formulate and submit to HEW a reimbursement methodology that complied with \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). The order required immediate implementation of reasonable cost related payments only after the state officials secured final HEW approval of a conforming plan. The July 12, 1977, order clearly contemplated that reimbursement payments made during this interim period would not comply with \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The terms of the injunction when reasonably construed do not prohibit the ten percent reduction in Medicaid reimbursement rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">.

Provider institutions received reimbursement on a per patient, per day rate. The rate of reimbursement could not exceed an absolute ceiling regardless of the institution\u2019s costs. At the time this action was initiated, a skilled nursing facility could receive a maximum of $21.50 per patient, per day, while an intermediate care facility could receive a maximum Of $19.35 per patient, per day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">. The district court treated this rule 12 motion to dismiss as a rule 56 motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b450-20\">. Congress redesignated the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as the Department of Health and Human Services. <em>See </em>Department of Education Organization Act, \u00a7 509, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 3508. All agency acts relevant to this appeal predated the redesignation.

After denying the motions of the state and federal defendants, the order granted the following relief to the plaintiffs:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">1. The class of all skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities located in Alabama which are provider institutions under the Medicaid Program be and is hereby certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">2.

The practice of the defendant state officials of paying plaintiff nursing homes under the Medicaid Program on something other than a cost related basis, and specifically of imposing a ceiling on payment rates which is not reasonably cost related, be and is hereby declared to be a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">4.

Counsel for the plaintiffs and counsel for the state officials advise both in their briefs and at oral argument that, during a June 23, 1977, conference, Judge Johnson was made aware of the state\u2019s intention to impose the ten percent reduction in Medicaid reimbursement payments yet declined to address the issue directly until it was properly before him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-17\">. Judge Varner additionally determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for supplemental relief was an effort to circumvent Fed.R.Civ.P. 4, 59(e).
