The company, Daniels Sales Company, was owned and operated by Daniels as a sole proprietorship. In the early years of his business, Daniels kept the company\u2019s records without the aid of a bookkeeper. In 1965 or 1966, however, he was advised by the state Workman\u2019s Compensation Department to employ a bookkeeper in order to better maintain the company\u2019s records. Accordingly, Daniels hired the Benjamin Tot-ten Accounting Office to keep his books and to prepare his tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In December 1974, the Internal Revenue Service began an audit of Daniels\u2019 1973 tax return. The IRS noticed that Daniels was spending large amounts of cash. When examination of the source and application of his funds as reported in his 1973 tax return could not be reconciled with the amount of cash spent by Daniels in that year, the IRS expanded its audit to include Daniels\u2019 tax liability for 1972 and 1974, as well as 1973. The same discrepancy between reported income and cash outlay appeared for the additional tax years, and the inquiry into Daniels\u2019 taxes was referred to the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS. Daniels was indicted by a grand jury on March 13, 1978, and charged under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 (1974) with three counts of willful and knowing income tax evasion by filing false and fraudulent tax returns for the years 1972-74. Tried by a jury, he was convicted of each count. Daniels now appeals his conviction, contending that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he acted willfully in understating his income and tax liability and that in any event he was entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor made what Daniels claims were improper and highly prejudicial comments in his closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Daniels has not disputed that he understated his taxable income and concomitant tax liability for 1972-74 in the amounts asserted by the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, he claims that his tax evasion was not willful because in filing his returns he relied upon the accounting system organized by his bookkeeper to establish correctly his net income and was too ignorant of accounting practices to realize that the accounting system was inadequate to reflect his true business earnings. The bookkeeping system required Daniels to report his total sales and costs to the Benjamin Totten Accounting Office. By agreement between Totten and Daniels, sales were determined by figures recorded in the company\u2019s \u201cload-out sheets,\u201d which registered the products loaded into trucks at the company warehouse for delivery to retail stores. Costs were determined by the price of goods stated in the Frito-Lay delivery invoices. When the accounting system was instituted, the net cost of goods sold was accurately expressed in the delivery invoice statements. However, within a few years, Frito-Lay began giving Daniels a rebate on his cost of the products. Frito-Lay also began providing Daniels with bonuses and promotional funds. Although the rebates decreased Daniels\u2019 gross costs and thus made the delivery invoice figures inaccurate representations of his net costs, he processed the rebates through a \u201cclearing account\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>rate from the company\u2019s \u201cbusiness account\u201d and did not report them to his accountant. Similarly, Daniels processed the bonuses and promotional grants through the clearing account and failed to report these items as income to his bookkeeper. The figures derived from the accounting procedures further understated Daniels\u2019 income because the \u201cload-out\u201d figures did not correspond to the company\u2019s total sales, since some sales transactions were made directly at the warehouse and were not recorded for delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">To sustain Daniels\u2019 conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 (1974) for the felony of willful tax evasion, the government must have established beyond a reasonable doubt that Daniels acted willfully and knowingly with specific intent to evade his income tax obligation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such willfulness is demonstrated by proof of conscious, deliberate, purposeful acts, rather than negligent, unconscious, or mistaken conduct in failing to pay taxes owed. <em>See Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 139, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954) (construing \u201cwillfulness\u201d requirement of \u00a7 145 of the Revenue Act of 1936, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b) (1939), which contained provisions similar to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201 (1974)); <em>Spies v.

Proof of \u201crepetitious conduct [is] admissible for the limited purpose of showing the intent of the appellant where, otherwise it might be claimed that the acts in the tax years were either inadvertent or innocent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Viewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), and making \u201call reasonable inferences and credibility choices ... in favor of the jury,\u201d <em>United States v. Prout, </em>526 F.2d 380, 384 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>see United States v. Black, </em>497 F.2d 1039, 1041 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>438 F.2d 858, 867 (5th Cir. 1971), we conclude that \u201ca reasonably minded jury could determine that the evidence was adequate and sufficient to support the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>592 F.2d 1325, 1328 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>See Glasser v. United States, supra, </em>315 U.S. at 62, 62 S.Ct. at 461. The government introduced evidence that Daniels understated his taxable income and tax liability substantially for the years in question. The magnitude of his error in reporting only $25,026 in taxable income for 1972, $16,046 for 1973, and $21,910 for 1974, when admittedly he had earned $62,905, $52,901, and $76,168, respectively, for those years itself tends to support a finding of willfulness. <em>See, e. g., Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. at 139, 75 S.Ct. at 137 (while willfulness \u201ccannot be inferred from the mere understatement of income . evidence of a consistent pattern of [understating] <em>large </em>amounts of income, and of the failure on petitioners\u2019 part to include all of their income in their books and records . could . . . [support] an inference of willfulness.\u201d); <em>United States v. Schechter, </em>475 F.2d at 1101; <em>United States v. Tunnell, </em>481 F.2d at 152. The consistency of the taxpayer\u2019s practice of understating his income may also establish the essential inference of willful intent. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>348 U.S. at 139, 75 S.Ct. at 147; <em>United States v. Rischard, </em>471 F.2d 105, 107 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">It is also telling that Daniels understated his sales for the taxable years in question by failing to reveal to his accountant or to report to the government sales he made directly from the warehouse. Indeed, the bookkeeping system was dependent upon Daniels\u2019 submitting the correct figures for monthly sales and purchases to his bookkeeper, and the major portion of his understatement of taxable income appears to stem from the omission of the warehouse sales from his figures summarizing total sales, which were based on load-out. This error does not involve the accounting system\u2019s failure to include clearing account transactions but rather can be attributed solely to false input by Daniels. By submitting to his accountant summary sheets substantially understating his sales rather than providing the original records of all sales transactions, Daniels withheld material information from his own bookkeepers. Such conduct has often been recognized as probative of an intent to evade and defeat tax liability. <em>See, e. g., Spies v. United States, </em>317 U.S. at 499, 63 S.Ct. at 368; <em>United States v. Slutsky, </em>487 F.2d at 844; <em>United States v. Scher, </em>476 F.2d 319, 322-24 (7th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Frank, </em>437 F.2d 452, 453 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 974, 91 S.Ct. 1661, 29 L.Ed.2d 139 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Most significantly, the evidence established that Daniels, an experienced and successful businessman, kept records in which he computed the net cost of all goods sold through both load-out and truck delivery and through direct warehouse sales. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>net cost figures, which Daniels regularly submitted to Frito-Lay with his payment for the products supplied by that company, correctly stated his actual cost by factoring Frito-Lay\u2019s rebates, bonuses, and promotional funds into the amount owed for goods purchased. Thus, Daniels in effect maintained a double set of records and submitted only the one containing inaccurately high cost figures and incorrectly low sales figures to his accountants for tax purposes. This behavior, which refutes Daniels\u2019 claim that he knew nothing of accounting procedures, is particularly persuasive evidence of the taxpayer\u2019s willful intent to evade his tax liability. <em>See, e. g., Spies v. United States, </em>317 U.S. at 499, 63 S.Ct. 368; <em>United States v. Slutsky, </em>487 F.2d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Finally, there is evidence that the defendant was spending large amounts of cash during the tax years here in question that could not be reconciled with the amount of income he reported in his tax returns. This conduct, too, supports a reasonable inference that Daniels was aware of the extent of his earnings and knowingly and willfully sought to evade taxes by falsely understating his taxable income. We therefore cannot overturn Daniels\u2019 conviction for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We also find meritless Daniels\u2019 contention that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor made improper and highly prejudicial remarks. Defense counsel had asserted in his closing argument to the jury that Daniels had cooperated with the government and that his cooperation was proof that he had not willfully violated the tax laws. In his closing statement, the prosecutor noted that Daniels had not been fully cooperative with the government during the IRS investigation and had in fact resisted disclosure of certain documents until forced to relinquish them by a summons proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon defendant\u2019s objection, the judge directed the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s comments and excluded Exhibit No. 39 from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper, although they were not precisely accurate. It was not technically true that it had been necessary for the government to obtain a court order compelling the <em>defendant </em>to release his records. The contested documents had been in the possession of Daniels\u2019 accountant, who had refused to give them to the IRS. The legal proceedings for their production, to which the prosecutor referred, had been directed against the bookkeeper, not Daniels. However, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was substantially correct in characterizing the defendant as uncooperative and the legal proceeding as compelling disclosure of his records, for Daniels had intervened in the legal proceeding against his accountant in order to prevent enforcement of the IRS summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were permissible means of factually rebutting the defendant\u2019s attempt to create the impression before the jury that he had cooperated with the IRS when in fact he had not fully done so. They were fair comments. The defendant had opened the door to comment on the issue of his cooperation, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement fell within the doctrine of fair reply. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619-20 &amp; n.11, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245 &amp; n.11, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (\u201cPost-arrest silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version on arrest . to challenge the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his behavior following arrest.\u201d); <em>United States v. Alston, </em>609 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. 1980) (cross examination of accused concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>his post-arrest silence is not improper where accused had given testimony on direct that was intended to create the impression that he had cooperated fully in an investigation of the crime); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>593 F.2d 626, 630 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Houde, </em>596 F.2d 696, 703-04 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Hiett, </em>581 F.2d 1199, 1204 (5th Cir. 1978). The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, therefore, does not provide grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\">. Daniels paid taxes of $6,442 on reported income of $25,026 for 1972, $4,249 on reported income of $16,046 for 1973, and $5,843 on reported income of $21,910 for 1974. In fact, he owed taxes of $18,997 on taxable income of $62,905, $18,950 on taxable income of $52,310, and $33,409 on taxable income of $76,168 for the years 1972, 1973, and 1974, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\">. Daniels established the separate \u201cclearing account\u201d with his accountant\u2019s knowledge. The account was intended to accommodate Frito-Lay\u2019s practice of accepting charge slips from retail customers as payment from its wholesale distributor, Daniels, in order to avoid duplication when tabulating Daniels\u2019 income. Daniels would deliver products to a retail outlet. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>retail grocer would then give him a charge slip for the wholesale cost of the items delivered. Daniels would not collect this money from the retailer. Instead, he would send the slips to Frito-Lay as part of the payment of the amount he owed for the goods he had purchased. Frito-Lay would credit Daniels for the amount indicated by the charge slips and would collect the money directly from the retailers. When the amount Frito-Lay collected from the retailers exceeded the cost of the articles purchased by Daniels for a given period, Frito-Lay would send Daniels a check for the difference. This money, rather than the amount indicated by the charge slips, was the income considered by the accountant. Daniels\u2019 accountant testified that when the \u201cclearing account\u201d was established, Daniels did not receive rebates, bonuses, or promotional funds from Frito-Lay. Daniels never informed his accountant of these additional sources of income, and hence the accountant remained unaware that the \u201cclearing account\u201d had come to involve these income-producing transactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-11\">. The other elements of the \u00a7 7201 offense that the government must prove are the existence of a tax deficiency and an affirmative act constituting evasion or attempted evasion of the tax due. <em>Sansone v.
