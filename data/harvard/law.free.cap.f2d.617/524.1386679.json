The sole issue on appeal is whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-115 bars the district court from enjoining the picketing by a union of an employer who is also subject to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Company, a Delaware corporation, operates an air freight pickup and distribution station in South San Francisco. It is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with Teamster Local # 85 (hereinafter \u201cLocal 85\u201d) or with any other labor organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Beginning on January 15, 1979, members of Local 85 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> picketed the Company\u2019s South San Francisco facility with signs reading in part: \u201cNotice to Public \u2014 the employees of Federal Express work at less than wages and labor standards averaged for the community. Teamsters Local 85.\u201d The picketing continued on various dates through the end of March.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The Company applied on March 22, 1979 for a preliminary injunction prohibiting all picketing at the facility. At the hearing held on March 30, 1979, the district court denied the Company\u2019s application and rejected the Company\u2019s offer to present testimony. The district court found that while Local 85 had conceded that the Company\u2019s South San Francisco facility was covered by the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Norris-LaGuar-dia Act nonetheless applied to the Company\u2019s claim and the court was therefore without jurisdiction to grant the application for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">The order denying the Company\u2019s application was entered on April 10, 1979. The district court on the same date also denied the Company\u2019s oral motion for an injunction pending appeal. This appeal from these two orders followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">We affirm both orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">Section 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(e) and (f), prohibits a court from issuing an injunction to prohibit any person from publicizing a labor dispute by any method not involving fraud or violence or to prohibit any person from assembling peacefully in promotion of his interests in a labor dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107, provides that courts are without jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief unless a hearing is conducted and specific findings of fact are made by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-18\">(1) That unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained, or have been committed and will be continued unless restrained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-19\">(2) That substantial and irreparable injury to complainant\u2019s property will follow;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-20\">(3) That as to each item of relief granted greater injury will be inflicted upon complainant by the denial of relief than will be inflicted upon defendants by the granting of relief;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-21\">(4) That complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>(5) That the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant\u2019s property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Court has held that the NorrisLaGuardia Act is no bar to an injunction in a case for which the RLA provides the process for final decision. <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago R. &amp; I. R. Co., </em>353 U.S. 30, 42, 77 S.Ct. 635, 641, 1 L.Ed.2d 622 (1957). When no specific legal command of the RLA is violated, however, the Norris-LaGuardia Act generally deprives the courts of jurisdiction to enter injunctions. <em>See Order of Railroad Telegraphers </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co., </em>362 U.S. 330, 342, 80 S.Ct. 761, 767, 4 L.Ed.2d 774 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Second Circuit noted in <em>Pan American World Airways v. Flight Eng. Intern. Assoc., </em>306 F.2d 840, 846-47 (2d Cir. 1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">Much has been written on the \u201caccommodation\u201d of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to the Railway Labor Act, but the difficulties of \u201caccommodation\u201d arise only in connection with the compulsions of the Railway Labor Act. Where that Act prohibits (or directs) certain conduct and the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids an injunction, the contradiction between the two Acts must be reconciled, [citations omitted] But where no compulsion exists under the Railway Labor Act, because its procedures have been exhausted, there can be no question of \u201caccommodation.\u201d The limitations of the Norris-LaGuardia Act are plainly applicable, [citations omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Thus, while federal courts may issue injunctions in labor disputes to compel the parties to fulfill their obligations under the RLA, when no such duties exist, the Norris-LaGuardia Act controls.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Buffalo Forge Co. v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>428 U.S. 397, 420, 96 S.Ct. 3141, 3153, 49 L.Ed.2d 1022 (1976), Stevens, J. dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">In the instant case, neither party has pointed to any procedure of the RLA which Local 85 has failed to follow, nor can we find any. The RLA mechanisms relate to disputes between employers and employees or disputes among employees as to representation. The union in this case does not purport to represent any employees, and thus there is no procedure for this dispute under the RLA. In such a circumstance, the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act plainly apply. Although the Norris-LaG-uardia Act does confer jurisdiction to issue injunctions in certain very limited circumstances, the Company has made no allegations of any activity rising to the level of such enjoinable conduct. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. The district court was thus correct in denying the Company\u2019s applications for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">.

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>\u2014 F.2d \u2014, No. 77-3362 (9th Cir. 1980), this court held that a contract provision by which the unions agreed not to strike military flights, even after RLA dispute mechanisms had been exhausted, was not enforceable by injunctive relief:</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">\u201cAbsent a substantial nexus with statutory dispute settlement mechanisms or an agreement to arbitrate, an injunction may not issue to prevent a plain breach of a no-strike clause by a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">sfc &gt;(: * $</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We do not think <em>Chicago &amp; N.

Similarly, this court stated in <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. v.

In neither case did this court authorize an injunction, however, but rather found that the activities were not covered by the Railway Labor Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
