Jones, United States District Judge for the District of Maryland, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1125-5\">HAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Pridgen, the Sheriff of Wilson County, North Carolina, was convicted of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>by arranging for the payment of bribes in return for protecting houses of prostitution from criminal investigation. He was also convicted, together with Baker, the operator of one of the houses of prostitution, of conspiring to violate the RICO legislation. In addition, Pridgen was found guilty of six violations of the federal tax laws. Pridgen and Baker appealed, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">The statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), makes it unlawful for persons associated with an \u201centerprise\u201d affecting interstate commerce to conduct its affairs through a pattern of racketeering. \u201cEnterprise\u201d is defined at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4) as including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzJ\">any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">Defendants\u2019 principal contention is that this definition was not meant to include a public entity such as the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The overwhelming weight of authority, however, supports a contrary conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the sole case cited for support of defendants\u2019 position is <em>United States v. Mandel, </em>415 F.Supp. 997 (D.Md.1976), which held that the state of Maryland was not an enterprise under RICO. The court in that case determined that the overriding concern of the RICO legislation was to combat the infiltration of organized crime into private commercial life. While the correctness of that court\u2019s holding is not before us, since this case does not address the status of a state under RICO, we are constrained to disagree with the <em>Mandel </em>court\u2019s implication that all public entities are beyond the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-10\">On its face, the definition contained in \u00a7 1961(4) makes no differentiation between public and private individuals, entities or groups. Under its terms, the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s Department clearly qualifies as either a \u201clegal entity\u201d or a \u201cgroup of individuals associated in fact.\u201d Nothing in the legislative history counsels that the statute was intended to apply only to private enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">The legislative history makes it quite clear that Congress intended RICO to be a potent tool in halting the infiltration of organized crime into the American economy. As the Third Circuit has noted, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to exclude from protection that large portion of the economy made up of transactions by public agencies. <em>United States v. Frumento, supra, </em>note 1, 563 F.2d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-12\">Moreover, Congress made the specific finding that organized crime threatened to \u201csubvert and corrupt our democratic processes.\u201d We think that this finding evinces a concern with the infiltration of organized crime into the public sector. Finding nothing to the contrary in either the legislative history or the statute, we hold that the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s Department is an \u201centerprise\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-13\">We have examined each of the defendants\u2019 remaining contentions, and find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">. <em>See United States v. Grzywacz, </em>603 F.2d 682 (7th Cir. 1979) (city police department is an enterprise under RICO); <em>United States v.
