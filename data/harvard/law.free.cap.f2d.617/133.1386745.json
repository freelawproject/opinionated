HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">Jefferson Pilot Broadcasting Co. [Pilot], appellee, contracted with Hilary &amp; Hogan, Inc. [Hilary] to produce a television commercial. Pilot fully performed; Hilary accepted Pilot\u2019s performance and promptly became insolvent. Unpaid, Pilot brought suit in diversity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) (1976), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>against both Hilary and its two officer-shareholders, Messrs. J. Hilary Cox and J. Dan Hogan. The district court entered judgment for the contract price against all three defendants, thereby \u201cpiercing\u201d the individual defendants\u2019 corporate \u201cveil.\u201d <em>Jefferson Pilot Broadcasting Co. v. Hilary &amp; Hogan, Inc., </em>No. 78-28-N (M.D.Ala., filed Aug. 10, 1978) (F. Johnson, J.). Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">As at trial, appellants do not dispute that Hilary owes Pilot the damages sought. Appellants\u2019 sole defenses have been and are that (1) Pilot, as an unqualified foreign corporate plaintiff, was barred from bringing suit in Alabama; and that (2) in any event, Pilot has no claim against Hilary\u2019s officer-shareholders. We shall treat these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Appellants\u2019 first defense derives from Ala.Code \u00a7 10-2-254 (Michie 1977), which renders \u201cvoid\u201d all \u201ccontracts . made or entered into in this state by foreign corporate] [plaintiffs] which have not qualified to do business in this state.\u201d This statute concededly comprises part of the \u201csubstantive\u201d law that we must apply. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652 (1976). <em>See Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., </em>337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524 (1949); <em>Associates Capital Services Corp. v. Loftin\u2019s Transfer &amp; Storage Co., </em>554 F.2d 188 (5th Cir. 1977) (per curiam). The cited provision is, however, inapposite here because the subject contract unquestionably was \u201cmade\u201d in North Carolina. Tr. 12. <em>See Lee v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., </em>465 F.2d 1132 (5th Cir. 1972). Appellants argue alternatively that, apart from the statute, Alabama \u201cpublic policy\u201d precludes enforcement of Pilot\u2019s claim since <em>part </em>of the work was performed in Alabama. Here again, recognizing that the forum state\u2019s \u201cpublic policy\u201d forms part of the applicable \u201csubstantive\u201d law in diversity cases, <em>see Angel </em>v. <em>Bullington, </em>330 U.S. 183, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947); <em>Richland Development Co. v. Staples, </em>295 F.2d 122 (5th Cir. 1961), the proferred \u201cpolicy\u201d is inapposite here. \u201c[Contracts made by foreign corporations without the State of Alabama and which are not to be performed <em>wholly </em>within the state are not affected by the failure of such corporation to [qualify] . .\u201d <em>Franklin Life Insurance Co. v. Ward, </em>237 Ala. 474, 187 So. 462 (1939) (emphasis added). We hold, as a matter of Alabama state law, that Pilot\u2019s status as an unqualified foreign corporate plaintiff poses no bar to its maintenance of the instant lawsuit. This conclusion naturally pretermits consideration of any supposed burden on interstate commerce. <em>Compare Allenberg Cotton Co. v. Pittman, </em>419 U.S. 20, 95 S.Ct. 260, 42 L.Ed.2d 195 (1974); <em>Foxco Industries, Ltd. v. Fabric World, Inc., </em>595 F.2d 976 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Appellants\u2019 second line of defense is that Pilot may look solely to Hilary for payment of its claim. The question is whether the district court properly \u201cpierced\u201d the individual defendants\u2019 corporate \u201cveil.\u201d The parties have, we think correctly (if fortuitously so), assumed that Alabama law controls this question. As in all diversity cases, we are bound by the forum state\u2019s choice-of-law rules. <em>See Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). Alabama continues to follow a jurisdiction selecting approach to choice-of-law, <em>see Griese-Traylor Corp. v. First National Bank, </em>572 F.2d 1039 (5th Cir. 1978), which was the methodology employed in the Restatement of Conflict of Laws (1934). In the absence of precedent, as here, the first Restatement provides a reasonably reliable basis for hypothesizing which law Alabama courts would choose. Consistently with the first Restatement, we think that Alabama courts would look to the law of the incorporating state \u2014 here Alabama \u2014 in deciding whether to recognize or disregard a corporate entity. <em>See </em>Restatement of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 154, Comment a (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Under Alabama law, \u201c[i]n order for a corporation to be accorded treatment as a separate legal entity, it must exist and function as such .... A court of equity looks through form to substance.\u201d <em>Lyons v. Lyons, </em>340 So.2d 450, 451 (Ala.Civ.App.1976). But while \u201csubstance\u201d is thus essential to corporate status, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>assure it. \u201cThe fiction of the corporate entity was not created to promote injustice and protect its owner[s] from payment of just obligations.\u201d <em>Tri-State Building Corp. v. Moore-Handley, Inc., </em>333 So.2d 840, 841 (Ala.Civ.App.1976). Individual liability will be imposed when, through \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201cmanipulation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 842, \u201cthe corporate form is . used to <em>evade </em>personal responsibility.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Williams, </em>294 Ala. 417, 318 So.2d 279, 281 (1975) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Within the preceding legal framework, the district court properly entered judgment against appellant Cox. Hilary\u2019s present insolvency stems largely from self-dealing transactions in which Cox, Hilary\u2019s president and majority shareholder, caused Hilary gratuitously to \u201cloan\u201d tens of thousands of dollars to Cox\u2019s wholly owned corporation, Hilary Productions, Inc. [HP]. Although carried on Hilary\u2019s books as assets, the HP \u201cloans\u201d never had any prospect of repayment. Cox had contributed HP\u2019s clients as consideration for his Hilary shares; HP\u2019s continued existence ostensibly was to serve Hilary\u2019s in-house production needs. But for all of Hilary\u2019s capital \u201ctransfusions,\u201d the record fails to disclose any product or value delivered from HP to Hilary, or indeed that HP was anything other than a defunct shell. The \u201cloans\u201d constituted, in substance, asset transfers from Hilary to HP, reflecting the grossest of interest conflicts and apparent breaches of fiduciary duty. Their effect was to render Hilary effectively judgment proof, denuding it of assets while HP\u2019s debts \u2014 many of which Cox personally guaranteed \u2014 were paid. In these circumstances, we have no trouble finding that Cox manipulated Hilary\u2019s corporate form so as to evade its just debts, sufficient in equity to hold him personally accountable to Pilot here. <em>Cf. Cohen v. Williams, </em>294 Ala. 417, 318 So.2d 279 (1975) (personal liability sustained where corporation dissolved for purpose of avoiding judgment debt).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We feel considerably different, however, about appellant Hogan. He had no responsibility for Hilary\u2019s financial affairs. The record does not reflect that he knew of the HP \u201cloans\u201d or in any way benefited by them. Unlike Cox, who contributed no money for his Hilary shares, Hogan here stands to lose his entire capital contribution of some $20,000. Although represented before us by a single attorney, it is apparent that Hogan\u2019s interests diverge substantially from Cox\u2019s. In any event, the record contains no evidence that Hogan abused or manipulated Hilary\u2019s form, and we reverse that portion of judgment that holds him personally liable to Pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
