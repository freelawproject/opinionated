On June 18, 1979, protests were filed by Georgia Power Company and Southern Company Services (\u201cGeorgia Power\u201d). The protests alleged that the proposed rates were unreasonably high and requested that the Commission suspend and investigate the tariff under \u00a7 10707. The Commission\u2019s Suspension Board considered the protests in the first instance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a decision served on June 29, 1979 (the day before the rates were to become effective), the Suspension Board ordered that the rates be investigated and their effectiveness suspended until January 29, 1980. Southern sought reconsideration of the Suspension Board\u2019s action. In an order served on August 23, 1979, Division 1 of the Commission, acting in its appellate capacity, vacated the Board\u2019s decision to suspend and investigate. Division 1 gave two reasons for its decision. First, finding that \u201cmarket dominance does not exist because there is effective intra-modal competition,\u201d it concluded that \u201cthe Commission has no jurisdiction to find that these rates are unreasonably high.\u201d Second, it found that Georgia Power had not shown that it was likely to prevail on the merits because \u201c[t]he rates at issue do not appear unreasonable . . .\u201d In a decision served on October 19, 1979, the full Commission denied Georgia Power\u2019s petition for reconsideration and stay of Division l\u2019s order. Georgia Power seeks an order from this Court \u201csetting aside the Commission\u2019s finding that market dominance does not exist and the Commission\u2019s conclusion that it did not have jurisdiction and directing the Commission to make a proper determination with respect to market dominance.\u201d Brief of Petitioners at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">Only last term, the Supreme Court made it absolutely clear that an ICC decision declining to commence a \u00a7 10707 investigation is not subject to judicial review. <em>Southern Railway Co. v. Seaboard Allied Milling Corp., </em>442 U.S. 444, 99 S.Ct. 2388, 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1017 (1979). <em>Seaboard </em>also reaffirmed the Court\u2019s prior holdings that the merits of an ICC suspension decision are likewise unreviewable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 2396-97. <em>See also United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973); <em>Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R. Co., </em>372 U.S. 658, 83 S.Ct. 984, 10 L.Ed.2d 52 (1963); <em>Lone Star Steel Co. v. United States, </em>600 F.2d 492 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Georgia Power seeks to avoid the import of <em>Seaboard </em>in two ways. First, it argues that although the decision not to suspend and investigate is unreviewable, the finding of no market dominance is reviewable because it is a \u201cfinal\u201d decision by the Commission. Section 10709(b) requires the Commission to make a market dominance determination when a rate is challenged as unreasonably high \u201cwithin 90 days after the start of a proceeding under \u00a7 10707 of this title to investigate the lawfulness of that rate.\u201d It further provides that \u201c[a] finding by the Commission that the carrier does not have market dominance is determinative . . . unless changed or set aside by the Commission or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Georgia Power contends that this language indicates that Congress intended to provide judicial review of market dominance decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The flaw in Georgia Power\u2019s argument is that in this case, a \u00a7 10707 investigation never began because the Commission vacated the Suspension Board\u2019s order to suspend and investigate. As a result, \u00a7 10709(b) has no application here because by its terms it requires a market dominance decision <em>\u201cafter the start\u201d </em>of a \u00a7 10707 investigation. Thus, the Commission\u2019s finding of no market dominance could not have been a final decision to approve rates <em>after </em>investigation. Two other provisions of the Act illuminate the true character of the market dominance finding. Section 10707(c) provides that the Commission may suspend a rate only if it determines that \u201cit is likely that the complainant will prevail on the merits.\u201d Under \u00a7 10709(c), a finding of market dominance is a necessary prerequisite to a finding that rates are unreasonably high. In light of these provisions, it is evident that the Commission, in finding no market dominance, was merely providing an explanation for its decision not to suspend and investigate. Far from being a final decision after investigation, the Commission\u2019s decision represents the very sort of \u201cpreliminary assessment\u201d of the merits \u201ccommonly made in suspension orders,\u201d <em>see United States v. SCRAP, </em>412 U.S. 669, 692 n. 16, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2418, 37 L.Ed.2d 254, and, thus, falls squarely within the holding in <em>Seaboard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Second, Georgia Power, citing the Commission\u2019s statement that it had \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d to declare the rates unreasonably high since it found that no market dominance existed, argues that the Commission\u2019s order falls within the exception to nonreviewability of decisions not to suspend or investigate recognized in <em>Seaboard. </em>The <em>Seaboard </em>Court, citing <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>436 U.S. 631, 98 S.Ct. 2053, 56 L.Ed.2d 591 (1978), and <em>Schilling v. Rogers, </em>363 U.S. 666, 80 S.Ct. 1288, 4 L.Ed.2d 1478 (1960), recognized that Congress did not intend to preclude judicial review of a legal issue concerning the Commission\u2019s authority to exercise or refuse to exercise a statutory discretion. <em>See </em>99 S.Ct. at 2396 n. 11. <em>See also Lone Star Steel Co. v. United States, </em>600 F.2d at 493. Georgia Power argues that the Commission\u2019s finding that it had no jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of the rates was based on an erroneous application of its own market dominance regulations, and that if the market dominance regulations were properly applied, the Commission would have jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>rates. The problem with Georgia Power\u2019s argument is that the Commission\u2019s finding that it had no jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of the rates because it found no market dominance does not involve a <em>legal </em>issue concerning the scope of the Commission\u2019s authority. Here, as in <em>Seaboard, </em>\u201cit is conceded by all that the Commission has authority with respect to rates such as those at issue either to suspend (or investigate) or not to suspend (or investigate) them and that it has exercised its authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2396. Georgia Power\u2019s real complaint is not that the Commission has refused to exercise a statutory discretion, but that it has exercised that discretion erroneously. Thus, the question Georgia Power asks this court to resolve is precisely the factual question that the <em>Seaboard </em>Court unequivocally declared to be nonre-viewable \u2014 whether the Commission exercised its jurisdiction not to suspend or investigate \u201ccorrectly under the particular circumstances involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2396. Georgia Power\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument is a patent attempt to \u201cundermine the Commission\u2019s primary jurisdiction by bringing the courts into the adjudication of the lawfulness of rates in advance of administrative consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2397. Because the narrow exception to nonreviewability has no application here, <em>Seaboard\u2019s </em>holding directly controls this case and the Commission\u2019s decision not to suspend or investigate may not be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\">.
