The district court mentioned this argument in its order of November 22, 1978, but this order was interlocutory in nature, and this appeal was not taken from it. All this court has before it is an appeal from a partial summary judgment that was narrowly restricted by the district court. This court has carefully confined itself to ruling on the matters presented in the appeal that arise from the partial summary judgment and has avoided ruling on issues not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-13\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED and no member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the court having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 16) the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
