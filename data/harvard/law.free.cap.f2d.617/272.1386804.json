Although disagreeing with the examiner\u2019s contention that there was no evidence to support the statement in the Boesch affidavit that \u201cany amount of sigma phase is deleterious and undesirable,\u201d it agreed with the examiner that the Boesch affidavit was insufficient to overcome the prima facie case of obviousness because there was no evidence showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">(1) the precise amounts of sigma-like phase present in compositions containing Appellants\u2019 claimed components balanced to provide Nv values just inside versus just outside Appellants\u2019 claimed \u201cabout 2.35\u201d Nv limits; and (2) direct comparisons of sufficient mechanical properties of those compositions within and without the claimed limit, to demonstrate the alleged critical correlation of Nv limit with sigma phase content.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">The board also said that the showing (in the specification, set forth <em>infra) </em>did not establish the asserted criticality in selection of the components of the alloys according to the claimed Nv formula, because the alloys failed to meet the claimed compositional and Nv value requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">\n<em>The Prima Facie Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Each of the ranges of constituents in appellants\u2019 claimed alloys overlaps ranges disclosed by Pohlman et al. and Lamb. Appellants, citing <em>In re Waymouth, </em>499 F.2d 1273, 182 USPQ 290 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974), argue that neither of the cited prior art references recognizes the problem solved by them and, therefore, cannot render the claims obvious. Upon examination of the prior art references, we do not agree. Appellants admitted in their specification that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az7\">It has been postulated according to Pauling\u2019s theory that the criterion for the formation of sigma phase is based upon the number of electron vacancies (Nv) in the bonding orbitals of the elements involved. Based thereon, other investigators have derived an empirical equation which includes the elements chromium, molybdenum, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel. It is to be noted, however, that the nickel base alloys to which reference is made in the present invention relate to an iron-free or low-iron composition, with only incidental amounts of an element such as manganese, and are hardened by the aluminum and titanium rich interme-tallic compound gamma prime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">U.S. patent No. 3,837,838 (\u2019838), filed December 18, 1972, and issued September 24, 1974, was introduced into evidence by appellants and further illuminates what is meant by \u201cPauling\u2019s theory\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-22\">As described in an article by Linus Pauling entitled \u201cThe nature of intera-tomic forces in metals,\u201d published in Physical Review, 54:899, 1938, in a given metallic atom, the outermost orbitals, termed the bonding orbitals, are occupied by the bonding electrons responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>bonding the atom to its neighboring metallic atoms. At a given instant in time and on the average, the bonding orbitals are only partially occupied by the bonding electrons. Such partial occupation means that the outer orbitals are partially vacant of electrons or possess an \u201celectron hole.\u201d The total average number of vacant orbitals in a given metallic atom is called the electron hole number of the metal (Nv). The average electron hole number (Nv) is the resultant of adding all Nv for the participating elements in the alloy - matrix. The higher the Nv of a given Co-Cr-Ni alloy the higher the chance for the precipitation of embrit-tling phases. The quantities of metals consumed in precipitation do not enter in calculating Nv of the alloy matrix and hence do not participate in the formation of embrittling phases. A low Nv may thus be obtained by either choosing elements of low Nv to form an alloy or by using elements that will react in the alloy and precipitate out from the alloy matrix.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">Accordingly, in carrying out this invention, I have selected an alloy-base for the system which possesses a low Nv, and have strengthened the alloy base by adding elements which will have minor or no effect on raising the Nv through controlling their percentage as solutes or by eliminating their effect on Nv by formation of compounds which precipitate out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">It appears from appellants\u2019 specification that certain precipitate-hardened nickel base alloys, after being exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged periods of time, suffered \u201cfrom a marked and catastrophic decrease in room temperature ductility and a marked increase in the rate of creep deformation.\u201d It was observed that other nickel base alloys having the same percentage ranges of components did not suffer such deleterious changes. The cause of the problem was believed to be the formation of an embrittling phase (\u201csigma\u201d). As early as 1938, however, it was known that the higher the Nv value of a Co-Cr-Ni alloy, the higher the chance for precipitation of em-brittling phases; also, that the quantities of metals consumed in precipitation did not enter into calculating the Nv value of an alloy matrix. We are persuaded that one of ordinary skill in the art would have been guided by these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the above-quoted passage from \u2019838, we note that lowering the Nv value of a Co-Cr-Ni alloy and deletion of the metals not consumed in precipitation from the Nv calculation are expressly suggested. Considering, also, that the composition requirements of the claims and the cited references overlap, we agree with the Solicitor that the prior art would have suggested \u201cthe kind of experimentation necessary to achieve the claimed composition, including the proportional balancing described by appellants\u2019 Nv equation.\u201d This accords with the rule that discovery of an optimum value of a result effective variable in a known process is ordinarily within the skill of the art. <em>In re Antonie, </em>559 F.2d 618, 195 USPQ 6 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977); <em>In re Aller, </em>220 F.2d 454, 42 CCPA 824, 105 USPQ 233 (1955). Accordingly, we conclude that a prima facie case of obviousness has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Unexpected Results</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">It is well settled that a prima facie case of obviousness may be rebutted \u201cwhere the results of optimizing a variable, which was known to be result effective, [are] unexpectedly good.\u201d <em>In re Antonie, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 620, 195 USPQ at 8-9, and cases cited therein. It is also well settled that proof of unexpected properties may be in the form of direct or indirect comparative testing of the claimed compounds (here, alloys) and the closest prior art. <em>In re Payne, </em>606 F.2d 303, 316, 203 USPQ 245, 256 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">A. <em>Creep Tests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Table V, set forth in appellants\u2019 specification and shown below, compares four examples of the claimed alloys with one example <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>(6-3211) of a prior art alloy and is intended to show that the measured creep of the claimed alloys is unexpectedly less than that of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">TABLE V</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">Creep Tests at 1500 \u00b0 F and 37,000 psi</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">Alloy No. Sample Removed After (Hours) Measured Creep (inches per inch)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">2-1422 1567.8 0.008</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">2-1423 1500.4 0.004</p>\n<p id=\"b341-21\">2-1425 1504.5 0.010</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Alloy No. Sample Removed Measured Creep After (Hours) (inches per inch)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">2-1426 1500.4 0.004</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">6-3211 1505.1 0.034</p>\n<p id=\"b341-30\">The measured creep of 6-3211 \u2014 an alloy, appellants note, having \u201cchemistries\u201d within those of the references \u2014 is in excess of three to eight times greater than the creep of the claimed alloys.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-31\">The composition and Nv values of the alloy heats in Table V are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-32\">Element, <em>Weight %</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">Alloy No. A1 Ti Mo Cr Co B Ni Nv Value</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">2-1422 0.07 4.20 3.23 4.70 14.7 18.0 0.030 bal. 2.32</p>\n<p id=\"A-X\">2-1423 0.06 4.37 3.45 4.45 14.6 17.6 0.028 bal. 2.36</p>\n<p id=\"A2u\">2-1425 0.06 3.91 2.98 4.40 14.8 17.5 0.028 bal. 2.21</p>\n<p id=\"Axz\">2-1426 0.05 4.20 3.19 4.50 14.5 17.5 0.030 bal. 2.27</p>\n<p id=\"AqD\">6-3211 0.06 4.43 3.54 4.95 15.2 18.8 0.030 bal. 2.51</p>\n<p id=\"b341-87\">Although it is apparent that the molybdenum content of 6-3211 exceeds the maximum content of the claimed alloys by 0.15%; it is clearly within the ranges of the Pohl-man et al. and Lamb alloys.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-88\">However, we are not persuaded that the Table V data are commensurate in scope with appellants\u2019 claims. <em>In re Greenfield, </em>571 F.2d 1185, 1189, 197 USPQ 227, 230 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants claim broad ranges of elements, but the weight percent of elements in the four examples of the claimed alloys vary by relatively minor amounts. For example, the entire <em>claimed </em>range of carbon is .18 percent, but the <em>tested </em>range is only .02 (.07 minus .05); the claimed cobalt range is 4.8, but the test range is only 1.3. There is no evidence showing whether other alloys encompassed by appellants\u2019 broad claims and having elements varying by relatively major amounts also exhibit a low creep rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-90\">B. <em>Ductility Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-91\">Appellants\u2019 Table VI, set forth in their specification, compares the room temperature ductility of one heat of the claimed alloy (2-1426) and one heat of an alloy (6-3266) which appellants state has \u201cchem-istries\u201d within those of the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-92\">TABLE VI</p>\n<p id=\"AQ-\">Room Temperature Tensile Tests</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">0.2% Alloy U.T.S.

However, for the same reason that the measured creep test data of Table V are not persuasive of unexpected results, we do not regard the tensile test data of Table VI, comparing only one heat of a claimed alloy, sufficient to rebut the prima facie case of obviousness of the claimed invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">C. <em>Absence of Sigma Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVr\">Throughout prosecution appellants have maintained that the claims define <em>\u201ca </em>nickel base alloy which can be manufactured in a consistent way to remain free from a tendency to form plate-like sigma phase.\u201d The \u201cessential concept of the present invention [is] to maintain the average number of electron vacancies at a value not exceeding about 2.35.\u201d Whereas the Pauling theory teaches that a low Nv value means <em>reduced chances </em>for sigma phase, appellants allege that alloys meeting their composition and Nv value requirements are <em>free </em>from sigma phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As related earlier, the Boesch affidavit shows that sigma phase is present in seven alloy examples, all of which meet the composition requirements but exceed the Nv value requirement of the claimed alloys. However, this affidavit contains no examples of claimed alloys showing the absence, or presence, of sigma. The remainder of the record reveals only a single example of the claimed alloy, which shows the absence of sigma.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 specification includes a photomicrograph of Table V alloy heat 2-1422, which clearly shows the absence of sigma; also, a photomicrograph of Table V alloy heat 6-3211, which shows the presence of sigma. We note again that the prior art teaches that reduction of the Nv value <em>reduces the chances </em>of sigma phase in the alloy. Here appellants tested only one example of a low Nv value alloy and found no sigma \u2014 a result consistent with both the prior art teaching and appellants\u2019 allegation that their claimed alloys are \u201ctotally <em>free </em>from sigma phase.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, test results involving a single alloy within the broad range claimed are not sufficient to support appellants\u2019 allegation of what would, from the prior art, be unexpected.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">In view of the foregoing we hold that appellants have failed to rebut the prima facie case of obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-37\">.

Appellants state that the overall variation in Nv due to chemical uncertainty is \u00b1 0.025 so that in reality the Nv value of about 2.35 may actually extend from 2.32 to 2.38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b337-44\">. Appellants\u2019 specification states that A% \u201crefers to the atomic percent of the element so described.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b337-45\">. Creep is the permanent deformation of a metal that occurs as a result of prolonged compression or extension at or near room temperature. <em>The Condensed Chemical Dictionary </em>228 (8th ed. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b339-17\">. The board agreed with the examiner that \u201cthere [was no evidence showing] that an alloy having an Nv number of 2.35 is free of any amount of sigma phase, or what the sigma phase content and properties are of an alloy having an Nv number of 2.36 which is close to but outside the Nv requirement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b341-108\">. It is unnecessary to decide whether 6-3211 is the \u201cbest prior art.\u201d <em>See In re Malagari, </em>499 F.2d 1297, 1302-03, 182 USPQ 549, 552-53 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. Thus, appellants have again failed to show test data commensurate in scope with the broad claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">. We agree with the board that the six United States patents ((1) No. 4,093,474, issued June 6, 1978; (2) No. 4,083,734, issued April 11, 1978; (3) No. 3,930,904, issued January 6, 1976; (4) No. 3,837,838, issued September 24, 1974; (5) No. 3,816,110, issued June 11, 1974; and (6) No. 3,767,385, issued October 23, 1973) introduced into the record by appellants \u201cdo support the assertion in the Boesch affidavit that \u2018any amount of sigma phase\u2019 is undesirable.\u201d Therefore, we have limited our analysis to the issue of the existence of sigma phase and have not extended it to include the effect of varying amounts of sigma phase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b342-20\">. Where it is alleged that a certain technique for flipping coins would always produce \u201cheads,\u201d one would hardly be persuaded by a single toss of a coin which resulted in a showing of \u201cheads.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
