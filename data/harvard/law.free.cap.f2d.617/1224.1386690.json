Plaintiffs have advised this court that in response to the judgment entered below, the Indiana General Assembly has passed \u201cSenate Enrolled Act No. 457\u201d which, among other things, requires the Department of Public Welfare to conform to the decision of the lower court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>GRANT, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">This case involves a husband and wife who are no longer residing together due to a medical disability which requires the long-term institutionalization of one of the spouses. The court below ruled that, in computing the Medicaid benefits payable to the institutionalized spouse, the State of Indiana may consider the resources of the noninstitutionalized spouse as available to the institutionalized spouse \u2014 provided the state conducts individualized fact findings regarding the financial needs of the non-institutionalized spouse before determining what is potentially available. The gravamen of this appeal is that the district court\u2019s judgment continues to permit the State of Indiana to enforce the spousal responsibility of a noninstitutionalized spouse through the indirect method of denying the institutionalized spouse his or her full Medicaid benefits, thereby raising the specter of eviction if spousal contribution is not forthcoming. Appellants suggest the proper procedure to enforce spousal responsibility is for the state to provide full benefits to the institutionalized spouse and to then initiate direct action against the unwilling noninstitutionalized spouse under a state spousal support statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">This class action, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was filed on behalf of James Brown, an incompetent Medicaid recipient, by his guardian, together with his noninstitutionalized spouse. Elizabeth Brown, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against regulations adopted as part of the Indiana State Medicaid Plan, I.C. 12-1-7-14.9; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>As a Medicaid recipient, Mr. Brown\u2019s expenses at his nursing home were partially paid by the Indiana Department of Public Welfare and the patient himself. Additionally, however, the defendant welfare officials had certain policies and regulations which required that Mrs. Brown pay a certain amount each month over to the nursing home. Her assigned amount was determined in accordance with a state-wide, uniformly applied mathematical formula that did not take into account her own individual financial needs. She was obliged to pay the money each month and, if she did not, the nursing home would be faced with a non-payment situation. Under the Indiana plan, Medicaid funds would not be used to pay any part of the amount assigned to Mrs. Brown. Apparently she was either unable or unwilling to pay her assigned amount to the nursing home. Defendants nevertheless <em>deemed </em>part of Mrs. Brown\u2019s income and resources to be \u201cavailable\u201d, within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the Medicaid recipient, Mr. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">The Browns filed this class action to challenge the deeming regulations of defendants. The district court conducted a trial on December 20, 1978, and issued a Memorandum Opinion on February 16,1979. The court certified the class and declared the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>challenged regulatory scheme<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to be contrary to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17) and thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause. The court stated: \u201cBy this ruling the court does not suggest that the state may not seek contributions from a noninstitutionalized spouse. . . . It is the arbitrariness and irrebuttable presumptiveness of the established limits as applied to any given case that renders the challenged state regulations invalid\u201d, p. 6 of Mem.Op. The court held that to comply with \u00a7 1396a(a)(17) of the Social Security Act, the Indiana welfare regulations must provide for a factual determination in each case that gives \u201cdue consideration to the individual obligations and particular needs of each spouse and family\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> citing <em>Herweg v. Ray, </em>443 F.Supp. 1315, 1319 (S.D.Iowa 1978), <em>appeal pending. </em>After ruling on the merits, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Plaintiffs contend on appeal that (1) the lower court\u2019s ruling on the merits, although an improvement in the law, has erroneously stopped short of the required abolition of all Medicaid deeming, and that (2) plaintiffs have erroneously been denied attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AU5\"><em>I </em>\u2014 Medicaid <em>Deeming</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6iv\">The section of the Social Security Act which is in issue, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-7\">(a) A state plan for medical assistance must\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-9\">(17) include reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which (A) are consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, (B) provide for taking into account only such income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, available to the applicant or recipient . . ., (C) provide for reasonable evaluation of any such income or resources, and (D) do not take into account the financial responsibility of any individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance under the plan <em>unless such applicant or recipient is such individual\u2019s spouse </em>or such individual\u2019s child . . .. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-15\">The crux of the problem is the apparent conflict between subparts (B) and (D) of Section 1396a(a)(17). Subpart (B) provides that only income and resources available to the Medicaid recipient shall be considered while subpart (D) suggests that income and resources of spouses can be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-16\">At this juncture we should set out (1) plaintiffs\u2019 definition of \u201cdeeming\u201d and (2) this court\u2019s perception of the levels of inquiry that confront courts faced with situations similar to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-17\">(1) Plaintiffs argue that deeming occurs either (a) where a participating state refuses to individualize the spousal responsibility, or (b) where a participating state punishes the institutionalized Medicaid recipient by depriving that person of his or her benefits because the spouse refuses to pay the assigned share of the costs of institutionalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-18\">(2) The first level of inquiry would be to determine the amount of income and resources belonging to the noninstitutionalized spouse that is potentially available for the support of the institutionalized spouse. This determination must include consideration of factors such as living expenses that do not proportionately decline due to the absence of the institutionalized spouse. The need for an individualized factual de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>termination, rather than an arbitrary irre-buttable presumption, was correctly expressed in the court below. In suggesting a scheme considered acceptable, the court stated: \u201cThe contemplated scheme would allow the state to require proof of the particular needs and individual obligations of each spouse and family, and would then deduct these verified sums from the existing resources and income to determine the amount, if any, that is reasonably available for support of the institutionalized spouse.\u201d Mem. Op. p. 7. The district court\u2019s approach to this first level of inquiry is most equitable and is affirmed without change. However, we must agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the lower court\u2019s ruling fell short of the abolition of an irrebuttable presumption contained in what we perceive as the second level of inquiry, i. e., whether the income and resources of the noninstitu-tionalized spouse that have been determined to be potentially available are actually received by the institution on behalf of the disabled spouse. The resulting question then arises: How shall the State of Indiana enforce upon an unwilling spouse the responsibility to contribute?</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">This second level of inquiry has neither been addressed by this court nor by any other circuit,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but several district courts have confronted the deeming issue. In <em>Burns v. Vowell, </em>424 F.Supp. 1135 (S.D.Tex. 1976), a spouse required 24-hour care in a nursing home. Plaintiff spouses challenged state regulations that included an irrebutta-ble presumption that income over a certain level was available to the institutionalized spouse without considering the actual needs or actual contribution of the ineligible spouse. The <em>Burns </em>court defined deeming as \u201ca bureaucratic decision to deem a portion of the income of the non-institutionalized spouse available to the institutionalized spouse\u201d. 424 F.Supp. 1135,1139. In granting a preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court ruled that subparts (B) and (D) of Section 1396a(a)(17) prohibited deeming, and addressed the level one inquiry by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT5\">Thus, while the income of a noninstitu-tionalized spouse can be considered, it must be done through the application of reasonable standards and not on the basis of an irrebuttable presumption that the money is available for the care and support of the institutionalized spouse. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-7\">. Thus where nursing home care is made available to eligible recipients, their spouses cannot \u2018be held accountable beyond their means\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">424 F.Supp. 1135, 1141. The <em>Burns </em>court commented on the level two inquiry by stating: \u201cThe Texas relative responsibility law applies in this case but only insofar as it allows the state \u2018to demand reasonable payment from a spouse or parent who is able.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>It is noteworthy that in that court\u2019s preliminary injunction, the state welfare agency was ordered to pay, <em>penden-te lite, </em>the full amount of the cost of the nursing care of the institutionalized spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">In <em>Franssen v. Juras, </em>406 F.Supp. 1375 (D.Or.1975), a three-judge district court faced a similar challenge by a class of plaintiffs wherein one spouse was an institutionalized Medicaid recipient and the other a noninstitutionalized spouse subject to state regulations that presumed the availability of income above a certain standard allowance. The <em>Franssen </em>court held that the state regulations were invalid as inconsistent with \u00a7 1396a(a)(17), and addressed the level two inquiry by noting that subpart (D) of \u00a7 1396a(a)(17) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-10\">intended to authorize a <em>state </em>mechanism for enforcing financial responsibility of relatives, not to permit presumptions forbidden elsewhere in the statute. Oregon until recently had such a mechanism, but it never applied to Medical Assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>and the Plaintiffs here had incomes well below the level that would have activated a demand for contribution. Nothing in our decision in this case, we should note, prevents the State from re-enacting a relative responsibility law and making it applicable to Medicaid, nor from making and enforcing regulations reasonably evaluating the income and resources actually available. We require only that such efforts to impose responsibility conform to federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">(Emphasis added.) 406 F.Supp. 1375, 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">In <em>Manfredi v. Maher, </em>435 F.Supp. 1106 (D.Conn.1977), the court similarly <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> declared that state welfare regulations that automatically attributed income from the non-institutionalized spouse were invalid as inconsistent with \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). The <em>Manfredi </em>court noted that Connecticut, as Indiana, is one of fifteen states which has elected to assess Medicaid eligibility on the basis of a historical standard, by referring to the state\u2019s medical plan which was in effect on January 1, 1972. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(f). This has relevance in that certain 1977 regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare are inapplicable to states that have exercised the \u00a7 1396a(f) option. These 1977 regulations, which apply to only 35 states, have limited any level two presumption of contribution, under the facts of <em>Manfredi, </em>to the first six months after the spouses cease to live together:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-9\">Where both spouses apply as aged, blind or disabled or where both spouses are SSI eligible, <em>and cease to live together, income and resources are considered mutually available without proof of contribution for the first six months after the month they cease to live together in a common household. After that, only actually contributed income and resources may be considered in determining the eligibility or amount of assistance of either individual spouse. </em>42 Fed.Reg. at 2686, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 248.3(b)(2)(i) <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">435 F.Supp. 1106, 1112.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After noting that this regulation did not apply to Connecticut, the <em>Manfredi </em>court nevertheless held that it was unreasonable, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(C), for the state to assess the income of two persons on the theory that they maintain a single household (which is HEW\u2019s criteria for determining eligibility for and amount of SSI benefits disbursed to an elderly person), when it is a recognized fact that one member of that couple is confined to a long-term medical care facility. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-15\">Such an assumption flies in the face of simple, economic reality, as the impoverished lifestyle of the named plaintiffs in this action clearly demonstrates. By comparison, it would be highly reasonable to treat such couples as separate individuals for Medicaid purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-16\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-17\">Indeed, the existence of [Connecticut support statutes] reinforces the cases for separate individual consideration of spouses in the plaintiff class, since they provide the Commissioner with a remedy to employ in cases of unwarranted neglect, where for example, a wealthy individual refuses to support an institutionalized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>spouse, even though she would be financially able to do so. [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVPB\">435 F.Supp. 1106, 1114-15.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">In <em>Gray Panthers v. Secretary, Dept. of Health, etc., </em>461 F.Supp. 319 (D.D.C.1978), an organization of older adults brought suit to challenge the federal regulations,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which allow the 15 states electing the \u00a7 1396a(f) option to promulgate their deeming regulations. The court held that the federal regulations were invalid as inconsistent with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). In interpreting the \u201cavailable to the applicant\u201d language in subpart (17)(B), the <em>Gray Panthers </em>court interrelated subpart (D) in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abq-dedup-0\">Subpart (D) of the statute is not to the contrary. That subpart merely prohibits a state from taking into account the \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 of anyone except spouses and parents. While it may allow a state to enforce its financial responsibility laws against a spouse or parent, this subpart does <em>not </em>suggest that the amount of contribution from that person should be a deemed amount. In fact, this is exactly what Congress had intended sub-part (D) to mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-5\">The committee believes it is proper to expect spouses to support each other and parents to be held accountable for the support of their minor children and their blind or permanently and totally disabled children even though 21 years of age or older. Such requirements for support may reasonably include the payment <em>by such relative, if able, for medical care. </em>S.Rep.No.404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 78, <em>reprinted in </em>[1965] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1943, 2018 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">461 F.Supp. 319, 322, note 5. While the court\u2019s language in this footnote refers to \u201cthe amount of contribution\u201d and the \u201cdeemed amount\u201d, the suggestion of enforcement through state responsibility laws implies that the fact of actual contribution should not be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-9\">Finally, two cases from the District of Minnesota suggest recent support for plaintiffs\u2019 position. In <em>Hanke v. Nyhus, </em>470 F.Supp. 742 (D.Minn.1979), a similar class of plaintiffs challenged state welfare rules that were construed as presuming the availability of income and resources of spouses, who are involuntarily living apart because one spouse is in a nursing home, without proof of actual contribution. The <em>Hanke </em>court, after noting that Minnesota, as Indiana, has taken the \u00a7 1396a(f) option, and after referring to the <em>Manfredi, Franssen, Burns </em>and <em>Gray Panthers </em>decisions, <em>supra, </em>held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-10\">defendants\u2019 policy of considering personal property owned by the spouse of an institutionalized MA applicant an available resource regardless of whether the spouse will contribute the property to the applicant\u2019s use is inconsistent with the federal statute and regulations which require that only such income and resources as are available to the applicant be considered in determining eligibility for MA benefits. This conclusion in no way affects the right of the state to pursue any claim it may have for contribution from the noninstitutionalized spouse pursuant to relative responsibility laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">470 F.Supp. 742, 746. <em>Nursing Home Residents\u2019 Advisory Council v. Kelly, </em>470 F.Supp. 747 (D.Minn.1979) was handed down the same day as the <em>Hanke </em>decision and the basic holding is identical except that <em>Hanke </em>dealt with personal property while <em>Kelly </em>dealt with a spouse\u2019s interest in real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">We find that the district court cases discussed above represent the majority trend against all forms of deeming and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>therefore hold that administrative coercion resultant from state procedures which presume actual contribution is inconsistent with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). In light of the Indiana spousal support statute, I.C. 31-2-2-1,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we hold that the state welfare agency is required to make an upward adjustment in Medicaid benefits to compensate for the portion left unpaid by an unwilling spouse, and then to proceed under the above statute to seek reimbursement directly from the unwilling spouse. To hold otherwise would be to deny an eligible recipient his full benefits because of the improper action of his or her spouse. <em>Cf. Gunn v.

And most importantly, the plaintiffs were well acquainted with the numerous published precedents that had dealt with issues identical to those presented herein solely upon the plaintiffs\u2019 well-pleaded statutory claim.

Arkansas Activities Ass\u2019n., </em>574 F.2d 423 (8th Cir. 1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtA0\">Our determination that the Act was intended to encompass the instant case does not, of course, require an award of attorney\u2019s fees. \u201c[Cjourts have wide discretion in determining whether or not an award of attorney\u2019s fees is warranted, giving due consideration to the principle that the prevailing party should recover attorney\u2019s fees \u2018unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u2019 \u201d <em>Planned Parenthood v. Citizens for Com. Action, </em>558 F.2d 861, 870 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>quoting Newman </em>v. <em>Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azi-dedup-0\">574 F.2d 423, 427. Indeed, in our recent opinion in <em>Dawson, et al. v. Pastrick, et al., </em>600 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1979), we expressly characterized the trial court\u2019s discretion as narrow, and further reiterated that \u201cIn <em>Davis v. Murphy, </em>587 F.2d 362, 364 (7th Cir. 1978), we noted that \u2018a prevailing plaintiff should receive fees almost as a matter of course.\u2019 \u201d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">In <em>Gagne v. Maher, </em>594 F.2d 336 (2d Cir. 1979), the Second Circuit held that a district court erred in constricting its view \u2022 of its own discretion by refusing to award any fee for time spent on the fee application. In the case at bar, we hold that the district court likewise erred in its constricted view that it lacked discretionary authority to award fees where the plaintiffs prevailed on a statutory rather than a constitutional claim. We, therefore, remand the attorney fees question to the court below to determine (1) whether the requested fees are exorbitant and (2) whether there are any special circumstances that would render such an award unjust. We note that the fact that plaintiffs are represented by Legal Services Organization of Indiana, which is in part federally funded, does not represent a special circumstance that would preclude an award. <em>Hairston v. R &amp; R Apartments, </em>510 F.2d 1090 (7th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the case at bar stands, an award appears appropriate; however, we shall defer to the expertise of the district court in determining the amount. Circuit Rule 18 shall not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">. Although jurisdiction has been neither raised as an issue nor denied by the court below, this court notes that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, filed December 1, 1978, alleges jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. This observation is made to distinguish the recent holding in <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979) wherein the Court ruled that jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 did not encompass a claim that a state welfare regulation is invalid because it conflicts with the Social Security Act. The <em>Chapman </em>Court distinguished a situation, such as in the case at bar, where jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 is alleged and the amount in controversy exceeds $10,-000. 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1910, 1946. In addition, <em>Chapman </em>can be distinguished in that in the case at bar plaintiffs have made substantial constitutional allegations as well as the successful statutory allegation. The Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 532-543, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), allows the conclusion that we continue to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the statutory claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. <em>Dunn v.

At oral argument counsel for the State of Indiana raised, without citation of authority or prior treatment in Appellees\u2019 Brief, the speculation that the State of Indiana would not have standing to proceed against the unwilling spouse. In light of our holding that the State is required to make an upward adjustment of benefits to compensate for an unwilling spouse, it is apparent that the State would have standing to bring an action for reimbursement. In general, a state Attorney General may institute such suits as he deems necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the state and the protection of public rights. 7 Am.Jur.2d <em>Attorney General, </em>\u00a7 11. Both the Medicaid statute\u2019s general purpose of providing benefits to those eligible and the Medicaid regulations\u2019 (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.135(f) (1978)) specific requirement that the state seek reimbursement, support a conclusion that the Indiana Attorney General has standing against the unwilling spouse. In the <em>Franssen </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the court stated that \u201cThe relevant section [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(D)] is intended to authorize a <em>state </em>mechanism for enforcing financial responsibility of relatives, not to permit presumptions forbidden elsewhere in the statute. Oregon until recently had such a mechanism, but it never applied to Medical Assistance and the Plaintiffs here had incomes well below the level that would have activated a demand for contribution. <em>Nothing in our decision in this case, </em>we should note, <em>prevents the State from re-enacting a relative responsibility law and making it applicable to </em>Medicaid.....\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 406 F.Supp. 1375, 1379. We note that Indiana has recently enacted parental responsibility laws that have directly involved the state agency responsible for administering Title IV-D of the Social Security Act in the collection of support payments. I.C. 12 \u2014 1\u20147\u2014 1.1; 31-2-2-1. As in <em>Franssen, </em>nothing in our decision prevents the State of Indiana from enacting a state spousal support statute that directly involves the Indiana Department of Public Welfare, or other appropriate state agency in the collection of spousal support payments. In any event, this standing issue is not presently before this court and should be resolved in an Indiana forum. The Supreme Court of Indiana, in <em>State v. Rankin, </em>260 Ind. 228, 294 N.E.2d 604 (1973) <em>appeal after remand </em>313 N.E.2d 705, stated that \u201cthe Attorney General need not state in his complaint the explicit legal basis for his authority to bring suit. When the opposing party raises the issue it is then up to the trial judge to determine from all the circumstances whether the Attorney General does have the authority to initiate the action.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 605.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">. Plaintiffs have additionally referred to the unpublished Memorandum in <em>WWRO, et al. v. Andreano, et al., </em>No. 75-C-102 (E.D.Wis. Oct. 30, 1978), where the district court likewise rejected the argument that a legal service type organization should be awarded a reduced fee because it is a publicly funded group.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1297-11\">PELL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-0\">dissenting in part, concurring in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">A result of the majority opinion reduced to a simple statement appears to me to be as follows. A is in a nursing home. Part of the attendant expense are paid by the state. A\u2019s spouse is legally obligated to pay for A\u2019s support which in this case would be the amount above that paid by the state. A\u2019s spouse has income sufficient over and above his or her own needs to pay the amount of the nursing home bill the state has not paid. A\u2019s spouse does not wish to do so. A\u2019s spouse does not have to do so, and the state has to pay the whole cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>I do not consider it an answer to say that the state can take action against the spouse to recover that which the spouse was legally obligated to pay. I think it unrealistic to think that the state will engage in a multiplicity of continuing individual lawsuits to recover the money that it should not have had to pay out in the first place. Under the majority opinion, there is an open invitation for the spouse to decide that he or she does not wish to make the excess payment. In this era of inflation, and giving consideration to the human inclination not to pay out money when one doesn\u2019t have to, I think it reasonable to conclude that few would decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">Unfortunately, and with the greatest respect for the reasoning expressed in the majority opinion, it appears to me that once more a roadblock has been placed in the way of a reasonable and legal endeavor of state authorities to curtail unnecessary expenditures of public funds in social programs. I think the district court correctly struck down the \u201cdeeming\u201d test, but provided a reasoned alternative to the state whereby the costs would be borne as they should be, I would adopt the opinion of the district court on this aspect of the matter as the opinion of this court, and therefore respectfully dissent from the majority opinion which overrules that part of the district court opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">I also agree with the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees. The majority opinion in remanding on this issue indicates that fees are allowable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. That section, however, provides for fees where actions are brought to enforce a provision of section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act. Elsewhere the majority opinion in finding jurisdiction relies only on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, which would not seem to encompass claims under section 1983, which claims are covered only under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">I otherwise concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
