Sixty-nine votes were cast in favor of the Union, while sixty-six employees voted against union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On May 13, 1976, the Company filed timely Objections (the \u201cObjections\u201d) to Union conduct allegedly affecting the election results. In its Objections the Company alleged generally that the Union had threatened employees with retaliation if they did not vote for the Union, that the Union had misrepresented the wages and benefits which it had obtained for employees at another company; and that the Union had defaced an official sample ballot by placing an \u201cX\u201d in the box marked \u201cyes.\u201d In support thereof, the Company submitted a number of affidavits of <em>supervisory </em>employees who recited the facts underlying each of the Objections to Union conduct during the representation election.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">An administrative investigation of the Company\u2019s Objections was conducted by the Board\u2019s Regional Director in which the parties had full opportunity to submit evidence and present witnesses. The Regional Director in its Report on Objections (the \u201cReport\u201d) recommended the certification of the Union. The Company filed exceptions (the \u201cExceptions\u201d) to the Report which are nearly identical to its original Objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Board, after full consideration of the Company\u2019s Objections, the Report and Exceptions to such, and the \u201centire record\u201d adopted the recommendation of the Regional Director and certified the Union. The Board did not order the Regional Director to hold an evidentiary hearing on the alleged Union misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Subsequently, the Company refused to bargain with the Union. The Board ultimately found the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(5) and (1) (the \u201cCharges\u201d) of the Act. The Board petitions this Court for enforcement of its Order that the Company cease and desist from violating the Act and bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The Company defended itself against the Charges by attacking the Board\u2019s decision to certify the Union. Specifically, the Company argues that the Board\u2019s certification decision, arrived at without benefit of either an evidentiary hearing on the Company\u2019s Exceptions or a review of its affidavits in support of allegations of union misconduct, constitutes an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d The Board argues that it has discretion to certify a union without ordering the Regional Director to hold an evidentiary hearing. It argues that such decision in this case was justified by the Company\u2019s failure to state with particularity the factual errors of the Regional Director\u2019s Report on alleged Union misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">We hold that the issues presented to the Court are controlled by this Circuit\u2019s recent decision in <em>Prestolite Wire Division v. NLRB, </em>592 F.2d 302.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">In <em>Prestolite, </em>this Court held that the Board\u2019s failure to have before it for review affidavits submitted by the Company supporting claims of alleged union misconduct during a representation election renders the Board\u2019s certification decision arbitrary and capricious as to constitute an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As this Court stated in <em>Prestolite, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Where, over objection, the Board\u2019s certification is made without [either] the benefit of a hearing or of the full record compiled by and relied upon by the investigating] officer, we believe we are justified in taking [the] record as we find it; and construing the well-pleaded factual assertions in Prestolite\u2019s objections most favorably to it. So viewed, the Board\u2019s decision to issue a certification must be considered an abuse of its discretion, 592 F.2d at 306-07.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In the instant case, the Company argued that its affidavits submitted contain references of specific instances of Union misconduct. In addition, the Company argues that its failure to submit affidavits of employees voting in the election is due to the allegedly coerced employee\u2019s fear of reprisal should the employees voluntarily recount their experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s petition to enforce is denied, the certification is set aside, and the cause remanded to the Board with directions to refer the matter for hearing before a hearing officer as provided in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(f).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-23\">. The Order and Decision of the Board are reported at 230 NLRB 71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. In <em>Prestolite, supra, </em>a company submitted eight objections to Union misconduct during a representation election. After an Administrative investigation the Regional Director recommended the certification of the Union. The company filed with the Board a list of seventy-three exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report. The Board certified the union without either ordering an evidentiary hearing on the company\u2019s well-pleaded exceptions or reviewing the affidavits submitted by the company to support its allegations of union misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-15\">. Although the Court in <em>Prestolite, supra, </em>was careful to reaffirm the validity of the Board\u2019s rules that affidavits submitted to support ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>jections are not required to be a part of the record forwarded to the Board by the Regional Director, the Court stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The problems faced by the Board in its review and by this court in ours are vastly complicated by such a procedure, 592 F.2d at 306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-20\">. Although the Company\u2019s Objections and Exceptions are virtually identically general and unspecific, it is disingenuous for the Board to support the Regional Director\u2019s characterization of alleged threats to employees during a representation election as \u201cmere hearsay\u201d when only the Board had the means to confirm the validity of the Company\u2019s allegation of the Union\u2019s unlawful conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
