Sigmon appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the final decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare terminating social security disability benefits to Sigmon as of June 30, 1973. Sigmon argues that work done by him in the summer of 1973 qualifies as \u201ctrial work\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 422(c) and should not have been considered in determining whether or when his disability ceased. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">This case was earlier remanded to the Secretary for a determination whether Sig-mon\u2019s work in July, August and September of 1973 should be considered \u201ctrial work.\u201d If the work were found not so to qualify, we then said, the Secretary could \u201creaffirm his prior decision since we agree with the district court that it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Sigmon v. Califano, </em>No. 77-2180, slip. op. at 3 (4th Cir. May 1, 1978) (unpublished). On remand, the Secretary concluded that the work did not qualify as trial work because of the limitation of \u00a7 422(c) in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1536(c), which provides that \u201csuch period shall not begin . before the month in which application is filed for such benefits . . .\u201d Sigmon did not file for disability benefits until March 20, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">Sigmon now argues that this limitation of trial work in \u00a7 404.1536(c) cannot be applied as it is in conflict with \u00a7 422(c). We agree with the district court that while \u00a7 404.-1536(c) limits the application of \u00a7 422(c), it does not conflict with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-18\">The general rule is one amply supported by common sense: the Secretary can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>consider work done by the claimant after the alleged onset of disability as tending to show that the claimant was not then disabled. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>385 F.Supp. 780 (E.D.Mo.1974) <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>520 F.2d 1010 (8th Cir. 1975). The exception to this rule contained in \u00a7 422(c) is to encourage persons whose statutory disability is in issue to try to rehabilitate themselves so that they may again engage in gainful activity. The \u201ctrial work\u201d provision assures them that they may attempt to return to work without prejudicing determination of their period of statutory disability. But \u00a7 404.1536(c) contemplates that the trial work effort shall be one undertaken with knowledge of the Secretary so that, among other things, its <em>bona fides </em>and rehabilitative purpose may be monitored. This of course can only be assured after the Secretary is made aware of the existence of a claim for benefits. This is the purpose of \u00a7 404.1536(c) and we think it a valid limitation that lies well within the statutory purpose of \u00a7 422(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">It is apparent that Sigmon\u2019s return to his previous job months before he filed for disability benefits was not part of any formally approved rehabilitation program such as is contemplated by the statute and by the regulation. We do not believe that the Secretary\u2019s consideration of this work in determining Sigmon\u2019s continuing disability violates the mandate of \u00a7 422(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
