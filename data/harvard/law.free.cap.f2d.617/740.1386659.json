Hart, Jr., denied the request, prompting this appeal. Believing that Judge Hart properly exercised his discretion in denying the award, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-20\">Gilbert Cuneo (now deceased) and Herbert Fenster,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> partners in a Washington law firm that specializes in government contract law, filed this suit against then Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in 1967 seeking disclosure of the Defense Contract Audit Manual, a manual used by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to aid inspectors who audit government contracts. <em>See Cuneo v. Laird, </em>338 F.Supp. 504 (D.D.C.1972), <em>remanded sub nom. Cuneo v. Schlesinger, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 484 F.2d 1086 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974). After resisting disclosure for eight years, the Government finally released the manual to the public while this case was pending in the district court. Appellant, having \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d within the meaning of section 552(a)(4)(E), filed a request for attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court denied the request because the attorneys were acting <em>in propria persona, </em>and therefore outside section 552(a)(4)(E). <em>Cuneo v. Schlesinger, </em>No. 1826-67 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 1975) (Order Denying Attorneys\u2019 Fees).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court reversed the district court\u2019s determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 553 F.2d 1360 (D.C.Cir.1977), and remanded the case to the district court to consider the relevant criteria and exercise its discretion in ruling on an award of fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1367. On remand, Judge Hart considered these criteria and declined to award fees. <em>Cuneo v. Brown, </em>No. 1826-67 (D.D.C. Aug. 7, 1978) (Order Denying Attorneys\u2019 Fees). Appellant Fenster challenges that ruling as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">In 1974, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act to authorize attorneys\u2019 fees for complainants who \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d in litigation under the Act. Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-502, \u00a7 1(b)(2), 88 Stat. 1561 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) (1976)). The Senate Report accompanying this legislation noted the importance of this new provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">[it is] crucial to effectuating the original congressional intent that judicial review be available to reverse agency refusals to adhere strictly to the Act\u2019s mandates. Too often the barriers presented by court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees are insurmountable for the average person requesting information, allowing the government to escape compliance with the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">S.Rep. No. 854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1974) [hereinafter cited as Senate Report], <em>reprinted in </em>House Comm, on Gov\u2019t Operations &amp; Senate Comm, on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Freedom of Information Act Amend-merits of 1974, pt. 1, at 169 (Joint Comm. Print 1975) [hereinafter cited as Legislative History].</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Congress, in authorizing the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, left to the traditional equitable discretion of the courts the decision whether such fees are appropriate in any given disclosure case. When this case was previously before this court in Cuneo <em>v. Rumsfeld, we </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">It is clear from the legislative history that Congress did not intend the award of attorney fees to be automatic. Instead, the trial court must weigh the facts of each case against the criteria of the existing body of law on the award of attorney fees and then exercise its discretion in determining whether an award is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">180 U.S.App.D.C. at 191, 553 F.2d at 1367 (footnotes omitted). Noting that it is \u201cbetter to have that discretion exercised by the court which has been most intimately connected with the case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 192, 553 F.2d at 1368, this court remanded the case for Judge Hart to rule on the attorneys\u2019 fees. The court mentioned four criteria for the district court to consider in deciding whether to make an award: \u201c(1) the benefit to the public, if any, derived from the case; (2) the commercial benefit to the complainant; (3) the nature of the complainant\u2019s interest in the records sought; and (4) whether the government\u2019s withholding of the records had a reasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 553 F.2d at 1364 (footnote omitted). <em>See </em>Senate Report 19, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History 171<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>court in <em>Rumsfeld </em>specifically suggested that the district court examine the commercial interest of the appellant\u2019s law firm in the disclosure of the manual. 180 U.S.App.D.C. at 192-93, 553 F.2d at 1367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">On remand, Judge Hart found that the public benefit from disclosure was \u201cminimal,\u201d the commercial benefit to appellant \u201cenormous,\u201d and the government\u2019s original withholding of the manual justified by \u201ca reasonable basis in law.\u201d He therefore denied the request for fees. <em>Cuneo v. Brown, </em>No. 1826-67 (D.D.C. Aug. 7, 1978) (Order Denying Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees). In making this decision, Judge Hart properly exercised the discretion permitted under section 552(a)(4)(E). As a review of the four suggested criteria reveals, he carefully weighed the circumstances of this suit against these criteria in deciding that the appellant did not deserve to be awarded fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Two of the four criteria are closely related in this case: the commercial benefit to the complainant and the nature of the complainant\u2019s interest in the record so\u00fcght. When a complainant seeks disclosure of information for commercial benefit, an award of fees is generally inappropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">[Tjhere will seldom be an award of attorneys\u2019 fees when the suit is to advance the private commercial interests of the corn-plainant. In these cases there is usually no need to award attorneys\u2019 fees to insure that the action will be brought. The private self-interest motive of, and often pecuniary benefit to, the complainant will be sufficient to insure the vindication of the rights given in the FOIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Senate Report 19, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History 171. In remanding this case for the district court to exercise its discretion respecting an award of fees, this court expressed concern over the appellant\u2019s commercial interest in disclosure of the manual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjqZ\">One important factor which the trial court should take into consideration is whether the action was brought to advance the private commercial interest of the complainant. Section 552(a)(4)(E) was not intended to compensate FOIA complainants who have a private commercial interest in disclosure which is sufficient incentive to pursue their claim through the courts. The facts of this case suggest that a private incentive was present. Appellant vigorously litigated this suit for seven years with full knowledge that the FOIA did not provide for the award of attorney fees. Apparently [appellant] thought that the time his firm would have to invest in the suit was worth the gamble that the Manual would be obtained. . . . The FOIA was fundamentally designed to inform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>public and not to benefit private litigants. If the potential for private commercial benefit was sufficient incentive to encourage [the appellant] to pursue his FOIA claim, the policy objectives of section 552(a)(4)(E) would be met and it would <em>not </em>be improper for the trial court to deny his request for attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. at 191-192, 553 F.2d at 1367-68 (emphasis in original) (footnotes and citations omitted). Fenster has admitted his firm\u2019s commercial interest in the information that he sought to have disclosed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">[Appellant\u2019s] clients and [appellant] annually participate in extensive negotiation and litigation with Defendants\u2019 agents, who specifically represent the DCAA. In these dealings, which involve tens of millions of dollars, Defendants\u2019 agents rely on provisions of the Defense Contract Audit Manual . . . . [Appellant] is seriously impaired in his counseling, negotiation, and litigation services by the unavailability of the manual, and is further unable to insure the fair treatment of his clients in such proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">Affidavit of Herbert L. Fenster, <em>Cuneo v. Laird, </em>No. 1826-67, at 7 (D.D.C., subscribed July 26, 1971). It is evident that Cuneo and Fenster originally brought this suit to obtain information that would help their firm counsel clients. Moreover, the firm knew that if it succeeded in obtaining the disclosure of the audit manual, that fact might well induce contractors with problems involving the DCAA to bring their business to the firm, although the manual would become equally available to other counsel. On these facts, \u201cthe private self-interest motive of, and . . . pecuniary benefit to, the complainant [is] sufficient to insure the vindication of the rights given in the FOIA.\u201d Senate Report 19, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Judge Hart also found the government had a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d for its opposition to disclosure. Although Fenster contends to the contrary, this court has already resolved this question in Rumsfeld:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\">To satisfy the \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d requirement it is not necessary for the court to find that the information the government chose to withhold was in fact exempt. What is required is a showing that the government had a reasonable basis in law for concluding that the information in issue was exempt and that it had not been recalcitrant in its opposition to a valid claim or otherwise engaged in obdurate behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\"><em>In this ease the government has satisfied the reasonable basis requirement. </em>At one stage in this litigation the district court had found that parts of the Manual were exempt. This confirms that the government had at least a reasonable basis for concluding the withholding to be proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 189-190, 553 F.2d at 1365-66 (emphasis added) (footnotes and citations omitted). In light of the fact that at the time the Government withheld disclosure the state of the law with respect to the disclosure of documents like the manual was a matter of genuine uncertainty, reflected in the reversal of the district court by this court in <em>Rumsfeld, </em>it is clear to us that a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for the Government\u2019s position existed at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The final relevant criterion involves the public benefit from disclosure of government materials. Judge Hart relied expressly on the small volume of public sales of the manual after its release in finding little public benefit from disclosure. The release of any government document benefits the public by increasing citizens\u2019 knowledge of their government. Congress did not have this sort of broadly defined benefit in mind, however, in enacting section 552(a)(4)(E). The legislative history indicates that the \u201cpublic benefit\u201d criterion \u201cspeaks for an award [of attorneys\u2019 fees] where the complainant\u2019s victory is likely to add to the fund of information that citizens may use in making vital political choices.\u201d <em>Blue v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>570 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1978). In this case, knowledge of the contents of the manual primarily helps government contractors with audits of their performance by the government. Thus, the manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>basically furthers a private commercial, and not the general public, interest. This finding of little public benefit from disclosure of the manual is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Having weighed all the criteria, <em>see Nationwide Building Maintenance, Inc. v. Sampson, </em>182 U.S.App.D.C. 83, 559 F.2d 704 (D.C.Cir.1977), Judge Hart properly exercised his discretion under section 552(a)(4)(E) in refusing appellant\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellant succeeded in his original goal of obtaining release of the manual. That is compensation enough. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Av3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-12\">. Section 552(a)(4)(E) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-15\">. Gilbert Cuneo died during the pendency of this suit. Herbert Fenster is the sole appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b805-21\">. The court also found that section 552(a)(4)(E), an addition under the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-502, 88 Stat. 1561, did not apply to suits filed before the provision\u2019s effective date of February 19, 1975. On appeal, this court disagreed, finding that \u201cthe law at the time the action is terminated, and not the law in force at the time of commencement\u201d of an action, controls the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Cuneo v. Rumsfeld, </em>180 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 191, 553 F.2d 1360, 1367 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. The Senate Report listed these four criteria and then stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Under the first criterion a court would ordinarily award fees, for example, where a newsman was seeking information to be used in a publication or a public interest group was seeking information to further a project benefitting the general public, but it would not award fees if a business was using the FOIA to obtain data relating to a competitor or as a substitute for discovery in private litigation with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Under the second criterion a court would usually allow recovery of fees where the complainant was indigent or a nonprofit public interest group versus [sic] but would not if it was a large corporate interest (or a representative of such an interest). For the purposes of applying this criterion, news interests should not be considered commercial interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">Under the third criterion a court would generally award fees if the complainant\u2019s interest in the information sought was scholarly or journalistic or public-interest oriented, but would not do so if his interest was of a frivolous or purely commercial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Finally, under the fourth criterion a court would not award fees where the government\u2019s withholding had a colorable basis in law but would ordinarily award them if the withholding appeared to be merely to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>embarrassment or to frustrate the requester. Whether the case involved a return to court by the same complainant seeking the same or similar documents a second time should be considered by the court under this criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">It should be noted that the criteria . are intended to provide guidance and direction \u2014 not airtight standards \u2014 for courts to use in determining awards of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">S.Rep. No. 854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>House Comm, on Gov\u2019t Operations &amp; Senate Comm, on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1974, pt. 1, at 171 (Joint Comm. Print 1975) [hereinafter cited as Legislative History],</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">These criteria were expressly stated in S. 2543, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), as passed by the Senate. House and Senate conferees, however, dropped specific mention of the criteria from the final bill. The Conference Report stated: By eliminating these criteria, the conferees do not intend to make the award of attorney fees automatic or to preclude the courts, in exercising their discretion as to awarding such fees, to take into consideration such criteria. Instead, the conferees believe that because the existing body of law on the award of attorney fees recognizes such factors, a statement of the criteria may be too delimiting and is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-16\">H.R.Rep. No. 1380, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History 227. Courts have, in fact, used these suggested criteria in judging requests for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See, e. g., Blue v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>570 F.2d 529 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Kaye v. Burns, </em>411 F.Supp. 897, 903-05 (S.D.N.Y.1976). <em>See also Nationwide Bldg. Maintenance, Inc. v.
