In 1971, petitioner was sentenced to concurrent terms of five and twenty years following his conviction on charges of conspiracy to rob and aiding and abetting in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Petitioner\u2019s application contained a variety of claims; however, the district court dismissed all claims except the claim which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. On April 2, 1979, an evidentiary hearing on that claim was held before the United States Magistrate. At the hearing, petitioner alleged that his attorney (1) failed to confer adequately with petitioner in connection with the preparation of the defense in advance of trial; (2) failed to interview the government\u2019s witnesses in preparation for trial; (3) failed to call certain material witnesses in his defenses; and (4) failed to take a timely appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The Magistrate found that based on the attorney\u2019s testimony and conduct at trial as reflected in the trial transcript, petitioner was not entitled to relief based upon his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court approved and adopted the Magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">We have carefully studied the record, including the Magistrate\u2019s opinion and the briefs of the parties to this action. We find no merit to petitioner\u2019s arguments, and accordingly affirm pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court on the basis of the Magistrate\u2019s findings as adopted by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
