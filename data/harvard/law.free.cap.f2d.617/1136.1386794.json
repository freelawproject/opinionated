CLARK, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">We are asked to decide whether the Estate of Arthur Dwight Haas (hereinafter the \u201cHaas Estate\u201d) is entitled to recover from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cMGM\u201d) $20,665.84 which the appellant contends MGM improperly paid directly to Mr. Lewis Jeffrey Selznick, son of the late movie producer David 0. Selznick. The district court granted MGM\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Mr. Haas had not properly notified MGM of the assignment under \u00a7 9-318(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">As most filmgoers certainly know, David 0. Selznick\u2019s greatest film triumph was the 1939 movie <em>Gone With the Wind. </em>In an effort to resolve certain disputes between David Selznick\u2019s company, The Selznick Company, Inc., and MGM concerning the radio and television rights to the novel <em>Gone With the Wind, </em>they agreed in 1963 that The Selznick Company would become entitled to a royalty payment of $200,000 by MGM upon the first television broadcast in this country of the movie <em>Gone With the Wind. </em>The agreement also provided that should the movie first be telecast outside the United States, $50,000 of the $200,000 would be payable immediately with the remaining $150,000 payable upon the first United States telecast. The Selznick Company was liquidated shortly after David Selznick\u2019s death in 1965. The Selznick Company\u2019s rights under the 1963 Agreement ultimately passed to David Selznick\u2019s various legatees, including his son, Lewis Jeffrey Selznick. Thus, upon the first telecast of <em>Gone With the Wind, </em>Lewis J. Selznick would become entitled to a share of the $200,000 royalty payment from MGM. His share constituted 23% of 59.901% of the $200,000, or $27,554.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-14\">In early 1975, Mr. A. D. Haas agreed to assist Lewis Jeffrey Selznick (\u201cSelznick\u201d) in several business ventures, including a Dallas, Texas, retail clothing store. As part of this arrangement, Haas loaned Selznick several hundred thousand dollars. To secure the loans Selznick granted Haas a security interest in his right to payment of his share of the television royalties from the first television broadcast of <em>Gone With the Wind. </em>However, at that time both parties had no way of knowing exactly when or where the movie would be shown first on television.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-15\">The security agreement, executed on June 23, 1975, specified that Lewis J. Selznick \u201cGRANTS AND ASSIGNS\u201d to Haas, \u201ca security interest in the following described property . . . \u201d :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-16\">All of Debtor\u2019s [Selznick\u2019s] rights in and under the MGM Agreement including without limitation, the right to receive income or profits, whether such rights are now owned or hereafter acquired and whether such income or profits are distributed in cash or property, and any and all proceeds or accounts, arising from or by virtue of the sale or other disposition of, or from any insurance payable with respect to or from the collection of, the Collateral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-17\">In addition, Selznick and Haas jointly notified MGM\u2019s legal department of Haas\u2019 security agreement by the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1201-18\">June 23, 1975</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiS\">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. 10202 West Washington Blvd. Culver City, California 90230</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>Attention: General Counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-3\">Re: Telecast of \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-4\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-5\">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) under which the Company will be entitled to a payment from MGM of $200,000.00 upon the first television broadcast in the United States of the photoplay \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d (the \u201cFilm\u201d), with $50,000.00 of such $200,-000.00 due to the Company upon the first foreign telecast of the Film if such telecast takes place prior to the first telecast in the United States. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company also owns a 50% interest in the net profits of MGM from the exploitation of certain radio and television rights related to the Film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-6\">All rights of the Company under the Agreement hav\u00e9 now passed to the legatees, including L.

We, therefore, request that MGM do the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-7\">(1) Notify Mr. Haas, in advance, of any payments to be made under the Agreement and disburse the portion due to Mr. Selznick as Mr. Haas and Mr. Selznick shall jointly direct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-8\">(2) Notify Mr. Haas of any event which materially affects the rights of Mr. Selznick under the Agreement, including any arrangement by MGM for exploitation of radio or television rights related to the Film.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-9\">(3) Acknowledge receipt of this notification by executing the enclosed copy in the space provided and returning it to A.

Pursuant to the terms of the 1963 Agreement, Lewis Selznick became entitled to payment of his share of $50,000 in royalties, or $6,888.62. Consistent with its prior refusal, MGM made no attempt to comply with the Haas and Selznick joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>letter before drawing a cheek dated October 6,1975, payable to Selznick, and forwarding the same to Mr. Brannen on October 9, 1975. The check was then transmitted to Selznick who ultimately endorsed the check over to the Haas Estate. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that either Selznick or the Haas Estate protested MGM\u2019s or Mr. Brannen\u2019s handling of this first royalty payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\"><em>Gone With the Wind </em>was first telecast in this country in June, 1976. At that time MGM paid the remaining $150,000 to David Selznick\u2019s legatees, including $20,665.84 to Lewis Jeffrey Selznick. This time, however, MGM sent its check directly to Selznick at his home in Jamaica. Instead of endorsing the check over to the Haas Estate, Selznick deposited the check in his bank account and did not apply those funds to his indebtedness to the Haas Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Thereafter, apparently unable to obtain the cooperation of Mr. Selznick, the Haas Estate wrote MGM on November 3, 1976, advising the company that Selznick had defaulted in his obligations to the Estate. The Haas Estate requested that all payments due Selznick be made directly to it. MGM responded on November 10 that all payments by MGM due to Selznick under the 1963 Agreement had already been made. Upon MGM\u2019s refusal to accede to the demand of the Haas Estate that MGM pay the Estate the $20,665.84 which had already been paid directly to Selznick, this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">The single issue presented by this appeal is whether the <em>Gone With the Wind </em>royalty payments were effectively assigned by Selznick to the Haas Estate under the guidelines contained in Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-318(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If there was an effective assignment by Selznick (the \u201cassignor\u201d) to Haas (the \u201cassignee\u201d), then MGM (the \u201caccount debtor\u201d) was not authorized to pay the royalty payments directly to Selznick. Without such authorization, and there was none here, the account debt- or can be held liable to the assignee for the amount of the assigned payment, here $20,-665.84. Thus, if an account debtor fails to follow the dictates of a valid assignment and improperly pays the assignor, the account debtor must answer to the assignee with a \u201cdouble payment\u201d in the amount of the improper payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-15\">UCC \u00a7 9318(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-16\">The account debtor is authorized to pay the assignor until the account debtor receives notification that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to made made to the assignee. A notification which does not reasonably identify the rights assigned is ineffective. If requested by the account debtor, the assignee must seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made and unless he does so the account debtor may pay the assignor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHJ\">Thus, in order for there to be an effective assignment under \u00a7 9-318(3), the account debtor must be notified of two things. First, he must receive notice that the \u201camount due or to become due has been assigned.\u201d Second, the account debtor must also be notified that \u201cpayment is to be made to the assignee.\u201d <em>See, First National Bank of Rio Arriba </em>v. <em>Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>91 N.M. 126, 571 P.2d 118 (1977); <em>First National Bank at East St. Louis v. Board of Education, District No. 189, </em>68 Ill.App.3d 21, 24 Ill.Dec. 670, 385 N.E.2d 811 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-17\">Here, although the parties arguably met the first requirement of \u00a7 9-318(3) in that the June 23, 1975, letter from Selznick and Haas to MGM did advise the latter that, \u201cL. Jeffrey Selznick has granted to A. D. Haas a security interest in all of the rights of L. Jeffrey Selznick under the Agreement,\u201d it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>is not necessary to decide that issue since we find that the second requirement of \u00a7 9-318(3) was not met under the peculiar facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Instead of notifying MGM that payment of the film royalties was to be made directly to Haas as assignee, Selzniek and Haas included in their June 23 letter a request that MGM should \u201c[njotify Mr. Haas, in advance, of any payments to be made under the Agreement and disburse the portion due to Mr. Selzniek as Mr. Haas and Mr. Selzniek shall jointly direct.\u201d Clearly, this is not a demand certain that MGM, as account debtor, pay Selznick\u2019s share of the <em>Gone With the Wind </em>television royalties directly to Haas. Here, Selzniek and Haas, as assignor and assignee, respectively, requested MGM as account debtor to notify only the assignee when payment on the account became due and then await the joint payment instructions from the assign- or and assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">On oral argument appellant urged strenuously that due to, (1) the uncertainty at the time of the June 23 letter and security agreement as to when and where <em>Gone With the Wind </em>would first be telecast, and (2) the additional uncertainty whether Haas would need to rely on his security interest for partial satisfaction of Selznick\u2019s indebtedness, the prepayment notification request was the only reasonable demand to make of MGM. Thus, because of the conditional nature of the \u201cassignment,\u201d a \u00a7 9-318(3) notice to MGM to make payment directly to Haas was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">We recognize that the purpose of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code \u201cis to provide a simple and unified structure within which the immense variety of present-day secured financing transactions can go forward with less cost and with greater certainty.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are also aware of the uncertainty of Selzniek and Haas with respect to the payment of the royalties. However, in light of events subsequent to the June 23, 1975, letter, we find that the assignment, even if initially valid under \u00a7 9-318(3), lacked continued vitality after those events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Official Comment 3 to \u00a7 9-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1204-8\">So long as the assignee permits the assignor to collect claims . ., the account debtor may pay the assignor even though he may know of the assignment. In such a situation an assignee who wants to take over collections must notify the account debtor to make further payments to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">Thus, even though an account debtor is aware that a valid assignment has been made, if the account debtor continues to pay the assignor and the assignee does not object, the account debtor is not bound by the assignment. <em>See, Ertel v. Radio Corporation of America, </em>261 Ind. 573, 575, 307 N.E.2d 471, 473 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">MGM responded promptly to the joint June 23 notification letter that it refused to comply with the request to notify Mr. Haas of any impending royalty payment. At no time before the two payments were made did either Mr. Haas, the Haas Estate, or Mr. Selzniek respond to MGM\u2019s July 10, 1975, refusal to assent to the request in the initial attempted assignment. Furthermore, both Selzniek and the Haas Estate acquiesced in MGM\u2019s refusal to comply with the June 23 request when the first royalty payment was made in October, 1975, directly to Selzniek. Although this check for $6,888.62 was ultimately endorsed to the Haas Estate, it was on notice that MGM was not complying and, indeed, had not complied with the notification scheme proposed by Selzniek and Haas. Alerted to the possibility that the second royalty payment would be paid directly to Selzniek upon the first domestic telecast of <em>Gone With the Wind, </em>the Haas Estate did nothing. No attempt was made by either Selzniek or the Haas Estate to instruct MGM that the second payment was to be made to the assignee-Haas Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-12\">The Haas Estate\u2019s letter to MGM in November, 1976, complaining that MGM should have complied with the June 23, 1975, request for prepayment notification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>came too late. In light of this acquiescence to both the MGM refusal and the method used for the first royalty payment, coupled with the fact that no request was timely made of MGM that payment be made to the Haas Estate, we hold that the assignment under \u00a7 9-318(3), even if initially effective, was invalidated by this inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">We find it unnecessary to decide whether the assignment was valid because of the peculiar facts of this case. The judgment below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">. <em>Cal.Com.Code </em>\u00a7 9318(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">. <em>Cal.Com.Code </em>\u00a7 9318(3) was amended in 1974, effective Jan. 1, 1976, as part of the adoption of the proposed 1972 Amendments to Article 9 of the UCC. The words in the first sentence of \u00a7 9318(3) \u201camount due or to become due\u201d replaced the word \u201caccount.\u201d Since this minor change in the statute does not affect the case sub <em>judice </em>in any way, it is of no matter which version of \u00a7 9318(3) is applicable to the assignment at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1204-13\">.
