Vicknair and FBV Corporation were served with jeopardy assessments pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the tax years 1975 and 1976, in the total sum of $313,686.38. They sought administrative review of the assessments in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the assessments were up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>held they sought judicial review as prescribed by \u00a7 7429. The district court, 452 F.Supp. 470, found the jeopardy assessments reasonable and approved their imposition. These appeals follow. We dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">Jeopardy assessments, as sanctioned by \u00a7 6861 of the Internal Revenue Code, are employed by the IRS to prevent suspected individuals from fleeing without paying taxes or from dissipating assets while tax liabilities are calculated. Affected taxpayers may endure tremendous hardships because assets are virtually frozen for the duration of the jeopardy decree. This procedure has been the subject of criticism because of hardships occasioned by delays sometimes encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">To alleviate the severity of this procedure, the Tax Reform Act of 1976 authorized prompt review to insure the propriety of the assessment. This Act affords the taxpayer, on an expedited basis, administrative review by the IRS and judicial review by the federal district court. Section 7429(f), entitled \u201cfinality of determination,\u201d specifically limits judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-6\">Any determination made by a district court under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewed by any other court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-7\">The statutory language being clear, resort to the legislative history is not necessary. However, a review discloses this comment in the Senate Committee Report accompanying \u00a7 7429(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-8\">. a determination by the district court <em>may not be appealed to or reviewed by any other court. </em>(Emphasis added.) S.Rep.No. 94-938, 94th Cong., 2nd Sess. p. 365, reprinted in [1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News pp. 2897, 3794.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">Congress has chosen precise and concise language to express its intent; we heed its directions. We do not have jurisdiction. Under the clear mandate of \u00a7 7429(f), we may not entertain these appeals and they are, accordingly, DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">Authority for making. \u2014 If the Secretary or his delegate believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency, as defined in section 6211, will be jeopardized by delay, he shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6213(a), immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the Secretary or his delegate for the payment thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-10\">7429.
