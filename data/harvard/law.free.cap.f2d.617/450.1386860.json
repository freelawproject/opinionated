(\u201cPark-Ohio\u201d), filed this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, alleging that defendant-appellee Letica Corporation (\u201cLetica\u201d) had infringed Park-Ohio\u2019s patented design for securing plastic lids or closures on plastic pails or buckets used as containers for shipping materials by rail or truck. Letica answered and counterclaimed, alleging invalidity of the patent and noninfringement, and also sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court (Hon. John Feikens) held that the patent is invalid in light of the prior art and that Letica\u2019s product in any event did not infringe the patented design. The court, however, refused to award attorney\u2019s fees to Letica.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">We agree with the district court that the patent-in-suit is invalid. We therefore have no need to deal with the infringement issue. In all other respects, including the denial of attorney\u2019s fees, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">Park-Ohio is a manufacturer of plastic containers used for shipping chemicals, paints and other commodities by truck and rail. It is the owner of the \u201cYates patent,\u201d the patent-in-suit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This patent is a design for fastening plastic lids to the tops of plastic shipping containers or pails. The lid (closure) is circular with an inverted U-shaped channel along its perimeter which fits over the top edge of the pail, said edge having an outside annular ridge or bead. The two sides of the inverted U-shaped channel are referred to as the \u201cinner leg\u201d and \u201couter leg.\u201d The inner leg rests against the inside upper wall of the pail, while the outer leg provides the foundation for the locking mechanism. On the inside of the inverted U-shaped channel, as part of the outer leg, is a raised surface or bead, the upper side of which is \u201csubstantially perpendicular\u201d to the outer leg and which presents a flat abutment surface that snaps tightly under the annular ridge at the top edge of the pail when the lid is pressed down and over it. This raised surface or bead is above the lower end of the outer leg. The lower edge of the outer leg is free and is thickened to give the lid \u201choop strength,\u201d so that the lid hugs the pail. The free end of the outer leg is continuous, and above the continuous free end on the outer leg are apertures (holes) approximately every four inches. These holes are so placed to aid in cutting through the outer leg with a knife, thus creating tabs which can then be raised upwardly to disengage the locking mechanism and remove the lid. Since the bead on the inner side of the outer leg is above the lower free end thereof, a tool (such as a knife) receiving recess is thereby created and allows insertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>therein and cutting upwardly to the apertures to create the aforesaid tabs. The primary advantage of the Yates design, according to the teaching of the patent, is that it is \u201ctamper proof\u201d in that the lid cannot be removed without severing the outer leg and lifting the then created tabs; and once such severing takes place, it is obvious that the lid has been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">THE PRIOR ART</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Park-Ohio alleged infringement of Claim 2 of the Yates patent and its dependent claims, 3, 5, 6, and 9. These claims specifically set forth the lid locking mechanism previously described.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a defense to the infringement action, Letica contended that the Yates patent was invalid in light of the prior art. The district court held that the Yates patent was substantially indistinguishable from earlier patents issued to R. V. Bardell<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and R. S. Hurtt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The prior art Bardell patent application was filed on December 3, 1968 and granted on July 7,1970. It too provided for an inverted U-shaped channel in its lid with locking element molded to the outer leg. The Bardell abutment was rounded, however, in contrast to the \u201cessentially flat and substantially perpendicular\u201d abutment of the Yates patent. Although Park-Ohio claims that this difference is one of the inventive features of the Yates patent, this perpendicular locking abutment was revealed by the prior art (Hurtt patent) and, further, it would in any event have been obvious, as the district judge found, that a flat surface would produce a more effective locking device with the bead on the rim of the pail. A patent may not be obtained where the differences between the invention and the prior art would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. We therefore hold that the flat and perpendicular locking surface was anticipated by Hurtt and in any event was obvious to one skilled in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Another issue is presented by Park-Ohio\u2019s contention that the Yates patent is distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>guishable from Bardell because of its lid removal design. As previously noted, the Yates design calls for a series of apertures in the outer leg so that a knife or other tool can be inserted into them and then forced down, sectioning the continuous outer leg into pivotable tabs, which can then be lifted to remove the lid. The Yates patent also teaches, as a preferred method of removing the lid, that the tool receiving recess at the free end of the outer leg allows the continuous free end to be cut upwardly, from the inside out, to the apertures above, thus creating the tabs, and without risk of scratching or puncturing the pail. The file wrapper history shows that the patent application was approved upon the pointing out by counsel of the tool receiving recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Although the Bardell patent employs a substantially identical locking system, the removal procedure is somewhat different. Bardell discloses the use of four triangular grooves or, alternatively, perforated lines (tear lines) running from the free end of the outer leg to a point above the level of the abutment. The lower inner edge of the outer leg is undercut so that a screwdriver or other tool may be wedged therein to break the tear lines, thereby sectioning the outer leg into pivotable tabs. The Bardell patent also disclosed, as stated, that the <em>grooved </em>tear lines could be replaced with <em>perforated </em>tear lines. The district court reasoned that the apertures (holes) employed in Yates\u2019 design were functionally equivalent to the perforations (holes) used in Bardell\u2019s patent and that, therefore, the Yates patent embraced a design already anticipated by Bardell. We find no fault in the district court\u2019s reasoning in this regard. It is also worth noting that the lid manufactured by Park-Ohio, pursuant to the Yates design, has elongated slots approximately <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>/i6\" long. The slot therefore resembles the perforated or grooved tear lines of Bar-dell.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For these reasons, we cannot say that the district judge erred in holding that the Yates apertures were already disclosed by the Bardell patent, nor can we say that the tool receiving recess also was not 'disclosed by Bardell.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Park-Ohio now appears to urge that this focus in the district court on apertures, perforations and holes diverted attention from what it now considers to be its primary contention which is that the \u201ccontinuous free end\u201d of the outer leg was the inventive feature of the Yates patent, distinguishing it from Bardell\u2019s design, which, Park-Ohio contends, did not have a continuous free end. As described previously, the Yates design contemplated the use of a continuous outer leg consisting of thickened plastic at the lower edge. Ostensibly, this feature gave \u201choop strength\u201d to the outer leg, ensuring that the locking system did not disengage during shipping. In Bardell, the free end is likewise continuous, or substantially continuous, although there are tear lines, as indicated, to aid the removal of the lid. Therefore, while the Yates design may provide for more hoop strength, it does not deviate significantly from the principle employed in Bardell\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY, ESTOP-PEL, AND COMMERCIAL SUCCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Park-Ohio contends that the Yates patent is entitled to a presumption of validity and that Letica did not overcome that presumption in the district court. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. We believe, however, that the failure of the examiner, Hall, who was also the examiner for the Bardell patent, to cite such highly relevant prior art as Bardell and Hurtt in the patent file history seriously weakens this presumption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Reynolds Metals Co. v. Acorn Bldg. Components, Inc., </em>548 F.2d 155, 160 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>Bolkcom v. Carborundum Co., </em>523 F.2d 492, 498 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>1725, 48 L.Ed.2d 194 (1975); <em>Schnadig Corp. v. Gaines Mfg. Co., </em>494 F.2d 383, 390 (6th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Park-Ohio also argues that Letica should be bound by a prior \u201cadmission\u201d that the Yates design was nonobvious. Specifically, Park-Ohio argues that because Mr. Letica applied, although unsuccessfully, for a patent on the accused closures, which in Park-Ohio\u2019s opinion are identical to the Yates closures, this filing and prosecution of a patent constitutes an admission that the \u201cYates-Letica\u201d closures were nonobvious even in light of Bardell. In support of this contention appellants cite the case of <em>Winslow Mfg. Co. v. Peerless Gauge Co., </em>202 F.Supp. 931, 937 (N.D.Ohio 1958), a case which we find inapposite. The <em>Winslow </em>case did not hold against defendant because of its earlier representations at the Patent Office. The court merely noted that it was deciding to uphold the validity of the patent-in-suit on the same rationale used by defendant when it was attempting to persuade the Patent Office of its invention\u2019s nonobviousness. The court therefore decided the issue of patent validity on the basis of a comparison between the invention and the prior art, and not on the basis of some form of estoppel as urged by appellants in the instant case. We therefore hold that the Letica application and prosecution of a patent does not constitute any type of admission of or estoppel as to the nonobviousness of the Yates design.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Park-Ohio also argues that the commercial success of its product constitutes a strong indication of the validity of the patent-in-suit. The Supreme Court, however, has recognized that commercial success is only a secondary consideration in determining the validity of a patent. <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684, 693-694, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). Moreover, the district court found, which is not clearly wrong, that Park-Ohio\u2019s product is not covered by the claims of the Yates patent in that the abutment surface is not flat and perpendicular but angled about ten to twenty-two degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">We have carefully considered Park-Ohio\u2019s other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Title 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 provides that \u201c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party\u201d in patent actions. In this case, the district court did make an award of attorney\u2019s fees to defendant Letica Corporation. Then, however, it failed to make any findings of fact or conclusions of law in this regard. In so doing, the court in effect denied attorney\u2019s fees to defendant. An award of attorney\u2019s fees cannot stand absent a specific finding by the district court that brings the case within the meaning of the term \u201cexceptional\u201d as set forth in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. <em>Uniflow Mfg. Co. v. King-Seeley Thermos Co., </em>428 F.2d 335, 341 (6th Cir. 1970). Defendant Letica, therefore, now cross-appeals for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The decision to award or deny attorney\u2019s fees rests within the discretion of the district court. <em>Hoge Warren Zimmermann Co. v. Nourse &amp; Co., </em>293 F.2d 779 (6th Cir. 1961). After due consideration, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">The judgment below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-15\">.
