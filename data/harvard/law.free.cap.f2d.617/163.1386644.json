The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ultimately held that although the regulation was invalid on both statutory and constitutional grounds, the defendants \u2014 Nebraska welfare officials \u2014 had not enforced it in bad faith and therefore were not liable for compensatory or punitive damages. The court further held that the plaintiffs were entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, but limited the award to a nominal amount because plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys worked for a legal aid organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">The principal issues on appeal are (1) whether the district court had jurisdiction, and if so, (2) whether the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fee award was proper. Although we conclude the court had jurisdiction, we hold it abused its discretion in awarding only a token attorneys\u2019 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">1. Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Plaintiffs were recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Their eligibility for AFDC benefits depended on their financial need, which was determined by a calculation of their income and resources. See <em>generally </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In January 1969, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) issued a regulation specifying that, in the calculation of income and resources, \u201conly such net income as is actually available for current use on a regular basis will be considered and only currently available resources will be considered.\u201d <em>National Welfare Rights Organization v. Mathews, </em>174 U.S.App.D.C. 410, 420, 533 F.2d 637, 647 (D.C.Cir.1976) (quoting 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(c) (1974)). The Nebraska State Department of Public Welfare (the department) issued a similar regulation. Under this regulation, only the welfare recipient\u2019s equity in his automobile was considered as an available resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In March 1975, however, HEW issued a new regulation, which specified that the retail market value of a recipient\u2019s automobile, rather than his equity in it, must be considered as an available resource. On October 1, 1975, the department followed HEW\u2019s lead and implemented its own retail market value regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">As a result of the new regulation, the department revalued the resources attributable to plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles and notified them that their benefits would be suspended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, with the assistance of legal aid attorneys,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> then sued for equitable relief, compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">On November 1, 1976, the department rescinded the offending regulation and reverted to valuing automobiles on the basis of the amount of owner\u2019s equity. This action mooted plaintiffs\u2019 claim for equitable relief but left alive their claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">In January 1977, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a), to compel production of all departmental documents that recorded communications between the department and HEW concerning the retail market value regulation. The court reserved its ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 request for the expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">In January 1979, the district court issued its first ruling on the question of damages. The court held that the department\u2019s regulation was both statutorily and constitutionally invalid. The statutory holding followed from <em>National Welfare Rights Organization v. Mathews, supra, </em>533 F.2d at 647, which, in striking down the HEW regulation on which the Nebraska regulation was modeled, held that \u201cavailability is required by the statute [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7)]\u201d and that it was improper for HEW to contend \u201cthat because the property itself is available, gross market value (and not the equity) is available.\u201d That contention was \u201ccontrary to fiscal realities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">The constitutional holding followed from <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, 452, 93 S.Ct. 2230, 2236, 37 L.Ed.2d 63 (1973), which struck down a state university\u2019s policy of subjecting a student to a higher, nonresident tuition rate if he had been living outside the state at the time he applied for admission to college. The Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause forbade the state university</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to deny an individual the resident rates on the basis of a permanent and irrebuttable presumption of nonresidence, when that presumption is not necessarily or universally true in fact, and when the State has reasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 452, 93 S.Ct. at 2236. The district court invoked <em>Vlandis </em>to rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">[t]he defendants\u2019 promulgation and enforcement of the regulation here created a conclusive and irrebuttable presumption that the entire gross market value of an encumbered automobile was available as a current resource and could be converted \u25a0into cash when in fact only whatever equity the person had in the automobile was available as a resource to meet their needs. The alternative means were simply to determine the equity, which was the policy which had previously been in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Oldham v. Ehrlich, </em>No. 76-L-175, slip op. at 11 (D.Neb. Jan. 29, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Upon ruling the regulation invalid, the court initially held the defendants liable for compensatory and punitive damages, but subsequently decided that defendants enjoyed official immunity under <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975), because they had basis for a good faith belief in the regulation\u2019s validity. The court\u2019s final order granted no injunctive or monetary relief but awarded plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees of $1000 plus costs incurred with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 37 motion to produce. The court noted that \u201c[t]he services rendered [by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys] are actually worth a great deal more\u201d than $1000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but thought it important that those attorneys \u201care employees of a private nonprofit agency whose duty and whose opportunity is to protect people such as they are here protecting.\u201d <em>Oldham v. Ehrlich, </em>No. 76-L-175, slip op. at 4 (D.Neb. Sept. 28, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">II. Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The department contends that the present action, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 with federal jurisdiction asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), (4), should have been dismissed under <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). The Court in <em>Chapman </em>held that, as far as section 1343 is concerned, a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction does not encompass actions based solely on conflicts between state welfare regulations and the Social Security Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court explained that section 1343 vests jurisdiction in federal courts only over actions brought to vindicate rights \u201csecured by the Constitution,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), by any federal law \u201cproviding for equal rights,\u201d <em>id., </em>or by any federal law \u201cproviding for the protection of civil rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>(4). A section 1983 action that simply asserts the inconsistency of a state welfare regulation with the Social Security Act necessarily invokes a right secured by the Supremacy Clause, but does not seek to vindicate any right \u201csecured by the Constitution\u201d within the meaning of section 1343. <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 611\u201415, 99 S.Ct. at 1913-15. Nor does the action seek to vindicate rights secured by an equal rights or civil rights law, for neither section 1983 nor the Social Security Act qualifies as such. <em>Id. </em>at 615-23, 99 S.Ct. at 1915-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">The plaintiffs, acknowledging that their Social Security Act-Supremacy Clause claim did not give the district court jurisdiction, assert that their constitutional claim was substantial. They point out that, given a substantial constitutional claim, the district court could hear their Social Security Act claim as a matter of pendent jurisdiction. <em>E. g., Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1378, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974). <em>See Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, supra, </em>441 U.S. at 618 n.36, 99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>S. Ct. at 1916 n.36 (\u201cWhere the underlying right is based on the Constitution itself, rather than an Act of Congress, \u00a7 1343(3) obviously provides jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 675, 99 S.Ct. at 1946. (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\u201cToday\u2019s decision may not have a great effect on the scope of federal jurisdiction. * * * [E]ven a welfare recipient with a federal statutory claim may sue in a federal court if his lawyer can link this claim to a substantial constitutional contention. And under the standard of substantiality established by <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra </em>[415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577], such a constitutional claim would not be hard to construct.\u201d). The department responds that the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim is obviously frivolous and therefore cannot support jurisdiction over the Social Security Act-Supremacy Clause claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The nub of the jurisdictional question, then, is whether plaintiffs asserted a non-frivolous constitutional claim. The district court held their claim was not only non-frivolous but warranted a ruling that the Nebraska regulation was unconstitutional in addition to being contrary to the Social Security Act. When analyzed under the appropriate equal protection standard of \u201crational basis,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> e. <em>g., Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 487, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), the retail market value regulation was arguably irrational as a means of measuring the resources of AFDC recipients in that, by assuming a car worth $4000 on which a family still owed $2000 represented $4000 in resources, the regulation \u201cdefie[d] the laws of economics and punishe[d] welfare recipients for the type of credit purchases also common to working families.\u201d <em>National Welfare Rights Organization v. Mathews, supra, </em>533 F.2d at 648. Of course, on the other hand, perhaps the regulation was defensible as a means of implementing a policy decision to discourage purchases on credit, to prevent accumulation of luxury items, to assure a difference between assets of working and welfare families, and to cut welfare costs. <em>See id. </em>Whatever a fullblown equal protection analysis might reveal, we cannot say plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim was \u201cessentially fictitious,\u201d \u201cwholly insubstantial,\u201d \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d or such that \u201cprior decisions inescapably render the claim[] frivolous.\u201d <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 537, 538, 94 S.Ct. at 1379. We therefore hold that plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claim was substantial enough to allow the district court to take pendent jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 Social Security Act claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>III. Attorneys\u2019 Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Plaintiffs maintain that they, as the prevailing parties in a section 1983 action, were eligible to receive a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976) and that it was improper to award them only a token fee on account of their attorneys\u2019 status as employees of legal aid organizations. The department responds that the plaintiffs did not prevail inasmuch as their request for injunctive relief became moot and their request for damages was ultimately denied. The department nevertheless accepts the district court\u2019s $1000 award of attorneys\u2019 fees as compensation for services performed in relation to plaintiffs\u2019 successful motion to produce and as compensation for the expenses incurred by the department\u2019s delay in adducing evidence of a good faith belief in the validity of its regulation. The department does not defend the award on the basis that plaintiffs had legal aid attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The first point to determine is whether plaintiffs prevailed for purposes of section 1988. Although the Nebraska regulation was amended before this case reached a trial on the merits,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiffs are considered the prevailing parties if the offending but now discontinued policy would have been declared invalid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., Inmates of the Nebraska Penal &amp; Correctional Complex v. Greenholtz, </em>567 F.2d 1381, 1384 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>433 F.2d 421, 429-30 (8th Cir. 1970). Had not defendants rescinded their regulation, it is virtually certain it would have been held invalid as contrary to the Social Security Act under <em>National Welfare Rights Organization v. Mathews, supra. </em>Given that plaintiffs had a non-frivolous constitutional claim, they may receive attorneys\u2019 fees as the prevailing parties on their pendent non-constitutional claim. <em>Kimbrough v. Arkansas Activities Association, </em>574 F.2d 423, 426 (8th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">Next to decide is whether the court acted within its discretion in reducing the attorneys\u2019 fees award because plaintiffs had legal aid attorneys. Although a court may consider a large number of factors in arriving at a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, e. <em>g., Zoll v. Eastern Allamakee Community School District, </em>588 F.2d 246, 252 &amp; n.11 (8th Cir. 1978), we conclude it is inappropriate to consider that the prevailing plaintiff\u2019s attorney was working for a legal aid organization. The basic purpose of section 1988 \u2014 to encourage enforcement and observance of civil rights \u2014 permits no distinction between private attorneys and legal aid organizations. Legal aid organizations can expand their services to indigent civil rights complaints by virtue of their receipt of attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And a defendant sued by a plaintiff retaining legal aid counsel should not be benefited by the fortuity that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>could not afford private counsel. Thus, whether the focus is on enabling suit by those otherwise unable to afford litigation, or on deterring misconduct by imposing a monetary burden upon the wrongdoer, a legal aid organization merits an attorney\u2019s fee fully as much as does the private attorney. <em>Accord, Lund v. Affleck, </em>442 F.Supp. 1109, 1111-12 (D.R.I.1977), aff'd, 587 F.2d 75, 76 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Rodriguez v. Taylor, </em>569 F.2d 1231, 1245-46 (3d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 913, 98 S.Ct. 2254, 56 L.Ed.2d 414 (1978); <em>Hairston v. R &amp; R Apartments, </em>510 F.2d 1090, 1092 (7th Cir. 1975) ; <em>Incarcerated Men of Allen County Jail v. Fair, </em>507 F.2d 281, 286 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Brandenburger v. Thompson, </em>494 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir. 1974). <em>But see EEOC v. Enterprise Association Steamfitters Local 638, </em>542 F.2d 579, 593 (2d Cir. 1976) (no abuse of discretion to award federally subsidized public interest law firm less than a non-federally subsidized law firm).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Although we otherwise affirm the district court, we remand for determination of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees based upon the appropriate factors.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-22\">.

Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys indicated spending over 120 hours on the case, and requested compensation at the rate of $40.00 per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-13\">. Of course, a Social Security Act claim would itself vest jurisdiction in a federal court if the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a). The amount in controversy here was well below that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">. As noted, the district court rested its constitutional holding on <em>Vlandis v. Kline, supra. </em>We confess some difficulty with this reliance in light of the strong criticism of the use of <em>Vlandis </em>\u2019 \u201cirrebuttable presumption doctrine\u201d as an independent basis on which to find a statute invalid, e. <em>g., </em>Note, <em>The Irrebuttable Presumption Doctrine in the Supreme Court, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. 1534, 1544-56 (1974); <em>see generally L. </em>Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 16-32 (1978), and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 767-85, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2467-76, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), which upheld a social security provision that denied survivor\u2019s benefits to a wife or child whose relationship with the deceased wage earner had lasted less than nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The <em>Weinberger </em>Court declined to extend <em>Vlandis </em>to the social security requirement there in question. Reasoning that such an extension of the irrebuttable presumption doctrine \u201cwould turn [the irrebuttable presumption] cases into a virtual engine of destruction for countless legislative judgments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 772, 95 S.Ct. at 2470, the Court ruled generally that governmental rules governing social insurance are valid, notwithstanding some overinclusion or underinclusion, so long as they are rationally based. <em>Id. </em>at 770, 776-77, 95 S.Ct. at 2472.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\"><em>Weinberger, </em>then, teaches that the appropriate constitutional challenge to a seemingly arbitrary welfare regulation uses the language of equal protection rather than due process. Nevertheless, the irrebuttable presumption doctrine partakes heavily of equal protection doctrine, <em>see, e. g., </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. at 1548 (\u201cstrange hybrid of due process and equal protection scrutiny\u201d). We therefore conclude that although plaintiffs (and the court below) may have chosen an inappropriate mode of constitutional analysis, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint implicitly raised the appropriate equal protection concerns. It is these concerns, not an irrebuttable presumption argument, that we examine for non-frivolousness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b231-15\">. Defendants also contend that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdue process argument is merely a restatement in other words of the supremacy clause argument decisively rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Chapman, supra </em>\u201d because \u201cthe protected prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>erty right arises out of the Social Security Act.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We disagree. Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claim was that the regulation was not authorized by statute; their constitutional claim was that if the regulation were authorized by statute, the statute was unconstitutional. These claims, of course, are similar; otherwise there would be no pendent jurisdiction. <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1138, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (claims must derive from \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact\u201d). But they are not identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. The court found that the department abandoned its regulation as a direct result of plaintiffs\u2019 suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. Defendants emphasize plaintiffs did not prevail on their claim for damages. Yet a party may be considered prevailing for purposes of section 1988 attorneys\u2019 fees without meeting success on every claim he has made. The degree of a plaintiff\u2019s success is appropriate to consider in gauging the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee to award, <em>see e. g., Brown v. Bathke, </em>588 F.2d 634, 638 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir. 1978), but once plaintiff has won success on a single substantial claim, he qualifies as a prevailing party, <em>see, e. g., id. </em>at 278-79. It is sufficient, then, for plaintiffs here to show they would have been entitled to injunctive relief had defendants not mooted their claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\">.
