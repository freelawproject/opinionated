It is used today on similar products. After the initial term of registration expired, ISC reregistered the mark in 1951. At that time the trademark examiner found that the mark had become \u201cdistinctive of applicant\u2019s goods\u201d; in other words, the trademark had become \u201cincontestable\u201d within the meaning of the Lanham Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-18\">After an intervening assignment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor-Am Agricultural Products, Inc. (\u201cNor-Am\u201d) acquired all rights in the mark \u201cLarvacide\u201d in 1957. Like its predecessors, Nor-Am sold tear gas composed primarily of chloropicrin under the \u201cLarvacide\u201d label as a grain fumigant for the control of bugs, insects, and rodents in grain elevators and bins. However, on August 13, 1970, Nor-Am notified its distributors that its \u201cLarvacide\u201d line of products had been discontinued and that orders could no longer be accepted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cLar-vacide\u201d products nevertheless remained for a time on distributors\u2019 shelves and continued to be sold. In its application for renewal of its \u201cLarvacide\u201d registration in April 1971, Nor-Am represented to the Patent and Trademark Office that \u201cLarvacide\u201d was \u201cstill in use in interstate commerce or in connection with fumigants intended for use as an exterminator of bugs, insects, slugs and rodents\u201d and that the label submitted at that time \u201cshows the mark as actually used on goods at the present time [April 5, 1971].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-19\">In November 1973, Nor-Am assigned all of its rights in its \u201cLarvacide\u201d trademark to Southwestern Grain Supply Company (\u201cSouthwestern\u201d), the predecessor in interest of plaintiff Soweco, Inc. (\u201cSoweco\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since that time Soweco has marketed grain fumigants, like those sold by Nor-Am, under the label \u201cLarvacide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Shell Chemical Company, a division of Shell Oil Company (\u201cShell\u201d), manufactures two products alleged to infringe on Sow-eco\u2019s trademark: (1) SHELL Poultry Spray &amp; Larvicide and (2) RABON \u00ae Oral Larvi-cide. Originally developed and marketed as two separate products,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> SHELL Poultry Spray &amp; Larvicide was first marketed in 1974. A liquid ordinarily used in spray form, this product can either be sprayed directly on birds to control mites and lice or sprayed on poultry droppings to inhibit the growth of larvae and maggots. Shell sells SHELL Poultry Spray &amp; Larvicide to a small number of distributors (ten to twelve) who resell it to poultry farmers. RA-BON \u00ae ! Oral Larvicide! is added to cattle feed to control fly larvae in manure. Developed in the late 1960\u2019s and first sold in 1972, RABON \u00ae Oral Larvicide is chiefly sold to feed companies for incorporation into their own brands of cattle feed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">In February 1976, Soweco brought suit against Shell, charging both trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), and unfair competition under state law. The district court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Trial on the issue of liability was held in February 1978. After several days of testimony the district court submitted 25 special issues to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After a day of deliberations, the jury was unable to answer all of the questions unanimously. After receiving an <em>Allen </em><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> charge, the jury returned a unanimous verdict on all issues the following afternoon. At plaintiff\u2019s request, the judge polled the jury. Although several jurors initially indicated that the answers to one or more of the special issues did not reflect their individual judgments, they subsequently explained their actions and affirmed the unanimity of the jury\u2019s answers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">Because the judge thought there was an \u201cirreconcilable conflict between the jurors\u2019 answers\u201d to some of the special issues, he granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a mistrial and ordered a new trial. Subsequently, however, the court issued a memorandum opinion granting judgment for Shell on plaintiff\u2019s Lanham Act claims and ordered cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cLarva-cide\u201d on the ground that the jury had found the mark to be a common descriptive name.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c). With respect to the state law unfair competition claim, the judge granted a judgment n. o. v. for the defendant. Soweco appeals from the court\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">\n<em>Trademark Infringement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-16\">Trademark cases often involve line drawing in areas that are inherently \u201cfuzzy.\u201d This problem is exacerbated in the instant case by the jury\u2019s contradictory answers to some inartfully worded special issues and the judge\u2019s subsequent attempts to reconcile those answers. For these reasons, it may be helpful to set out the basic principles of applicable trademark law<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> before turning to the jury\u2019s findings and the judge\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>Terms for which trademark protection is sought are customarily grouped into four categories:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. Although meant as pigeon-holes, these useful labels are instead central tones in a spectrum; they tend to merge at their edges and are frequently difficult to apply. <em>Vision Center </em>v. <em>Optics, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 111, 115 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 100 S.Ct. 668, 62 L.Ed.2d 646 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">A \u201cgeneric\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> term refers to \u201ca particular genus or class of which an individual article or service is but a member,\u201d <em>id.; Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., </em>537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976); it suggests the \u201cbasic nature of articles or services.\u201d <em>American Heritage Life Insurance Co. v. Heritage Life Insurance Co., </em>494 F.2d 3, 11 (5th Cir. 1974). A word may be generic of some things and not of others: \u201civory\u201d is generic of elephant tusks but arbitrary as applied to soap. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 9 n.6. A generic term can <em>never </em>become a trademark. <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., </em>561 F.2d 75, 79 (7th Cir. 1977) (citing <em>William R. Warner &amp; Co. v. Ely Lilly &amp; Co., </em>265 U.S. 526, 528, 44 S.Ct. 615, 616, 68 L.Ed. 1161 (1924)), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 751, 54 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978); <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 9. Moreover, if a registered mark <em>at any time </em>becomes generic with respect to a particular article, the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides for the cancellation of that mark\u2019s registration. See, e. <em>g., Haughton Elevator Co. v. Seeberger, </em>85 U.S.P.Q. 80 (1950) (the mark \u201cEscalator\u201d had become generic).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-15\">A \u201cdescriptive\u201d term \u201cidentifies a characteristic or quality of an article or service,\u201d <em>Vision Center, </em>596 F.2d at 115, as, for example, its color, odor, function, dimensions, or ingredients. <em>American Heritage, </em>494 F.2d at 11. Although descriptive marks are not automatically protectable, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e)(1),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> they may be registered if they have acquired secondary meaning for the consuming public.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1052(f).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Examples of descriptive marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>would be \u201cVision Center\u201d in reference to a place where one purchases eyeglasses, <em>Vision Center, supra, </em>or \u201cEVERREADY\u201d with reference to batteries or light bulbs. <em>Union Carbide Corp. v. Every-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976). As we noted in <em>Vision Center, </em>596 F.2d at 115 n.11, \u201cthe distinction between descriptive and generic terms is necessarily one of degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">A \u201csuggestive\u201d term \u201csuggests, rather than describes,\u201d some characteristic of the goods to which it is applied and requires the consumer to exercise his imagination to reach a conclusion as to the nature of those goods. <em>Vision Center, </em>596 F.2d at 115-16. If used as a trademark for refrigerators, the term \u201cPenguin\u201d would be suggestive. Suggestive terms require no proof of secondary meaning in order to be protected. <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">\u201cArbitrary\u201d or \u201cfanciful\u201d terms, such as \u201cKodak,\u201d bear no relationship to the product or service with which they are associated. Like suggestive terms, they may be registered without proof of secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Once a mark has been registered, proof of registration is prima facie evidence of the registrant\u2019s right to use the mark, but it does not preclude one who is sued for trademark infringement from proving \u201cany legal or equitable defense or defect which might have been asserted if such mark had not been registered.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(a). If, however, a registrant has used his mark in connection with the goods or services specified on his registration for five continuous years after the registration date, his mark is deemed \u201cincontestable,\u201d <em>id. </em>1065;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> his registration constitutes \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of his right to use the mark, subject only to the seven defenses enumerated in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> An \u201cincon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>testable\u201d mark cannot be challenged as lacking secondary meaning; such marks are conclusively presumed to be nondescriptive or to have acquired secondary meaning. <em>Union Carbide, </em>531 F.2d at 377. This is perhaps the most significant benefit that being \u201cincontestable\u201d \u2014 a \u201csuggestive\u201d if not \u201carbitrary\u201d term as applied to the status it describes \u2014 confers on a mark.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Among the several permissible defenses to an \u201cincontestable\u201d mark is the \u201cfair-use\u201d defense, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(4). <em>See </em>n.19, <em>supra. </em>That defense is available only when the allegedly infringing term is used not as a trademark but \u201cfairly and in good faith only to describe to users the goods and services of [a] party, or their geographic origin.\u201d <em>Id. See Venetianaire Corp. v. A &amp; P Import Co., </em>429 F.2d 1079, 1081-82 (5th Cir. 1970). The \u201cfair-use\u201d defense, in essence, forbids a trademark registrant to appropriate a descriptive term for his exclusive use and so prevent others from accurately describing a characteristic of their goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">Liability under the Lanham Act for trademark infringement is predicated on use of a registered trademark that \u201cis likely to cause confusion.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1)(a).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In this circuit likelihood of confusion is determined by evaluating a variety of factors, including the type of trademark at issue; similarity of design; similarity of product; identity of retail outlets and purchasers; identity of advertising media utilized; defendant\u2019s intent; and actual confusion. <em>Amstar Corp. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 258-259 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>1980) (citing <em>Roto-Rooter Corp. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>513 F.2d 44, 45 (5th Cir. 1975)). Proof of actual confusion is unnecessary; the <em>likelihood </em>of confusion is the determinative factor. <em>World Carpets, Inc. v. Dick Littrell\u2019s New World Carpets, </em>438 F.2d 482, 489 (5th Cir. 1971). Actual confusion is, however, strong proof that the likelihood of confusion exists. Moreover, \u201cwhile very little proof of actual confusion would be necessary to prove the likelihood of confusion, an almost overwhelming amount of proof would be necessary to refute such proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The likelihood of confusion is a question for the trier of fact. <em>Amstar, </em>615 F.2d at 257-258; <em>Boston Pro Hockey Association v. Dallas Cap &amp; Emblem Manufacturing, Inc., </em>510 F.2d 1004, 1012 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 868, 96 S.Ct. 132, 46 L.Ed.2d 98 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">We now turn to the instant facts. The jury in Special Issue Eighteen found that \u201cas of the present date [February 24, 1978] the word \u201clarvicide\u201d is the common descriptive name for an agent or substance for killing larvae.\u201d Defendant argues that this finding effectively disposes of plaintiff\u2019s trademark infringement claim: because the jury determined that larvicide had become <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> generic, plaintiff\u2019s mark was no longer entitled to trademark protection and was subject to cancellation under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c). <em>See </em>n.13, <em>supra. </em>The district judge, in his memorandum order, relied on this rationale to grant judgment for the defendant on the trademark claim and cancel plaintiff\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">There are two significant problems, however, with this approach. First, in the instruction that accompanied Special Issue Eighteen, the judge defined a \u201ccommon descriptive name\u201d with a definition of a <em>descriptive </em>term rather than a generic term.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is therefore arguable that the jury found only that \u201clarvicide\u201d is a <em>descriptive </em>mark since it assessed that word in terms of a descriptive definition. Second, the special issue did not require the jury to consider whether <em>plaintiff was using </em>the word \u201clar-vicide\u201d in its generic sense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As we have previously noted, \u201cprotection afforded trademarks by both the Lanham Act and the common law focuses on the <em>use </em>of words, not on their nature or meaning in the abstract.\u201d <em>Venetianaire, </em>429 F.2d at 1082 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Aber-crombie &amp; Fitch, </em>537 F.2d at 9. The instruction accompanying Special Issue Eighteen explicitly acknowledges that. <em>See </em>n.23, <em>supra. </em>Based on these problems with Special Issue Eighteen, plaintiff contends that the judge erred in finding for defendant on the trademark infringement claim and in cancelling plaintiff\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention is in part well taken: for the reasons discussed above, a judgment for defendant cannot rest on the jury\u2019s finding in Special Issue Eighteen that \u201clarvicide\u201d is a generic term. We conclude, however, that defendant is entitled to prevail on the basis of a fair-use defense.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See </em>p. 1185, <em>supra. </em>The fair-use defense requires that the allegedly infringing term be <em>\u201cdescriptive </em>of the goods.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(4) (emphasis added). There was ample evidence at trial that defendant\u2019s products, RABON\u00ae Oral Larvi-cide and SHELL Poultry Spray &amp; Larvi-cide, were primarily, if not exclusively, used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>to kill fly larvae. Although Soweco\u2019s president, Robert Bauman, disputed the <em>effectiveness </em>of Shell\u2019s products in killing larvae, he had stated in his deposition, which was read to the jury, that RABON\u00ae Oral Lar-vicide \u201ckills specifically larvae and nothing else.\u201d Walter Tramel, a chemist and private consultant who testified for plaintiff, stated on cross-examination that defendant\u2019s product names were \u201cprecisely descriptive\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and \u201centirely descriptive\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of defendant\u2019s products. Various defense witnesses also testified that Shell\u2019s use of the word \u201clarvicide\u201d in its product names was a descriptive or generic use of the term.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The evidence is thus overwhelming that Shell fairly used the word \u201clarvicide\u201d to describe its product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">To prevail on a fair-use defense, however, Shell must also show that it used the mark in good faith and that it did not use the term \u201cas a trade or service mark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The jury found in Special Issue Nineteen that Shell fairly and in good faith used the term only to describe the nature of its products and not as a trademark. Soweco attacks this finding on two grounds. First, Soweco contends that the verdict is not valid because it was not the decision of a unanimous jury. Second, plaintiff submits that the jury\u2019s answer to Special Issue Nineteen conflicts with its answers to Special Issues Eleven and Twelve. Neither of these contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-20\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s assertion, the jury verdict was unanimous. Although several jurors indicated that they had pressed for a different answer to certain special issues during the deliberations, when the jury was polled each juror affirmed the unanimity of the verdict.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s second challenge is grounded in an alleged inconsistency between Special Issue Nineteen and Special Issues Eleven and Twelve. In Special Issue Nineteen, the jury found that Shell \u201cused the word \u2018larvicide\u2019 otherwise than as a trademark.\u201d In Special Issues Eleven and Twelve, the jury found that Shell used each of the product names \u201cRABON \u00ae Oral Larvicide\u201d and \u201cPoultry Spray &amp; Larvicide\u201d \u201cas a word combination adopted by Shell to identify its goods and to distinguish it from those manufactured or sold by another.\u201d These answers, however, are not contradictory. Special Issue Nineteen refers only to the word \u201clarvicide\u201d; Special Issues Eleven and Twelve, on the other hand, concern various <em>word combinations, </em>not simply the term \u201clarvicide.\u201d The jury could well find that Shell intended to use the word combinations to identify its goods without intending to use the word \u201clarvicide\u201d as a trademark. It is difficult for us to discern how the jury could have answered Special Issues Eleven and Twelve in the negative; obviously, the word combinations were being used to identify Shell\u2019s goods. Moreover, the word combination addressed in Special Issue Eleven included the term \u201cRABON \u00ae,\u201d which had been trademarked by Shell. Considering these facts, the jury\u2019s finding that Shell did not use the term \u201clarvicide\u201d as a trademark must stand. Accordingly, we conclude that Shell must prevail on its fair-use defense to the trademark infringement claim.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">The district court erred, however, in cancelling plaintiff\u2019s registration for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>trademark \u201cLarvicide.\u201d As noted above, the jury did not find that plaintiff\u2019s use of the term \u201clarvicide\u201d was generic <em>with respect to its products. See </em>p. 1186, <em>supra. </em>In fact, plaintiff used its mark on products that are intended to kill many forms of animal life, not merely larvae;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> it is more properly characterized as a \u201cvarmintcide\u201d than a \u201clarvicide.\u201d Nevertheless, since plaintiff\u2019s products do kill larvae, its mark may be said to be at least descriptive of its products <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As such, it requires secondary meaning to be protected. However, plaintiff\u2019s mark, as a result of its incontestable status, <em>see </em>nn.17, 20 and 25 and accompanying text, <em>supra, </em>is <em>presumed </em>to have secondary meaning. <em>See Union Carbide, </em>531 F.2d at 377 (\u201conce incontestability is established, registrant\u2019s mark is immune from challenge on any grounds not enumerated in \u00a7 1115(b).\u201d). Consequently, plaintiff\u2019s mark is protectable and is not subject to cancellation under section 1064(c) of the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">\n<em>The Federal Unfair Competition Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Once the district court had disposed of the trademark claim, it turned to plaintiff\u2019s unfair competition claim under state law. Nowhere did it address plaintiff\u2019s claim under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> which has been characterized as \u201cat least a partial federal law of unfair competition.\u201d <em>Maternally Yours, Inc. v. Your Maternity Shop, Inc., </em>234 F.2d 538, 547 (2d Cir. 1956) (Clark, J., concurring). Perhaps the court felt it was unnecessary to address the section 43(a) claim because of its finding that plaintiff\u2019s mark had become generic. Even plaintiff seems to have slighted the section 43(a) claim, since it never objected to the wording of Special Issues Seven and Nine in which \u201cunfair competition\u201d was defined in terms of \u201cpassing off of one\u2019s goods or services as those of another,\u201d even though passing off is not required under section 43(a). <em>L\u2019Aiglon Apparel, Inc. v. Lana Lobell, </em>214 F.2d 649 (3d Cir. 1954). Nevertheless, plaintiff brought a section 43(a) claim and raises it again on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">We are of the opinion that defendant must prevail on this claim. There was no evidence demonstrating that Shell\u2019s use of the word \u201clarvicide\u201d constituted a \u201cfalse description or representation\u201d of its goods as required by section 43(a). To the contrary, the term \u201clarvicide\u201d accurately conveys the essence of defendant\u2019s products. As we have found above, defendant\u2019s use of the term \u201clarvicide\u201d was <em>fair </em>use for the purposes of the trademark infringement claim. It would make no sense to characterize defendant\u2019s use as \u201cfair\u201d within the meaning of the Lanham Act for the purposes of a trademark infringement claim and at the same time characterize his use as \u201cunfair\u201d for the purpose of a section 43(a) unfair competition claim under the same statute. For these reasons, we hold for defendant on the section 43(a) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">\n<em>The State Law Unfair Competition Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">A state law claim of unfair competition in Texas requires the plaintiff to show that his mark is distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning. <em>Douglas v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>497 S.W.2d 308, 310 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1973, no writ); he must also demonstrate that the public is likely to be deceived or confused: \u201cUnfair competition results if [defendant\u2019s] use of the name is calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the ordinary conditions which prevail in the particular trade to which the controversy relates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Harrelson v. Wright, </em>339 S.W.2d 712 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Eastland 1960, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.)). The <em>Douglas </em>court\u2019s phrase \u201ccalculated to deceive\u201d seems to suggest that there must be some intent on the part of the competitor. Other cases, however, indicate that a showing of intent is not necessary in order to prevail on a claim of unfair competition. <em>See, e. g., McCarley v. Welsh, </em>170 S.W.2d 330, 332 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1943, no writ); <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>492 F.2d at 478 (\u201cintent is not a necessary element of the tort of unfair competition.\u201d). Thus, it appears that intent is <em>not </em>necessary to prevail on an unfair competition claim in Texas. <em>But see Burge v. Dallas Retail Merchants Association, </em>257 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Dallas 1953, no writ) (\u201cUnfair competition is predicated upon fraud.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The jury found in Special Issues Seven and Nine that Shell\u2019s use of its product names were \u201cacts of unfair competition.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge granted a judgment n. o. v. on the unfair competition claim because, among other reasons,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> he found that \u201cthere was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings of unfair competition on the part of defendants in Special Issues 7 and 9.\u201d Applying the standards of <em>Boeing Co. v.

A \u201cproduct name\u201d is the name of a product. Quite often, a product name is also a common descriptive name. This would certainly be the case, for example, with the word \u201ccoffee,\u201d which is the common descriptive name for the drink which is made from the beans of the coffee tree.

Taylor, </em>507 F.2d 166 (5th Cir. 1975), and <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>469 F.2d 1362 (5th Cir. 1972). These cases, however, are inapposite because they are <em>criminal </em>cases involving general verdicts and thus implicate concerns \u2014 most significantly, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 that are not present in civil suits. Moreover,</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>A verdict is not vitiated by the fact that a juror hesitated to agree to it, or where, in answer to the inquiry, he says it is not his verdict but he consented to it, and subsequently answers that it is his verdict, or says he consented to it under protest, or <em>that he did not believe the verdict right, but agreed to it for the sake of harmony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\"><em>89 C.J.S. Trial </em>\u00a7 490(2) (1955) (footnotes omitted and emphasis added). The instant jurors thus articulated permissible reasons for joining a majority of their peers in a unanimous vote on each special issue. We need not look any further than this testimony to acknowledge the unanimity of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">. Because we find that Shell is entitled to a fair-use defense, we need not consider Shell\u2019s abandonment defense, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115(b)(1), or its fraudulent registration defense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1115(b)(2). The jury found in Special Issues Fourteen and Fifteen that plaintiff had not abandoned its trademark but found in Special Issue Sixteen that it had fraudulently registered its mark \u201cLarvacide.\u201d We are reluctant to rely on the fraudulent registration defense because (1) there is a dearth of evidence in the record to support a finding of fraud, and (2) the answer to Special Issue 16 may be inconsistent with the jury\u2019s answers to Special Issues Fourteen and Fifteen. There was no evidence that Nor-Am intended to abandon its trademark; moreover, its products were still in interstate commerce at the time of the registration, since they were still on distributors\u2019 shelves at that time. As noted above, however, we need not probe this issue because a fair-use defense is available to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">One final contention made by plaintiff does merit consideration. In Special Issues One and Three, the jury explicitly found that the ordinary consumer of agricultural chemical products was not likely to be confused by Shell\u2019s use of its product names. Because we have held that a finding of likelihood of confusion is a prerequisite for a trademark infringement claim, <em>Dallas Cap, </em>510 F.2d at 1012, the jury\u2019s answers to these special issues should be sufficient to dispose of plaintiff\u2019s trademark infringement claims. Nevertheless, the jury also found that Shell\u2019s use of the term \u201clarvicide\u201d was an act of \u201cunfair competition,\u201d which the judge had characterized in his instructions as \u201cthe passing off of one\u2019s goods or services as those of another, in a manner that is <em>likely to confuse.\" </em>(emphasis added). On this basis, plaintiff contends that it is entitled to prevail on its trademark claim. However, having carefully read the entire transcript and having considered all the requisite factors, <em>Amstar, </em>615 F.2d at 258-259, we agree with the district court that there is \u201cmore than ample evidence\u201d to support a jury finding that there was no likelihood of confusion and, conversely, that the jury\u2019s findings of unfair competition on the part of the defendants were \u201cnot supported by any evidence.\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, we are convinced that even if there were a likelihood of confusion, the defendant would still be entitled to its fair-use defense, so long as it had met the requirements of \u00a7 1115(b)(4). To hold otherwise would effectively eviscerate the fair-use defense. If defendant\u2019s use of a term to <em>fairly </em>describe a characteristic of its goods creates a likelihood of confusion, then plaintiff should adopt some other method of distinguishing its goods from those of defendant. He cannot deprive defendant of his statutory defense once defendant has established the elements of that defense, as defendant has done here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">. Several witnesses testified that plaintiff\u2019s products were intended primarily to kill adult insects, not larvae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">. Plaintiff argued at trial that his mark was \u201carbitrary,\u201d but we reject that contention in light of the testimony at trial that plaintiff\u2019s products <em>do </em>kill larvae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">.

The judge gave two reasons, in addition to the lack of evidence, for rejecting plaintiffs state law claim. Neither of these, however, is sufficient to uphold the judgment n. o. v.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-7\">The judge found that plaintiff had failed to prove that its mark had acquired secondary meaning, even though it was \u201cincontestable\u201d within the meaning of the Lanham Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Although the Seventh Circuit held in the <em>Union Carbide </em>case <em>[Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., </em>531 F.2d 366 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 830, 97 S.Ct. 91, 50 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976)] that the incontestability of the mark there in question created a conclusive presumption of secondary meaning it noted at p. 375 of the opinion that, \u201cIf a mark is the common descriptive name of an item, it does not qualify for registration under \u00a7 1052(f). If a mark becomes the common descriptive name of an item, it may be can-celled at any time and incontestability would be of no effect even if subsection (4) [of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065] had not been enacted.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064(c), 1065. Thus in a case such as the one under consideration where the mark has become a common descriptive name, the presumption of secondary meaning stemming from the mark\u2019s incontestable status under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065 does not apply. This is because the mark, being a common descriptive term, is not entitled to incontestable status under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065(4), and thus not entitled to any presumption to which such status would normally entail. Plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving secondary meaning is not satisfied by virtue of its mark being \u201cincontestable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">In light of our holding that plaintiff\u2019s mark is <em>not </em>generic as applied to its products, this reasoning cannot support the judge\u2019s grant of a judgment n. o. v.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">The judge also held that the jury\u2019s finding that defendant did not deliberately seek to trade on the goodwill of plaintiff (Special Issues Five and Six) defeats plaintiffs claim of unfair competition. Clearly, he found defendant\u2019s lack of deliberateness inconsistent with plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for \u201cpalming off.\u201d However, as noted above, there are numerous authorities that support the assertion that deliberate deception is not required for an unfair competition claim under Texas law. Consequently, we cannot sustain the judgment n. o. v. on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
