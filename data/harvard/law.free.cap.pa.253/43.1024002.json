A testator dying without issue, bequeathed his estate in trust for ten years or until the death of his widow, with directions to pay her a proportion of the income during her life, and during the continuance of the trust to pay certain fixed annuities to named persons, and provided that in the event of the refusal of the wife to accept the provisions of the will, the bequests in favor of two of the annuitants should be void; at the expiration of the trust estate the property was to be divided among seventeen remaindermen. The widow elected to take against the will. The Orphans\u2019 Court decided that the widow\u2019s election rendered inoperative the provisions of the will only in so far as they affected her and the two annuitants, and awarded the balance remaining after deducting the widow\u2019s share to the trustees so that the provisions not affecting the widow could be carried into effect. <em>Held, </em>no error.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-7\">2.

In addition to Ralph R. Nowlen, named in the will as a nephew, the son of Eliza Reighard Nolan, she had two other sons, nephews of the testator, to wit: Amasa J. Nowlen and H. Ross Nowlen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">The net income of the estate, after deducting the widow\u2019s one-half, is about $40,000 per year. Of this amount the income specifically devised is about $5,100.00 per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">It cannot be said that testator directed an accumulation of the income of his estate; he directed the contrary ; in the third paragraph he authorizes his trustees to whom he bequeaths his estate in trust, not only to manage and control the estate, but \u201cto pay out the net income arising therefrom.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">True, by the direction to pay one-half to the widow and to pay certain monthly annuities to brothers, sisters and a nephew, the record shows that the whole of the net income is not and will not likely be exhausted. There is a residue of income, but not necessarily such an accumulation as to bring it within the ban of the Act of 1853. Even though there be an accumulation, it does not follow that the trust must fall by reason thereof; neither directly nor implied is there a trust for accumulations created by the provisions of the will, for the language is that the net income shall be paid out, and this means all the income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">Conceding that the will created a trust for accumulations; they would *be void only so far as they exceed the terms of the Act of 1853. The general-gift, in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the creation of a trust estate, is not void because it might appear that accumulations of income transgress the restrictions of the act; only so much as does transgress isi void: L\u00e9isenring\u2019s Estate, 237 Pa. 60; a provision for accumulation contrary to the statute is void only for the' excess: Hillyard v. Miller, 10 Pa. 326; Rhodes\u2019 Est., Oldmixon\u2019s App., 147 Pa. 227. A gift infringing the rule against perpetuities, which is absolutely void, must not be confused with the statute prohibiting trusts for accumulations, which trusts are good to the extent that they do not transgress the statute: Lennig\u2019s Est., Fullerton\u2019s App., 154 Pa. 211; Brown, et al., v. Williamson\u2019s Executors, 36 Pa. 338.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">The excess income \u201cshall go to and be received by such person or persons as would have been entitled thereto if such accumulations had not been directed\u201d; Sec. 9, Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 507. The testator has spoken, designating the persons who are entitled to this excess income; he gave his entire estate to certain brothers, sisters and a nephew. The persons entitled must be found under-the provisions of the will as fairly interpreted, if such can be found: Martin\u2019s Est. &amp; App., 185 Pa. 51, before intestacy can be presumed. The estate in the remaindermen, or residuary legatees, subject to the income payable during the life of the wife, was vested ; the persons definitely ascertained. Where there is no vesting, or there are no persons designated, or they cannot now be known, as in Rhodes\u2019 Est., Oldmixon\u2019s App., 147 Pa. 227; or where the accumulation is to create a fund from which legacies are payable, and there is no present residuary gift, as in Grim\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 391, the excess would pass to the next of kin under the intestate law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">The law does not presume intestaey; the presumption is the other way, where a will disposes of the entire estate; this testator intended to die testate as to all of his estate because he so says. As the parties entitled to the estate are exactly the same as those entitled to the an-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>unities, and in the same proportion, and as he intended them to have the full benefit of his estate, it must be obvious that the excess income which must be distributed, should be awarded to the annuitants, who are the remaindermen, in the proportions designated by the testator himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\">While the election of the widow to take against the will is equivalent to her death: Ferguson\u2019s Est,, 138 Pa. 208; Vance\u2019s Est., 141 Pa. 201, as to her the trust is ended, and if there be no trust for others, the payment of the whole estate is accelerated; such is not the law where provisions for others continue the trust. This trust was created, inter alia, to provide during the continuance of the period for the payment of certain annuities to testator\u2019s brothers, sisters and a nephew. Testator had in mind the possibility of his wife\u2019s election to take against his will, because he provided that her refusal should forfeit the benefit to two annuitants. But he still had in mind, notwithstanding her rejection of the provisions of his. will, the maintenance of the trust for the other purposes set forth. He desired to postpone his bounty to his ultimate beneficiaries for reasons which seemed good to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">His trustees for ten years, or during his wife\u2019s life, if she lived beyond that period, are to manage and control the trust property; to pay out the net income in a designated manner; to have full power to purchase and sell personal and real property; to invest and reinvest the proceeds in such securities as they may deem best; -to determine whether the annuity paid to the brother, Henry, should be given to his wife and children in case he did not provide for them; and finally, at the expiration of the -trust period, to divide the estate into seventeen parts and distribute it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">. This time for distribution has not yet arrived, even though the widow has elected to take against the will; testator directed the distribution of the corpus of his estate to be postponed during the trust period; he di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>rected Ms executors to manage and control the whole of his estate to that time; he gave them special discretionary powers as to the payment of the annuity, or income to his brother, H. M. Reighard. It is conceded by the beneficiaries who claim present distribution that a sum might have to be impounded to enable the trustees to perform this duty at least; if so much is conceded, and so much of the trust is to remain, and this is an arbitrary exercise of power, on what authority shall not the remainder of the trust be sustained? If the trust is valid and continuing for any portion of the estate not frustrated by the widow\u2019s election, it must be held to be valid as to the whole, where, as it appears here, testator\u2019s clear and valid desire was that his beneficiaries should presently receive income only. It cannot be said that testator\u2019s sole purpose in creating the trust, was for the benefit of his wife. If that had been his entire purpose, then he could have produced the same result by giving his wife the entire income of half of his estate and by giving to the other beneficiaries the other half absolutely now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">In support of this construction that the widow\u2019s election has not terminated the trust Portuondo\u2019s Est., Dugro\u2019s App., 185 Pa. 472, is authority. There, as here, the widow was awarded the major portion of the income for life, to another, the mother there, and to the brothers and sisters here, the rest of the income; there the mother to take one-third of the balance upon the death of the wife, here to brothers and sisters to take the entire balance in designated portions. It was there held that the widow\u2019s election did not terminate the trust as to the other parties, nor accelerate the time for payment, the court saying: \u201cThis is not a trust for the widow alone. There is another person interested, and as long as the purpose of the testator with reference to her can be performed, it must be done. The scheme of-the will is not to be departed from except when necessity requires, and there is no such necessity in this case, because even after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the widow\u2019s one-half has been taken from the residuary-estate, enough can be set apart to secure to the mother the income which the testator intended she should have during his wife\u2019s lifetime.\u201d So, similar in principle, is Gourley\u2019s Est., 238 Pa. 62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">Testator devises the balance and remainder of his estate for a period of ten years, or during the life of his wife, should she survive him for a period of over ten years, to his executors in trust. It is clear that he intended the trust to continue for at least ten years, even though his wife died prior to that time, for he said, should she live beyond that period that then the trust should continue until her death. He does not say should she die before that period that the trust terminates with her death. If her death prior to that time was not to terminate the trust, her election prior to that time cannot terminate the trust as to the other trust beneficiaries under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">For their benefit also the trust was created; the trustees vested with active duties; they are to continue to manage and control the trust estate, which includes caring for, selling and buying real estate, and investing personalty, and paying income.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">Here, as in Spring\u2019s Est., 216 Pa. 529, they were to collect and pay out income, exercising their discretion in Spring\u2019s estate as to the children, here, as to the brother, H. M. Eeighard; here, as there, the ultimate or residuary estate is vested in the same persons who are to receive the income. Under exactly similar provisions the trust was sustained there, the court saying, inter alia, \u201cIt is a primary rule of our cases to give effect to the intention of the testator, and the presumption always is that the intent was lawful. Applying this principle to the present case, there is presented an active trust, created by apt words, and. a testamentary intent clearly expressed which must be sustained, unless it can be shown that the trust there created is in violation of an inflexible rule of law, or of statutory restrictions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>To sustain this trust accords with testator\u2019s direct intentions. What he directed was lawful; he had a right to say what should be done with his own property, and how it should be distributed. The widow\u2019s election, changing disposition of a part, should not result in defeating his intention and express commands as to the residue. The law imposes no restrictions on the trusts created as to the part not taken by the widow. Such trusts may be created for every purpose not unlawful: 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq. Jur., Sec. 991.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">From the foregoing discussions the conclusions are, first, that of the income on hand there must be awarded first the amounts payable to the annuitants, and that any excess of income must be paid to the same parties, the remaindermen in the proportions therein designated; and, second, that the remaining corpus of the estate must be awarded to the trustees for the purposes set forth in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">The court dismissed the exceptions.

If she had elected to accept the provisions of his will, she and the other cestuis que trustent would have received monthly during her life what the will gave them, but she elected to take against it, and, her husband having died childless, she acquired a life estate in one-half of his realty and one-half of his personalty absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The single question raised by the assignments of error is whether the trust should be declared terminated and the corpus of the personal estate, together with the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>crued income, as shown by the account of the executor, distributed among the residuary legatees named in the will. The plain and simple scheme of the testator has become inoperative by his wife\u2019s election to take against his will, so far as its provisions affect her, but no farther. He clearly contemplated the contingency of her election not to accept his testamentary provision for her, for, in directing that $50.00 should be paid monthly during the continuance of the trust to each of two relatives of his wife, he declared that these annuities were to be paid \u201cupon the express condition, however, that my wife accepts the provisions made in this will for her, in lieu of dower, and in the event of her refusal to so accept said provisions, then and in that event the bequests to said Louis Lytle and Harry Eeifsnyder, and their children, hereinabove contained shall be void.\u201d No other provision in the will was to be disturbed by his wife\u2019s election to take against it, and the unavoidable conclusion is that the t'estator\u2019s intention was that all the provisions in the will, except those relating to his wife and her two relatives, should continue unaffected by her election to take against it, Expressio unius, exclusio alterius. By her election to take against the will the widow of the testator destroyed the trust created for her. But how could that election strike down the trust for others created in terms as clear as those which had created the trust for her? The trust created by the testator was not for her alone, but for others, to continue for them during her natural life; and the intention of her husband is not to be thwarted by her refusal to accept the provisions of his will, but is to be given effect under the cardinal rule applicable to every will: Portuondo\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 472; Gourley\u2019s Est., 238 Pa. 62. Notwithstanding what the widow has done, the clearly expressed intention of her husband must be given effect. During a period fixed by him his beneficiaries, of whom the appellant is one, are not to have any shares in the corpus of one-half of his estate, for his express direction is that it shall be held in \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>trust for them as long as his widow shall live. His reason for so directing is immaterial, if he created, as he clearly did, an active trust for the appellant and the other residuary legatees: Spring\u2019s Est., 216 Pa. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">No direction is to be found in the will of the testator foi* any accumulation of the income of his estate. Any excess income in the hands of the trustees will, under the decree of the court below, be paid to the persons named by the testator as his residuary legatees, one of whom is the appellant, and she is not complaining of this, if the trust is to continue. The convincing opinion of the learned adjudicating judge relieves us from further discussion of the question before us, and the decree may be regarded as affirmed on that opinion at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
