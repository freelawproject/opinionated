Appended to count I were special allegations that Gonzales had suffered prior convictions in 1980 and 1981, respectively, for robbery (\u00a7 211) and residential burglary (\u00a7 459), each crime being a serious felony within the meaning of sections 1192.7 and 667, subdivision (d).

We issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">The Three Strikes legislation \u201cwas adopted as an urgency measure, effective March 7, 1994. It makes major changes to Penal Code section 667, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>adding subdivisions (b) through (i) relating to increased punishment for recidivists who suffered one or more previous convictions for a serious or violent felony. A \u2018serious felony\u2019 is one that is so defined in section 1192.7, subdivision (c); a \u2018violent felony\u2019 is a crime defined as such in section 667.5, subdivision (c). (See \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1).)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 660, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">\u201c. . . The 1994 legislation contains a stated purpose: \u2018It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u2019 (\u00a7 667, subd. (b).)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 559, 564 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Section 667, subdivision (c), provides in part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d),\u201d certain sentencing results follow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">A defendant enters this labyrinth through section 667, subdivision (d), by virtue of California adult serious or violent felony priors, foreign equivalents, or qualifying California juvenile adjudications. Subdivision (d)(1) provides, in part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law and for the purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, a prior conviction of a felony shall be defined as: [&lt;H] (1) Any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 as a violent felony or any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state. <em>The determination of whether a prior conviction is a prior felony conviction for purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction </em>and is not affected by the sentence imposed unless the sentence automatically, upon the initial sentencing, converts the felony to a misdemeanor. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The italicized language comprises the so-called \u201cdetermination clause,\u201d which is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s Contention</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Gonzales makes two related claims linked to the premise the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d language requires a contemporaneous finding at the time the subject prior conviction occurred. First, he argues, a prior conviction occurring before March 7, 1994, is not a prior felony conviction within the meaning of section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i). Second, he maintains prior felony convictions, as defined by section 667, subdivision (d), do not include convictions for offenses which were not section 1192.7, subdivision (c) or section 667.5, subdivision (c) offenses at the time of conviction. In both instances, he reasons a court would not\u2014indeed could not\u2014have made the predicate finding at the time of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In addressing these contentions, we are guided by familiar principles of statutory interpretation: \u201cIn construing a statute, our principal task is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] We do so by first turning to the words themselves, giving them their ordinary meaning. [Citations.] Of course, \u2018 \u201c \u2018language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] In such circumstances, \u2018[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1071-1072 [22 Cal.Rptr. 278, 856 P.2d 1134]; <em>Green, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Reed, Anderson, Sipe and Green</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\"><em>Reed, Anderson, Sipe </em>and <em>Green, supra, </em>reject Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of section 667, subdivision (d)(1). <em>Reed </em>found subdivision (d)(l)\u2019s use of \u201cupon\u201d to be ambiguous. \u201cDoes this mean that the determination whether an offense is a \u2018strike\u2019 must be made <em>at the time </em>of the prior conviction\u2014which cannot have occurred with convictions predating the Three Strikes law\u2014or does it mean something else that permits application of the law to such convictions?\u201d <em>(Reed, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th atp. 1610, italics original.) <em>Reed </em>concluded \u201cupon\u201d meant \u201csimply that the determination whether an offense is a \u2018strike\u2019 must be made <em>with reference to </em>the date of the prior conviction, and not with reference to the sentence subsequently imposed for the prior (unless the sentence converts the offense to a misdemeanor).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1611, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\"><em>Anderson </em>interpreted the clause similarly. \u201cClearly, the Legislature intended that the qualifying status of a conviction would be fixed upon the date of the prior conviction, so that no subsequent actions, including those listed in subdivision (d)(l)(A)-(D), could alter that status. By specifically distinguishing those status reductions that occur upon the initial sentencing, the Legislature was clearly contemplating those status reductions that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>occur later (see, e.g., \u00a7 17, subd. (b)(3)) and declaring that such reductions shall have no effect on the crime\u2019s status for the purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i). . . .\u201d <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 600-601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><em>Sipe </em>concluded when the language of the determination clause is read in the context of section 667, subdivision (d)(1) as a whole, it is apparent \u201cthe \u2018determination\u2019 at issue must be whether the prior conviction \u2018is a prior <em>felony </em>conviction\u2019 rather than a conviction for a misdemeanor. This determination is made \u2018upon the date\u2019 of the conviction, so subsequent events, such as a reduction to a misdemeanor (\u00a7 17, subd. (b)(3)), will not affect its classification as a felony conviction. [^Q . . . It is \u2018reasonable and commonsense\u2019 to provide a reference point (the date of conviction) for determining whether a conviction is for a felony or a misdemeanor. There is no reason, however, to require a court to determine whether a conviction may serve as a \u2018strike\u2019 unless and until the defendant commits another felony.\u201d <em>(Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 478, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\"><em>Reed </em>cited three reasons for this interpretation of section 667, subdivision (d)(1). First, the lists of qualifying felonies found in sections 667.5, subdivision (c), and 1192.7, subdivision (c), \u201cinclude several former felonies that were repealed before enactment of the Three Strikes law. Construction of the Three Strikes law to preclude its application to convictions predating its enactment would make meaningless its references to these former felonies, which can <em>only </em>have occurred prior to enactment, and is thus disfavored. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>[1985] 37 Cal.3d [826,] 832 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736].)\u201d <em>(Reed, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1611, fn. omitted, italics in original; <em>Green, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Second, prospective-only application of the Three Strikes law would frustrate its basic purpose of deterring recidivism. <em>(Reed, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1611.) <em>Sipe </em>and <em>Green </em>agreed <em>(Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at pp. 482-483; <em>Green, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 282); so did <em>Anderson. </em>\u201cThus, a defendant would have to commit a serious or violent felony, be prosecuted, serve any sentence imposed, and then commit a new felony before this law could be applied to him. This was manifestly not the Legislature\u2019s intent, and defendant supplies no authority whatsoever supporting this interpretation.\u201d <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 601, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Third, given that the similarly worded Three Strikes <em>initiative </em>(Prop. 184) clearly was intended to apply to preenactment priors, \u201c[i]t would be anomalous to conclude that the Legislature and the electorate intended different meanings for essentially identical provisions. And it would be absurd to sentence pre- and post-Proposition 184 defendants differently under those provisions.\u201d <em>(Reed, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\"><em>Anderson </em>provided another reason: defendant\u2019s interpretation of section 667, subdivision (d)(1) effectively would negate the provision of subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>(d)(2) concerning foreign prior convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe Legislature could not have intended that the application of subdivision (d)(2) depend upon such an unlikely act . . .\u201d as a finding, on the date of a conviction, in the foreign jurisdiction, of a conviction\u2019s Three Strikes status. <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Plain Language?</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Gonzales asserts the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d is clear, unambiguous, and dictates prospective-only application. <em>Reed </em>found an ambiguity based on different meanings of \u201cupon.\u201d <em>(Reed, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1610.) <em>Green </em>concluded the phrase \u201c[t]he determination [as to whether a prior offense qualifies as a \u2018strike\u2019] . . . shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction . . .\u201d meant \u201cthe court is presently required to look backward to see if, at the time of the conviction of the past offense, such past offense qualified as a serious or violent offense under section 1192.7, subdivision (c) or section 667.5, subdivision (c).\u201d <em>(Green, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) When section 667, subdivision (d)(1) is read as a whole, it is apparent the Legislature did not provide for prospective-only application.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The provision reads: \u201cThe determination of whether <em>a prior conviction </em>is a prior felony conviction for purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction and is not affected by the sentence imposed unless the sentence automatically, upon the initial sentencing, converts the felony to a misdemeanor. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), italics added.) The characterization of a <em>prior conviction </em>necessarily is retrospective, i.e., occurs during a later proceeding. The contemporaneous characterization of a <em>current </em>conviction (that Gonzales argues the statute requires) is manifestly not a \u201cdetermination of whether a <em>prior </em>conviction is a prior felony conviction.\u201d The purportedly \u201cplain language\u201d concerning the <em>timing </em>of the determination conflicts with the equally \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the well-established phrase \u201cprior conviction.\u201d This linguistic collision requires further examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">When the remaining language of section 667, subdivision (d)(1), is examined, the intended meaning becomes apparent. The provision does not require a contemporaneous characterization of a conviction but ensures that post-conviction events will not transform the felony into a misdemeanor (with the sole exception expressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>The \u201cpleading and proof\u2019 requirement of section 667, subdivision (c), applies to the current case, in which the Three Strikes sentencing scheme is invoked. Subdivision (d) explains what proof is required in that proceeding; it contemplates a determination <em>in that proceeding </em>of whether the prosecution has proved the alleged prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">Subdivision (b) expresses the legislative intent \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (b).) A similar statement justified adopting the Three Strikes law as an urgency measure. (Stats. 1994, ch. 12, \u00a7 2, p. 59.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) The Legislature wanted the new sentencing scheme to become available immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Recidivism laws are familiar in California. Such laws have routinely applied to persons with specified prior offenses predating the law\u2019s effective date, who commit a new crime after the law takes effect. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 833 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736] [\u00a7 667 serious felony enhancement enacted pursuant to Prop. 8]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 445, 448-449 [189 Cal.Rptr. 497] [\u00a7 667.5 prior prison term enhancements enacted as part of determinate sentencing law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Moreover, the constitutionality of \u201cretroactive\u201d application is well settled. \u201cIn the context of habitual criminal statutes, \u2018increased penalties for subsequent offenses are attributable to the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender and arise as an incident of the subsequent offense rather than constituting a penalty for the prior offense.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 833; <em>Sipe, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">In light of the retroactivity feature of past habitual criminal statutes, of which the Legislature is deemed to have been aware when it enacted the Three Strikes law, no plausible reason occurs to support a prospective approach here. Indeed, to delay the practical operation of the law unnecessarily would have defeated the purpose of the urgency clause and severely undercut the legislative intent. To adopt an urgency clause accelerating the effective date by less than 10 months while simultaneously deferring the practical effective date potentially by many years would have been an exercise in legislative schizophrenia this court should not presume.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">As noted, section 667, subdivision (d)(2), applies the Three Strikes law to foreign convictions equivalent to California\u2019s serious and violent felonies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>This case does not raise the issue whether the determination clause applies to foreign convictions. But whether or not the clause applies to foreign convictions, accepting Gonzales\u2019s interpretation would yield bizarre consequences. If the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d does apply to foreign convictions (as <em>Anderson </em>assumes), as a practical matter a foreign conviction\u2014whether it occurred before or after March 7, 1994\u2014would never be available for Three Strikes purposes (under Gonzales\u2019s interpretation). It is highly unlikely a sister state or federal court would undertake a contemporaneous determination of whether the current conviction qualified for California Three Strikes treatment. <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Alternatively, if the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d does not apply to foreign convictions, an anomaly results. A defendant with foreign equivalent convictions predating March 7, 1994, would be subject to the law as soon as he committed a new California felony, while California serious or violent felonies of the same vintage would not be usable. That the Legislature intended to distinguish between recidivist felons based on the origin of their priors is highly unlikely; that it would have intended to benefit recidivists with <em>California </em>priors is inconceivable.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Gonzales argues retroactive application of Three Strikes would nullify section 667, subdivision (a)\u2019s serious felony enhancement. Under his argument, prospective application would accomplish the same result, only more slowly. Moreover, the argument appears to assume, without reasoned discussion, a court may not impose a serious felony enhancement and invoke the Three Strikes sentencing scheme in the same case. This court need not face the issue here, but other courts have rejected Gonzales\u2019s premise. <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Gonzales also argues the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d is an analog to section 969f, which permits the prosecutor to charge and the court to find the current offense to be a section 667, subdivision (a) serious felony. This argument does not persuade us. It can as easily be argued that section 969f will help preserve a record on which a later \u201cstrike\u201d finding can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">In sum, the admittedly awkward language of the \u201cdetermination clause\u201d does not require this court to accept Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of section 667, which depends on an irreconcilable reading of subdivision (d)(1), flies in the face of the clear legislative intent, and would produce absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Finally, Gonzales argues prior felony convictions as defined by section 667, subdivision (d), do not include convictions for offenses which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>were not section 1192.7, subdivision (c) (serious felony) or section 667.5, subdivision (c) (violent felony) offenses at the time of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">The \u201cdetermination clause\u201d requires the ultimate sentencing court to determine whether, as of the date of a prior conviction, a prior conviction was a felony or misdemeanor. It does not require a contemporaneous determination, when the prior conviction occurred, that the conviction constituted a \u201cstrike\u201d or a \u201cserious felony\u201d or \u201cviolent felony.\u201d This being the case, the Three Strikes law does apply to felony convictions predating March 7, 1994, which fit the definition of a \u201cserious felony\u201d or \u201cviolent felony\u201d on the relevant date. The Three Strikes law also applies to felony convictions which were neither \u201cserious\u201d nor \u201cviolent\u201d felonies at the time of conviction, but which again fit the definition of a \u201cserious felony\u201d or \u201cviolent felony\u201d on the relevant date.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this regard, as noted above, both the \u201cserious felony\u201d enhancement enacted as part of Proposition 8 and the \u201cviolent felony\u201d prior prison term enhancement adopted as part of the determinate sentence law have been held to apply to convictions that predated their respective effective dates, where the defendant\u2019s current crime occurred after that date. Again, no plausible reason <em>exists </em>why the Legislature would have chosen to treat \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cviolent\u201d felonies differently for purposes of the Three Strikes law than they were treated under their own enhancement statutes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied, the order to show cause discharged, and the stay of trial vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Dibiaso, J., and Harris, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 22,1995, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-12\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">\u201cThree Strikes\u2014The Initiative\u201d (Prop. 184) (\u00a7 1170.12) became effective November 9, 1994, and parallels section 667. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 656, 660, fn. 2 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 776].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-7\"> The Three Strikes law imposes various indirect and direct consequences on eligible defendants.

(g)), prevents courts from striking a prior in the interests of justice (\u00a7 667, subd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>(f)(2)), and freezes the list of qualifying priors as of June 30,1993 (\u00a7 667, subd. (h)). That the Legislature would have gone to these lengths to prevent circumvention and then itself unnecessarily limited the law to prospective application is not reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b979-9\"> The Three Strikes law freezes the list of qualifying felonies as of June 30, 1993. (\u00a7 667, subd. (h).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b979-10\"> In his petition for rehearing, Gonzales argues the language quoted from <em>Anderson, supra, </em>and <em>Green, supra, </em>supports his argument the Three Strikes law only applies to convictions that, when suffered, qualified as \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cviolent\u201d felonies. The <em>Anderson </em>language (\u201cthe qualifying status of a conviction would be fixed upon the date of the prior conviction\u201d), to us, simply refers to whether the conviction was a felony or a misdemeanor. <em>(Anderson, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 600.) It is completely consistent with our opinion. The <em>Green </em>language (requiring a court to look back to see \u201cif, at the time of the conviction of the past offense, such past offense qualified as a serious or violent offense\u201d) arguably supports Gonzales\u2019s argument. (Green, <em>supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) However, the language was dicta. Neither <em>Green </em>nor <em>Anderson </em>involved the issue whether the Three Strikes law can apply to convictions that were felonies, but predated the \u201cserious felony\u201d and \u201cviolent felony\u201d enhancement laws. Opinions are not authority for matters not considered. <em>(Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
