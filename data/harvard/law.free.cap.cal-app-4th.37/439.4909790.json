(known to her family as Amber) or, in the alternative, for an order staying enforcement of an order of the juvenile court which permitted Hellen Jones, Amber\u2019s great-aunt and court-appointed foster mother, to take her out of the state on a five-week vacation. We saw no reason to change Amber\u2019s placement but the petition appeared to raise a legitimate question about the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction to permit the out-of-state trip and a visit with an unrelated adult, and we therefore issued a stay order and a request for immediate opposition so we could address the merits of the petition before Ms. Jones\u2019s planned departure date.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">Unconcerned with our denial of the request for an order changing custody, Kate Hand (the social worker assigned to Amber\u2019s case) arranged to have Melissia Groomes, Amber\u2019s aunt, meet her at Amber\u2019s day care facility and take custody of Amber away from Ms. Jones (despite Ms. Jones\u2019s assurance that, in light of the stay order then served on her, she would cancel her vacation plans). Two days later, Ms. Jones asked the juvenile court to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the Department to return Amber to her custody, which the juvenile court did. Undeterred, County Counsel then asked us to \u201cclarify\u201d our earlier order to make it clear that we intended a change of custody. Since we never intended a change of custody, we declined and ordered the Department to return Amber to Ms. Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">When we ultimately received transcripts of the proceedings along with opposition to the petition filed by Amber\u2019s attorney, we not only denied the petition but ordered the Department and County Counsel to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed against them. They responded in writing and, represented by private counsel retained for the OSC proceedings (Mr. Elwood Lui), appeared in court as directed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons we will explain, we conclude that the Department and its attorneys demonstrated an arrogant disregard for the orders of the juvenile court and this court and lost sight of their <em>raison </em>d\u2019eP-e\u2014to protect the best interests of the child involved in these proceedings\u2014and that this is an appropriate case for the imposition of substantial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">For almost three years, Ms. Jones has been Amber\u2019s court-appointed foster mother and Amber, who is now eight, calls her \u201cMommy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In March 1995, Ms. Jones called Amber\u2019s social worker (Kate Hand) to obtain permission to take Amber on a trip to Texas. Ms. Jones explained that she was planning a combined business trip and vacation for herself, her own eight-year-old son (Justin) and Amber. While Ms. Jones attended to business, she proposed leaving the children with Justin\u2019s father (Earl Coleman) who lives in Dallas and she explained that arrangements had been made for both children to attend a YMCA day camp, take swimming lessons and participate in computer classes at a local college.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Ms. Hand\u2019s response was that she did not approve of the trip and would not approve it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Ms. Jones asked if there was someone to whom she could \u201cappeal\u201d that decision, Ms. Hand offered no assistance and, every time Ms. Jones called, Ms. Hand had one excuse or another about why she didn\u2019t have time to discuss the matter with her. Ultimately, Ms. Jones made her way to a supervisor, Ms. Virgie Boykin, who explained that, according to the Department\u2019s policy, Mr. Coleman would have to be investigated through interstate procedures and that Mr. Coleman would have to obtain a \u201cfoster license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Ms. Jones talked to Mr. Coleman and they agreed to do whatever was necessary. Accordingly, Ms. Jones again called Ms. Hand, requested the \u201cinterstate transfer\u201d she had been told would be necessary, and provided identifying information about Mr. Coleman. Ms. Hand said she would not approve such a transfer and would not provide further information to Ms. Jones. When Ms. Jones asked to speak to her supervisor, Ms. Hand\u2019s response was that she had already done so and that he (her supervisor) agreed with her (Ms. Hand). Ultimately, Ms. Jones found the supervisor (Hermes Cruz) and he confirmed Ms. Hand\u2019s representation that he would not approve Ms. Jones\u2019s request. When she persisted and asked whether it was impossible to obtain approval of an interstate transfer, Mr. Cruz said it was \u201cnot impossible\u201d but \u201che would not consider it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Ms. Jones then contacted Amber\u2019s attorney, Teri Robinson, and explained what she wanted to do. Ms. Robinson asked Ms. Jones to send her a letter explaining her plans and then offered to apply for court approval for the trip.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 30, 1995, Ms. Robinson presented Ms. Jones\u2019s request to the juvenile court (Hon. Marilyn Kading Martinez, Judge Pro Tempore) and the court, in turn, indicated its intention to grant the request. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Department (represented by Deputy County Counsel John W. McCauley) conceded it had no adverse information about Mr. Coleman, it nevertheless objected to the request on the ground that it is \u201cthe policy of the Department . . . that these foster children should not be sent out of state with unrelated caretakers or individuals who have not been charged by the court through the foster care licensing with the care of these children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">When the court reminded Mr. McCauley that, more than a month before the hearing, Ms. Jones had provided Ms. Hand with Mr. Coleman\u2019s address, birthdate and other identifying information so that his background <em>could </em>be checked, Mr. McCauley\u2019s only response was that Ms. Hand had told him she had not been able to obtain the information she needed from Ms. Jones.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After further discussion (during which the attorney representing Amber\u2019s mother informed the court that Amber\u2019s mother was in favor of the planned trip), the court granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Mr. McCauley asked for a stay. At that point, Ms. Robinson suggested the following approach: \u201c[I]f the Department finds something between now and when this visit begins\u2014which is not for another month\u2014if they find out the man is an axe murderer, they can certainly walk it on. But my client for a month has been trying to get this man interviewed by the Department unsuccessfully.\u201d The court responded: \u201cHere\u2019s the situation. [Amber] lives with her foster mother, who is her relative, maternal aunt. And a review of the report shows that [Amber\u2019s] been doing well with this caretaker. We charge our caretakers, who we determine to be responsible, to make decisions for the children: If they can stay overnight at a slumber party, with a friend from school, if they can go to a birthday party with friends from school, they can go to Disneyland.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u201cIt would appear that. . . Ms. Jones has a great deal of information about Mr. Coleman. In fact, as I read the report, Mr. Coleman is the father of Ms. Jones\u2019 son. And although Mr. Coleman and Ms. Jones do not live together and are not married, Ms. Jones appears to have a very high regard for Mr. Coleman, such high regard that she is sending her own son to have a summer vacation with his father. Mr. Coleman knows [Amber] because [Amber] has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>resided with Ms. Jones for a substantial period of time. The plans are that the children would attend the YMCA program. They would have horseback riding, computer training.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u201cIt would seem . . . that although the social worker has had adequate time to gather information and has not, that Ms. Jones herself, as a qualified caretaker, has fully evaluated the situation and believes that it will be a wonderful opportunity for [Amber] to have a vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u201cFurthermore, it is Ms. Jones who will, in fact, be taking [Amber] out of state, because Ms. Jones will be also taking a summer vacation, which shall begin in Texas so that she can visit relatives. Now, during a portion of that time, she will not be there because she has business-related trips, such that she cannot care for [Amber] this summer. So if [Amber] does not go with . . . her cousin, who\u2019s going to visit his father, then [Amber] would have to be put in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u201cSo weighing and balancing and not having any evidence that Mr. Coleman is other than appropriate and that the caretaker is the one who will be taking the vacation out of state and get [Amber] and her son arranged and settled, I authorize the vacation. However, I order the Department to continue with their follow-up, and if there is evidence that, Mr. McCauley, you believe will persuade the court to reconsider its decision, <em>then you shall present that to the court prior to Ms. Jones going on her vacation. And she intends to leave June 24th. So that gives you about a month to complete this evaluation. If I don\u2019t hear from you, I will assume your evaluation is complete, and you are satisfied that it is appropriate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u201cSo I authorize an out-of-state vacation for [Amber] to the State of Texas <em>to begin approximately June 24th </em>and extend for approximately five weeks. Her caretaker will provide the transportation. And I deny [the] request for a stay.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Unpersuaded, Mr. McCauley responded: \u201cAs far as my client is concerned, even if Mr. Coleman is appropriate, state policy precludes him as a non-foster care, nonrelated caretaker from taking foster children out of state. And, therefore, the record should be clear the Department adamantly opposes the court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d The court tried once again: \u201cYou have made your record. I will emphasize that this is a vacation, not an out-of-state placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">On June 13, the parties were back in court with Mr. McCauley asking for reconsideration of the order allowing Amber to take a vacation. Mr. McCauley \u201creminded\u201d the juvenile court that it had said \u201cthat in the meantime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>before June 24th, that I could walk the matter back on should there be a change of circumstances or further information. I have further information, Your Honor, that foster care is not the only option. We have a maternal aunt by the name of Meliss[i]a Groom[e]s who wishes to take care of [Amber] during the time of the current caretaker\u2019s absence out of the state. That she . . . also has [Amber\u2019s] siblings\u2014Miranda and Jovan\u2014in her care now. So she is a DCS-approved placement. [Amber] could go there immediately upon her foster caretaker leaving on her business trip [and] be able to visit with her siblings .... Meliss[i]a Groom[e]s has agreed to this and asked that [Amber] come and join her during the five or so weeks that [Amber\u2019s] foster caretaker will be out of the state. And, your honor, there\u2019s a Legislative preference for visitation with siblings\u2014[Welfare and Institutions Code section] 361.3 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On Amber\u2019s behalf, Ms. Robinson objected. \u201cI find it very interesting that the Department, rather than allowing this child to go on the visit and follow up on the investigation of Mr. Coleman, has now decided to turn the comer, go and seek the other relatives out. This is not an aunt that has said, I want to take care of Amber for the summer. This is a person who has been contacted by the Department when the Department has said, will you take this child instead of her going to Texas? That\u2019s a whole different thing than what this code section is talking about.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u201cAfter Mr. McCauley told me of the plans of the Department, I also find it interesting that they haven\u2019t bothered to provide the court with the information about Mr. Coleman that they still haven\u2019t bothered to obtain. Ms. Jones indicated . . . that the biggest tiling is that. . . [Amber] thinks\u2014 she\u2019s been told she\u2019s going to Texas for this vacation. The swimming lessons have been paid for. The YMCA program has been paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u201cAnother thing is the current caretaker, Ms. Jones, does not approve of this aunt where [Amber]\u2019s going to go spend the summer. <em>This woman [Ms. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Groomes] has three children [of] her own, Amber\u2019s two siblings, plus another adult in the house in a two-bedroom home. And the Department is going to add yet another child in that home? </em>Ms. Jones wants Amber to have activities that are going to help her continue to grow and develop over the summer. <em>She believes truthfully if Amber goes to her aunt\u2019s home, she\u2019s going </em>[to] <em>sit in front of the TV and watch the trial all summer long. And she\u2019s also concerned that behavior problems that the siblings are exhibiting are going to be with Amber.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u201cAmber has a long relationship with Mr. Coleman. He exercises his visits with his son. Amber sees him as a father/uncle kind of figure. She goes on the visits when he exercises his visits with his son. The bottom line is if the Department insists on moving Amber to this other relative\u2019s home, this may well be a permanent move because Ms. Jones may refuse to take this child back if her behavior deteriorates, as she believes it may.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Amber\u2019s mother\u2019s attorney again sided with Ms. Jones: \u201cYour honor, we have had in place now for some time good placements for all of Mary [P.\u2019s] children with her relatives. I think this presents a unique opportunity for this child to further her education just in terms of seeing new areas, new territory. Furthermore, nothing Mr. McCauley cites in any way diminishes the court\u2019s authority to exercise the court\u2019s discretion to allow such a visit or a trip or a vacation or what have you. Furthermore, County Counsel fails to cite any even potential risk that accompanies this vacation request. I simply don\u2019t see any basis for the court\u2019s changing its indicated ruling the last time the matter was brought on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Notwithstanding Mr. McCauley\u2019s insistence that Ms. Groomes was really quite \u201canxious\u201d to have Amber stay with her, the court confirmed its earlier ruling, reiterating its finding that the issue was not placement, only vacation plans. The court added: \u201cFurthermore, placement with the aunt and the cousins and the siblings, these people appear probably to be like strangers to [Amber]. And so I don\u2019t have any statement from [Amber] whatsoever that she knows these people. She may feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u201cFurthermore, she, in fact, will be with a relative during this vacation. Her caretaker, Ms. Jones, is her relative. She will be on vacation in part with Ms. Jones, but in totality with her cousin, who is Ms. Jones\u2019 son. Furthermore, it appears that an enriched vacation has been arranged for this child, and this court is happy to note that this caretaker appears to be such a fine caretaker that she has arranged such an enriched and exciting vacation for this child. No doubt this child will have her horizons expanded, learn about another state, and I don\u2019t have any basis whatsoever to deny this child this fine opportunity. And that concludes the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Undeterred, Mr. McCauley complained that Ms. Jones would be with Amber for only a few days out of the five-week vacation period. The court corrected him: \u201cAs I understand it, Ms. Jones will be going to Texas with her son and her niece, and they will be visiting relatives in Texas. That then, Ms. Jones . . . has business responsibilities which would require her to travel, and she is not able to take the children with her. And so she has arranged for this vacation for her niece and her son in Texas while she is traveling, and when her business is completed, so will the vacation be completed, and her niece and her son will return with her to California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Mr. McCauley insisted that, according to his reading of Ms. Jones\u2019s letter to Ms. Robinson, the important point was that Ms. Jones would be returning to California separately from the children. The court observed that he was technically correct but that Mr. Coleman would be returning the children to California at the same time, and asked rhetorically, \u201cIs Ms. Jones intending to abandon them?\u201d Incredibly, Mr. McCauley answered: \u201cShe is, in fact, intending to abandon them there. She\u2019s going to be there for a few days, and Mr. Coleman is going to be the sole caretaker.\u201d After more of the same, the court put an end to it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cMr. McCauley, stop. It really isn\u2019t important if the children are on the plane with Ms. Jones or with Mr. Coleman. The fact is they are simply on vacation. At the end of the vacation, they will return to California and resume residence with Ms. Jones.\u201d Once again, the court denied Mr. Mc-Cauley\u2019s request for a stay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">On June 19, Principal Deputy County Counsel Joe Ben Hudgens filed a petition for a writ of mandate and a request for an immediate stay. The transcripts of the May 30 and June 13 hearings quoted at length above were not, however, filed with the petition. Instead, we were given Mr. Hudgens\u2019s version of what had occurred with regard to Ms. Jones\u2019s request to take her niece on a vacation. According to Mr. Hudgens, the juvenile court acted arbitrarily and in excess of its jurisdiction when it \u201cordered that [Amber] accompany [Ms.] Jones to Texas and be left there for four to five weeks in the sole care of Earl Drayland Coleman, a person neither related to [Amber] nor licensed by the State of California to provide foster care. It is anticipated that [Amber] will be taken out of the State of California as early as June 20, 1995, but certainly no later than June 24, 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Without mention of Amber\u2019s attorney\u2019s objection to Ms. Groomes as a substitute caretaker, Mr. Hudgens told us that Ms. Groomes, \u201cwho already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>cares for [Amber\u2019s] two siblings,\u201d was ready and willing to care for Amber in Los Angeles during Ms. Jones\u2019s absence. Based on these incomplete allegations, Mr. Hudgens asked for an immediate order \u201ccommanding that [Amber] not leave the State of California, <em>and that [Amber] be placed forthwith in the home of [Ms.] Groom[e]s; and prohibiting [the juvenile] court from taking any further action ... to enforce or implement its orders of May 30 and June 13. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) In a supporting declaration, Mr. McCauley chimed in: \u201cWhile [Amber\u2019s] counsel represented that [Amber] and [Ms.] Jones would commence this trip ... on Saturday, June 24, . . . <em>I am informed, and thereupon believe, that this trip will commence tomorrow morning, June 20, 1995.[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] Therefore, it is essential that the Court of Appeal grant a stay of the [juvenile] court\u2019s order and command that [Amber] not be taken out of the State of California until this matter can be fully argued.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On the incomplete record before us, it appeared there might be some legal impediment to the juvenile court\u2019s order and, on the same day the petition was filed (June 19), we therefore issued a temporary stay order and request for opposition. This is what our order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cGood cause appearing therefor, the May 30, 1995 order permitting [Ms. Jones] ... to take [Amber] out of the State of California and leave her with an unrelated caretaker in the State of Texas, is stayed.\u201d Opposition was requested by June 23 which, we hoped, would make it clear that we intended to rule before the planned vacation was scheduled to begin. <em>No affirmative relief of any kind was mentioned and the order did no more than it said\u2014it stayed the juvenile court\u2019s order which authorized Ms. Jones to take Amber to Texas. By necessary implication, it also denied the Department\u2019s request for an order changing Amber\u2019s placement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Ms. Hand nevertheless arranged for Ms. Groomes to meet her at Amber\u2019s day care center<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and to have Ms. Jones await their arrival at the center when she came. When Ms. Hand arrived, she gave Ms. Jones a copy of our stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>order. Ms. Jones read it, understood it and, in response, told Ms. Hand that she would change her travel plans. When Ms. Jones took Amber by the hand to lead her to her car, Ms. Hand intervened and ultimately took the child, crying and visibly upset, and turned her over to Ms. Groomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">On June 21, Ms. Robinson\u2019s colleague, Amy Guy, applied to the juvenile court for an order directing the Department to immediately return Amber to Ms. Jones, on the ground that our stay order simply delayed the vacation and did not authorize a change of placement. Ms. Guy explained to the court that, as a result of these events and of discussions Ms. Robinson had with Ms. Groomes, Amber\u2019s attorneys (Ms. Robinson and Ms. Guy) were concerned about Ms. Groomes\u2019s behavior and the well being of Amber\u2019s siblings (who they also represented). Amber\u2019s mother\u2019s attorney then explained that Amber\u2019s mother (who is confined to a nursing home and whose attorney questioned her mental competency) had received several \u201cagitating\u201d calls from Ms. Groomes in an effort to influence the mother to change her position about whether Amber should take the planned vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The juvenile court was not impressed with the Department\u2019s conduct: \u201cI am extremely disturbed with the Department. . . . On the very moment that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision came out, they saw fit to go to the child\u2019s child care and remove the child without any advance notice. There was no reason that I know of to do that when the vacation was not beginning until June 24th. If there was any doubt in the Department\u2019s mind, they could have contacted Ms. Jones and asked her exactly when she was leaving and informed her that the child\u2019s bag should be packed to go to the aunt\u2019s home while she was on vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201cThis child is young, and to not have any ability to say good-bye to [Ms. Jones], to not have the ability to pack her bag or favorite doll, to not be informed by the person who loves her, cares for her that she\u2019s not able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>take a vacation out of state in child-appropriate, sensitive language is disturbing to this court. Now, since Ms. Jones is not going on vacation until July 15th, the child shall continue to reside with . . . Ms. Jones until Ms. Jones goes on vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In response, Mr. McCauley suggested that Ms. Jones was playing games (he offered no factual basis for this statement or for his suggestion that, had the Department not taken Amber away from her, Ms. Jones would have violated our stay order) and he also suggested that the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to do what it was doing. The court had the last word, suggesting again that the Department was acting in a disturbing fashion by relying on Ms. Groomes\u2019s hearsay statements and concluding with the following comment: \u201cNow, all of the prior reports indicate that [Amber] has been well cared for by Ms. Jones. There is no evidence whatsoever that she has ever attempted, nor an indication that she might attempt to flee this jurisdiction, to not follow court orders . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Later that day (June 21), Mr. Hudgens delivered a letter to us explaining that, upon receipt of our stay order and <em>on the advice of the Department, </em>Ms. Groomes \u201cimmediately took custody of [Amber].\u201d According to Mr. Hudgens\u2019s indignant version of what had transpired, the juvenile court had then \u201centertain[ed] a \u2018walk-on\u2019 (short-notice) item presented by [Ms. Robinson and Ms. Guy], over our objection\u201d and had \u201cordered custody of [Amber] returned to [Ms. Jones] immediately. [Ms. <em>Groomes], whose declaration </em>z[j] <em>filed with this letter, has said she will resist compliance with today\u2019s order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u201cTo spare [Amber] the distress of becoming the object of a judicial and famila [szc] \u2018tug-of-war,\u2019 we urge that your Honorable Court modify its June 19th order by adding the following: [^0 \u2018Meliss[i]a [Groomes] shall have custody of [Amber] until further order of this court. [Ms. Jones] shall file with this court her declaration under penalty of perjury as to whether she is going out of state between now and October 1, 1995, and if so, when and for how long.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In a declaration accompanying Mr. Hudgens\u2019s letter, Mr. McCauley told us he \u201cstrenuously objected\u201d to the matter being heard by the juvenile court while \u201cthe Court of Appeal had the matter under consideration.\u201d In her declaration, Ms. Groomes explained that she had told Ms. Hand that Ms. Jones planned to leave the state on June 20; that, contrary to the in-court representations by the mother\u2019s attorney, Amber\u2019s mother was \u201cnot in favor\u201d of Amber staying in Texas for four to five weeks; and that, <em>\u201c{o]n the evening </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>of Monday, June 19, 1995, social worker Kate Hand received the stay order from the Court of Appeal and told me to pick <em>[Amber] up from [Ms.] Jones, which I did.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">On June 21, we responded with the following order: \u201cThe prior order of this court, filed June 19, 1995, stayed only that May 30, 1995 order of the juvenile court permitting [Ms. Jones], the caretaker of [Amber], to take the minor out of the State of California and leave her with an unrelated caretaker in the State of Texas. The order did not contemplate or allow custody of the minor to be changed in any way. Therefore, [the] Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services is hereby ordered to <em>immediately </em>return . . . [Amber] to the custody of [Ms. Jones], by tonight if possible, and if not possible, then no later than noon on June 22, 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">On June 23, Ms. Robinson filed Amber\u2019s formal opposition to the Department\u2019s petition. After summarizing the proceedings and explaining her belief that Ms. Jones was providing Amber with \u201ca wonderful summer full of learning opportunities,\u201d Ms. Robinson suggested the Department had acted in bad faith and without regard to Amber\u2019s well being in its handling of this entire matter. Elaborating on what happened after we issued our stay, Ms. Robinson explained that when Ms. Hand and Ms. Groomes went to take Amber from her day care provider and served a copy of our order on Ms. Jones, Ms. Jones suggested our order merely meant what it said. Ms. Hand\u2019s response was that she had the \u201cpower\u201d to take the child from Ms. Jones\u2019s custody any time she wanted and to place her anywhere she chose. When Ms. Jones said she would cancel her trip, Ms. Hand nevertheless \u201ctook the child crying and screaming\u201d from Ms. Jones and placed her with Ms. Groomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In an accompanying declaration, Ms. Robinson explained that, as Amber\u2019s attorney, she believed the planned vacation was in the child\u2019s best interests. She also explained that, as a result of these events and her contact with Ms. Groomes, she had \u201cgrave concerns over whether [Ms. Groomes] is an appropriate caretaker for this or any other child under the jurisdiction of this court. Ms. Groomes in speaking to me was literally hysterical, screaming at me over the telephone and hollering at me without ever being able to calmly discuss the matter at hand. . . .Iam concerned that Ms. Groom[e]s may, in fact, not be emotionally stable or that her inappropriate behavior may be chemically induced. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">J.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">On June 23, Mr. Hudgens submitted Ms. Hand\u2019s declaration. According to Ms. Hand, when she received our stay order on June 19, she and Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Groomes went to Amber\u2019s day care provider. Upon their arrival, Ms. Hand showed Ms. Jones the order and suggested they talk. According to Ms. Hand, Ms. Jones refused, took Amber by the hand and said, \u201cyou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d When Amber began to cry, Ms. Hand concluded the child was in pain \u201cand likely to leave the state with Ms. Jones the very next morning.\u201d Accordingly, she stepped between Ms. Jones and Amber, \u201creleased [Amber] from Ms. Jones\u2019 grasp and told Ms. Jones that Amber would be staying with [Ms.] Groom[e]s until she returned from Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">K.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">On June 23, we vacated our temporary stay order and denied the Department\u2019s petition. We also issued an order to show cause to the Department and County Counsel, directing them to appear and show cause regarding (1) whether there was <em>anything </em>in our stay order to support the decision to take the child from Ms. Jones and place her with Ms. Groomes or anyone else; (2) whether the Department and its attorneys acted in bad faith, for improper purposes, and/or with deliberate disregard of our express orders; and (3) whether monetary or other sanctions should be imposed on the Department and its attorneys or either of them. We specifically ordered that Mr. McCauley, Mr. Hudgens and Ms. Hand appear before us on July 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">L.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">On July 10, the Department and County Counsel filed a written response to our OSC, contending they did not violate our stay order; that the \u201cstay order made no specification as to custody, but was very explicit that [Amber] was not to be taken to Texas and left in the care of an unrelated caretaker there.\u201d Having unilaterally concluded that Ms. Jones could not be trusted \u201ceither to remain in California or to keep [Amber] in her care while in Texas\u201d (rather than leaving her with Mr. Coleman), and based on the \u201cscene\u201d at the day care center, County Counsel and the Department decided they had inherent jurisdiction to protect the minor and take custody from Ms. Jones. Of course, this scenario conveniently ignores the fact that, by having Ms. Groomes drive to the day care center in her own car, Ms. Hand revealed her plan to take custody of the child no matter what Ms. Jones might have said or done.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Although there is nothing in the record other than Ms. Groomes\u2019s statement about what Ms. Jones supposedly told her (that she might leave on June 20),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Department and County Counsel concluded that Ms. Jones was a flight risk because (1) as of July 5 (that is, <em>after </em>we dissolved our stay order and denied the petition), Ms. Jones\u2019s voice mail message at work said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>she would be \u201con vacation\u201d from June 29 to July 7; and (2) Amber\u2019s day care provider told Ms. Hand she had not seen Amber since June 27 and did not expect her to return until September. Of course, none of this has anything to do with the Department\u2019s purported belief, on June 19, that Ms. Jones would violate our stay and leave on June 20. Nevertheless, we are told these \u201cfacts\u201d made it \u201creasonable to infer that Ms. Jones [had] already left for Texas earlier than she had represented to the juvenile court through the minor\u2019s counsel, as she has not mentioned going anywhere else.\u201d The Department has not explained why it was that, after we vacated our stay and denied the petition, Ms. Jones should not have gone ahead with her original plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Instead, it simply suggests Ms. Jones could not be \u201ctrusted\u201d because, \u201c[d]espite all attempts of [the Department\u2019s] personnel to dissuade her from leaving [Amber] with Earl Coleman, and to explain the illegality of doing so, Ms. Jones had consistently stated she would leave [Amber] with [Mr.] Coleman while transacting her business. . . . Transferring [Amber] to Ms. Groom[e]s\u2019 custody, therefore, seemed the surest way of making certain that [Amber] was not taken to Texas and left with an unrelated caretaker there.\u201d In other words, Ms. Jones\u2019s efforts to obtain permission from the juvenile court to do what it (and we) believe she had every right to do means she couldn\u2019t be trusted and provides good cause for the Department and County Counsel to ask us for relief and, when it is denied, to go ahead and do what they want without regard to what any court might have to say about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Mr. Hudgens\u2019s declaration concedes there \u201cwas no mention [in the stay order] as to who was to have custody of [Amber],\u201d but insists there was \u201cno doubt\u201d in his mind \u201cthat the intent of the order was to keep the child in the state, and that the only sure means of doing so on such short notice was to have DCFS transfer [Amber] to Ms. Groom[e]s\u2019 custody before Ms. Jones left the state with [Amber] on June 20, 1995. ... I, therefore, told Mr. McCauley to telephone DCFS immediately from the building in which the Court of Appeal is located, to advise them to transfer [Amber] to Ms. Groom[e]s\u2019 custody that day.\u201d In other words, the change in placement was Mr. Hudgens\u2019s idea, not the Department\u2019s, as previously suggested by Mr. Hudgens. (See pt. G, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">When the juvenile court ordered Amber returned to Ms. Jones, Mr. Hudgens tells us he \u201creturned to the Court of Appeal reasonably confident that Division One would regard the trial court\u2019s latest order as a[n] usurpation of appellate writ jurisdiction, and would modify its June 19 order to specify that custody of [Amber] remain with Ms. Groom[e]s until it was satisfied that Ms. Jones was not planning to take [Amber] to Texas. I was surprised when Division One refused to modify the June 19 order; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>perplexed when their clerk told me verbally that the justices were very upset by the transfer of [Amber\u2019s] custody, and insisted that the child be restored to Ms. Jones\u2019s custody immediately . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In our view, the facts speak for themselves and there are only a few things left to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">First, we are dismayed and discouraged by this view of the system\u2019s response to a responsible foster parent\u2019s voluntary attempts to comply with the Department\u2019s rules and regulations. As noted at the outset, we do not share the Department\u2019s notion that leaving Amber with Mr. Coleman for a few weeks constitutes a \u201cplacement\u201d within the meaning of the governing statutes. In spite of that fact, we can understand the Department\u2019s concern about out-of-state trips by dependent children and the need for special care when such a trip is contemplated. What we can\u2019t understand is the refusal to view this case (or any case) on its merits. While Ms. Hand may be overworked, that is no excuse for her stubborn refusal to consider Ms. Jones\u2019s request simply because of \u201cDepartment policy.\u201d In our view, Ms. Hand seems to have forgotten that she is charged with protecting Amber\u2019s best interests, not with maintaining the Department\u2019s right to intimidate foster parents (and punish those who have the temerity to resist intimidation).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Second, we are equally dismayed by County Counsel\u2019s conduct. Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley regularly file petitions in our court. Sometimes we give them all that they ask for, sometimes part of what they want, and other times we deny their requests altogether. In the past, they have always understood the letter and the spirit of our stay orders and they have always been able to distinguish between orders granting affirmative relief and simple stay orders. For these reasons, we simply cannot accept their assertion that they \u201cmisunderstood\u201d the intent of our June 19 stay order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Third, we are not impressed with the conflicting declarations filed by Ms. Hand, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley. First, they insisted they took Amber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>from Ms. Jones on June 19 solely because Ms. Jones refused to sit down and talk to Ms. Hand. Later, after it became obvious that their request to Ms. Groomes to meet Ms. Hand at the day care center defeated a claim of a last-minute decision, they changed their story and told us they misconstrued our order and asked us to accept their representation that, based on information acquired in <em>early July, </em>they decided on <em>June 19 </em>that Ms. Jones couldn\u2019t be trusted. Other inconsistencies are noted throughout this opinion and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Fourth, the Department and its attorneys seem to have forgotten that Amber is represented by Ms. Robinson. Ms. Robinson presented Ms. Jones\u2019s application to the court in the first instance because Ms. Robinson thought the planned trip was in Amber\u2019s best interests (and, of course, because Ms. Jones was not at that time represented by her own attorney and needed help with her efforts to question the Department\u2019s arbitrary denial of her request). The Department and its attorneys nevertheless took Amber from Ms. Jones without ever bothering to tell Ms. Robinson, who found out what had happened on June 20 when she called Ms. Jones to tell her the stay had been issued. Had the Department and its lawyers been acting in good faith and with Amber\u2019s best interests in mind, it is inconceivable that they would have taken the steps they did without notifying Amber\u2019s court-appointed representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We are satisfied beyond any doubt that Ms. Hand, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley acted without regard to Amber\u2019s best interests, in bad faith and for an improper purpose\u2014to punish Ms. Jones for daring to question the Department\u2019s decision, to show the juvenile court that it was a waste of time to order anything that the Department, in its unilateral and unrestricted view, did not approve and, finally, to let us know that they were equally unimpressed with our orders. If ever a case cried out for the imposition of sanctions, this is it. <em>{In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637 [183 Cal.Rptr. 508, 646 P.2d 179]; <em>Manzetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 373, 375, 381-382 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 857]; <em>City of Bell Gardens </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1563, 1570-1574 [283 Cal.Rptr. 91]; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 611, 619 [253 CaLRptr. 748].)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>We see no purpose in having the County pay money to itself which, as a practical matter, would be the result of ordering reimbursement for the attorney fees incurred by Ms. Robinson and Susan Crane (the attorney now representing Ms. Jones) since both attorneys are paid by the County in the first instance. However, we do believe that Ms. Jones is entitled to full reimbursement for the expenses she incurred when she had to change her travel plans without prior notice, a total of $1,500. That amount is to be paid to Ms. Jones, one-third each by Ms. Hand, Mr. McCauley and Mr. Hudgens.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In addition, we believe this is an appropriate case for the imposition of sanctions payable to the Court of Appeal. (See <em>Manzetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 375, 381-382; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Rosenthal </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 135-137 [260 Cal.Rptr. 369].) Accordingly, Ms. Hand, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley are each ordered to pay $1,000 to the Clerk of the Court of Appeal as sanctions for a frivolous writ petition (a total of $3,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Ms. Hand, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley shall, within five days, deliver to Ms. Crane cashier\u2019s checks in the amount of $500 each, all payable to Ms. Jones (a total of $1,500). Within the same time, cashiers\u2019 checks in the amount of $1,000 each, all payable to the Clerk of the Court of Appeal, shall be delivered to the Clerk of this court by Ms. Hand, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley (a total of $3,000). This order is immediately final. The clerk of this court is directed to mail a copy of this opinion to the Los Angeles Office of the State Bar of California, to the attention of the Chief Trial Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Ortega, Acting P. J., and Masterson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 26, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-9\"> None of our comments about the attorneys representing the Department are directed at Mr. Lui.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-10\"> In September 1992, Amber and her five siblings were declared dependent children of the court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 300. Amber was placed with Ms. Jones, two siblings were placed with Melissia Groomes (an aunt) and the other three children were placed with other relatives. Amber\u2019s mother was and still is physically disabled and unable to care for her children, and the whereabouts of Amber\u2019s father are unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> It bears noting at this point that, despite the Department\u2019s statutory obligation to regularly check on the status of foster children, Ms. Hand and others in the Department who preceded her involvement with Amber knew that Ms. Jones was a responsible foster parent and that Amber was in good hands and, as a result, rarely, if ever, contacted Ms. Jones to check on Amber\u2019s status. As a practical matter, therefore, Ms. Jones could have simply taken the trip and never notified the Department of her plans to take Amber out of California. Instead, she played by the rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> Ms. Jones did as requested and sent a formal letter to Ms. Robinson, explaining her plans as described above. She also explained that Mr. Coleman had lived in California until last fall, when he was transferred by his employer, General Telephone Company, to Dallas. Until that transfer, he regularly visited Justin at Ms. Jones\u2019s home and he always included Amber in his activities with his son. Ms. Jones added: \u201cMr. Coleman has known our family for the last twenty years. He knew [Amber\u2019s] great grandmother, grandmother, and mother. He is a fine law abiding citizen and could provide the highest references.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> This statement was not true. According to Ms. Robinson, she personally tried to contact Ms. Hand to discuss the planned vacation. First, she was told the social worker was on leave. When counsel finally \u201ctracked down the [social] worker handling the case, [she] was informed the Department would not approve the vacation request because Mr. Coleman is an unrelated caretaker,\u201d not because needed information had not been, provided. In short, the evidence suggests Ms. Hand <em>was </em>given the information she needed and she simply refused to pursue the matter\u2014a fact she essentially admitted when, in response to our OSC, she stated in her declaration that a \u201cquick search\u201d of Mr. Coleman conducted <em>before </em>May 25 revealed no criminal record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> All section references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code. When a minor is adjudged a dependent child of the court under sections 300 and 361 and it is not feasible to place the child with a parent, subdivision (d) of section 361.2 authorizes placement of the child in the home of a relative, a foster home, a suitable licensed community care facility, a foster family agency for placement with a suitable foster family and elsewhere under special circumstances which have no application to this case. Under section 361.3, the decision about where to \u201cplace\u201d a child among the possibilities listed in section 361.2 is supposed to be based upon the best interests of the child, the wishes of the parent, placement of siblings, and so on. Amber is \u201cplaced\u201d with Ms. Jones and has been for three years, and the only issue before the juvenile court was whether Ms. Jones could leave Amber with Mr. Coleman for a portion of their five-week stay in Texas. Accordingly, Mr. McCauley\u2019s suggestion that Ms. Groomes was entitled to preference because two of Amber\u2019s siblings live with her had nothing to do with the matter then before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> As will appear, the sole source of this \u201cbelief\u2019 is an unconfirmed statement by Ms. Groomes that Ms. Jones told her on <em>June 6 </em>that she might leave on June 20. Indeed, according to Ms. Hand\u2019s July 7 declaration, Ms. Groomes told her of the planned June 20 departure at about that same time and well before Mr. McCauley\u2019s application to the juvenile court for reconsideration, yet he said nothing about it during the June 13 hearing. There was ample time for Ms. Hand to call Ms. Jones or to ask Mr. McCauley or Mr. Hudgens to ask Ms. Robinson to ascertain the precise date of Ms. Jones\u2019s planned departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> In their written opposition to our OSC re sanctions, the Department and County Counsel claim they \u201cdetermined to transfer temporarily the custody of the minor from red party in interest [Ms.] Jones <em>because of facts occurring subsequent to the issuance of the stay order.\" </em>The record defeats this assertion. Ms. Hand\u2019s call to Ms. Groomes on June 19 to request that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>she drive more than 60 miles from her home to meet Ms. Hand at Amber\u2019s San Bernardino day care center demonstrates the Department\u2019s preexisting determination to take Amber away from Ms. Jones no matter what she said or did and no matter what we did or didn\u2019t do. Ms. Groomes\u2019s June 21 declaration states that, on June 19, Ms. Hand \u201creceived the stay order from the Court of Appeal and told me to pick [Amber] up from [Ms.] Jones, which I did.\u201d Indeed, Ms. Hand\u2019s declaration of July 7 states that, on the afternoon of June 19 (when we issued our stay order), \u201cJohn McCauley telephoned to inform me that the Court of Appeal had granted a stay order of which he was faxing me a copy to serve on [Ms.] Jones, and that I should pick up Amber at the day care center right away, to keep Ms. Jones from going to Texas. [SO I spoke to Angela Parks-Pyles, the supervising CSW on duty, who concurred that I should pick up Amber right away and release her to Melissia Groomes. Ms. Parks-Pyles . . . instructed me to telephone the day care provider and caution her not to release Amber to Ms. Jones until I arrived.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> It is uncontroverted that no one from the Department or County Counsel\u2019s office ever attempted to call Ms. Jones or Ms. Robinson to inquire about the actual date of Ms. Jones\u2019s planned departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\"> In her declaration filed in opposition to our OSC, Ms. Hand claims there was not enough time between Ms. Jones\u2019s first call (in March) and her planned departure date (late June) to check out Mr. Coleman\u2019s qualifications. Of course, this doesn\u2019t explain Ms. Hand\u2019s unwillingness to accept the juvenile court\u2019s view of the trip as a vacation and not a \u201cplacement,\u201d nor does it explain Ms. Hand\u2019s conduct after we refused to issue an order transferring Amber\u2019s custody to Ms. Groomes. It is also inconsistent with Mr. McCauley\u2019s representation to the juvenile court that the reason Ms. Hand did not investigate Mr. Coleman was because Ms. Jones failed to provide the required information. (See also fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> If Mr. Hudgens is as obtuse as his declaration would have us believe, he has no business representing a Department entrusted with the care of minors. He states: \u201cAlthough there was no mention [in the stay order] as to who was to have custody of [Amber], I had no doubt that the intent of the order was to keep the child in the state, and that the only sure means of doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>so on such short notice was to have DCFS transfer [Amber] to Ms. Groom[e]s\u2019 custody before Ms. Jones left the state with [Amber] on June 20, 1995. Judging by the speed with which it acted and its history of granting relief in dependency emergencies, I anticipated that Division One would be unhappy with County Counsel and DCFS if we allowed [Amber] to leave California and something bad happened to her in Texas.\u201d In our view, Mr. Hudgens and Mr. McCauley and their client were not about to let us interfere with their efforts to punish Ms. Jones for her refusal to accept their word as final on the subject of her trip. And, of course, we believe Mr. Hudgens, Mr. McCauley, Ms. Hand and Ms. Hand\u2019s supervisors were all so involved in this power play that they completely forgot about Amber.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> We express no opinion on whether they should be reimbursed by their respective employers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
