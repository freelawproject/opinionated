His complaint also included other causes of action which are not pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">The matter proceeded to trial on September 15,1993. At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant moved for a directed verdict on his breach of contract cause of action, urging he had been summarily discharged on August 9, 1990, without the written notice required by the employment agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motion and submitted the issue of damages to the jury. It returned a special verdict awarding appellant $130,000 as a result of Hamer Toyota\u2019s breach. Immediately thereafter, the trial court was asked to order Hamer Toyota to specifically perform on the stock purchase agreement. It declined to do so. Appellant has appealed from the judgment entered after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-8\">In 1987, appellant became the general manager of Hamer Toyota, where he had previously worked as a salesman and a finance manager. The following year, appellant and Lee Hamer, the president of Hamer Toyota, entered into discussions about the possibility of appellant purchasing the stock of the dealership. Their dialogue culminated in appellant\u2019s execution of employment and stock purchase agreements on February 3, 1989. The employment agreement provided appellant would receive a monthly salary of $10,000, an automobile, health insurance and a bonus of 20 percent of the annual net operating profit of the dealership. The stock purchase agreement called for Hamer Motors, Inc., the principal shareholder of Hamer Toyota, to sell appellant 92 percent of its stock for $5,979,991. It was anticipated appellant would procure 49 percent of the stock with the bonuses he accrued under the employment agreement and an escrow was set up to facilitate that aspect of the parties\u2019 agreement. The remaining 51 percent of the stock was to be purchased with additional funds raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>During appellant\u2019s tenure as general manager of Hamer Toyota, he was frequently absent from the dealership. When he was present, he repeatedly engaged in conduct which fostered an unbusinesslike atmosphere in the office. In 1989 and 1990, the dealership suffered substantial losses due to false reporting of sales during incentive periods, improper documentation of fleet sales, and the failure to demand cashier\u2019s checks or cash from auto brokers. By early 1990, the relationship between appellant and Hamer had become strained. On July 9, 1990, Hamer wrote a performance review memorandum to the Hamer Toyota board of directors detailing his complaints about appellant\u2019s lack of effective leadership and planning. The memo called upon appellant to correct the problems within 30 days and instructed him to undertake certain specified actions. The board of directors apparently adopted a resolution incorporating those directives at its meeting of July 9, 1990. A month later, the board summarily discharged appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">A few days after his termination, appellant was hired as general manager of Mike Miller Toyota, where he commenced work on August 15, 1990. His compensation included an initial base salary of $10,000 per month, a vehicle, medical benefits and 10 percent of the dealership profits. He worked at Mike Miller Toyota for just two months before being fired on October 16, 1990. According to Mike Miller, the president of Mike Miller Toyota, appellant had overstated sales and incentives during the time he served as general manager and the dealership lost employees and sales. The day before appellant was discharged, he was out of the office playing golf at a particularly critical time. After his departure as general manager of Mike Miller Toyota, appellant obtained employment in other capacities at several dealerships for periods ranging from one month to eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">Appellant contends: \u201c[I.] The trial court\u2019s modification of BAJI 10.16 misdirected the jury resulting in a miscarriage of justice. . . . [II.] Admission of Art Miller\u2019s testimony was an abuse of discretion. . . . [III.] The trial court erroneously denied appellant specific performance as to the stock purchase agreement. . . . [IV.] The trial court\u2019s exclusion of the testimony of Lee Hamer was an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-8\">I. <em>BAJI No. 10.16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">The jury was given, over appellant\u2019s objection, a modified version of BAJI No. 10.16, which read: \u201cAn employee who was damaged as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>of a breach of an employment contract by the employer, has a duty to take steps to minimize the loss by making a reasonable effort to find <em>and retain </em>comparable employment. [f| If the employee through reasonable efforts could have found <em>and retained </em>comparable employment, any amount that the employee could reasonably have earned by obtaining <em>and retaining </em>comparable employment through reasonable efforts shall be deducted from the amount of damages awarded to employee.\u201d (Italics designate modifications to the standard BAJI instruction.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">BAJI No. 10.16, as drafted by the Committee on Standard Jury Instructions, Civil, of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (BAJI Committee), does not contemplate a setting in which the wrongfully terminated employee actually secures a substantially similar job. It offers a method of calculating damages based upon what an employee <em>could </em>have earned <em>if the </em>employee <em>could </em>have found comparable work. This is not surprising since the typical inquiry where an employer asserts a former employee did not mitigate damages is whether the employee unreasonably rejected or failed to find comparable employment. Thus, in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 176 [89 Cal.Rptr. 737, 474 P.2d 689, 44 A.L.R.3d 615], which is referred to in the comment to BAJI No. 10.16, the court was faced with an employee\u2019s failure to accept her employer\u2019s tendered substitute employment. The sole question in the case was whether the employer\u2019s alternate employment offer was comparable or substantially similar to that of which the employee had been deprived, so that the employee\u2019s refusal to accept it could be used to mitigate the employer\u2019s damages.  In resolving this point adversely to the employer, the court elucidated the standard applicable in such instances: \u201cThe general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of service, less the amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee has earned or with reasonable effort might have earned from other employment. [Citations.] However, before projected earnings from other employment opportunities not sought or accepted by the discharged employee can be applied in mitigation, the employer must show that the other employment was comparable, or substantially similar, to that of which the employee has been deprived; the employee\u2019s rejection of or failure to seek other available employment of a different or inferior kind may not be resorted to in order to mitigate damages. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Parker </em>v. <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at pp. 181-182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">The court in <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Personnel Commission </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 241 [106 Cal.Rptr. 283] addressed the underlying rationale for the mitigation rule, quoting from earlier cases which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>commented on the subject. \u201c \u2018The familiar rule requiring a plaintiff in a tort or contract action to mitigate damages embodies notions of fairness and socially responsible behavior which are fundamental to our jurisprudence. Most broadly stated, it precludes the recovery of damages which, through the exercise of due diligence, could have been avoided. Thus, in essence, it is a rule requiring reasonable conduct in commercial affairs. This general principle governs the obligations of an employee after his employer has wrongfully repudiated or terminated the employment contract. Rather than permitting the employee simply to remain idle during the balance of the contract period, the law requires him to make a reasonable effort to secure other employment.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">\u201cThe issue has also been discussed in terms of [an employee\u2019s] duty . . . to minimize his loss. Thus Judge Cardozo stated: \u2018 \u201cThe servant is free to accept employment or reject it according to his uncensored pleasure. What is meant by the supposed duty is merely this: That if he unreasonably reject, he will not be heard to say that the loss of wages from then on shall be deemed the jural consequence of the earlier discharge. He has broken the chain of causation, and loss resulting to him thereafter is suffered through his own act.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Personnel Commission, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d at p. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">The parties have not cited nor has our independent research revealed any cases analyzing what is meant by the duty to mitigate in the context of a discharged employee who, after finding and accepting comparable employment, loses the position because of his or her own conduct. Nor, as we have previously indicated, is this factual scenario covered by the standard BAJI No. 10.16 instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, when one considers the basic principles underlying the mitigation rule, it is manifest that a jury, in deciding the reasonableness of a wrongfully discharged employee\u2019s efforts to mitigate damages, may properly take into account that employee\u2019s failure to retain comparable employment once it has been secured. The crux of the mitigation rule is that while the compensation to which the employee would have been entitled for the unexpired period of the contract affords a prima facie measure of damages, the employee\u2019s \u201cactual damage is the amount of money he [or she] was out of pocket <em>by reason of the wrongful </em>discharge.\u201d <em>(Erler </em>v. <em>Five Points Motors, Inc. </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 560, 567-568 [57 Cal.Rptr. 516], italics added.) Therefore, in those instances where the jury determines the employee was fired from a substantially similar position for cause, any amount the employee with reasonable effort could have earned by retaining that employment should be deducted from the amount of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>which otherwise would have been awarded to the employee under the terms of the original employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">In our present case, the record contains ample evidence to sustain findings that appellant obtained comparable employment within days after being wrongfully terminated by Hamer Toyota and that despite the fact his new position was of the \u201cat will\u201d variety, he was fired for good cause. That being so, there is no basis for concluding he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision to modify BAJI No. 10.16</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">II. <em>Admission of Art Miller\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">On March 29, 1993, Hamer Toyota designated Art Miller as its damages expert and, in a declaration executed on that date, its counsel averred Miller would \u201cbe sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a meaningful oral deposition pertaining to his specific testimony including his opinions and its basis [szc] that, he is expected to give at trial <em>upon his review of the conclusions and opinions reached by plaintiffs expert witness, Arthur Brodshatzer. </em>. . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the discovery referee ordered appellant and Hamer Toyota to produce their respective damages experts for deposition on a mutually agreeable date. Appellant\u2019s expert was to be deposed first. The depositions were ultimately set for July 6, 1993. Hamer Toyota deposed appellant\u2019s expert that morning and Miller appeared for his deposition that afternoon. He testified he had not completely developed his opinions concerning appellant\u2019s damages and needed approximately 16 hours to complete his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">Despite appellant\u2019s inability to complete Miller\u2019s deposition to his satisfaction on July 6, 1993, he neither informally requested that Hamer Toyota produce Miller for a follow-up deposition, nor sought relief from the discovery referee for Miller\u2019s failure to comply with the referee\u2019s order, nor made an <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude Miller\u2019s testimony at trial. Rather, he waited until Miller was scheduled to take the stand on October 4, 1993, to voice his first objection. Following a full discussion of the matter, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s oral motion to exclude Miller\u2019s testimony, citing appellant\u2019s failure to make reasonable arrangements to continue the deposition or seek appropriate relief before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">Code of Civil Procedure section 2034, subdivision (j)(4) requires the trial court, \u201con objection of any party who has made a complete and timely compliance with [the section\u2019s exchange requirements],\u201d to \u201cexclude from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to ... [^Q [m]ake that expert available for a deposition . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">While there is no express requirement that the objection be raised before trial, the exclusion sanction applies only if noncompliance with the statute was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d This limitation \u201cmay prevent parties from waiting until trial to raise objections that could have been raised beforehand. I.e., without notice and opportunity to correct deficiencies before trial, a court may find the failure to comply was not \u2018unreasonable\u2019 ....\u2019\u2019 (2 Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1994) f 8:1719.2, p. 8J-28, rev. #1, 1994.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">In the instant case, it seems clear Miller\u2019s lack of readiness at the appointed hour was attributable not to gamesmanship, but to the brief time span between Brodshatzer\u2019s deposition and his. Miller surmised he could be ready \u201cto render the opinions [he] intended] to give at trial\u201d in approximately 16 hours. Appellant made no showing that he would have been irreparably harmed by waiting a day or two to complete Miller\u2019s deposition, nor can we imagine that would have happened. Nonetheless, for whatever reason, he elected not to pursue the matter further until more than two weeks into the trial. Under the circumstances, the trial court was persuaded it was appellant who had acted unreasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in this ruling. The slight delay which would have been incurred had appellant responded promptly to the situation on July 6, 1993, would in no way have compromised the purposes of the discovery statutes.  \u201cThey are intended, among other things, to assist the parties and the trier of fact in ascertaining the truth; to encourage settlement by educating the parties as to the strengths of their claims and defenses; to expedite and facilitate preparation and trial; to prevent delay; and to safeguard against surprise. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Beverly Hospital </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1289, 1294 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 238].)  In this respect, the facts of our case differ from those in <em>City of Fresno </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 296 [201 Cal.Rptr. 219], cited by appellant. There the objecting party\u2019s first opportunity to depose the expert occurred less than two weeks before trial, rendering \u201cthe exercise . . . futile in light of the fact that the expert had neither reviewed the data, settled upon a method, nor reached an opinion.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 301.) Equally distinguishable are two additional cases relied upon by appellant, <em>Zellerino </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 222] and <em>Waicis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 283 [276 Cal.Rptr. 45]. As the court in <em>Zellerino </em>observed, the plaintiff\u2019s actions in failing to comply with section 2034\u2019s disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>requirements \u201cwere not mere infractions\u201d; she engaged in \u201ca comprehensive attempt to thwart the opposition from legitimate and necessary discovery.\u201d (235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1117.) In <em>Waicis, </em>the trial court disqualified the plaintiff\u2019s expert after finding he had \u201crepeatedly been uncooperative in allowing his deposition to be taken . . . .\u201d (226 Cal.App.3d at p. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">After appellant failed in his attempt to prevent Miller from taking the stand, he unsuccessfully sought to have Miller\u2019s testimony stricken. He now argues that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to strike Miller\u2019s testimony. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s suggestion that a follow-up deposition would have been meaningless because Miller had not completed his work until after the trial started is not borne out by the record. Miller merely testified that a few days before taking the stand, he had revised some \u201cwork that [he] had already done . . . .\u201d There was no reason to believe based upon that comment that Miller would not have been ready to continue his deposition within 16 hours as originally estimated, if appellant had endeavored to arrange a follow-up session.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">IE. <em>Specific Performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">Hamer Toyota offered uncontroverted expert testimony to establish appellant was unable to perform under the stock purchase agreement either at the time of trial or one year from that date. Appellant contends such evidence was irrelevant and contrary to the terms of the agreement, which gave him one year after he had acquired 49 percent of the Hamer Toyota stock, or Hamer had become permanently disabled or died, to complete the purchase. Appellant\u2019s expert testified that \u201c2001 represents the estimate of Mr. Hamer\u2019s life expectancy plus one year\u201d and 2006 the year in which it could be expected that appellant would have accumulated the amount of money needed to buy 49 percent of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">Appellant\u2019s analysis, even if correct, does not establish the trial court erred in refusing to grant specific performance. Though there is authority for the notion that specific performance is appropriate in cases involving closely held stock (see, e.g., <em>Gilfallan </em>v. <em>Gilfallan </em>(1914) 168 Cal. 23, 26 [141 P. 623]; <em>Steinmeyer v. Warner Cons. Corp. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 515, 519 [116 Cal.Rptr. 57]; <em>Kaneko </em>v. <em>Okuda </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 217, 234 [15 Cal.Rptr. 792]; <em>Glascock </em>v. <em>Sukumlyn </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 587, 593 [281 P.2d 90]; <em>Korabek </em>v. <em>Weaver Aircraft Corp. </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 32, 39 [149 P.2d 876]), \u201can essential basis for the equitable remedy must be a showing by the plaintiff of performance, or tender of performance, or ability and willingness to perform. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cockrill </em>v. <em>Boas </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 490, 492 [2 P.2d 774].) Here, appellant failed to demonstrate he could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>performed his obligations under the agreement within the time frame identified by his own expert. In fact, what evidence was produced on the subject suggested he had neither the personal assets nor the ability to obtain the commercial financing necessary to conclude the stock transaction. Having failed to meet his burden of proof below, he is precluded from successfully challenging the trial court\u2019s determination on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">IV. <em>Exclusion of Lee Hamer\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">When appellant gave notice that he intended to depose Lee Hamer on April 26, 1993, Hamer Toyota asked him to withdraw it, citing Hamer\u2019s medical condition. Appellant failed to do so and Hamer Toyota sought a protective order. On May 11, 1993, the date the issue was set for hearing before the discovery referee, the parties conditionally stipulated Hamer Toyota would withdraw its motion for a protective order and produce Hamer for a deposition on or before August 2, 1993. If Hamer\u2019s medical condition had not improved by that time, Hamer Toyota would be obliged to move again for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Appellant noticed Hamer\u2019s deposition for August 2, 1993, and Hamer Toyota moved for a protective order, supporting its motion with the declaration of Hamer\u2019s primary treating physician, Doctor Keith Richman. Rich-man averred that Hamer suffered from organic brain syndrome, or senility, that the stresses of a deposition would exacerbate his condition \u201cand render him confused to such an extent that any deposition testimony would be incompetent,\u201d and that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d Hamer\u2019s situation would improve in the future. The discovery referee granted Hamer Toyota\u2019s motion on August 12, 1993, without prejudice to appellant\u2019s ability to raise the matter in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">As expected, a subsequent hearing was held to determine Hamer\u2019s competency to testify at trial. Richman, Hamer Toyota\u2019s sole witness, testified the 82-year-old Hamer suffers from chronic organic brain syndrome and dementia. As a result, Hamer has difficulty with immediate recall and short-term memory, hallucinates, experiences confusion and \u201cconfabulates.\u201d The doctor explained, \u201ca confabulation is where a patient would make up a story when their memory loses them.\u201d Richman indicated Hamer\u2019s condition is progressively worsening and opined that placing him in an unfamiliar setting, such as a courtroom, would exacerbate his problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Appellant attempted to rebut Hamer Toyota\u2019s evidence through the testimony of a psychiatrist, Robert Rubin. Rubin\u2019s opinions were largely limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>to general observations about organic brain syndrome and dementia, since he had never examined Hamer and had reviewed only a portion of Hamer\u2019s medical records after listening to Richman testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant also called as witnesses two individuals who worked at Hamer Toyota and served on its board of directors. They established that Hamer continued to go to the dealership on a part-time basis and to attend board meetings. However, their testimony also revealed that Hamer had serious memory problems and was not really capable of participating in the business in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">In light of the uncontroverted medical evidence concerning the nature of Hamer\u2019s mental difficulties, the trial court found he was incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth and was thus disqualified under Evidence Code section 701. It further expressed the view that having Hamer, who had been placed on call by Hamer Toyota, testify would be of no benefit given the manner in which his condition manifested itself. We cannot say this constituted an abuse of discretion and the trial court\u2019s decision must therefore be upheld on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaughan </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 409, 421 [317 P.2d 974]; <em>In re Basilio T. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 155, 166 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 450]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farley </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 851, 869 [153 Cal.Rptr. 695, 12 A.L.R.4th 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">Fukuto, Acting P.
