(Pen. Code, \u00a7 187.) The jury found true enhancement allegations that defendant personally used a firearm, that a principal was armed, and that defendant discharged a firearm from a motor vehicle causing injury or death. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (a)(1), 12022.55.) Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>He was sentenced to twenty-five years to life for the murder, in addition to a determinate sentence consisting of four years for firearm use and five years for causing injury or death by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">I. <em>Insufficiency of the Evidence*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">II. <em>Sufficient Evidence of Premeditation and Deliberation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Defendant also claims there was insufficient evidence to establish premeditation and deliberation. Defendant, an avowed Crip, argues that \u201c[t]here was evidence of motive only if the court accepts that the group by the roadside was an assembly of Bloods,\u201d but fails to explain why this motive evaporates if Holmes and his friends and relatives were innocent bystanders, some of whom happened to be wearing red. According to defendant\u2019s own argument, \u201cBloods and Crips hate each other so much Bloods omit the letter \u2018C\u2019 in words and Crips omit the letter \u2018B.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The intensity of their rivalry often precipitates hostile confrontation resulting in serious injury and death.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d Apparently, defendant argues that, because Crips and Bloods hate each other so much, \u201c[a] Blood [or anyone else, for that matter] dressed in red is a provocation to a Crip, and is intended to be a provocation to a Crip.\u201d Thus, \u201cfor a Crip to shoot a Blood . . . is a proverbial \u2018kneejerk\u2019 reaction, just the opposite of a shooting done with premeditation and deliberation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument is nonsensical. A studied hatred and enmity, including a preplanned, purposeful resolve to shoot anyone in a certain neighborhood wearing a certain color, evidences the most cold-blooded, most calculated, most culpable, kind of premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThoughts may follow each other with great rapidity and cold, calculated judgment may be arrived at quickly . . . <em>{People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 518 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101].) The law does not require that an action be planned for any great period of time in advance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>Defendant had an admitted motive for the killing; he also had the driver slow the car and virtually stop while he aimed deliberately at the stranded persons he believed were rival gang members. \u201c[A] cold and calculating decision to kill can be arrived at very quickly; we do not measure the necessary reflection solely by its duration.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pensinger </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1210, 1238 [278 Cal.Rptr. 640, 805 P.2d 899].) There was sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 26-27 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">IH.-VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The abstract of judgment is ordered modified to strike the enhancement under Penal Code section 12022.5, subdivision (a), reducing defendant\u2019s sentence by four years. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Ramirez, P.
