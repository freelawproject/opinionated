S. (appellant) was adjudged a ward of the court based on his participation in the theft of an automobile. On appeal he challenges an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>order requiring him to make restitution to the victim. He contends that the amount of the victim\u2019s losses was not adequately proven at the restitution hearing and that the court erred by declaring his obligation \u201cjoint and several\u201d with that of another juvenile. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The court found appellant to be a person described in Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 upon his admission that on or about April 17, 1994, he committed misdemeanor auto theft and resisting arrest. According to the probation report, appellant was a passenger in the stolen vehicle when officers spotted it and tried to stop it. After a chase, the car crashed into a fence post and was significantly damaged. Appellant and the driver, Frazier W., were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The probation report recommended in-home placement, participation in appropriate programs, and restitution to the victim. It stated that the victim\u2019s documented out-of-pocket expenses up to that point were $1,067.17. At the dispositional hearing counsel for appellant requested that \u201csome type of restitution hearing be reserved in this matter, and that some adequate documentation be provided so that we can determine what\u2019s going on here.\u201d The court granted the request and set a separate restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Prior to the hearing the probation officer submitted a supplemental report stating that the victim had provided a written itemization of losses amounting to $1,467.17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing, counsel for appellant argued that the victim\u2019s itemization was insufficient to support a finding that the amounts claimed had in fact been incurred. Counsel objected to the probation officer\u2019s failure to \u201cverify any of this evidence,\u201d suggesting that \u201csome type of affidavit or declaration\u201d should have been presented. The court suggested that appellant and his counsel could themselves have contacted the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>with any disagreements or questions about the claims. Ultimately the court disallowed a $100 entry entitled \u201cMiscellaneous] items,\u201d and a $400 entry entitled \u201cDifference between Blue Book Value &amp; the amount to be paid by insurance co., approximately.\u201d With respect to the latter the court said, \u201cI have to assume that the insurance company paid the owner of the car what the car was worth.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered restitution in the amount of $967.17, the obligation to be \u201cjoint and several\u201d with any such obligation imposed on the driver, Frazier W.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Appellant renews in this court his contention that the victim\u2019s losses were insufficiently proven by her itemized statement. He relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Vournazos </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 948 [244 Cal.Rptr. 82], where the court held insufficient a statement from the victim itemizing stolen or damaged items with asserted values and repair costs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 952, fn. 2.) The court held that this document failed to show that the claimed values represented <em>replacement </em>costs, or that the claimed repair costs reflected \u201cthe actual cost of the repair.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 958.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The <em>Vournazos </em>court professed to acknowledge the rule, adopted in an earlier case, that the defendant \u201cbears the burden of proving that the amount of restitution claimed by the victim exceeds repair or replacement cost of lost or damaged property.\u201d (198 Cal.App.3d at p. 959, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartley </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 126, 130 [209 Cal.Rptr. 131].) In fact the <em>Hartley </em>decision stated an even broader rule: \u201cSince a defendant will learn of <em>the amount of restitution recommended </em>when he reviews the probation report prior to sentencing, the defendant bears the burden at the hearing of proving that amount exceeds the replacement or repair cost.\u201d (163 Cal.App.3d at p. 130, italics added, fn. omitted.) The court went on to offer guidelines for the probation officer\u2019s \u201cinquiry or investigation\u201d into the victim\u2019s losses. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 130, fn. 3.) However the decision appears to mean that, at least where the items, amounts, and sources are adequately identified in or with the probation report, the defendant has the burden of refuting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">We find it difficult to reconcile the holding in <em>Vournazos </em>with the rule just cited. We are not alone in that difficulty. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 939 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] review denied, the only court to squarely consider the holding of <em>Vournazos </em>refused to follow it. The defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Foster </em>was ordered to pay $8,000 for a stolen Persian rug. <em>(Foster, supra, </em>at p. 943.) The probation officer had reported the victim\u2019s statement that she paid $8,000 for the rug. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 944.) The defendant asserted that the court\u2019s reliance on this statement was error under both <em>Vournazos </em>and <em>Hartley. </em>The court refused to read <em>Hartley </em>as barring reliance on the victim\u2019s estimate of value. <em>(Foster, supra, </em>at p. 946, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartley, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at p. 130.) The court found <em>Vournazos </em>\u201cunpersuasive,\u201d partly because it \u201cimposes an unwarranted burden on the trial court, the prosecutor, and the victim.\u201d (14 Cal.App.4th at p. 946, fh. omitted.) Instead, the court concluded, an item\u2019s original cost can generally be treated as evidence of replacement cost for purposes of restitution. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, a property owner\u2019s statements of value, recapitulated in the probation report, \u201cshould be accepted as prima facie evidence of value.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cWhen the probation report includes information on the amount of the victim\u2019s loss and a recommendation as to the amount of restitution, the defendant must come forward with contrary information to challenge that amount. \u2018A defendant\u2019s due process rights are protected if he is given notice of the amount of restitution sought and an opportunity to contest that amount. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 947, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1153, 1161 [261 Cal.Rptr. 93].)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Foster </em>by shifting the thrust of his argument. He contends not that the <em>amounts </em>of the claimed losses were insufficiently shown, but that the victim\u2019s itemization was too ambiguous with respect to the nature of the claimed items. Thus, he asserts, \u201cthe victim failed not only to establish the actual replacement cost. . . , but she failed to clearly explain what exactly she lost. For example, the items \u2018martial arts weapons and spears\u2019 are not easily identified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">These objections were not raised below. Counsel\u2019s main objection was general\u2014that the victim\u2019s statement failed to make a prima facie showing of loss because it was not verified or substantiated by a sworn statement, testimony, or documentation such as receipts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only specific objections raised were that certain <em>amounts </em>were overstated or poorly documented\u2014the number and value of tapes, the amount of the deductible, the \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d items, and the difference between Blue Book value and the victim\u2019s reimbursement from her insurer. The court disallowed the last two items. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The other objections have not been pursued on appeal. Had the objections now raised here been presented to the trial court, it could have exercised its discretion and perhaps obviated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We see no reason to permit such objections to be raised for the first time on appeal. In any event, we find no merit in the objection that the items of loss are not described with sufficient specificity. The question is whether appellant received sufficient notice in advance of the hearing to investigate and oppose the probation officer\u2019s recommendation. At least under the circumstances of this case, all of the items allowed were more than adequately described. Appellant contends that he was entitled to more information concerning the precise nature of the items claimed, but there is no basis for a conclusion that he lacked the information sought, or could not by reasonable efforts obtain it. For example, the trial court was entitled to infer that the \u201cmartial arts weapons and spears\u201d referred to by the victim were in the car when appellant stole it. If they were not, appellant was competent to so testify. If further details were needed, appellant could attempt to procure them, either by contacting the victim or by requesting that the probation officer do so. Having done none of these things, appellant cannot complain about the lack of detail in the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In sum, the court disallowed two items as ambiguous or inexplicable. The remaining items were identified, and their values asserted, with sufficient specificity to permit a defense to the claims. Having presented no meritorious objections, appellant cannot contend that it was petitioner\u2019s (or the probation officer\u2019s) burden to further embellish the showing made.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Appellant next contends that the court erred by ordering that his liability for restitution be \u201cjoint and several\u201d with that of Frazier W. Instead, he asserts, the court should have ordered him to make restitution for half the total losses incurred by the victim. In support of this position he cites <em>In re Brian S. </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 523 [181 Cal.Rptr. 778], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1374 [277 Cal.Rptr. 444] (disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 237 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In <em>Brian S., </em>three or four juveniles participated in a burglary. Two of the juveniles were charged. The trial court ordered one of them (the appellant) to pay one-half the victim\u2019s losses. On appeal the appellant contended among other things that the court \u201cincorrectly refused to consider the responsibility of other culpable parties,\u201d apparently meaning the one or two juveniles who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>participated in the burglaiy but were not charged. The Court of Appeal affirmed the order. \u201cWhile the juvenile court should take into account other culpable parties in imposing a restitution order, there are no rigid guidelines for apportionment. Responsibility of criminal confederates is merely one factor to be considered by the court in exercising its discretion.\u201d (130 Cal.App.3d at p. 533.) \u201cSince it would serve a rehabilitative purpose to require defendant to make the victim whole, we conclude the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the minor to pay restitution for one-half of the losses suffered by the victim.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 533-534, fh. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Defendant apparently reads <em>Brian S. </em>to require <em>per capita </em>apportionment among persons whose responsibility for the victim\u2019s losses is actually adjudicated. It stands for no such rule. It merely holds that the order there, apportioning restitution in a particular manner, was not an abuse of discretion. The underlying principle is that the juvenile court is vested with discretion to apportion restitution in a manner which will effectuate the legislative objectives of making the victim whole and rehabilitating the minor. (See 130 Cal.App.3d at pp. 529, 531-532, 534, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 1374, the court invalidated a condition of probation requiring the defendant to make restitution of $4,000, for which he would be jointly and severally liable with a codefendant. The court acknowledged that imposing a joint obligation \u201cimproves the prospect of the victim being made \u2018whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1379.) However, it continued, \u201c[t]he imposition of restitution must serve a valid rehabilitative purpose and not merely address civil liability.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, the rehabilitative purposes of the order were \u201cclouded\u201d because \u201cthe fulfillment of the condition depends on the actions of another who is completely independent from the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1380.) Moreover, the condition was \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d because it required the defendant to \u201cwait, perhaps up to the very end of his probation term, to determine what is required of him.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The <em>Hernandez </em>decision has been severely weakened by subsequent cases. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Zito </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 736, 744 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 491], review denied, the court expressly disagreed with <em>Hernandez </em>and concluded that \u201ca joint and several restitution order is permissible.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1098-1100 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 35], the Fifth District\u2014which decided Hernandez\u2014limited that case to situations where the restitution order is made as a condition of probation, holding that joint and several restitution may be appropriately ordered in conjunction with a prison commitment. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 825, 833-834 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 433], the court squarely rejected <em>Hernandez </em>and permitted a joint and several restitution order as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>We agree with these courts that <em>Hernandez </em>is unsound in its blanket rejection of joint and several restitution orders. Such an order merely means that the defendant (or juvenile) is responsible to make restitution for the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses, but that the defendant\u2019s obligation shall be reduced by any payments to the victim by other wrongdoers. Here, the trial court\u2019s manifest purpose in using the term \u201cjoint and several\u201d was precisely this\u2014to make appellant responsible for the entire amount of the victim\u2019s losses, while allowing him a credit for any sums paid by Frazier W. Appellant obviously suffered no prejudice from the court\u2019s recognition of an entitlement to credit. He is aggrieved only by the order making him responsible for the entire amount. Therefore the real gist of his argument is that the court erred by obligating him to pay more than his pro rata share of the losses, i.e., one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We see no basis for holding that the court erred by holding appellant responsible for the entire amount of the victim\u2019s losses. All dispositional orders in a wardship case must take into account the best interests of the child and the rehabilitative purposes of the juvenile court law. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 202, subd. (b).) But here, as in an adult criminal case, a proper restitution order \u201cmay serve the salutary purpose of making [the juvenile] understand that he has harmed . . . individual human beings, and that he has a responsibility to make them whole.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Richards </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 614, 620 [131 Cal.Rptr. 537, 552 P.2d 97], quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1378-1379.) This \u201csalutary purpose\u201d would be directly undermined by a rule that each participant in a criminal scheme may be held responsible only for a portion of the overall harm. The trial court\u2019s power to tailor an appropriate order cannot be bounded by such per se rules. Instead that court\u2019s allocation of restitutionary responsibility must be sustained unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion or rests upon a demonstrable error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">There is ample basis on this record for the trial court to conclude that both juveniles were fully responsible for the victim\u2019s losses. While Frazier W. was driving the car at the time of the police chase\u2014and thus appears to have been most directly responsible for the major damage to the car itself\u2014 appellant admitted direct involvement in the original theft and driving the car on previous occasions. There was no evidence that either juvenile was more responsible than the other for the loss of the vehicle\u2019s contents. The record amply supports the court\u2019s determination that appellant should be responsible for the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We also reject the notion that an order such as this one is rendered fatally ambiguous by uncertainty as to the amounts Frazier W. may pay toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>total amount due. It is not accurate to say, as <em>Hernandez </em>does, that this possibility makes appellant\u2019s successful probation depend on the actions of another, or renders the probation order fatally vague as to what is required. (226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1380.) \u201cThe defendant\u2019s obligation is clear; he must pay the full amount of restitution and may pay less if the codefendant also meets his restitution obligation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 833; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Zito, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">No prejudicial error appears. The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Kline, P. J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"> The main body of the victim\u2019s letter to the probation officer appears as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_r\">\u201cItemi[z]ed below is our loss not reimbursed by the insurance co., submitted hereby per your request:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqM\">[[Image here]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\"> None of the cases hold that the victim must supply a sworn proof of loss or detailed documentation of costs and expenses. Of course a trial court would act well within its discretion to decide, as trier of fact, that unverified and unsubstantiated statements were insufficient proof of loss in a particular case. Even more telling might be a victim\u2019s failure to verify or document claims after being asked to do so. Indeed, this was the case in <em>Vournazos, supra, </em>where the probation officer asked the victim\u2019s bookkeeper for documentation, but never received it.
