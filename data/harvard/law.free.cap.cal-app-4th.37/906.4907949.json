Vueve, individually and doing business as Financial Realty Services, and Bill Hector, claiming that defendant real estate brokers committed fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in inducing him to buy a motel in the Lake Tahoe area. Summons, complaint and a statement of damages were duly served on defendants on April 15 and 16. A set of interrogatories was mailed to them on May 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">When no response was forthcoming, plaintiff mailed a request for entry of default on June 3; the clerk entered defendants\u2019 default on June 4. Upon learning of the default, defendants contacted their insurance carrier. On July 26, plaintiff appeared for a \u201cprove-up\u201d hearing and submitted evidence in support of entry of a default judgment. In August, defendants\u2019 insurance carrier retained Attorney Paul Perdue to represent them in the action. After starting work on a motion to set aside the default, Perdue became involved in other matters and completely forgot about the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">On September 2, the court entered default judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $598,049. Defendants\u2019 insurance adjuster called Perdue in February 1994 to inquire about the status of the case, alerting him to the fact that he had done nothing about the file since August. On March 3,1994,182 days after entry of judgment and well in excess of 6 months after clerk\u2019s entry of default, Perdue brought a section 473 motion on defendants\u2019 behalf to set aside the default and the judgment. In support of the motion, Perdue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>filed an affidavit confessing his responsibility for the lengthy period of inaction in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The argument at the hearing focused on whether Perdue\u2019s affidavit of neglect required the trial court to set aside both the default and the judgment under the recent \u201cattorney affidavit\u201d amendments to section 473. After assuming that the motion was brought within the six-month jurisdictional time frame required by that section, the trial court was nevertheless clearly troubled by the fact that the underlying default was not caused by the attorney because it was entered in June, prior to the time Perdue was retained to represent defendants. The court denied the motion by minute order and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">At the outset, it is important to note that we are not concerned with the \u201ctraditional\" discretionary relief provisions of section 473 which allow the trial court to set aside a default caused by a party\u2019s \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or <em>excusable </em>neglect.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendants\u2019 position is that the trial court had a duty to set aside both default and default judgment under the recent mandatory provision of section 473, which states: \u201cNotwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court <em>shall, </em>whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney\u2019s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, <em>unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.\u201d </em>(Italics added; see <em>Sugasawara </em>v. <em>Newland </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 297 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 484].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">We assume that the application was timely and that Attorney Perdue\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to establish attorney neglect within the meaning of this section. Under the recent mandatory relief provision of section 473 relief must be granted regardless of whether the attorney\u2019s neglect is excusable. <em>(Metropolitan Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Casa De Palms, Ltd. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>1481, 1487 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 575].) Accordingly, relief was mandatory absent application of the \u201cunless\u201d clause italicized above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Expressly by its comments and impliedly by its order, the trial court found that the \u201cunless\u201d clause applied because the <em>default </em>was not caused by any act or omission on the part of defendants\u2019 attorney. The logic cannot be questioned, since it is undisputed that Perdue was not hired until after defendants\u2019 default was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Defendants suggest that the word \u201cdefault\u201d in the clause is unclear. They take the position that the section 473 relief is required where the default <em>judgment </em>is caused by attorney neglect even if the attorney had nothing to do with the underlying default. They reason that the Legislature intended the \u201cunless\u201d clause only to enable the court to test the credibility of the attorney\u2019s affidavit, and that mandatory relief for an attorney-caused default judgment is consistent with the remedial spirit of the statute. This argument runs contrary to common sense as well as settled rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Our first task is to determine if there is an ambiguity in the \u201cunless\u201d clause.  Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no need to resort to statutory construction. <em>(Billings </em>v. <em>Health Plan of America </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 250, 256 [275 Cal.Rptr. 80].) \u201c \u2018It is a cardinal rule that a court is not justified in ignoring the plain words of a statute unless it clearly appears that the language used is contrary to what, beyond question, was the intent of the Legislature [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lamberton </em>v. <em>Rhodes-Jamieson </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 748, 754 [245 Cal.Rptr. 162], quoting <em>Breshears </em>v. <em>Indiana Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 245, 250 [63 Cal.Rptr. 879].)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We discern no uncertainty or vagueness in the clause, which carves out an exception for relief where the \u201cdefault\u201d was not caused by attorney misfeasance. \u201c[T]he \u2018default and default judgment are separate procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Rutan </em>v. <em>Summit Sports, Inc. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 965, 970 [219 Cal.Rptr. 381].) The Legislature\u2019s specific and careful use of both \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cdefault judgment\u201d elsewhere in the statute shows that it understood the two terms and the material distinction between them. Yet while the amendment authorizes <em>relief </em>from both default and default judgment, the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>equally clear that for mandatory relief to apply the court must also satisfy itself that the <em>default </em>(i.e., the failure to respond) was in fact caused by attorney mistake or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Defendants\u2019 argument suffers from an insuperable linguistic hurdle, in any event, because if \u201cdefault\u201d does not mean the clerk\u2019s entry of default, what does it mean? While suggesting ambiguity in the word, defendants never tell us exactly what meaning we should ascribe to it. In their reply brief, defendants suggest that the Legislature was using the word \u201cdefault\u201d loosely and genetically to refer to either the default or the default judgment. But even if we take the leap of faith in construing the term to mean \u201cdefault <em>or </em>default judgment\u201d defendants still wind up on the losing end of this appeal, because the court could deny relief if either event were not caused by counsel. Defendants do not venture the implausible proposition that when the Legislature said \u201cdefault\u201d it actually meant \u201cdefault <em>and </em>default judgment,\u201d yet that is exactly what we must hold to accept their argument. Defendants\u2019 failure to confront the logical import of their position illustrates its obvious weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Nothing in the legislative history of the 1988 and 1991 amendments cited by defendants indicates that the Legislature intended mandatory relief for neglectful clients who allow their default to be entered simply because that neglect is compounded by attorney neglect in permitting the judgment to be perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In support of their \u201cremedial spirit\u201d argument, defendants rely on a Senate Rules Committee analysis of the bill stating that \u201c \u2018[i]n an effort to balance the equities the bill seeks to provide the court a mechanism for properly burdening <em>the party whose inaction resulted in the default </em>with the expense of compensating both the court and opposing counsel for any reasonable expenses incurred.\u2019 \u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1975 (1987-1988 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 9,1988.) They also quote from a letter to the Governor from the author of the bill stating that \u201cClients <em>who have done nothing wrong </em>are often denied the opportunity to defend themselves, simply because of the mistake or inadvertence of their attorneys <em>in meeting filing </em>deadlines.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Far from supporting defendants\u2019 argument, the legislative history undercuts it. As illustrated by the italicized language, the policy goal sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>effectuated is to relieve <em>innocent </em>clients from losing their day in court because the attorneys they hired to defend them inexcusably fail to file responsive papers. Nothing in the letter or any of the other legislative materials brought to our attention indicates that the Legislature intended to relieve parties who carelessly permit the default to be entered when they subsequently hire equally neglectful attorneys whose failure to take action allows the default to ripen into a judgment. On the contrary, the \u201cunless\u201d clause appears directly calculated to deny relief to parties, like defendants, who bear personal responsibility for allowing the default to occur in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Nor are we persuaded that the \u201cunless\u201d clause of section 473 was intended solely as a test of the credibility of the attorney\u2019s affidavit. According to this argument, as long as the court believes that the attorney is not trying to \u201ccover-up\u201d for the client, the court must set aside a default judgment upon timely application.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">A close look at the language reveals that the \u201cunless\u201d clause is not a credibility testing device, it is a causation testing device. The statute mandates relief \u201cunless the court finds that the default . . . was not <em>in fact caused </em>by the attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence\u201d etc. (Italics added.) While attorney cover-up is obviously one instance in which the default would not truly be caused by the attorney, there are others like the one at bar in which a neglectful client permits the default to be taken against him before retained counsel enters the scene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Because Attorney Perdue was not representing defendants at the time the default was entered, we find as a matter of law, that he was not the proximate cause of the entry of default as defined in the \u201cunless clause.\u201d Hence, the trial court properly concluded that defendants were not entitled to relief under the attorney affidavit provisions of section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The order denying the section 473 motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Kline, P.

However, no claim is made herein that these affidavits warranted setting aside the judgment below. We therefore do not discuss them further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> We reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court had no jurisdiction to set aside the default (as opposed to the default judgment) because more than six months had passed from the entry of default and the motion for relief. The legislative history of the 1991 amendment makes clear that when a default judgment is vacated pursuant to this section, the trial court is also required to set aside the underlying default. <em>{Sugasawara </em>v. <em>Newland, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 294, 297.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> Letter dated September 14,1988, from Senator Ed Davis to Governor George Deukmejian re: Senate Bill No. 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> Neither the respected treatise cited by defendants (Brown &amp; Weil, Cal.
