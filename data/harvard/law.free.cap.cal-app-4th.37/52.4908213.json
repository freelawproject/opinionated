They inflicted \u201cbodily harm\u201d and exposed her to a \u201csubstantial likelihood of death.\u201d Appellants were apprehended, convicted, and sentenced to state prison for life without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The amended information charged appellants with escape by means of force and violence (count I; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1768.7, subd. (b)), two counts of assault with a deadly weapon (counts II [Goldman] &amp; HI [Victorino]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> extortion (count IV [Lieutenant Barrett]; \u00a7 520), aggravated kidnapping for ransom (count V [Goldman]; \u00a7 209, subd. (a)), false imprisonment of a hostage and use of the victim as shield (count VI [Goldman]; \u00a7\u00a7210.5, 236), attempted kidnapping (count VII [Goldman]; \u00a7\u00a7 664, 207, subd. (a)), and false imprisonment by violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(count VIII [Goldman]; \u00a7236). Personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon allegations were appended to counts I through V. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellants entered pleas of not guilty, denied the special allegations, and waived jury trial. The matter was submitted on the preliminary hearing transcript and exhibits. The trial court found appellants guilty as charged and found the special allegations to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">As to the aggravated kidnapping (count V), the trial court found that the victim suffered \u201cbodily harm\u201d and was confined in a manner exposing her to a \u201csubstantial likelihood of death.\u201d (\u00a7 209, subd. (a).) It sentenced appellants to state prison for life without the possibility of parole, plus one year for personal use of a dangerous weapon. (\u00a7\u00a7 209, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Appellants were also sentenced to a determinate term of nine years. The trial court selected count I (escape by means of force and violence) as the principal offense and imposed an upper term of six years. As to counts II (assault with a deadly weapon), III (assault with a deadly weapon), and count IV (extortion), it imposed a one-year consecutive term for each count (one-third the midterm) and stayed the one-year weapon enhancement for count IV. (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a); 12022, subd. (b).) It imposed and stayed a concurrent five-year term as to count VI (false imprisonment of a hostage), a two-year-six-month term as to count VII (attempted kidnapping), and a two-year term as to count VIII (false imprisonment by violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Pursuant to section 669, the trial court ordered the determinate sentence to run consecutive to the life without parole term and ordered appellants to serve the determinate sentence first. It determined that the life without parole term should run consecutive to the other terms because the injuries inflicted on the victim were gratuitous and caused by the use of force over and above that necessary for the commission of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Appellants contend that (1) the life without parole sentence for aggravated kidnapping is cruel or unusual punishment, (2) insufficient evidence was presented that the kidnap victim suffered \u201cbodily harm\u201d within the meaning of section 209, subdivision (a), or was exposed to a substantial likelihood of death, (3) appellants did not extort an \u201cofficial act,\u201d (4) the convictions for false imprisonment by violence and attempted kidnapping should be vacated because they are lesser included offenses of kidnapping for ransom, (5) the sentence for aggravated kidnapping, extortion, escape, and assault with a deadly weapon violates the section 654 prohibition against multiple punishment, and (6) the court erred in imposing a consecutive determinate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We vacate the convictions for attempted kidnapping and false imprisonment (counts VII &amp; VIII), stay the sentences for escape, assault with a deadly weapon, and extortion (counts I, II, &amp; IV) pursuant to section 654, modify the judgment (\u00a7 1260), and affirm the judgment as modified. This results in a determinate five-year term followed by sentence of life without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On September 17, 1993, appellants were confined at El Paso de Robles, a youth authority facility in Paso Robles. Jerry Oliver, a group supervisor, observed appellants break from a group of wards, run to the library, and punch the librarian, Ava Goldman, in the face. Lopez put his arm around Goldman\u2019s neck and dragged her inside where he held a sharpened metal shank to her neck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Roy Victorino, a vocational landscape instructor, tried to rescue Goldman. Lopez swung at him with the shank. Victorino deflected the blow and sustained a puncture wound to his stomach and a cut on his wrist. Lopez put the shank against Goldman\u2019s neck and yelled, \u201cback off or I\u2019ll kill her!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Chacon ran back and forth to the front door, screaming that they wanted the \u201cOfficer of the Day\u2019s\u201d pickup truck. Chacon threatened to \u201ckill the bitch\u201d if the truck was not delivered. When staff members tried to talk to Chacon, Lopez applied pressure to Goldman\u2019s neck, causing her to pass out a second time. Chacon ran over to Goldman and stabbed her in the stomach with a shank. Appellants threatened to \u201ckill the bitch\u201d if the truck was not delivered. Chacon held the shank to Goldman\u2019s right eye and started a countdown from 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The \u201cOfficer of the Day,\u201d Lieutenant John Barrett, directed Jerry Oliver to park the truck in front of the library. Appellants dragged Goldman to the truck. Lopez kept his arm around her neck and held the shank to her head. Appellants screamed and hollered, \u201c[bjetter not do anything to the truck or do anything with us or we\u2019re going to kill the bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Goldman sat in the middle of the truck cab with Lopez on the passenger side. Lopez continued to hold Goldman around the neck. Chacon got behind the wheel, accelerated full throttle, and spun the tires. Chacon steered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>truck towards Barrett, hitting him on the left arm. As the truck drove past, Barrett sprayed mace through the driver\u2019s open window. The truck sped away, traveled 150 feet, and crashed into a tree. The force of the impact broke the windshield, collapsed the steering wheel, and jammed the doors shut. Appellants were apprehended. A road map with an escape route to Mexico was found on Chacon\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Goldman woke up facedown, yelling \u201cow, ow, I hurt, I hurt, my face, my face, my eyes, my eyes, my back, my back.\u201d Mace was in her eyes and coming out her mouth. An ambulance transported her to the hospital where she was treated for a cut on the right eyelid, bruises, multiple contusions, and a right arm sprain. As a result of this attack, Goldman was unable to work from September 17, 1993, to November 29, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>Aggravated Kidnap: Bodily Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Appellants contend that insufficient evidence was presented to support the finding that Goldman suffered \u201cbodily harm\u201d within the meaning of section 209, subdivision (a). They assert that Goldman\u2019s injuries were trivial and incidental to the kidnapping. Section 209, subdivision (a) provides that the penalty is life without possibility of parole if the victim suffers \u201cbodily harm\u201d <em>or </em>is intentionally confined in a manner which exposes the victim to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 671 [168 Cal.Rptr. 762], the defendants pled guilty to 27 counts of kidnapping for ransom after abducting a busload of schoolchildren from Chowchilla. The trial court found that three of the victims suffered \u201cbodily harm\u201d and imposed a sentence of life without parole. The bodily harm consisted of a nosebleed (not caused by the defendant), fainting spells, nausea and stomachache. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 690.)  The Court of Appeal reversed and held that \u201cbodily harm,\u201d for purposes of aggravated kidnapping for ransom, required \u201c1) a substantial or serious injury to the body of the kidnaped victim, 2) by application of a physical force, 3) beyond that necessarily involved in the forcible kidnapping. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at page 685.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Appellants argue that \u201cbodily harm\u201d requires broken bones or injuries necessitating surgery. We disagree. Whether \u201cbodily harm\u201d has been suffered is a factual question to be decided by the trier of fact. We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>adverse determinations to defendants by application of the three-prong test articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at page 685 and the substantial evidence rule. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576-578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R. 1255].)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Here, appellants hit Goldman in the face, choked her unconscious, stabbed her in the stomach, cut her on the right eyelid, and inflicted severe bruises and contusions to her right arm, leg, hip, ankles, and back. Appellants poked, cut, and scratched the victim with shanks made from rusty landscape nails. The injuries included a nine-inch scratch from the bottom of her throat to her right ear. Goldman testified that she could hardly walk after the incident and that her right arm was badly sprained. Goldman was treated at a hospital and missed 10 weeks of work. She recovered use of the right arm about a week after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The trial court factually found that \u201cMs. Goldman did suffer bodily harm .... It appears to me Ms. Goldman suffered bruising and severe bruising. She suffered what, in my opinion, were severe abrasions; that she suffered swelling; that she suffered unconsciousness on at least two occasions. And . . . that is a bodily injury, in this court\u2019s mind. [*][] She suffered sprains. It\u2019s common knowledge that sprains can actually be more severe than broken bones. And it\u2019s this court\u2019s experience that some cuts requiring sutures can cause less discomfort than the sorts of injuries that were received by Ms. Goldman as a direct result of these defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The injuries suffered meet the three-prong test articulated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Schoenfeld, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at page 685. Substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual determination. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rayford </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 1,23 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 884 P.2d 1369].) We cannot say that the injuries inflicted on Goldman were \u201ctrivial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 511, 517 [282 P.2d 898]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 690, 711 [47 Cal.Rptr. 909, 408 P.2d 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Appellant Lopez argues that the trial court erred in considering the victim\u2019s cumulative injuries because the kidnapping was complete once the pickup was delivered. We disagree. \u201c[F]orcible detention of a victim is an element of kidnapping and as long as the detention continues, the crime continues. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Masten </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 579, 588 [187 Cal.Rptr. 515]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1335 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 177] [abduction followed by continuous period of detention]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dacy </em>(1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 216, 219 [85 Cal.Rptr. 57] [kidnap for ransom began with entry into victim\u2019s house and ended in high-speed chase]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 37, 49-50 [75 Cal.Rptr. 430] [kidnap ended after police rescue].)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 159 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 701], <em>People </em>v. <em>Beaumaster </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 996 [95 Cal.Rptr. 360], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 859 [83 Cal.Rptr. 879] does not compel a different result. There, the defendants committed a robbery or kidnapping, and after the crimes were completed, committed additional offenses. The courts held that the crimes were separate and distinct offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wiley, supra, 25 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 163 [kidnapping for robbery terminated before detention for extortion]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beaumaster, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1008-1009 [robbery, then kidnap for robbery, followed by forcible oral copulation]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at pp. 866-867 [robbery, attempted robbery, and kidnap for robbery completed before defendant sexually molested the same victims].)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\n<em>Aggravated Kidnap: Substantial Likelihood of Death</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Appellants also contend that insufficient evidence was presented that they intentionally confined Goldman in a manner that exposed her to a \u201csubstantial likelihood of death.\u201d The argument lacks merit. Before the truck was delivered, appellants choked Goldman unconscious, stabbed her in the stomach, and severely bruised and sprained her right arm. The method of confinement and appellants\u2019 use of Goldman as a hostage exposed her to a substantial risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The trial court also found that the escape in the truck posed a substantial risk of death because it could have led to a high speed pursuit. This was not impermissible speculation. The Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201clikelihood\u201d allows and requires the trier of fact to draw reasonable inferences in determining whether the victim was exposed to a substantial likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Forced movement of the victim is not an element of kidnapping for ransom. <em>(People </em>v. <em>MacInnes </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 838, 844 [106 Cal.Rptr. 589]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th 1,12, fn 8.) Intentional movement of the victim may create a substantial risk of death. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1992) 18 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1196 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 20] [victim forced to accompany defendants on two- to three-block drive]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 671, 683 [248 Cal.Rptr. 753] [three- to four-block movement]; <em>In re Earley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 122, 130 [120 Cal.Rptr. 881, 534 P.2d 721] [one-block movement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Here, after appellants dragged Goldman to the truck, and sped away from the library, the truck ran into a tree. The force of the impact broke the windshield, jammed the doors shut, and collapsed the steering wheel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>trial court factually found that the escape with Goldman created a \u201csubstantial risk of her death.\u201d Substantial evidence supports this factual determination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rayford, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\n<em>Extortion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Appellant Chacon argues that the prosecution failed to prove extortion because the delivery of the pickup was not an \u201cofficial act.\u201d The contention is without merit. \u201cExtortion\u201d is defined in section 518 as \u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his consent, <em>or </em>the obtaining of an official act of a public officer, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 518 provides that the \u201cobtaining of property\u201d and obtaining of an \u201cofficial act\u201d are alternative objectives of extortion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Norris </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 51, 58 [219 Cal.Rptr. 7, 706 P.2d 1141] (con. opn. of Kaus, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Appellants were not convicted of extorting an \u201cofficial act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court found Lieutenant Barrett furnished the pickup truck \u201cbecause of the force, fear, and threat being used against Ms. Goldman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Norris, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 51 is misplaced. There, the defendant, a prisoner, was transported by two police officers from prison to county jail. Norris brandished a revolver and ordered the officers to drive him to San Francisco. The officers escaped from the car and Norris was captured. Norris was convicted of aggravated kidnapping for extortion of an official act and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the demand to be driven to San Francisco was not extortion. \u201c[T]hreats or demands cannot be converted into extortion [of an official act] merely because the person threatened happens to be an on-duty law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 56.) The case is distinguishable and not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Chacon further contends that the aggravated kidnap conviction must be reversed because his acts did not amount to extortion or attempted extortion. We again point out that appellants were convicted of kidnap for ransom, not kidnap for extortion. Section 209, subdivision (a), is phrased in the disjunctive and encompasses kidnapping \u201c \u2018for ransom, reward or to commit extortion <em>or </em>to exact from another person any money or valuable thing. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibrahim </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1692, 1696 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 269].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Chacon finally asserts that the demand for the truck was robbery, not extortion. He cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 579 [198 Cal.Rptr. 565] for the rule that the confinement of a victim incidental to a robbery does not support a conviction for aggravated kidnap. The argument lacks merit. Robbery and extortion are not the same. \u201c[T]he two crimes are distinguished by the fact that in extortion the property is taken with the victim\u2019s consent whereas in robbery it is taken against his will.\u201d <em>{In re Stanley E. </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 415, 420 [146 Cal.Rptr. 232].) If the ransom demand is made on a person other than the kidnap victim, there is no robbery. The kidnapping for ransom statute applies \u201c. . . to those situations involving a primary and secondary victim, where one of the victims is held or taken away and the other is subjected to a ransom or extortion demand.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>Cruel or Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Appellants contend that the sentence of life without possibility of parole is, \u201con its face\u201d and \u201cas applied,\u201d cruel or unusual punishment. Section 209, subdivision (a), provides that a kidnapping which results in \u201cbodily harm\u201d to the victim or exposes the victim to a \u201csubstantial likelihood of death\u201d carries a mandatory sentence of life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">On review, appellants have the burden of showing that the punishment prescribed is unconstitutional. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169, 174 [121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001].) \u201cA tripartite test has been established to determine whether a penalty offends the prohibition against cruel . . . [or] unusual punishment. First, courts examine the nature of the offense and the offender, \u2018with particular regard to the degree of danger both present to society.\u2019 Second, a comparison is made of the challenged penalty with those imposed in the same jurisdiction for more serious crimes. Third, the challenged penalty is compared with those imposed for the same offense in other jurisdictions. [Citations.] In undertaking this three-part analysis, we consider the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 surrounding the commission of the offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 567, 572 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 220].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Appellants assert that the penalty for aggravated kidnapping for ransom is grossly disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other states and to penalties imposed for more serious offenses in California. Similar challenges have been uniformly rejected. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 299, 307 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 847]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castillo </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 36, 66 [284 Cal.Rptr. 382]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1236-1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Castillo, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 36 is illustrative and dispositive. \u201c \u2018The selection of a proper penalty for a criminal offense is a legislative function involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected, the weighing of practical alternatives, and consideration of relevant policy factors and responsiveness to the public will.\u2019 [Citation.] This broad legislative discretion is subject to constitutional limitation, but given the long-standing, even ancient, horror of kidnapping [citation] and the substantial risk to human life that it presents [citation], we [conclude] that the punishment [on its face] is not excessive.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 66, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Ordonez, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1236-1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Nor is the punishment cruel or unusual as applied to appellants. Aggravated kidnapping for ransom involves an inherent danger to the life of the victim. \u201cBecause it is the Legislature which determines [the] appropriate penalty for criminal offenses, the defendant must overcome a \u2018considerable burden\u2019 in convincing us that his sentence was disproportionate to his level of culpability. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weddle </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1196-1197 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 714].)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Here, the sentence was lawfully predicated on the heinous nature of the crime and appellants\u2019 individualized culpability. Appellants planned the escape and selected Goldman as the kidnap victim because she was small and vulnerable. They threatened to kill her, choked her unconscious, inflicted bodily harm, and exposed her to a substantial risk of death. The sentence of life without possibility of parole is not disproportionate to this crime when measured against appellants\u2019 individualized culpability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">On its face and as applied, the sentences of life without the possibility of parole are not cruel or unusual punishment under the California or federal Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17; U.S. Const., 8th Amend.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\n<em>Lesser Offenses of False Imprisonment and Attempted Kidnapping</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Appellants meritoriously contend that the convictions for attempted kidnapping and false imprisonment (counts VII &amp; VIII) should be vacated because they are lesser-included offenses of kidnapping for ransom. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Magana </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1120-1121 [281 Cal.Rptr. 338] [false imprisonment lesser-offense of kidnapping]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daly </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 47, 57 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 21] [attempted kidnapping a lesser included offense of kidnapping].) Respondent concedes the point. The convictions for attempted kidnapping and false imprisonment (counts VII and VIII) are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\n<em>Section 654</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Appellants contend that the sentence for aggravated kidnapping, extortion, escape by force and violence, and assault with a deadly weapon constitutes impermissible multiple punishment. Section 654 prohibits multiple punishment for an indivisible course of conduct even though it violates more than one statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 99, 119 [137 Cal.Rptr. 447, 561 P.2d 1135].) Whether a course of conduct is indivisible depends on the intent and objective of the actor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Latimer </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1203, 1216 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 144, 858 P.2d 611].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">In <em>In re McCoy </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 739 [72 Cal.Rptr. 373], an inmate at San Quentin broke into a home on the prison grounds, brandished a knife, tied up a woman, and took cash, clothes, and the family automobile. McCoy escaped but was later apprehended. The Court of Appeal held that the robbery was part of and intended to consummate the escape. Applying section 654, the court held that McCoy could only be punished for the more serious crime, robbery. (266 Cal.App.2d at p. 740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The same principle applies here. The kidnap for ransom, extortion, and escape were part of an indivisible transaction having a single objective: escape.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that section 654 requires a stay of the sentences for escape and extortion. (Counts I &amp; IV.) \u201cAlthough the commission of these offenses occurred during the same general transaction, section 954 expressly permits multiple convictions. On the other hand, [the] offenses were incident to one objective, [appellants\u2019 escape]. The California Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed the doctrine of <em>Neal </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 11 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839], which interprets section 654 as permitting punishment for only one of multiple offenses which are incident to a single objective as determined by the intent and objective of the actor. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wiley, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 163.) Section 654 bars multiple punishment where the crimes are directed toward a single goal. Accordingly, the sentence for extortion and attempted escape must be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The sentences for assault with a deadly weapon (counts II and III) require a different analysis. In count II, appellants were charged with assaulting Goldman. The evidence was uncontroverted that Lopez held a shank to Goldman\u2019s neck and choked her unconscious. Chacon ran up to Goldman and stabbed her in the stomach. Relying on cases such as <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 181, 190-191 [251 Cal.Rptr. 40], the Attorney General claims that these assaults were gratuitous and unnecessary acts of violence and not incidental to the kidnap. As to Goldman, we cannot agree. The acts of violence upon her, while atrocious, were committed to get the attention of Lieutenant Barrett so that he would supply the truck. The aggravated kidnap was ongoing. The sentence on count II must be stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Appellants were also convicted of assaulting Roy Victorino with a deadly weapon. (Count III.) When Victorino attempted to rescue Goldman, Lopez took a swing at him. Victorino warded this blow but was stabbed in the stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Even though the defendant entertains a single principal objective during an indivisible course of conduct, he may be convicted and punished for each crime of violence against a different victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1977) 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Cal.3d 873, 885 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].) \u201cThe purpose of section 654 is to ensure punishment will be commensurate with one\u2019s culpability. [Citations.] . . . And, the fact certain acts are proximate in time is not determinate in finding an indivisible course of conduct. Multiple criminal objectives may divide those acts occurring closely together in time. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1144,1157 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 276].) A sentence was properly imposed on count III for assault with a deadly weapon on Victorino.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\n<em>Consecutive Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Appellants finally argue that the trial court erred in ordering the determinate sentence to run consecutive to the life without possibility against parole sentence. The trial court found that consecutive sentences were appropriate because the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence of separate victims. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 425(a)(2); <em>People </em>v. <em>Levitt </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 500, 518 [203 Cal.Rptr. 276].) No error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The record shows that the kidnap victim was selected by appellants because she was a female and small in size, i.e., she was particularly vulnerable. In addition, appellants\u2019 prior convictions were numerous and of increasing seriousness. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 421(a)(3), 425(b).) The presence of these factors indicates that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a consecutive sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arviso </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1059 [247 Cal.Rptr. 559].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Where, as here, the trial court\u2019s intention is clear, there is no need to remand for resentencing as we have the statutory power to modify the judgment. (\u00a7 1260.) There is no likelihood that the trial court would, on remand, impose leniency in the selection of a term as to count III. The conduct which led to the conviction is aggravated and we safely say that the trial court would find that the circumstances in aggravation outweighed any factor in mitigation. Remand for resentencing would exalt substance over form. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bravott </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 93, 98 [227 Cal.Rptr. 810].)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The convictions for attempted kidnapping and false imprisonment (counts VII &amp; VIH) are vacated. A stay of sentence for escape, assault with a deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>weapon, extortion, and false imprisonment of a hostage (counts I, II, IV, and VI) is imposed. The trial court is directed to send an amended abstract of judgment to the Department of Correction designating the following: count in as the principal offense with the upper term of four years, such term to be served consecutive to count V with a one-year enhancement for personal use of a dangerous weapon. As so modified, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Stone (S. J.), P.
