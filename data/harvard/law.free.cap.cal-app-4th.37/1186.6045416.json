We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">On November 3, 1992, respondent Fresno County Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a petition alleging that one-week-old Ronald R. was a minor within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 300, subdivisions (a), (b), and (g). The petition asserted that Ronald\u2019s mother, appellant Lucia R., had used cocaine and heroin daily during pregnancy, and that as a result, Ronald was bom \u201cwith low birth weight, testing positive for heroin and cocaine in his system and exhibiting the negative symptoms of prenatal drug use, namely, jitteriness, jaundice and stiffness.\u201d The petition farther alleged that Ronald was at risk of serious physical harm due to Lucia\u2019s inability to supervise or protect him adequately, and that Ronald was without any provision for support. Ronald was already in DSS custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">On November 4, 1992, a detention hearing was held. Lucia was present and the public defender was appointed to represent her. Lucia denied the allegations in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>The court read and considered a social worker\u2019s report stating that Ronald\u2019s older brother, Jose M., was also bom with cocaine in his system and was placed in protective custody. At that time Lucia agreed to undergo drug treatment and cooperate with DSS, and Jose was returned to her custody; however, during a subsequent 90-day period when family maintenance services were provided to Lucia, she was \u201cevasive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The court released Ronald for placement in foster care or with a suitable relative, and further allowed that Ronald could be released to Lucia \u201cif enrolled in a suitable treatment program.\u201d The court also authorized reasonable supervised visitation for Lucia.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">A jurisdictional hearing was held on January 4, 1993. Lucia was again present with counsel. The jurisdictional allegation based on section 300, subdivision (g) was stricken by request of DSS. Lucia submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, which calendared a dispositional hearing for January 19. Statements by counsel and the DSS officer indicated that Lucia had made at least one attempt to contact the social worker to set up visitation, but had not left any telephone number at which she could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The social study submitted for the January 4th hearing, and considered by the court, was extensive. It contained copies of eight prior child protective services referrals of Lucia between May 1990 and April 1992 dealing with her drug use, with her failure to care for Ronald\u2019s older siblings, and with Jose\u2019s positive toxicology report at birth. Also included was a narrative documentation of Lucia\u2019s intravenous use of heroin, cocaine, and methadone during her pregnancy with Ronald. Finally, hospital records regarding Ronald\u2019s blood screening and postnatal symptoms were included.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">At the January 19th dispositional hearing, Lucia was again present with counsel. The social worker\u2019s report submitted for that hearing indicated that Lucia had taken significant steps, moving into her mother\u2019s home, seeking substance abuse treatment, keeping visitation appointments with Ronald, and maintaining contact with DSS. The court directed that there be no immediate change in placement and that reunification services (including reasonable visitation) be offered to Lucia. A hearing for review of dependency status (six-month review) was calendared for July 16, 1993. On May 18, this hearing was vacated and rescheduled for July 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Lucia failed to appear for the July 30th setting of the six-month review hearing. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that notice of the hearing had been served, but ordered the six-month review hearing continued to August 26,1993, because the social study was late. A notation on the minute order states: \u201cDept to re-notice or provide declaration] of search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>Lucia again failed to appear on August 26, 1993. The court again continued the six-month review hearing, this time to September 16, \u201cfor counsel to contact parents. New notice to go out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Lucia again failed to appear for the September 16th review hearing. The court found that notice had been served but Lucia\u2019s whereabouts were unknown, and it directed counsel to attempt to contact Lucia for a rescheduled hearing on October 1, 1993. A social study submitted to the court for this hearing indicated Ronald remained in appropriate foster care, and Lucia\u2019s whereabouts had been unknown since March 12, 1993. The report stated that Lucia \u201chas not attempted contact with the [social worker] since date of transfer to the Family Reunification Unit.\u201d Lucia\u2019s mother was caring for Ronald\u2019s two siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Lucia was again not present for the six-month review hearing on October 1, and the following exchange took place immediately after the matter was called for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u201cMs. Romero: Carmen Romero, on behalf of Lucia R[.], the mother. She\u2019s not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">\u201cI understand that a declaration of search has been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">\u201cMs. Romero: Your Honor, on September 17th, I wrote to her at the only address which I had which, apparently, is her mother\u2019s address, ... I told her that she had had a hearing on the 16th of September and that I had requested the Matter be continued to today\u2019s date so she could come in and contact me. I told her that services would more than likely be terminated if she did not appear, and I would be asking that I be relieved. And she failed to be here. There was an error in my letter. I indicated she should be here on September 16th. In the body of the letter I indicated that her next date was October the 1st. This morning I called her mother\u2019s house to clarify that. Her mother said she has not seen her daughter in over a month. She does not know where she lives. She had received my letter, but had been unable to give that to her daughter because she didn\u2019t know where she was. So I don\u2019t know what more to do. I don\u2019t know that my error hurt in any way, since she wasn\u2019t there to receive a letter. And I\u2019m requesting that I be relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\u201cThe Court: The request to be relieved is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">A \u201cDeclaration of Search\u201d was filed by Emilia Torres, documenting attempts that had been made to locate Lucia through public records and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>Lucia\u2019s mother. The court found that a \u201cdue diligence search\u201d had been made and an affidavit thereof filed, but that Lucia\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown and no notice had been served. The presumed father\u2019s attorney was also relieved. The court, finding that neither parent had had any contact with Ronald for the prior six months, found prima facie evidence that return of Ronald to either parent would be detrimental and there was no likely date of return. The court further ordered reunification services terminated and set a section 366.26 \u201cpermanency planning\u201d hearing for February 2, 1994. That hearing was subsequently continued to May 4, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Various attempts were made to notify Lucia of the May 4th hearing. She was eventually served personally at the Fresno County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Lucia was present for the May 4th hearing. The court appointed new counsel for Lucia and ordered the hearing continued to May 18. On May 18, Lucia was again not present. Her new attorney appeared, asserted a conflict, and was relieved. New counsel was appointed, and the hearing was continued to May 25, and later to June 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">On June 1,1994, Lucia was again present with counsel. DSS staff member Carolyn Chamberlain testified she had assessed Ronald\u2019s case for purposes of recommending a permanent plan and had concluded Ronald was adoptable; his foster parents had applied for adoption, and the situation was under review. Chamberlain noted the social studies were incorrect in asserting that Lucia and Ronald had not had any contact since Ronald\u2019s birth; however, there clearly was no contact since (at the very latest) February 1993, and the presumed father had never had any contact with Ronald. The foster parents had cooperated in permitting visits with Ronald\u2019s grandmother, and they had indicated their willingness to continue to allow contact with her and with Ronald\u2019s siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">When Lucia indicated she wanted to call her brother as a witness, her attorney requested the case be set for trial. The court set trial for July 19. It was later continued to September 7, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">On September 7 Lucia was present with counsel. At that time, however, Lucia\u2019s attorney stated that Lucia \u201cconfirmed with me today that she wants to submit on [the social worker\u2019s] report and does waive trial and her other rights.\u201d After again hearing testimony from social worker Chamberlain and hearing statements from counsel, the court made the necessary findings, ordered the termination of Lucia\u2019s parental rights, and ordered adoption as the appropriate permanent plan for Ronald.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Lucia filed a timely notice of appeal from the September 7, 1994, judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"> Lutia. argues that reversal is required on two separate grounds: (1) the juvenile court improperly relieved her trial counsel at the six-month review hearing and violated her statutory and due process rights by terminating reunification and scheduling a permanency planning hearing while she was absent and unrepresented; and, (2) the court lacked authority to terminate reunification and schedule the permanency planning hearing at the first judicial review hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We address the second contention first.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">I. <em>The Juvenile Court Was Authorized to Terminate Reunification Services and Schedule a Permanency Planning Hearing at the Six-month Review Hearing.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">II. <em>Permitting Lucia\u2019s Counsel to Withdraw and Ordering Termination of Reunification Services and a Permanency Planning Hearing With Lucia Absent and Unrepresented by Counsel Was Harmless Error Not Amounting to a Denial of Due Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">At the six-month review on October 1, 1993 (the hearing in question here), the court permitted Lucia\u2019s appointed counsel to withdraw from the case for the sole stated reason that counsel had been unable to contact her. Lucia was not present at the hearing, despite what the court determined to be a \u201c[d]ue and diligent search\u201d for her. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that Ronald and Lucia had had no contact for six months and ordered reunification services terminated. Finding no substantial probability that Ronald would be returned to Lucia\u2019s home within six months, the court then scheduled a permanency planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Lucia argues the court erred in permitting counsel to withdraw, and a due process violation took place when the court below made the critical decisions to terminate reunification services and schedule a permanency planning hearing outside her presence and after permitting her attorney to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">\n<em>Statutory right to counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Section 317 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>\u201c(a) When it appears to the court that a parent or guardian of the minor desires counsel but is presently financially unable to afford and cannot for that reason employ counsel, the court may appoint counsel as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201c(d) The counsel appointed by the court shall represent the parent... at the detention hearing <em>and at all subsequent proceedings </em>before the juvenile court. <em>Counsel shall continue to represent the </em>parent. . . <em>unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause. </em>The representation shall include representing the parent ... in termination proceedings and in those proceedings relating to the institution or setting aside of a legal guardianship.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In <em>In re Tanya H. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 825 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 503], the Second District found clear and unambiguous the requirement that appointed counsel serve until relieved \u201cupon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.\u201d (At p. 829.) The court then went on to define \u201cfor cause\u201d: \u201cAlthough \u2018for cause\u2019 is not defined by the statute, the term is neither vague nor ambiguous. In the absence of express guidelines, the purpose of a statute supplies the standards to be followed in its application. [Citations.] The purpose of this statute is to provide an attorney for a parent who \u2018desires counsel but is presently financially unable to afford and cannot for that reason employ counsel\u2019 (\u00a7 317, subd. (a)) and the attorney, once appointed, is to represent the parent at \u2018the detention hearing and at all subsequent proceedings before the juvenile court. . . unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.\u2019 (\u00a7 317, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">\u201cSo viewed, \u2018for cause\u2019 must include some good reason personal to the individual sought to be removed [citation], one which affects or concerns the ability or fitness of the appointee to perform the duty imposed upon him [citations] or relates to and affects the administration of the office [citation]. <em>Stated otherwise, for cause\u2019 means inefficiency, incompetency or other kindred disqualifications. </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>{In re Tanya H., supra, 17 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 831, fn. 5, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">DSS relies on the sentence prior to the emphasized one above in support of the contention that \u201cfor cause\u201d may include the instant situation. We disagree. The <em>Tanya H. </em>court\u2019s entire statement, including the emphasized sentence, does not support DSS\u2019s position. Nothing in the record suggests that appointed counsel\u2019s inability to contact Lucia was due to inefficiency, incompetency, or any other like reason personal to coxxnsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>DSS also relies on Code of Civil Procedure section 284. That section provides: \u201cThe attorney in an action or special proceeding may be changed at any time before or after judgment of final determination, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\">\u201c2. Upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">According to DSS, \u201c[t]he requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision 2 were fully complied with herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Code of Civil Procedure section 284, however, governs the bare <em>procedure </em>for <em>change </em>of counsel in an action. It does <em>not </em>expressly permit counsel to abandon his or her client at a crucial stage in the proceedings simply by giving notice and applying to the court. Moreover, it clearly cannot supersede section 317 (which specifically governs dependency actions).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Under the express provisions of section 317, Lucia\u2019s appointed counsel should not have withdrawn from her representation at the beginning of the October 1st hearing without stated cause and without requesting that the court appoint substitute counsel or grant a continuance, and the corat should not have permitted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>However, the violation of a parent\u2019s <em>statutory </em>right to counsel in dependency proceedings is reviewed under the standard set out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]. (See <em>In re Nalani C. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1017, 1028 [245 Cal.Rptr. 264]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 711, 730 [214 Cal.Rptr. 801, 700 P.2d 415]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooley </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1399 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 346].) And here, as will become clear from the due process discussion below, it is not \u201creasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">\n<em>Due process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The court\u2019s relief of appointed counsel without appointing a successor meant Lucia was both absent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and without representation at the time the decision was made to terminate reunification services and schedule the permanency planning hearing. These particular decisions constituted the critical juncture in the dependency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">\u201cClearly, an order terminating reunification services and setting a selection and implementation hearing, while interim and not itself appealable, involves the merits of or necessarily affects the subsequent order terminating parental rights, and substantially affects the rights of the parties. It is at this juncture, and not at the subsequent section 366.26 hearing, that the critical decision regarding parental rights is made. (See <em>Cynthia D. </em>[v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993)] 5 Cal.4th [242,] 250 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 851 P.2d 1307].)\u201d <em>(In re Matthew C. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 386, 396 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 862 P.2d 765].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Lucia contends she had a due process right to counsel at the six-month review hearing, where the decisions to terminate reunification and set a permanency planning hearing were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">In <em>Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 18 [68 L.Ed.2d 640, 101 S.Ct. 2153], the United States Supreme Court held that whether a parent has a federal due process right to counsel during termination proceedings must be determined on a case-by-case basis, applying three factors set forth in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 319 [47 L.Ed.2d 18, 96 S.Ct. 893]: \u201cThe dispositive question, which must now be addressed, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>whether the three <em>Eldridge </em>factors, when weighed against the presumption that there is no right to appointed counsel in the absence of at least a potential deprivation of physical liberty, suffice to rebut that presumption and thus to lead to the conclusion that the Due Process Clause requires the appointment of counsel when a State seeks to terminate an indigent\u2019s parental status. To summarize the above discussion of the <em>Eldridge </em>factors: the parent\u2019s interest is an extremely important one (and may be supplemented by the dangers of criminal liability inherent in some termination proceedings); the State shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision, has a relatively weak pecuniary interest, and, in some but not all cases, has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures; and the complexity of the proceeding and the incapacity of the uncounseled parent could be, but would not always be, great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent\u2019s rights insupportably high.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">\u201cIf, in a given case, the parent\u2019s interests were at their strongest, the State\u2019s interests were at their weakest, and the risks of error were at their peak, it could not be said that the <em>Eldridge </em>factors did not overcome the presumption against the right to appointed counsel, and that due process did not therefore require the appointment of counsel. But since the <em>Eldridge </em>factors will not always be so distributed, and since \u2018due process is not so rigid as to require that the significant interests in informality, flexibility and economy must always be sacrificed,\u2019 <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S., [(1973) 778] at 788 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 665, 93 S.Ct. 1756], neither can we say that the Constitution requires the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding. We therefore adopt the standard found appropriate in <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>and leave the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in termination proceedings to be answered in the first instance by the trial court, subject, of course, to appellate review.\u201d (452 U.S. at pp. 31-32 [68 L.Ed.2d at pp. 652-653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In short, whether a parent has a due process right to representation at any given juncture in a dependency proceeding that may result in termination of parental rights must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (See <em>In re Arturo </em>A. (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 229, 238 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 131].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">In <em>post-Lassiter </em>dependency cases in California, it appears settled that whether a due process right to counsel existed at the lower court hearing depends on whether the presence of counsel would have made a \u201cdeterminative difference\u201d in the outcome of the proceeding. <em>(Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 33 [68 L.Ed.2d at p. 653].) \u201c. . . Under <em>Lassiter, </em>in order to establish that she/he was deprived of this due process constitutional right to representation by counsel, <em>a parent must </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number><em>demonstrate on appeal that the absence of counsel made a \u2018determinative difference\u2019 and \u2018render[ed\\ the proceedings fundamentally unfair.\u2019 (Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 33 [].)\u201d <em>(In re Emilye A. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1695, 1705 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 294], italics added; see also <em>In re Arturo A., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Lucia has not shown that the presence of counsel would have resulted in a different outcome at the six-month review hearing. She argues that the presumed due process violation is reversible per se, but fails to show the due process violation itself. Indeed, the only contention she makes as to how counsel might have made a difference at the hearing is that counsel \u201ccould have vigorously represented [Lucia] at the hearing, by making the appropriate .. . legal objection to the court\u2019s proposal to terminate reunification services after only eight and a half months.\u201d However, as discussed in the unpublished part of this opinion, the court possessed the authority to make that order; counsel\u2019s objection would almost certainly have failed given Lucia\u2019s complete failure to participate in reunification, or indeed, to demonstrate any interest in the outcome of the proceedings or the welfare of Ronald.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We conclude that, despite the court\u2019s error in permitting counsel to withdraw, no cognizable due process violation occurred at the six-month review hearing, and no showing was made that would justify reversal on the violation of the statutory right to counsel under <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Stone (W.

Rule 376 is contained [in] Division II of the California Rules of Court (Rules 301-391), a division entitled \u2018Civil Law and Motion Rules.\u2019 Rule 303(a)(1) specifically <em>excludes </em>from Division II coverage \u2018causes arising under the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">California Rules of Court, rule 301 states that division II applies to \u201cproceedings in civil law and motion in superior, municipal, and justice courts and to discovery proceedings in family law and probate.\u201d Rule 303(a) defines \u201claw and motion\u201d as including any proceedings \u201c[o]n application before trial for an order, except for causes arising under the Welfare and Institutions Code, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">A motion to be relieved is, by the express terms of Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision 2, an \u201capplication\u201d for an \u201corder.\u201d Thus, title 2, division II of the California Rules of Court is not applicable here, and the failure to follow the procedure outlined in rule 376 is irrelevant. We note, however, that two courts have cited the rule in dependency cases without noting or distinguishing rules 301 and 303. (See <em>In re Andrew S. </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 541, 546 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 670]; <em>In re Rubin P. </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 306, 312, fn. 5 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 301].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\"> There is no statutory requirement that a parent attend review hearings, although the court may direct the parent\u2019s presence. (See \u00a7\u00a7 338, 362.3.) Nothing in the record indicates that Lucia was ordered to appear for the October 1st hearing; it appears she did not receive actual notice either of the hearing date or of counsel\u2019s threat to seek to withdraw if she did not appear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
