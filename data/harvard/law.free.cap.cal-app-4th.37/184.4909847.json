(hereafter KMP), Debbie Badders, Jerry Badders, the American Bicycle Association (hereafter ABA), and the City of San Diego (hereafter sometimes referred to collectively as defendants)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arising from Branco\u2019s complaint alleging, inter alia, that the negligent design of an expert caliber jump at KMP\u2019s bicycle motocross (BMX) course caused him to suffer injury. Premised on the duty of a sponsor of a sports activity not to increase the risks inherent in a sport, we hold there is a triable issue of fact whether KMP\u2019s jump was negligently designed. Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On May 19,1991,17-year-old Branco, while racing his bicycle on KMP\u2019s BMX course, was injured when his bicycle crashed and struck the side wall of the landing area of an expert caliber jump. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">KMP is a nonprofit, mutual benefit corporation, and (according to a declaration submitted by one of KMP\u2019s officers) its officers, who design and operate the moto park, serve on a volunteer basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> KMP\u2019s promotional literature indicates that riders race according to age and skill class; new riders can learn and race safely with other new riders; and as they gain experience, they move up in skill class.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> KMP also provided opportunities for the participants to learn riding techniques from professional BMX racers. ABA\u2019s promotional literature claimed BMX was \u201cthe safest of all the action youth sports.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The parties agreed that by its nature, BMX racing includes bumps, jumps, turns, straightaways and obstacles. The million dollar jump, on which Branco was injured, is also referred to as the \u201cmillion dollar doubles,\u201d and consists of two hills, described by plaintiff\u2019s attorney as \u201ctwo bumps joined together in a saddle-like configuration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Branco had several years\u2019 experience riding BMX bicycles,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and he had had numerous prior falls from his bicycle, including one which resulted in a broken collarbone when he misjudged a street curb and flipped over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>handlebars. He suffered the injury at KMP when he \u201cwheelied\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201cmillion dollar jump\u201d at the BMX course. He had intended to \u201croll\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the million dollar jump, since doing a wheelie would be \u201cstupid\u201d because it would slow him down,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but instead he found himself doing a wheelie. Prior to his injury, he had never wheelied the million dollar jump before, but had rolled it, and had never had any problems with it. Slower speed and more control and skill is required to wheelie rather than roll a jump. A couple of times, he had seen other riders wheelie up the million dollar jump, but did not observe them have any difficulties. He had seen people \u201cbuckle\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and almost lose control on the second part of the million dollar jump. Brandon thought \u201cjumping\u201d the million dollar jump was too dangerous,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but he did not think doing a wheelie was too dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Defendants\u2019 expert declared that each BMX track may incorporate its own specific design, and the jumps are designed so that they may be traversed by either riding over them, or jumping over them by making the bicycle airborne. In his opinion, KMP\u2019s jumps complied with the guideline that all jumps could either be ridden over or jumped by making one or both wheels airborne. Further, the president of the ABA declared that the ABA sanctions tracks, each sanctioned track must comply with certain rules and regulations, and in his opinion the jumps at KMP were \u201csuch that can be expected at any BMX track.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In contrast, Branco\u2019s expert identified the following characteristics of the million dollar jump. The first hill of the jump is too steep for the use to which it was put; its 63-degree angle combined with the curvature of the hill creates an 80-degree angle; the steepness of the angle puts the rider at extreme risk because the rider\u2019s center of gravity tends to lift up as he approaches the jump, which puts the rider in an extremely unbalanced position. Second, the distance between the two hills of the jump is so great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>that the cyclist has to be at a very high rate of speed to make the second jump.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The expert opined that both of these factors tend to put riders at risk or \u201cat the very end of their envelope of ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Branco\u2019s expert opined that the slope of the first hill of the jump led to the accident since it caused the rider\u2019s center of gravity to rise too abruptly. The expert elaborated that most BMX tracks he had seen, which include a jump where the rider aims to get skybome, will have a very gentle approach slope to the jump, i.e., a 15- to 20-degree angle with a very long lead-up, and then an abrupt drop-off on the other side, which gives the rider the feeling of jumping the bike, but does not put him at risk. KMP\u2019s million dollar jump was the only one he could remember seeing with such an abrupt change in slope.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In granting the motion for summary judgment, the trial court acknowledged that Branco\u2019s subjective knowledge of the risk was irrelevant to the issue of duty under <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296, 314-315 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696] (discussed below). The court determined that defendants owed no duty to Branco, stating that the deposition testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert did not create a triable issue of fact as to whether defendants increased the risks above those inherent to BMX racing. The court also noted that Branco was a participant rather than a student being coached by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].) The evidence of the moving party should be strictly construed, and that of the opponent liberally construed, and any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>{Molko, supra, </em>at p. 1107.) A defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted causes of action can prevail. <em>{Ibid.) </em>On appeal from a summary judgment, our review is de novo, and we independently review the evidence submitted. <em>{Davis </em>v. <em>Gaschler </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1396 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 679]; <em>Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1513 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>As we explain below, we hold there is a duty to refrain from utilizing BMX jumps which by design pose an extreme risk of injury, and there is a triable issue of material fact whether that duty was breached by virtue of the design of the million dollar jump.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pages 314-315, our Supreme Court<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> held that the doctrine of assumption of risk involves two components, primary and secondary assumption of risk. With primary assumption of risk, the defendant owes no duty to the plaintiff and the doctrine operates as a complete bar to recovery. With secondary assumption of risk, the defendant owes a duty, but the plaintiff proceeds to encounter a known risk imposed by the defendant\u2019s breach of duty. The doctrine of secondary assumption of risk is part of the comparative fault scheme where the trier of fact considers the relative responsibility of the parties in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Accordingly, we first evaluate whether the defendant\u2019s conduct breached a legal duty of care to the plaintiff, i.e., whether the defendant had a legal duty to avoid the conduct or to protect the plaintiff against a particular risk of harm. <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 315-317.) The nature of a defendant\u2019s duty in the sports context depends heavily on the nature of the sport itself. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Additionally, the scope of the duty frequently depends on the defendant\u2019s role in, or relationship to, the sport. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 316-317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As recognized by the trial court, <em>Knight </em>sets forth the following standard to guide the determination of the duty of an operator of a sports facility:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>\u201cAlthough defendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate (or protect a plaintiff against) risks inherent in the sport itself, it is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.\" (Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Knight </em>utilizes the example of a ski mogul to illustrate a risk inherent in a certain sport as to which there is no duty of care.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That is, although \u201cmoguls on a ski run pose a risk of harm to skiers that might not exist were these configurations removed, the challenge and risks posed by the moguls are part of the sport of skiing, and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate them.\u201d <em>{Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 315.) This duty analysis is not dependent on the plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge or appreciation of the risk. Thus, a defendant owes no duty to a plaintiff who falls while skiing over a mogul, even if he or she is a total novice with no knowledge of skiing. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 316.) In contrast, a ski resort does have a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe, working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm, since the latter type of risk is not a risk inherent in the sport. Even if the plaintiff actually were aware that a ski resort on occasion has been negligent in maintaining its towropes, he or she could still recover for the negligence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 315, 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Harrold </em>v. <em>Rolling J Ranch </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 578, 585 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 671], applied the standard delineated in <em>Knight, </em>stating that commercial operators of sports and recreational facilities owe a duty to their patrons to ensure the facilities and related services which are provided do not increase the risk of injury above the level inherent in the sport or recreational activity itself. The court observed the duties of a commercial operator of a horse-riding facility could include the duty to supply horses which were not unduly dangerous, to warn patrons renting a given horse of its predisposition to behave in ways which added to the ordinary risk of horse riding, the duty not to provide faulty saddles, not to provide dangerous trails, etc. However, <em>Harrold </em>holds the duty did not extend to providing horses that never spooked, since such sudden movements were \u201cjust as inherent in horseback riding as the presence of moguls on a ski slope are to skiers.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 586-588.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In <em>Galardi </em>v. <em>Seahorse Riding Club, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 817, 823, the court held that an instructor at a horse riding club, who was assisting the plaintiff during her practice jumps, had a duty to take care that the jumping array she (the instructor) set up was not beyond the capability of the horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and rider. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 822-823.) Recognizing that although the risk of injury inherent in the activity (which included engaging in increasingly higher jumps and at shorter intervals until at some point the obstacles could no longer be cleared without substantial contact) could not be eliminated and in fact created the challenge which defined the sport, the court held there was a triable issue of fact whether the defendants had negligently deployed the jumps at unsafe heights or intervals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.) Galardi </em>points out that the plaintiff was not injured during a competition, and she had placed her training in the hands of defendants who were employed to instruct her and coach her, and they inferentially had superior knowledge and experience concerning the sport. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 823-824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In support of its holding, <em>Galardi </em>refers to <em>Tan </em>v. <em>Goddard </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1535 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 89], where the court concluded that a jockey racing school owed a duty to see that the horse assigned to a student was safe to ride under the conditions the trainer prescribed for that activity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Although the instructor/student relationship was considered in determining the scope of the duty in the <em>Galardi </em>and <em>Tan </em>cases, there is nothing in those cases which suggests no duty can exist absent such a relationship.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The analysis in <em>Knight </em>(and reiterated in <em>Harrold, </em>which does not involve an instructor/student relationship) indicates that an operator of a sporting facility has a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport. <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 316-317.) <em>Knight </em>cites with approval cases which do not involve instructor/student relationships, and which utilize a standard premised on <em>\u201cthe steps the sponsoring business entity reasonably should be obligated to take in order to minimize the risks without altering the nature of the sport.\"</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(3 Cal.4th at p. 317, italics added; see also <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Parents Without Partners, supra, </em>17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 329 [primary assumption of risk did not preclude cause of action premised on increased risk of falling created by spreading slippery substance on floor by organization sponsoring recreational dance]; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Fuji Country USA, Inc. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 127 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 249] [operator of golf course owes duty to minimize risk players will be hit by golf balls].)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It is not unreasonable to expect a BMX course to refrain from utilizing jumps which by design create an extreme risk of injury. Certainly the jumps, and falls, are inherent to the sport, and under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk, there is no duty to eliminate the jumps entirely, and no duty to protect from injury arising from reasonably designed jumps. However, the sport does not inherently require jumps which are designed in such a way as to create an extreme risk of injury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, premised on the duty not to utilize dangerously designed jumps, this case falls under the secondary assumption of risk category, and issues pertaining to Branco\u2019s comparative fault are for the trier of fact to decide. Branco\u2019s expert\u2019s opinions regarding the design of the jump create a triable issue of material fact whether the million dollar jump was designed in such a way as to create an extreme risk of injury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In closing, we note that we do not view man-made bicycle jumps as comparable to the ski moguls which <em>Knight </em>states need not be eliminated since the moguls are part of the challenge and risks of the sport of skiing. There is a distinction between the degree of control exercised over the creation of the nature-made obstacles involved in the sport of skiing (see generally, <em>O\u2019Donoghue </em>v. <em>Bear Mountain Ski Resort </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 188, 193 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 467]), as compared to the man-made obstacles of the BMX course involved in the instant case. Thus, whereas no duty is owed to the skier injured on a mogul, a duty is owed to a bicycle racer injured on a bicycle jump which by its design creates an extreme risk of injury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The summary judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Benke, Acting P.
