Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in respondent\u2019s favor because there were triable issues of material fact concerning respondent\u2019s duty to defend appellants in the underlying lawsuit on the basis of a potential for coverage under the policy. For the reasons which follow we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Appellants purchased property in Sonoma in 1986. At the time, they believed on the basis of the grant deed and the assurances of the previous owner that they had the use of an easement for ingress and egress, consisting of a gravel driveway approximately 10 by 200 feet running the entire length of appellants\u2019 property and which was located on the adjoining property owned by Mildred R. Ferrando. The easement gave appellants access to the rear portion of their property. For three years after their purchase of the property, the appellants used the easement without incident. From 1963 to 1989, a fence stood along the back end of the Ferrando property, crossing a portion of the easement. In February 1989, appellants removed the portion of the fence crossing the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">On March 20, 1989, Ferrando\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to appellants, stating that appellants\u2019 claim of an easement of right-of-way \u201ccame as a complete surprise\u201d to Ferrando; that \u201c[a]t no time\u201d during Ferrando\u2019s ownership of their property had appellants\u2019 \u201cpredecessors in title ever claimed to have a right-of-way\u201d across the property; that Ferrando was \u201cvery upset\u201d about appellants\u2019 \u201crecent conduct in tearing down the fence\u201d and parking cars on her property; that even if appellants had an easement of right-of-way, \u201cneither of these actions would be permitted under the easement\u201d; and that the act of \u201ctearing down the fence constitute[d] trespass\u201d for which appellants \u201ccould be legally liable\u201d to Ferrando. Aside from telling appellants not to park cars on the easement or remove any more fencing or other improvements, Ferrando\u2019s attorney asked appellants to \u201crefrain\u201d from using the right-of-way altogether pending the completion of his investigation of the status of the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">By letter dated March 23, 1989, Ferrando\u2019s attorney memorialized an agreement with appellants that, pending completion of investigation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>matter, neither appellants nor Ferrando would park on the right-of-way; appellants could continue to use the roadway for access to and from the back of their property, but \u201cin a way to minimize the inconvenience\u201d to Ferrando; and appellants would not remove any other fence posts, fencing material or other improvements located near the boundary line. The letter stated that the agreement was without prejudice to either party\u2019s position with regard to the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Almost a year later, on March 9, 1990, Ferrando filed a complaint against appellants, entitled a \u201ccomplaint to quiet title to real property, for declaratory relief, and for injunctive relief.\u201d The complaint denied appellants\u2019 claim to an easement of right-of-way on Ferrando\u2019s property; claimed that Ferrando had exercised \u201cexclusive, complete, actual, open, notorious, hostile and continuous\u201d adverse possession of the right-of-way for more than five years; asserted that any former easement of right-of-way \u201chad previously been extinguished by abandonment\"; and asked for declaratory relief quieting Ferrando\u2019s title to the right-of-way in fee simple, together with an injunction permanently enjoining appellants from asserting or exercising any claim to the easement. The complaint did not pray for damages. It specifically alleged that Ferrando \u201chas no adequate remedy at law, or otherwise, for the harm and damage threatened to be done by the adverse claims of [appellants], for the reason that [Ferrando] cannot be adequately compensated for her injuries in an action at law, for the amount of damages [she] will sustain as a result of the wrongful acts of [appellants] is not susceptible of accurate computation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Appellants tendered the Ferrando complaint to their insurance agent, asking that respondent defend and indemnify them in connection with the lawsuit under their homeowners liability policy (the Policy). Respondent\u2019s claims office in Santa Rosa received the complaint on March 22, 1990. On March 27, 1990, Robert G. Benson, respondent\u2019s branch claims manager, sent appellants a letter denying appellants\u2019 claim for a defense of the Ferrando complaint. Benson\u2019s letter stated that under appellants\u2019 Policy, respondent provided \u201cliability coverage and agree[d] to pay all damage from an occurrence which an insured is legally liable to pay because of bodily injury or property damage covered\u201d by the Policy, and that respondent would defend an insured against any such covered claim or suit. Pointing out that the Ferrando complaint \u201creflects three causes of action for quiet title, injunctive relief and declaratory relief,\u201d and contained \u201cno reference to a claim for bodily injury or property damage,\u201d the letter declared that \u201c[i]n view of this fact, Fire Insurance Exchange has no obligation to provide a defense for this Action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Appellants engaged counsel, who again tendered the Ferrando complaint to respondent for defense and indemnification, by letter dated April 2,1990. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>Benson replied 10 days later with a letter again declining to defend or indemnify appellants under the Policy, on the ground that the Ferrando complaint contained no claims for bodily injury or property damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">On June 6, 1990, Ferrando filed a verified first amended complaint naming an additional defendant, but otherwise making the same claims for quiet title, declaratory relief and injunctive relief against appellants as before. On August 15, 1990, appellants filed their verified answer and affirmative defenses to Ferrando\u2019s first amended complaint. Neither the answer nor the affirmative defenses made any reference or allegation with respect to any bodily injury or property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">On February 13, 1991, Ferrando\u2019s attorney sent appellants\u2019 attorney a letter complaining that appellants had been cutting down trees on Ferrando\u2019s property that day, and stating that his office would hold appellants \u201cresponsible for any damage to our clients\u2019 property, as well as punative <em>[sic] </em>damages for his actions.\u201d Later, on April 30, 1991, Ferrando\u2019s attorney wrote appellants\u2019 attorney to complain that appellants\u2019 son was \u201criding his go cart\u201d on the disputed easement and driveway, was \u201ctearing up\u201d Ferrando\u2019s property arid disturbing her, and that appellants \u201chave apparently resumed their efforts to destroy\u201d Ferrando\u2019s fence. The letter requested written confirmation within 10 days \u201cthat this conduct will stop so that it will not be necessary ... to seek injunctive relief.\u201d Appellants did not submit these letters or claims to respondent for any response.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">On August 1,1991, appellants filed a motion for summary judgment in the Ferrando action. Their motion and attached declarations made no mention of any property damage to Ferrando\u2019s property. Prior to trial, appellants settled the lawsuit with Ferrando.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">On September 4, 1992, appellants filed the instant lawsuit against respondent, naming Farmers Insurance Group of Companies (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Farmers), and alleging breach of insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. By letter dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>October 27, 1992, respondent\u2019s attorney told appellants\u2019 attorney that the name of the company that had issued appellants\u2019 insurance Policy was Fire Insurance Exchange, and that that was the \u201ccorrect entity\u201d to sue. On November 11, 1992, appellants filed a first amended complaint naming Fire Insurance Exchange as the defendant, rather than Farmers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Respondent answered this first amended complaint, denying all allegations and asserting, among other things, that appellants\u2019 action was barred by the applicable provisions of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">On November 12, 1993, respondent filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that there was no potential for coverage of the Ferrando claim under the terms of the Policy, and therefore no duty to defend as a matter of law. Among other \u201cundisputed material facts,\u201d respondent stated that Fire Insurance Exchange had issued the pertinent Policy to appellants. In opposing the motion, appellants challenged this statement, pointing out that respondent had provided conflicting information indicating that Farmers may have issued the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">At the hearing on respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court determined that neither the face of the Ferrando complaint nor the extrinsic evidence available at the time appellants tendered the defense to respondent indicated any potential for coverage. On January 28, 1994, the trial court issued its order granting summary judgment, stating: \u201cThe undisputed facts show that neither the face of the underlying [Ferrando] complaint . . . nor any extrinsic evidence available at the time the defense was tendered indicate a potential for coverage. The undisputed facts establish that there was no ambiguity in the complaint to alert the insurance carrier of a duty to defend and that there was no potential for coverage on the subject policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">On February 1, 1994, respondent\u2019s attorney served and filed a document entitled \u201cNotice of Entry of Judgment.\u201d On February 16, 1994, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On February 25, 1994, Susana Magenheimer, a policy writing supervisor for Farmers, informed respondent\u2019s attorney that \u201ca mistake had been made,\u201d and that the entity that had issued the subject Policy to appellants was actually Farmers Insurance Exchange, not Fire Insurance Exchange. On February 28, 1994, respondent\u2019s attorney informed appellants\u2019 attorney by letter of the mistake in the name of the issuing insurance entity. Except for the name of the correct entity, there was no change in the content, provisions or terms of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>Respondent filed opposition to appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration on March 1, 1994, arguing that appellants had not produced any evidence to raise any new questions with regard to the undisputed facts on which the trial court based its decision, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). In addition, respondent asked the trial court to correct the order granting summary judgment to name Farmers Insurance Exchange as the entity that actually issued the subject Policy, rather than Fire Insurance Exchange. On May 10, 1994, after a hearing, the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration, and directed that judgment be entered. The order also denied respondent\u2019s request that the caption of the earlier order granting summary judgment be amended to designate respondent as Farmers Insurance Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Potential for Coverage <em>Facts Extrinsic to the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Appellants\u2019 principal argument is that respondent knew or should have known that there was a potential that Ferrando would make a property damage claim against them, and therefore had a duty to defend upon appellants\u2019 tender of the Ferrando lawsuit. Appellants rely on the California Supreme Court decision in <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] to argue that respondent breached its duty to investigate facts and allegations extrinsic to the face of the Ferrando complaint in determining its duty to defend. In our opinion, appellants have misapplied the principles expressed <em>in'Montrose </em>to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">In <em>Montrose, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed the \u201cfamiliar principles governing adjudication of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d It reaffirmed the rules established in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168] that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, that a liability insurer must defend a suit which potentially makes claims within the coverage of the policy, and that facts extrinsic to the allegations of the complaint may give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>insurance policy. On the other hand, the Supreme Court also reaffirmed that the extrinsic facts which may create a duty to defend must be <em>known by the insurer </em>at the <em>inception </em>of the third party lawsuit; and that the duty to defend ceases as soon as it has been shown that there is <em>no </em>potential for coverage. <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 295-296; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276; <em>Hurley Construction Co. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 533, 538-539 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 629]; <em>Saylin v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 256, 263 [224 Cal.Rptr. 493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Thus, contrary to appellants\u2019 position, an insurer does not have a continuing duty to investigate whether there is a potential for coverage. If it has made an informed decision on the basis of the third party complaint and the extrinsic facts <em>known </em>to it at the time of tender that there is no potential for coverage, the insurer may refuse to defend the lawsuit. <em>(Hurley Construction Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 538-539; <em>Saylin v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 263; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 538, 548 [95 Cal.Rptr. 296].) The duty to defend a lawsuit which raises a <em>possibility </em>of liability, but is eventually shown to be groundless, does not equate with a duty to defend a lawsuit which raises <em>no </em>potential liability. <em>(Nichols v. Great American Ins. Companies </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 766, 776-777 [215 Cal.Rptr. 416].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">An insured may not trigger the duty to defend by speculating about extraneous \u201cfacts\u201d regarding potential liability or ways in which the third party claimant might amend its complaint at some future date. This approach misconstrues the principle of \u201cpotential liability\u201d under an insurance policy. \u201cAlthough an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, the duty to defend depends upon <em>facts </em>known to the insurer at the inception of the suit. [Citations.] ...[\u00a7] Our Supreme Court, anticipating imaginative counsel and the likelihood of artful drafting, has indicated that a third party is not the arbiter of the policy\u2019s coverage. [Citations.] A corollary to this rule is that the insured may not speculate about unpled third party claims to manufacture coverage.\u201d <em>(Hurley Construction Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 538.) \u201cWe look to the nature and kind of risk covered by the policy as a limitation upon the duty to defend . . . .\u201d <em>(Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 275.)  Thus, the issues here are what facts respondent knew at the time appellants tendered the defense of the Ferrando lawsuit, both from the allegations on the face of the third party complaint, and from extrinsic information available to it at the time; and whether these <em>known facts </em>created a potential for coverage under the terms of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>In pertinent part, the Policy at issue provided coverage as follows: \u201cWe shall pay all damage from an occurrence which an insured is legally liable to pay because of bodily injury or property damage covered by this policy.\u201d In addition, the Policy provided: \u201cAt our expense we shall defend an insured against any covered claim or suit.\u201d The Policy defined \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use.\u201d It defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201ca sudden event, including continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions, resulting in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the insured.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In order to trigger coverage under these provisions of the Policy, a third party must have suffered tangible \u201cproperty damage\" or \u201cbodily injury\u201d that appellants \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d to occur. There are no allegations in the underlying Ferrando complaint that create any potential for coverage under these provisions. The complaint contained three <em>equitable </em>causes of action to quiet title to real property, for declaratory relief, and for injunctive relief, disputing appellants\u2019 claim to an easement of right-of-way on Ferrando\u2019s property on the basis of Ferrando\u2019s assertions of her adverse possession and appellants\u2019 abandonment. The complaint asked only for declaratory relief quieting Ferrando\u2019s title to the right-of-way in fee simple and an injunction permanently enjoining appellants from exercising any rights to the easement. It specifically alleged that Ferrando had no adequate remedy at law for appellants\u2019 adverse claims, because the amount of damages she would sustain as a result of the appellants\u2019 \u201cwrongful acts ... is not susceptible of accurate computation.\u201d There were no claims of either tangible property damage or bodily injury in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Appellants nevertheless assert that there was a potential for liability under the Policy because Ferrando <em>could </em>have made a claim for \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property\u201d in connection with the fence across a portion of the easement which appellants removed at the outset of the dispute. They point to complaints made in letters by Ferrando\u2019s attorney; Ferrando\u2019s interrogatory responses mentioning \u201cproperty damage\u201d based on removal of the fence and damage to shrubbery and trees; deposition testimony by Ferrando discussing appellants\u2019 removal of the fence; Ferrando\u2019s assertion as an undisputed fact that the fence had obstructed the easement until appellants removed it; and Vera Gunderson\u2019s deposition statement that when she tendered the Ferrando complaint to respondent, an unidentified \u201celderly man\u201d remarked \u201c[o]nly if there was a fence involved.\u201d On this basis, they contend that respondent had sufficient extrinsic evidence of a potential property damage claim under the Policy to create a duty to defend the Ferrando lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>The contention fails for several reasons. First, under the Policy definition of a covered \u201coccurrence,\u201d the property damage for which respondent agreed to provide liability coverage had to be \u201cneither expected nor intended by the insured.\u201d It is undisputed that appellants intentionally tore down the disputed fence. \u201cAn intentional act is not an \u2018accident\u2019 within the plain meaning of the word. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Royal Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitaker </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 532, 537 [226 Cal.Rptr. 435], fn. omitted.) Because any damage to the fence could not have arisen from an accidental \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the insuring clause, any anticipated property damage claims arising from appellants\u2019 act would not be covered under the terms of the Policy. <em>(Hurley Construction Co. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at p. 539.) For this reason alone, respondent would have no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Second, none of the allegations concerning damage to the fence, as found in the several letters of Ferrando\u2019s attorney and in her responses to discovery requests, were <em>ever </em>incorporated in her complaint against appellants. Ferrando\u2019s attorney himself stated in a declaration under penalty of perjury that he prepared both the original Ferrando complaint and the first amended complaint; that \u201c[n]either of these pleadings alleges claims involving property damage or seeks damages for property damage\u201d; and that \u201c[a]t no time did I seek to amend these pleadings to allege such claims or indicate that I intended to do so.\u201d It is clear that any such allegations would have conflicted with Ferrando\u2019s claims of title to the right-of-way based on appellants\u2019 abandonment. In context, Ferrando\u2019s own interrogatory responses, statements in her deposition, and statement of undisputed fact regarding the removal of the fence were concerned either with establishing the time period for her claim of adverse possession through the obstruction of the easement by the fence itself, or were made in response to appellants\u2019 own attempts to establish that they had not abandoned the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Third, there was insufficient foundation for the ambiguous hearsay statement \u201conly if there was a fence involved\u201d to be considered as evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact for summary judgment purposes. Mrs. Gunderson described the person making the statement simply as an \u201celderly man\u201d present in the insurance office at the time she brought the Ferrando complaint to respondent. She acknowledged that she did not know if the man was an agent, or even an employee of respondent at all. There was absolutely no evidence that the man was involved in any way with respondent\u2019s coverage determination of appellants\u2019 claims. Even if the statement could be considered as evidence, it has no impact on the undisputed material fact that Ferrando never made a claim for property damage against appellants. An offhand remark or opinion by a person not shown to be involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>the matter in any way can have no effect on the factual issue of whether there was a potential for coverage under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Fourth, most of this alleged extrinsic evidence of a potential claim for property damage arose <em>after </em>Ferrando\u2019s complaint was filed and tendered to respondent for defense. Respondent was entitled to base its determination of whether or not to accept the tender on the facts available to it at that time. Once it determined on the basis of the lawsuit itself and the facts known to it at that time that there was no potential for coverage, it did not have a continuing duty to investigate or monitor the lawsuit to see if the third party later made some new claim, not found in the original lawsuit. <em>{Hurley Construction Co. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th at pp. 538-539; <em>Saylin v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>179 Cal.App.3d at p. 263; <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Flynt, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.3d at p. 548.) Had any of these statements in the letters from Ferrando\u2019s attorney or in discovery actually raised a potential claim for property damage covered under the Policy, appellants could have notified respondent at the time. Appellants never brought any of this information to respondent\u2019s attention. In the absence of any new tender of defense from appellants, respondent had no way to know of these new extrinsic facts, and no obligation to find them out by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In this case, as in <em>Hurley Construction Co. </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.App.4th 533, Ferrando\u2019s complaint, on its face, alleged no facts showing a potential for coverage. The extrinsic \u201cfacts\u201d regarding potential liability for property damage have come from speculation about how Ferrando might have (but did not) amend her complaint at some future date. Just as a third party complainant is not the arbiter of the coverage of an insurance policy, so is it also the rule that insureds themselves may not manufacture coverage by speculating about unpled third party claims. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 538-539.) Here, there was no potential for coverage to trigger any duty to defend on respondent\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\n<em>Loss of Use of Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Appellants contend that even if there was no potential claim for destruction of property, respondent still had a duty to defend because there was a potential property damage claim for \u201closs of use\u201d of the disputed easement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d in the Policy is \u201cphysical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use.\u201d Appellants argue that the phrase \u201cincluding loss of its use\u201d is meant to include \u201closs of use\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>tangible property, whether or not there has been physical injury or destruction of such property. Respondent maintains that the phrase \u201closs of its use\u201d modifies and refers only to tangible property that has itself been physically injured, damaged or destroyed, and that the Policy coverage for property damage therefore extends to loss of use of tangible property only where there is physical damage or destruction of the property accompanying the loss of use. Citing <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 263, appellants urge that the Policy language is ambiguous, and that any ambiguity must be resolved against respondent insurer by construing the Policy to provide coverage for loss of use of the right-of-way, even if there is no physical damage to or destruction of tangible property.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">Where the underlying facts are not in dispute, construction of the language of an insurance policy is a matter of law. <em>(Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coastal Rescue Systems Corp. </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 763, 767 [227 Cal.Rptr. 639].) On appeal, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the Policy language, but must make our own independent interpretation. <em>(Suarez </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co. of North America </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1396, 1402 [254 Cal.Rptr. 377]; <em>Cal-Farm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>TAC Exterminators, Inc. </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 564, 571 [218 Cal.Rptr. 407].)  The language of the insurance policy must be interpreted in light of its plain and ordinary meaning, unless the Policy clearly indicates to the contrary. \u201cWhen the language is clear a court should not give it a strained construction to impose on the insurer a liability it has not assumed. [Citation.] An insurance company has the right to limit the coverage of a policy issued by it and the plain language of the limitation must be respected. [Citation.] \u2018Although we construe all provisions, conditions, or exceptions that tend to limit liability strictly against the insurer [citation], strict construction does not mean strained construction. [Citations.] We may not, under the guise of strict construction, rewrite a policy to bind the insurer to a risk that it did not contemplate and for which it has not been paid. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Suarez </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co. of North America, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1402-1403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Here, the plain and ordinary meaning of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d definition in the Policy supports respondent\u2019s construction. The phrase \u201cincluding loss of its use\u201d modifies the entire preceding statement that \u201c[property damage means physical injury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d Grammatically, the word \u201cits\u201d in the phrase \u201cits use\u201d refers to \u201ctangible property.\u201d It is not logical to interpret the entire sentence as stating that the mere loss of use of any tangible property, without physical injury or destruction, may constitute \u201cproperty <em>damage.\" </em>Such a construction would require respondent to provide coverage regardless of whether any actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>physical damage to the property occurred, contrary to the plain meaning of the Policy definition, which requires some kind of <em>physical </em>damage to <em>tangible </em>property. In context, the phrase \u201cincluding loss of its use\u201d refers to the loss of use of tangible property that suffers some physical injury or destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The Ferrando lawsuit alleged only nonphysical injuries from the appellants\u2019 assertion of adverse claims to the easement, including depreciation of the value of Ferrando\u2019s property. Ferrando sought solely to quiet title in the property and enjoin appellants from using the easement. \u201c \u2018Understood in its plain and ordinary sense, \u201ctangible property\u201d means \u201cproperty (as real estate) having physical substance apparent to the senses\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Dict. (1968) p. 2337). To construe the explicit words \u201ctangible property\u201d to include intangible economic interests and property rights requires a strained and farfetched interpretation, doing violence to the plain language of the policies. Such an interpretation would rewrite the policies to fasten on the insurers a liability they have not assumed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Warner </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1029, 1034 [281 Cal.Rptr. 635].) Thus, pure rights in property, such as those claimed to have been lost by Ferrando in her underlying complaint, are by definition not the kind of physical damage or injury to tangible property necessary to trigger coverage under the Policy provisions. <em>(Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213, 218-219 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278].)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We conclude that the definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d in the subject Policy did not provide coverage for the claims made in the underlying Ferrando action, and consequently that respondent had no duty to defend the lawsuit. Because there was no breach of the insurance contract, appellants\u2019 bad faith claim also fails. <em>(McMillin Scripps North Partnership </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1222-1223 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 243].)
