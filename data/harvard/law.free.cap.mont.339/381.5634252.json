The charges arose after Tennell, while driving south on Highway 93, caused a fatal accident when he ran head-on into another vehicle after crossing into the oncoming lane of traffic. Tennell appeals his conviction by jury on all counts in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b62 Tennell raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b63 1. Did defense counsel\u2019s withdrawal of his challenge for cause constitute record-based ineffective assistance of counsel, and if not, should the withdrawal be reviewed for plain error?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u00b64 2. Did Tennell receive ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to object when the State, during closing argument, misstated the content of a witness\u2019s testimony and offered a personal opinion about Tennell\u2019s case?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">\u00b65 3. Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to character evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">\u00b66 4. Did cumulative error render Tennell\u2019s trial unfair?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">\u00b67 In the early afternoon on February 2, 2005, Tennell was driving south on Highway 93 just south of Lolo, Montana, when he struck Alice Day\u2019s oncoming vehicle head-on. Prior to the collision, multiple witnesses observed Tennell driving erratically and dangerously for approximately ten miles, weaving in and out of traffic and passing vehicles by using the center northbound lane. Witnesses reported that Tennell was driving too fast for the road conditions, which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>travel at speeds of seventy or eighty miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour construction zone. Witnesses also noted that immediately prior to the accident Tennell did not appear to be aware of his surroundings, and in fact appeared to be slumped against the driver\u2019s door of his vehicle as he drove. Ultimately, after two oncoming motorists narrowly avoided colliding with Tennell, his vehicle struck Alice Day\u2019s vehicle, killing her. Tennell did not brake or take evasive action before the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b68 Montana Highway Patrol trooper Michael Bailey spoke with Tennell briefly at the scene of the accident, and also in the emergency room shortly thereafter. In both instances, Tennell stated that he had swerved to avoid hitting an animal in the roadway, but no witnesses saw any animals on or near the highway immediately prior to the collision. While Tennell made consistent, alert, and coherent statements shortly after the accident, he later stated that he had no recollection of driving from Missoula prior to the accident, of the accident itself, or of making any statements at the hospital. From a blood sample it was determined that Tennell had no alcohol in his system, and there was no evidence he had taken drugs or prescription medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b69 A jury trial was held on August 29 and 30, and September 1,2005. During voir dire proceedings, defense counsel questioned Juror McGowan regarding his history in law enforcement with the State of Alaska, and asked whether McGowan would be inclined towards believing the testimony of law enforcement over the testimony of the general public. Juror McGowan indicated that, if all else were equal and he needed to break a tie between conflicting facts, he would side with law enforcement\u2019s version. Defense counsel moved to dismiss McGowan for cause, and the State objected. Defense counsel then continued questioning McGowan, and once again renewed its motion to dismiss him for cause. At that point, the District Court asked McGowan about his ability to apply the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, inquiring whether McGowan would be able to disagree with law enforcement if he felt the evidence warranted a different conclusion than law enforcement had reached. After McGowan agreed that he could do so, defense counsel withdrew his motion to challenge McGowan for cause, and ultimately used Tennell\u2019s sixth peremptory challenge to strike Juror McGowan.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b610 Testimony at trial included that of psychiatrist Michael Silverglat, whom Tennell had consulted six months prior to the accident, seeking treatment for poor sleep and possible depression. At their initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>appointment, Dr. Silverglat tentatively concluded that Tennell was suffering from sleep-disordered breathing. Dr. Silverglat recommended that Tennell undergo a polysomnogram to determine what might be wrong with his sleep, and suggested that Tennell do so soon because untreated sleep apnea could interfere with one\u2019s alertness and could cause other medical complications. Tennell did not take the sleep test until after the accident, at which time Dr. Silverglat diagnosed Tennell with severe obstructive sleep apnea.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b611 During closing arguments, the prosecutor made the following remarks regarding Dr. Silverglat\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">Interestingly, you work in this sleepy idea in July of 2004, as Dr. Silverglat told us, he tells the Defendant, \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility you have a sleep breathing disorder,\u201d is the phrase he used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">And I said, \u201cWell, I suppose you talked to him about what it means.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\u201cAbsolutely, I told him what it means. I told him the risks with it, the risk to his health, to the things around him, and urged him to get the tests so we could confirm it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">And what did the Defendant do? He blew it off. He absolutely blew it off. And now he wants you to let it excuse his gross conduct because he just didn\u2019t know wrong. He knew. And he knew darn well he should do something about it. Because that\u2019s exactly what Dr. Silverglat told him seven months before the crash.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Defense counsel did not object to these remarks during closing argument. Defense counsel also did not object when the prosecutor later stated that he did not \u201cput any stock in\u201d Tennell\u2019s sleep apnea defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">\u00b612 The jury ultimately found Tennell guilty of one count of negligent homicide and three counts of criminal endangerment. On October 26, 2005, the District Court sentenced Tennell to concurrent ten-year terms in the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections, with six suspended and a recommendation that Tennell be considered for non-prison placement. Tennell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\u00b613 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact which we review de novo. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 7, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b614 Did defense counsel\u2019s withdrawal of his challenge for cause constitute record-based ineffective assistance of counsel, and if not, should the withdrawal be reviewed for plain error?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b615 Tennell argues that his trial counsel\u2019s withdrawal of a motion to challenge Juror McGowan for cause constituted ineffective assistance of counsel that, in concert with McGowan\u2019s statements, constituted structural error. According to Tennell, there was \u201cno apparent tactical or strategic reason for withdrawing [the] challenge for cause\u201d after McGowan indicated that he would give more weight to law enforcement\u2019s testimony if there was some dispute in the facts. Tennell also argues that even if his counsel\u2019s withdrawal of the challenge is deemed to be tactical and not record-based, this Court should review the District Court\u2019s failure to exclude Juror McGowan for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"A6d\">\u00b616 Both the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment guarantee a person the right to effective assistance of counsel. When reviewing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, this Court applies the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2025 (1984). The burden is on the defendant to show that defense counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial to his case.\u201d <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. \u201cThere is a strong presumption with regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Upshaw, </em>2006 MT 341, \u00b6 32, 335 Mont. 162, \u00b6 32, 153 P.3d 579, \u00b6 32 (citing <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b617 However, before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance claim we must first determine whether the claim is properly before the Court or instead should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief. Upshaw, \u00b6 33. \u201cThe test to determine if an ineffective assistance claim is properly brought on direct appeal is whether the record contains the answer as to \u2018why* counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense.\u201d <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 34 (citation omitted). If the record does not document allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the claim must be pursued in a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 12, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 12. Regarding challenges for cause, we have said that \u201cit is a mistake to assume that we can determine from a cold record whether there was a tactical reason for not exercising a challenge [for cause]. The reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>for counsel's actions or inactions should not be \u2018assumed\u2019 but should be the subject of a postconviction evidentiary inquiry.\u201d <em>State v. Hermann, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 30, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 30, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b618 Here, the record is silent as to \u201cwhy\u201d Tennell\u2019s counsel withdrew his challenge for cause of Juror McGowan. The State offers and we can conceive of plausible reasons for counsel\u2019s decision to withdraw the challenge, but the record does not reveal the basis for that decision. Therefore, Tennell\u2019s complaint is not record-based and is inappropriate for consideration on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b619  Tennell alternatively argues that we should nonetheless undertake review of this issue by the common law \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine. Tennell offers a very brief argument in support of this position and does not set forth how our failure to review the claimed error \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 254, \u00b6 22, 95 P.3d 166, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). However, because we do not know from the record whether the withdrawal of the challenge was error, given the possible tactical reasons for the withdrawal, we cannot undertake review of the issue by the plain error doctrine. <em>Godfrey, </em>\u00b6 38 (\u201cA fundamental aspect of \u2018plain error,\u2019 is that the alleged error indeed must be \u2018plain.\u2019 \u201d). Consequently, we dismiss Tennell\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to raising the claim in post-conviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b620 Did Tennell receive ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to object when the State, during closing argument, misstated the content of a witness\u2019s testimony and offered a personal opinion about Tennell\u2019s case?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b621 Tennell argues that statements by the prosecutor, Mr. Fulbright, during closing argument amounted to misconduct, and that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object. Tennell also argues that Mr. Fulbright\u2019s statement that he did not \u201cput any stock in\u201d Tennell\u2019s sleep apnea theory was an impermissible expression of personal opinion about Tennell\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b622 The testimony from Dr. Silverglat at trial indicated that he had urged Tennell to undergo a polysomnogram in order to diagnose what Dr. Silverglat initially suspected was Tennell\u2019s sleep disorder. Dr. Silverglat explained to Tennell that a person with sleep apnea could have trouble focusing, and that untreated sleep apnea could cause medical complications. However, Mr. Fulbright\u2019s closing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>inferred that Tennell \u201cknew\u201d from his visit to Dr. Silverglat that he was a risk to himself and his surroundings if he did not take the sleep test. Tennell offers that, \u201cunder this version of what Dr. Silverglat said, [the jury] would be left with the impression that Tennell had received a specific warning about driving, about danger to those around him, and about unexpectedly falling asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b623 We agree that Mr. Fulbright\u2019s statements subtly exaggerated the content of Dr. Silverglat\u2019s warnings to Tennell, and further, that Mr. Fulbright offered a brief personal opinion about Tennell\u2019s credibility when he stated \u201cI don\u2019t put any stock in\u201d Tennell\u2019s theory. These comments were improper, and we admonish prosecutors to avoid such statements in the fulfillment of their duty to prosecute with honesty and integrity and in accordance with ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b624  Although these statements were improper, we cannot conclude that they rose to a level of egregiousness that prejudiced Tennell or rendered the trial unfair. Dr. Silverglat did indeed warn Tennell about possible consequences of his condition, and argument in that regard was appropriate. Mr. Fulbright\u2019s opinion comment was briefly made in passing. We conclude, therefore, that any error by defense counsel in failing to object to the State\u2019s closing argument was ultimately harmless, and we affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b625 Did trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to character evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b626 Tennell argues that his trial counsel should have objected when the State presented evidence of Tennell\u2019s erratic and aggressive driving leading up to the collision. According to Tennell, his aggressive driving-in which he was constantly weaving in and out of other vehicles at speeds well in excess of the posted limit-occurred ten miles before the accident and was \u201clogically and temporally separate from the collision.\u201d The State responds that witnesses observed Tennell drive erratically for the entire ten miles, not merely ten miles prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b627 Tennell uses the term \u201ccharacter evidence\u201d in his statement of issues, but thereafter fails to cite this Court to any authority regarding the introduction of improper character evidence and its application herein. Rather, Tennell argues the evidence of erratic driving was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d However, the events preceding the accident were clearly relevant and an objection on this basis would have been groundless. Tennell was charged with negligent homicide and criminal endangerment after he crossed into the lane of oncoming traffic and struck a motorist head-on, killing her. Contrary to Tennell\u2019s argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the fact that he had been driving erratically and aggressively for ten miles prior to the collision cannot be said to be \u201clogically and temporally separate from the collision.\u201d Rather, the opposite is true, as such evidence was closely related to the charged offenses and explanatory of the circumstances surrounding those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b628  Because we hold that evidence of Tennell\u2019s erratic driving prior to the accident was relevant, defense counsel had no reason to object to its introduction on this ground, and Tennell thus did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for his counsel\u2019s failure to so object.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b629 Did cumulative error render Tennell\u2019s trial unfair?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b630 Tennell argues that an amalgam of errors he has identified warrants reversal, even if no single error does. In support of this argument, Tennell reiterates his primary contentions under each of the issues discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b631  \u201cThe doctrine of cumulative error requires reversal of a conviction where a number of errors, taken together, prejudiced a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 126, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 126, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 126 (citations omitted). The defendant must establish prejudice; mere allegations of error are inadequate to satisfy the doctrine. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 126 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">\u00b632 We conclude that any error identified herein was not sufficient to reverse on the doctrine of cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
