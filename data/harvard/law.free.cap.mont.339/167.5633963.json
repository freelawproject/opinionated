Martin (Martin) worked for Sherman Brothers Trucking (Sherman Brothers), a corporation located in Oregon. Martin collected workers\u2019 compensation from SAIF Corporation (SAIF) for an injury that occurred at a truck stop in Montana during the course and scope of his employment with Sherman Brothers. Martin filed a third-party tort claim against the owners of the truck stop. Martin settled the tort claim and SAIF sought to subrogate the claim under the laws of Oregon. Martin filed a declaratory judgment action in Montana: The District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, granted summary judgment in SAIF\u2019s favor. Martin appeals and we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b62 Martin presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment in SAIF\u2019s favor on the grounds that the Board\u2019s decision was entitled to full faith and credit?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to SAIF?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">\u00b65 Martin resided in Washington and worked as a long-haul truck driver for Sherman Brothers. Martin slipped and fell on a diesel fuel spill at Crossroads Travel Center (Crossroads) located near Missoula, Montana, on May 16, 2001, while acting within the course and scope of his employment with Sherman Brothers. Martin filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim two days later with SAIF in Oregon. SAIF is Oregon\u2019s not-for-profit, state-chartered workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>insurance company. SAIF paid Martin benefits for injuries, lost wages, and permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b66 Martin filed a third-party tort action against Crossroads in Missoula County on October 3, 2001. SAIF sent Martin a copy of a third-party election form and notified Martin that it intended to subrogate any proceeds from Martin\u2019s third-party claim against Crossroads. Martin and Crossroads settled for $27,500 on August 20, 2002. SAIF notified Martin in October 2002 that SAIF claimed a lien of $59,940.58 on any settlement between Crossroads and Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b67 SAIF filed a distribution of proceeds with the Oregon Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (Board) in Oregon on July 30, 2003. SAIF requested a proposed recovery of $12,222.22. Martin responded by filing a declaratory judgment action in Montana on August 18, 2003. Martin requested that the District Court determine that Montana law applied to the distribution of proceeds pursuant to the settlement of Martin\u2019s third-party tort action. The Board issued a final decision in SAIF\u2019s favor in Oregon on October 7,2003. The Board directed Martin to distribute $12,222.22 of its third-party settlement to SAIF. Martin filed an appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals on October 20, 2003, but voluntarily dismissed his appeal on April 6, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b68 SAIF filed a motion for summary judgment on April 21,2004, and Martin filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on May 5, 2004. SAIF attached as exhibits to its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment a copy of the Board\u2019s decision and the letter of Martin\u2019s counsel to the Oregon Court of Appeals withdrawing his appeal. The District Court in Montana granted summary judgment to SAIF in Martin\u2019s declaratory action on July 14, 2004. The court also awarded attorney fees and costs to SAIF. Martin appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b69 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, using the standard established by M. R. Civ. P. 56. The moving party must establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Haynes v. Shodair Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>2006 MT 128, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 286, \u00b6 8, 137 P.3d 518, \u00b6 8. Once a moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of its case in order to raise a genuine issue of material fact. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Haynes, </em>\u00b6 8 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees is a discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ruling that we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 210, \u00b6 15, 69 P.3d 663, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court properly grant summary judgment in SAIF\u2019S favor on the grounds that the Board\u2019s decision was entitled to full faith and credit?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b612 Martin argues that the District Court need not extend full faith and credit to the Board\u2019s decision. He argues that the Board never afforded him a fully contested case hearing on the matter, and therefore, the Board\u2019s order does not constitute a final judgment. Martin also argues that Oregon lacked jurisdiction in the subrogation claim filed by SAIF. SAIF contends that Martin voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to the Oregon Court of Appeals. SAIF argues that the Board\u2019s judgment is final and entitled to full faith and credit by the District Court in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b613 The United States Constitution provides that \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\u201d U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 1. The U.S. Supreme Court has held, and this Court has recognized, that the full faith and credit obligation owed to final judgments is exacting. <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 39, 970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 39. A final judgment rendered by a state court is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of its sister states. <em>Underwriters National Assur. Co. v. North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Ass\u2019n, </em>445 U.S. 691, 102 S. Ct. 1357 (1982). Full faith and credit generally \u201c \u2018requires every State to give to a judgment at least the <em>res judicata </em>effect which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 39 (quoting <em>Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 109, 84 S. Ct. 242, 244 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b614 Martin states that OAR 438-011-0045(2) precluded him from holding a contested case hearing before the Board. OAR 438-011-0045(2) provides that \u201c[tjestimonial evidence shall be by deposition, affidavit or written interrogatories.\u201d ORS 656.298 also requires, however, that the Board create a sufficient record to sustain judicial review at the Oregon Court of Appeals. The duty to create a sufficient record includes providing for oral argument if requested. OAR 438-011-0031(1) provides that \u201c[a]t any time before expiration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>briefing schedule, a party may request that the Board entertain oral argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b615 Martin fails to offer evidence that he requested oral argument on SAIF\u2019s petition to the Board to subrogate Martin\u2019s settlement with Crossroads. Martin also voluntarily dismissed his appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals from the Board\u2019s decision in SAIF\u2019s favor. The Board\u2019s decision constitutes a final judgment entitled to full faith and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b616 Martin argues next that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear SAIF\u2019s subrogation claim, rendering the Board\u2019s order invalid. Martin relies on <em>Oberson v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 329, 330 Mont. 1, 126 P.3d 459, for the proposition that Montana law controls whether SAIF is entitled to subrogate, and, therefore, the Board lacked the jurisdiction to decide SAIF\u2019s subrogation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b617 <em>Oberson </em>addressed the question of extending comity, however, rather than the application of full faith and credit to another state\u2019s judgment. Musselman, a Michigan resident and an employee of a Michigan business, suffered injuries while working in Montana. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 4. Musselman filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in Michigan and a third-party tort action in Montana. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 4. Federated filed a subrogation claim against Musselman\u2019s Montana personal injury award after Musselman prevailed in the Montana district court. Musselman responded by filing a declaratory action in Montana. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 6. We considered the question of \u201cwhether Montana\u2019s or Michigan\u2019s substantive law governs Federated\u2019s subrogation interest in Musselman\u2019s third-party tort award\u201d while Federated\u2019s subrogation claim was still pending before the Michigan Workers\u2019 Compensation court. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b618 We rejected Federated\u2019s comity argument in <em>Oberson </em>on the grounds that Montana\u2019s firm public policy disallowed subrogation before full recovery. We declined to relinquish voluntarily jurisdiction over the issue of subrogation to the Michigan Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 17. Conversely, in Martin\u2019s case, the Oregon Board already had issued a judgment determining that SAIF is entitled to subrogate. Martin voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to the Oregon Court of Appeals on April 6, 2004, thus rendering final the Board\u2019s decision. SAIF moved for summary judgment in the Montana declaratory judgment action two weeks later on April 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b619  Montana\u2019s firm public policy dictates against subrogation claims until after the worker is made whole. No public policy exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>exists, however, to the full faith and credit accorded to final judgments. <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 45 (citing <em>Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp., </em>522 U.S. 222, 118 S. Ct. 657 (1998)). The Full Faith and Credit Clause obligates us to give effect to the final Oregon judgment. The District Court correctly granted summary judgment in SAIF\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b620 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding attorney fees to SAIF?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b621 Martin argues that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to SAIF as provided in \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Martin argues that under <em>Buxbaum </em>an award of fees must be \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d He contends that the court\u2019s award of fees was not \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d on the grounds that SAIF failed to satisfy the \u201ctangible parameters\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b622 Montana follows the general American Rule that a party in a civil action is not entitled to attorney fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau v. Hall, </em>2001 MT 314, \u00b6 13, 308 Mont. 29, \u00b6 13, 38 P.3d 825, \u00b6 13). This Court previously stated in <em>Buxbaum </em>that \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, provides a statutory basis for awarding attorney fees in declaratory judgment actions. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42. The award of attorney fees must be \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 42. <em>Buxbaum </em>fails to define what constitutes \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\u00b623 This Court has adopted, however, the \u201ctangible parameter\u201d test to determine whether attorney fees are \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 27, 324 Mont. 509, \u00b6 27, 105 P.3d 280, \u00b6 27. The tangible parameters test provides that fees are \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d when \u201c(1) an insurance company possesses what the plaintiffs sought in the declaratory relief action; (2) it is necessary to seek a declaration showing that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought; and (3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status quo.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u00b624 Here, of course, we must conduct the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d analysis with the roles reversed: Martin possessed the settlement proceeds from Crossroads. Martin nevertheless filed the declaratory judgment action to prevent SAIF from obtaining a portion of that settlement. This Court set forth examples in <em>Buxbaum </em>demonstrating that attorney fees were \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d in instances where a plaintiff had to bring a declaratory action to obtain coverage or when no other alternative was available to remove the cloud from the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>to property. <em>Buxbaum, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b625 In the instant case, the District Court relied heavily on the fact that SAIF \u201cwas required to litigate identical issues in different forums, which affects its ultimate recovery and ability to be made whole from this ongoing, identical litigation in two separate forums.\u201d The District Court focused on the fact that SAIF ultimately prevailed in the litigation rather than thoroughly articulating why an award of attorney fees to SAIF would be \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b626 Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Buxbaum </em>and <em>Renville, </em>Martin did not seek to obtain coverage or indemnification. Martin filed the declaratory judgment action to prevent SAIF from collecting a portion of his third-party settlement with Crossroads. Martin sought a determination from the District Court that Montana law would control the subrogation rights. SAIF cannot satisfy even the first prong of the tangible parameters test as it actually sought proceeds from Martin\u2019s settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b627 Moreover, it was not necessary to SAIF to seek a declaration from the Montana court in order to change the status quo. The Board already had issued an order directing Martin to distribute $12,222.22 to SAIF as its proper share of Martin\u2019s third-party settlement with Crossroads. Thus, SAIF cannot satisfy at least two elements of the tangible parameters analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b628  The District Court\u2019s reliance on the fact that SAIF prevailed, and therefore, should be entitled to attorney fees does not comport with the \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Buxbaum. </em>We hold that neither party is entitled to attorney fees under the American Rule. <em>Sampson v. National Farmers Union Property, </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 15, 333 Mont. 541, \u00b6 15, 144 P.3d 797, \u00b6 15. The District Court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to SAIF. We vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b629 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"An1\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"Apy\">concurs in part and dissents in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b630 I concur with the Court in affirming Issue 1, but I would also affirm the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees under Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u00b631 The Court relies on <em>Renville v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, </em>2004 MT 366, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280 <em>(Renville III) </em>in determining to reverse the award of attorney fees. We said in <em>Renville III:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">[T]he award of attorney fees is a discretionary function of the District Court and we will not overturn such an award absent an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>district court judge acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reasoning resulting in substantial injustice. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><em>Renville III, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b632 The District Court entered four orders addressing the attorney fee issue, including a fourteen-page order discussing and denying Martin\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s award of attorney fees to SAIF, wherein the court delineated its reasoning and applied the three prongs of the \u201ctangible parameter\u201d test requiring that an award be \u201cnecessary and proper.\u201d I am hard pressed to conclude that the court acted \u201carbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment\u201d on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b633 Under the three-part test, as enunciated in <em>Renville III, </em>\u00b6 27, the Court concludes that \u201cSAIF cannot satisfy even the first prong,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 26, which requires that \u201can insurance company possesses what the plaintiffs sought in the declaratory relief action.\u201d <em>Renville III, </em>\u00b6 27. It is not clear to me from the Court\u2019s opinion why SAIF cannot satisfy this prong, unless we intend to strictly construe the test as applying to cases where an insurance company \u201cpossesses\u201d something. In my view, Martin possessed something that SAIF sought and was legally entitled to by virtue of the Oregon litigation, which should satisfy the first prong. The District Court\u2019s reasoning was perhaps truer to the wording of the first prong: \u201cIf this Court were to characterize what SAIF Corporation possessed and what Martin sought in the Montana declaratory judgment action, it would be that SAIF Corporation possessed a binding Oregon decision and Martin failed to appeal the decision that Oregon law applied to the settlement proceeds.\u201d Under either of these \u201cpossession\u201d theories, I would hold that SAIF satisfied the prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b634 Regarding the second prong, whether it was \u201cnecessary to seek a declaration,\u201d <em>Renville III, </em>\u00b6 27, although Martin initiated the litigation, SAIF was forced to participate in the litigation to avoid defaulting to Martin, and thus, its participation was \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to protect its interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b635 Regarding the third prong, whether \u201cthe declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status <em>quo,\u201d Renville III, </em>\u00b6 27, the District Court noted, that it was Martin who sought to change the status quo, which required SAIF to litigate identical issues in different forums. The Court finds this to be insufficient under the third prong, concluding that because SAIF had already obtained an order directing Martin to pay in Oregon, \u201cit was not necessary [for] SAIF to seek a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>declaration from the Montana court in order to change the status quo.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 27. I would admit that, in a very technical sense of the term \u201cstatus quo,\u201d this observation is true. However, Martin would not honor the legal \u201cstatus quo\u201d (the Oregon order), abandoned his litigation within the Oregon courts and challenged the Oregon order in Montana. As a practical matter, Martin\u2019s refusal to honor the Oregon order and pay SAIF created a new \u201cstatus quo\u201d which required SAIF to participate in the Montana litigation to obtain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b636 The Court\u2019s application of the three-prong test seems rigid and technical. I would conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion and affirm the attorney fee award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
