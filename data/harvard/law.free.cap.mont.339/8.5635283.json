Mid-Continent cross-appeals a portion of the order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u00b62 Blair raises three issues on appeal which we restate as a single issue: Did the District Court err in concluding that the allegations in Meadows West\u2019s amended complaint were not an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in Mid-Continent\u2019s policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u00b63 On cross-appeal, Mid-Continent raises the issue of whether the amended complaint alleged \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined in its policy. However, because we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing Blair\u2019s complaint, we need not discuss the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u00b64 Blair owns approximately eight acres in the Meadows West Landowners Association subdivision (Meadows West), near Missoula. The land is zoned residential. In 2003 he began excavating gravel on his property. Although Blair sold some of this gravel, he filed an affidavit claiming that any gravel extraction was incidental to development of the property for residential purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\u00b65 In August 2003, Meadows West sued Blair seeking an injunction and restoration of the property. In the alternative, Meadows West sought damages for failure to submit any construction plans to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Meadows West architectural control committee and for Blair\u2019s use of his property as a commercial gravel pit in violation of the subdivision\u2019s restrictive covenants. The complaint alleged that Blair had constructed high earthen berms around the gravel pit which were unpleasant and disruptive to the views of other lot owners and that the gravel pit substantially decreased the value of the other homes in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b66 The District Court initially restrained Blair from operating a gravel pit, but allowed him to continue developing his property if he submitted a development plan to the Meadows West architectural control committee. However, in a later order, the District Court restrained Blair from all further excavation and site work until after the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b67 Meadows West then filed an amended complaint against Blair, again alleging injury to the owners of lots in the subdivision, a decrease in the value of other homes in the subdivision, and demanding damages. Blair tendered the defense and demanded coverage under his insurance policy (the Policy) with Mid-Continent.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b68 Blair\u2019s Policy with Mid-Continent provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKF\">We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u2019 or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b69 The Policy goes on to say that it only applies to bodily injuries or property damage if, \u201cThe bodily injury or \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory.\u2019 \u201d \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined in the Policy as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">[A]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b610 After reviewing the amended complaint, Mid-Continent informed Blair that it had determined its Policy did not provide coverage and it would not defend him against Meadows West\u2019s lawsuit because the pleadings did not allege damages stemming from bodily injury or property damage due to an occurrence, as defined by the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b611 Blair hired an attorney to defend him against Meadows West\u2019s lawsuit. He ultimately entered into a settlement agreement with Meadows West and its complaint against him was dismissed. He then brought the present declaratory judgment action against Mid-Continent seeking a judgment that he was entitled to recover the amount he paid in settlement of the Meadows West suit, his attorney fees incurred in the defense of that suit, and his attorney fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>incurred in this present action. Mid-Continent counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the Policy provided no coverage and it had no duty to defend Blair against Meadows West. Both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b612 The District Court granted Mid-Continent\u2019s motion, concluding that Blair\u2019s admitted intentional gravel operation did not constitute an occurrence as defined in the Policy, thus there was no coverage and Mid-Continent had no duty to defend Blair against the suit by Meadows West.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b613 It is from this order that Blair has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b614 The standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Williams v. Union Fid. Life Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 273, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 158, \u00b6 18, 123 P.3d 213, \u00b6 18. We apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 18. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b615  Montana law is well-settled that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises when a complaint alleges facts which represent a risk covered by the terms of an insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 20, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 20 <em>(citing Lindsay Drill. &amp; Cont. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>208 Mont. 91, 94, 676 P.2d 203, 205 (1984)). The insurance company must look to the allegations of a complaint to determine if coverage exists under an insurance policy, thus giving rise to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Graber v. State Farm, </em>244 Mont. 265, 270, 797 P.2d 214, 217 (1990)). The duty to defend is independent from and broader than the duty to indemnify and it arises when a complaint against an insured alleges facts, which if proven, would result in coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). Unless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage, an insurer has a duty to defend. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Insured Titles, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>275 Mont. 111, 116, 911 P.2d 209, 212 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b616 The gist of this dispute is Blair\u2019s claim that Meadows West\u2019s amended complaint alleged facts that, if proven true, would be within the coverage provided by Mid-Continent\u2019s Policy and, thus, Mid-Continent had a duty to defend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b617 According to Blair, the District Court erred in its analysis of what constitutes an occurrence under the Policy. Blair does not deny that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>intentionally removed gravel from his property. However, he claims that long-established Montana law provides that an intentional act is an occurrence under an insurance policy if the resulting injuries or damages were not the intended or expected result of the insured\u2019s intentional conduct. Here, Blair claims that he did not intend to cause harm to neighboring property owners. Thus, according to Blair, the District Court erred when it determined his deliberate conduct could not constitute an occurrence as defined in the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b618 As noted above in \u00b6 9, the Policy in question limited what constitutes an occurrence to an \u201caccident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Under this definition, the proper focus is on whether Blair\u2019s deliberate operation of removing gravel is covered-not whether he intended the resulting damages allegedly stemming from the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b619  Given this definition and its focus on Blair\u2019s conduct, rather than the results of that conduct, Blair\u2019s intentional actions in digging and removing gravel from his property, which gave rise to Meadows West\u2019s complaints, was not accidental. The interpretation of an insurance contract\u2019s terms must be according to their \u201cusual, commonsense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of average intelligence not trained in law or insurance business.\u201d <em>Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. </em>Co., 2001 MT 59, \u00b6 30, 304 Mont. 356, \u00b6 30, 22 P.3d 631, \u00b6 30. From the standpoint of the insured, the term \u201caccident\u201d reasonably refers to any unexpected happening that occurs without intention or design on the part of the insured. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 36, 303 Mont. 519, \u00b6 36, 16 P.3d 399, \u00b6 36 (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 15 (6th ed. 1990)). Blair deliberately moved gravel on his property, which caused the alleged damages. Unequivocally, this was no accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b620 The cases cited by Blair in support of his argument are distinguishable. In those cases, the definition of what was covered by the policy at issue focused, in part, on the consequences of an act. For example, in <em>N. W. Natl. Cas. Co. v. Phalen, </em>182 Mont. 448, 450, 597 P.2d 720, 721 (1979), the policy in question defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as an accident which results in bodily injury or property damage. However, unlike Mid-Continent\u2019s Policy in question here, that policy considered the results of a deliberate action because in limiting the coverage it said that only injury which \u201c[i]s either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured\u201d was excluded. <em>Phalen, </em>182 Mont. at 450, 597 P.2d at 721. Likewise, the results of a deliberate action were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>necessarily considered by the Court in <em>Lindsay Drilling, </em>208 Mont. at 95, 676 P.2d at 205, because the policy at issue defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as an accident which resulted in bodily injury or property damage \u201cneither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d Blair\u2019s Policy with Mid-Continent does not state that the results of an intentional act, apart from the act itself, are to be considered in what is a covered occurrence. The policy unequivocally limits coverage to accidental happenings and, thus, its coverage is narrower than the policies interpreted in the cases Blair relies upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b621 The order of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, granting summary judgment to Mid-Continent is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
