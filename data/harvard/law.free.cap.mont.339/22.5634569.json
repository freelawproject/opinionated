We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in refusing to set aside the default entered against Lake County?</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\u00b63 As we reverse and remand for further consideration the District Court\u2019s denial of Lake County\u2019s motion to set aside its default, we need not decide whether the District Court erred in denying Lake County\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment and in granting Engelsberger\u2019s motion to strike affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b64 On December 27, 2002, Engelsberger filed a complaint against Lake County alleging wrongful discharge. For the next two years Engelsberger attempted to resolve his claim with Lake County officials. On January 10, 2005, Engelsberger finally served Lake County Commissioner Mike Hutchin (Hutchin) with the summons and complaint in this action. Lake County made no appearance in the lawsuit and on March 7, 2005, Engelsberger applied to the Lake County Clerk of the District Court for a default. The Clerk entered the default of the defendant Lake County that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b65 The next day, March 8, 2005, Lake County appeared in the action by way of a Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default. In an order entered April 5, 2005, the District Court denied the motion. The District Court, citing Essex <em>Ins. Co. v. Jaycie, Inc., </em>2004 MT 278, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 231, \u00b6 12, 99 P.3d 651, \u00b6 12, and <em>Cribb v. Matlock Communications, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>236 Mont. 27, 30, 768 P.2d 337, 339 (1989), held that the failure of Lake County to timely appear in the action was willful, and based solely on such willful conduct denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b66 Engelsberger then applied for a default judgment. The amount of his damage was tried to a jury, which awarded $90,532.00. The District Court entered judgment against Lake County for the amount of the jury verdict on November 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b67 After the District Court entered judgment Lake County filed a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, attaching three documents captioned as \u201cAffidavits.\u201d The District Court denied Lake County\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment and granted Engelsberger\u2019s motion to strike the affidavits. Lake County appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b68  The general principles which guide this Court in considering a motion to set aside a default are: every case should be decided on its merits, judgments by default are not favored, and district courts are vested with discretion when considering a motion to set aside a default. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, \u00b6 16, 166 P.3d 451, \u00b6 16. Additionally, the party seeking to set aside the judgment bears the burden of proof. <em>Matthews v. Don K Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 456, \u00b6 9, 115 P.3d 201, \u00b6 9. When a trial court grants a motion to set aside a default and opens up the action for a trial on the merits, the court\u2019s ruling will only be set aside upon a showing of manifest abuse of discretion. However, when a trial court denies a motion to set aside a default, the defaulting party need only show a slight abuse of discretion to warrant reversal. <em>See Essex v. Moose\u2019s, </em>\u00b6 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b69 Lake County argues that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the motion to set aside its default. It contends that the District Court should have set aside the default because both the good cause criteria contained in M. R. Civ. P. 55(c) and the excusable neglect standard in M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b610 This Court has set separate standards for review of motions for relief from default judgments and for review of motions to set aside defaults. <em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>\u00b6 12. If a defending party does not appear and the district court enters judgment by default, we apply Rule 60(b) and the standard set forth in <em>Blume v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>242 Mont. 465, 467, 791 P.2d 784, 786 (1990). <em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 12; <em>See also Matthews, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 12; <em>Tschida v. Rowe, </em>2003 MT 192, \u00b6 12, 316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Mont. 503, \u00b6 12, 74 P.3d 1043, \u00b6 12. We apply Rule 55(c) and the standard set forth in <em>Cribb </em>when the clerk of the district court has entered a default, but where the district court has not entered a default judgment at the time the defending party appears. <em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 12. If a default is set aside, a judgment upon which it is based must be vacated. <em>Big Spring v. Blackfeet Tribe of Blackfeet Indian Reservation, </em>175 Mont. 258, 264, 573 P.2d 655, 659 (1978). Conversely, if a default is not set aside, a judgment entered as a result of that default will not be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b611 As the result in this case depends on whether the default of Lake County is set aside, we apply Rule 55(c) and the <em>Cribb </em>standard to analyze whether the District Court slightly abused its discretion in denying Lake County\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b612 Rule 55(c) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[f]or good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).\u201d Whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to set aside a default under Rule 55(c) is an equitable determination made by considering the factors set forth in <em>Cribb </em>and <em>Essex v. Jaycie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">(1) whether the default was willful, (2) whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default should be set aside, and (3) whether the defendant has presented a meritorious defense to plaintiffs claim. The court must also balance the interests of the defendant in the adjudication of his defense on the merits, against the interests of the public and the court in the orderly and timely administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\"><em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>\u00b6 10, citing <em>Cribb, </em>236 Mont. at 30, 768 P.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">\u00b613  The District Court did not err in concluding that Lake County\u2019s failure to appear was willful. It noted that the summons served upon Hutchin explicitly stated that failure to answer the complaint within twenty days could result in judgment by default for the relief demanded in the complaint and that Hutchin\u2019s failure to bring the summons and complaint to the attention of the County Attorney\u2019s office constituted willful behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b614 Lake County argues its failure to timely appear was not willful, but resulted from a misunderstanding of procedure occasioned by a change of guard in the office of the Lake County Clerk of the District Court. The argument advanced is that on prior occasions, when a lawsuit was filed against Lake County, the Clerk of Court would take the complaint to the Lake County Attorney, who would then appear for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the County. In this instance no one in the office of the Clerk of Court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b615 However, the failure of the Clerk of Court\u2019s office to follow an informal, in-house procedure does not absolve managerial personnel, the County Commissioners, from the duty of diligence required to deliver the summons to the proper individuals-in this case, the office of the Lake County Attorney. It is not an abuse of discretion for a District Court to require management-level personnel to be aware of the importance of a summons from the moment it is received. <em>Roberts v. Empire Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>278 Mont. 135, 141, 923 P.2d 550, 554 (1996). Here, one of the three highest executive officers in Lake County was personally served with a summons and nothing was done to appear in the lawsuit. Lake County\u2019s conduct in this instance is analogous to office mismanagement, neglect and inattentiveness on the part of high-level employees that is sufficiently careless to amount to willfulness. <em>See Roberts, </em>278 Mont. at 140-41, 923 P.2d at 553-54.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u00b616 In addressing \u201cgood cause\u201d under a Rule 55(c) motion to set aside a default, a Court must be more inclined to set aside the default because it is more flexible and lenient than the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard for setting aside a default judgment under Rule 60(b). <em>Cribb, </em>236 Mont. at 30, 768 P.2d at 339. When considering a motion to set aside a default the District Court is compelled in every case to consider all three factors of the <em>Cribb </em>test. <em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 16; <em>See also Pincay v. Andrews, </em>389 F.3d 853, 860 (9th Cir. 2004) (There should be no rigid legal rule against late filings attributable to any particular type of negligence. Instead, the weighing of equitable factors is left to the discretion of the trial court in every case.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">\u00b617 Because a consideration and balancing of all three <em>Cribb </em>factors is required before making a decision on a motion to set aside a default, and because the District Court only considered Lake Count/s willful failure to appear, we must remand this case to the District Court for a consideration of any prejudice to Engelsberger if the default is set aside and if Lake County presented the possibility of a meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u00b618  If, upon consideration of all three factors used to determine if there is good cause to set aside a default, as enunciated in <em>Cribb </em>and <em>Essex v. Jaycie, </em>the District Court concludes that the default of Lake County should not be set aside, it shall re-affirm the judgment of November 21, 2005. In such instance, interest on the judgment shall run from the date of its original entry. <em>Woods v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2004 MT 384, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 106, \u00b6 8, 104 P.3d 1045, \u00b6 8. Should the District Court conclude that the default of Lake County must be set aside, the matter shall proceed to trial on the issue of liability only, as the amount of damages has already been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for proceedings in conformity with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b51-4\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> These are the same principals this Court uses to review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to set aside a default judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\"> In applying the four-part <em>Blume </em>test to a Rule 60(b) motion to set aside a default judgment, a district court <em>might </em>consider only the first factor, excusable neglect. This Court has consistently held that if a party fails to establish \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d it fails to establish the \u201cthreshold requirement\u201d necessary to set aside a default judgment. <em>Roberts, </em>278 Mont. at 140-41, 923 P.2d at 553-54. Thus, if a trial court finds that a party <em>fails </em>to establish excusable neglect, it may not need to address the additional elements of the <em>Blume </em>test. <em>Matthews, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
