On August 26, 2005, the County Attorney filed an information charging Meyers with assault on a minor and a jury trial ensued. At trial, Meyers\u2019s wife, Victoria Meyers (Victoria), testified to the events of August 20. Victoria, who has five children with Meyers, testified that on the morning of August 20 she heard screaming coming from the boys\u2019 room and, upon investigating, discovered Meyers hitting Isaac with a sandal. Victoria testified that Meyers hit Isaac between twelve and fifteen times. She testified that she told Meyers to stop hitting Isaac, but Meyers insisted that he was \u201cdisciplining\u201d their son. Victoria responded by saying that this was not \u201cdiscipline\u201d but \u201cabuse.\u201d She testified that she told Meyers, \u201c[w]e are not going to live this way anymore\u201d and ordered him to leave the room. After Meyers left the boys\u2019 room, Victoria gathered the children and traveled to the police station. Victoria testified that while in the car she asked the children, \u201c \u2018[d]o you guys want this to stop?\u2019 And all five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of the children said, Yeah, Mom, it has to stop. We can\u2019t keep living like this.\u2019 \u201d Meyers\u2019s trial counsel did not lodge any objections throughout Victoria\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b64 The jury subsequently found Meyers guilty of assault on a minor, and the District Court sentenced him to four years in the Montana Department of Corrections, with all four years suspended upon conditions. Among others, the conditions mandated that Meyers, \u201cif not employed in Broadwater County, shall not reside in Broadwater County, subject to the pending Parenting Plan\u201d and that Meyers would \u201cpay court ordered victim restitution\u201d in an amount to \u201cremain open until all victims have received the help they need.\u201d While the District Court\u2019s sentence and judgment of conviction sets forth the general rationale for these conditions, the pre-sentence investigation report provided detailed support for their imposition. In the report, Victoria stated that her \u201c \u2018kids are afraid to ride there [sic] bikes and sleep in their own beds because they know [Meyers] is around town, somewhere.\u2019 \u201d She also related that Meyers\u2019s mental and physical abuse over the years made herself and all five children victims of Meyers\u2019s behavior. Victoria offered further testimony at the sentencing hearing. Meyers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b65 \u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, \u00b6 7, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 7. When an offender\u2019s sentence does not include one year or more of actual incarceration he or she is statutorily ineligible for sentence review by the Sentence Review Division. In such cases, \u201cwe first review the sentence for legality to determine whether it falls within statutory parameters and, if so, we then examine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 131, \u00b6 8, 151 P.3d 46, \u00b6 8. \u201c[W]here the issue ... is whether [a] court followed applicable statutory requirements, the question is one of law over which our review is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 17, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b66 1. Did Meyers\u2019s trial counsel render ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to or seek exclusion of testimony regarding alleged prior bad acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b67 Meyers argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to seek exclusion of and object to Victoria\u2019s testimony constituted ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>counsel. Meyers asserts that Victoria\u2019s statements that \u201cwe are not going to live this way anymore\u201d and \u201cthis has to stop\u201d represented improper evidence of prior bad acts to show action in conformity with character. The State asserts that Victoria\u2019s statements were permissible as evidence of Meyers\u2019s \u201chabit of disciplining his children.\u201d In the alternative, the State argues that even if Victoria\u2019s statements were impermissible as prior bad acts, they were not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b68 Both the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee an individual the right to effective assistance of counsel. When reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel we have adopted the two-prong test defined in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). This test places the burden on the defendant to show that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance fell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial to his case.\u201d <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. With respect to the first prong, there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that trial counsel\u2019s actions are indicative of trial strategy and within the broad scope of reasonable professional conduct. <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b69 However, before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we must first determine that the allegations are properly before the Court. <em>State v. </em>Dyfort, 2000 MT 338, \u00b6 8, 303 Mont. 153, \u00b6 8, 15 P.3d 464, \u00b6 8. \u201cOnly when the record will fully explain why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense for the accused may this Court review the matter on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20 (emphasis added). Conversely, where allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201ccannot be documented from the record,\u201d the claim must be pursued in a petition for post-conviction relief, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. <em>Hagen v. State, </em>1999 MT 8, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 60, \u00b6 12, 973 P.2d 233, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b610 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding omissions of trial counsel frequently are ill-suited for direct appeal. While \u201c[f]ailure to object to testimony may be record-based and thus appropriate for direct appeal,... commonly the record does not reflect counsel\u2019s reasons for failing to object.\u201d <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 35, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 35, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 35 (internal citation omitted). Generally, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on an omission indicates that non-record based information explains trial counsel\u2019s decisions, thereby making the claim inappropriate for direct appeal. <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u00b611 Here, Meyers alleges that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to submit an order in limine to exclude Victoria\u2019s testimony of alleged prior bad acts and his subsequent failure to object to Victoria\u2019s testimony comprised ineffective assistance of counsel. However, in both instances the record is silent as to \u201cwhy\u201d Meyers\u2019s trial counsel failed to take these actions. Therefore, Meyers\u2019s complaint rests on non-record based information and is inappropriate for direct appeal. Consequently, we dismiss Meyers\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to raising the claim in post-conviction relief proceedings. Accordingly, we do not reach the issue of whether the testimony was improper prior bad act testimony or proper testimony regarding Meyers\u2019s habit of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b612 2. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by:</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">a. Restricting Meyers\u2019s ability to reside in Broadwater County?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b613 Meyers complains that the District Court imposed an illegal sentence when it restricted him from residing in Broadwater County unless he was also employed in Broadwater County. Meyers argues that the condition is illegal because it is not reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation or the protection of the victim and society. In support of this argument, Meyers likens his residency restriction to the banishment condition addressed <em>to. State v. Muhammad. </em>There, we held that a banishment condition was not reasonably related to the goals of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b614 The sentencing statutes provide that a sentencing judge may impose reasonable restrictions or conditions on suspended sentences that are \u201cconsidered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d Section 46-18-20l(4)(o), MCA. Such conditions may include restrictions on the defendant\u2019s freedom of association and freedom of movement. Section 46-18-202(1)(c), (d), MCA. Accordingly, each restriction must be analyzed to determine whether it is reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation or protection of the victim and society. We found the condition at issue in <em>Muhammad </em>to be an unreasonable condition. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b615 In <em>Muhammad, </em>the defendant entered a plea of guilty subject to a non-binding plea agreement for the offense of sexual intercourse without consent. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. As a condition to his suspended sentence, Muhammad was barred from residing or working in Cascade County. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 12. The defendant challenged the condition as unreasonable and a violation of his constitutional rights. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 20. While not reaching his constitutional argument, we agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the condition was not reasonably related to his rehabilitation or protection of the victim and society. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 29. The record in <em>Muhammad </em>stated \u201cno reasons for the imposition of the condition\u201d but did establish that the district court \u201chad facts before it at the time of sentencing [that] would render the condition unduly severe and punitive to the point of being unrelated to rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. We reasoned that the district court had also \u201cimposed less restrictive means to rehabilitate Muhammad and to protect the victim and society.\u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. These less restrictive means included requiring that he complete sex offender treatment, refrain from contact with females under the age of eighteen, and not live within two blocks of where children assemble. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. Because the condition was broad and there were other less restrictive means of fulfilling the goals of rehabilitating Muhammad and protecting society, we held that the condition was unreasonable and therefore in violation of \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(e), MCA (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b616 Here, although Meyers repeatedly uses the term \u201cbanishment condition,\u201d it is clear the condition does not completely \u201cbanish\u201d him from Broadwater County. Rather, the condition imposes a residency restriction, which Meyers may be relieved from if he becomes employed in the county. Indeed, even if Meyers is not employed in Broadwater County, he is allowed to be present in the county, so long as the county is not his residence. Further, the District Court made the residency restriction subject to the pending parenting plan, which may well lead to further refinement or possible elimination of the restriction, depending on the development of that plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b617 Most importantly, and in contrast to <em>Muhammad, </em>the presentence investigation report discusses the need to narrow Meyers\u2019s ability to reside in Broadwater County. The victims have expressed fear of Meyers to the point that it has disrupted their participation in every day activities in the community. Victoria reported that Meyers \u201c \u201chas no reason to be in Townsend\u2019 \u201d and \u201cshe believes the only reason [Meyers] is still living in Townsend is so that he can still have control over their lives, \u2018even if it is just through terrorizing [them]....\u2019 \u201d The need to protect the victims in this case led the court to impose, as a corollary to the residency restriction, a \u201cno contact\u201d condition as well. As such, Meyers may not contact Victoria or any of the children until the pending parenting plan is in place. The record is silent as to lesser restrictive means the court may have used to provide protection to the victims herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b618  Because the residency restriction is designed to protect the victims and yet allow Meyers limited ability to be present in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>county, we conclude that the District Court imposed an appropriately tailored condition, and that it satisfies the requirement to be reasonably related to the protection of the victims and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b619  Finally, because we conclude the condition restricting Meyers\u2019s ability to reside in Broadwater County does not constitute an illegal sentence, we thus consider if the District Court abused its discretion by imposing the condition, as this sentence falls within the narrow group of cases subject to our two-tiered review. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. The District Court had before it a pre-sentence investigation report and victim testimony indicating that Meyers had continued to attempt to control their lives, if not by physical force, but by \u201cterrorizing [them],\u201d and that the family\u2019s normal life had been disrupted by their fear of his presence. Victoria testified that Meyers had no reason to live in Townsend except to control their lives. The District Court left the door open to changing the condition pursuant to a parenting plan to be adopted within the pending dissolution proceeding. The District Court\u2019s decision is thus supported by substantial evidence and we conclude that the residency restriction was not an abuse of discretion. Consequently, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">b. Requiring Meyers to pay restitution \u201cin an amount to remain open\u201d until the victims receive any help they need?</p>\n<p id=\"A1dH\">\u00b620 Last, Meyers asserts that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority when it failed to set the amount of restitution Meyers must pay to the victims. The State concedes that the District Court erred by leaving the amount of restitution \u201copen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b621  \u201cA district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence is defined and constrained by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 12, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 12. Likewise, a sentence is illegal when it is not based on statutory authority. <em>Ruiz, </em>\u00b6 12. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-244, MCA, \u201c[t]he court shall specify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay.\u201d The District Court erred by failing to specify the total amount of restitution Meyers must pay to the victims. Accordingly we vacate this condition and remand to the District Court for re-imposition of the restitution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b622 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
