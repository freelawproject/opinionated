Griffin signed a Request to Amend Conditions of Probation Supervision, consenting that his probation could be modified to include participation in the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP). The District Court approved his request and entered an Order Modifying the Conditions of Supervision. He subsequently filed a motion to set aside the District Court\u2019s order, which was denied. He now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of that motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Griffin\u2019s motion to set aside the order modifying the conditions of his probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">\u00b64 Defendant Jack Griffin pled guilty to a charge of felony incest for having sexual intercourse with his minor daughter and was convicted on June 26, 1998. The District Court classified Griffin as a Level III sex offender and sentenced him to Montana State Prison for a period of thirty years, with fifteen years suspended. One of the conditions of his sentence stated that \u201c[t]he Defendant shall be under the supervision and control of the Montana Office of Adult Probation and Parole during the entire period of the suspended sentence including at least monthly personal reports to his parole/probation officer. The Defendant <em>shall abide by all the rules and conditions of that office\u201d </em>(emphasis added). This same condition appeared in the pretrial agreement which Griffin himself signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">\u00b65 After serving seven and a half years of his sentence, Griffin was released from the custody of Montana State Prison and was placed under the supervision of the Department of Corrections (\u201cthe Department\u201d). He wanted to be placed in Billings, though he had no existing ties to the community there. Griffin met with Laura McKee, a probation officer of the Department of Corrections Adult Probation and Parole Bureau in Billings. McKee recommended that Griffin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>complete ISP when he was released from prison \u201cto assist him in reentering the community.\u201d McKee recommended that Griffin\u2019s conditions of probation supervision be modified to include ISP because he was a Level III sex offender who had \u201cno ties to [the] community and no job or treatment set up.\u201d She found that \u201c[h]e warrants a higher level of supervision than standard probation provides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b66 Griffin signed a formal request to modify the conditions of his probation to include ISP. The Deputy County Attorney then moved the court to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation as requested, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA (2005). Several days later, the District Court approved the motion and entered an order modifying the conditions of Griffin\u2019s supervision. The District Court\u2019s order specifically noted that Griffin agreed to the conditions in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b67 A day after the District Court\u2019s order was issued, Griffin moved to have the order set aside. His attorney withdrew this motion the following day, upon learning that Griffin had consented to the modification. Later, he spoke with Griffin, and Griffin claimed that his probation officer had coerced him to sign the request for modification. Griffin\u2019s attorney then renewed the motion to set aside the District Court\u2019s order modifying the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b68 The District Court denied the renewed motion to set aside, finding that Griffin had consented to the request to modify the conditions. The District Court also found that there was \u201cno evidence from the Defendant that his agreement to the Request for Modification was coerced or the result of duress.\u201d Rather, the District Court found, Griffin himself \u201cindicate[d] that he signed such document so he could be supervised in Billings, Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b69 The court concluded that it had the authority to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA, which provides \u201ca judge may modify or add any condition of probation or suspension of sentence at any time.\u201d Finally, the District Court concluded, the requirement to complete ISP did not change Griffin\u2019s original conditions of probation, but merely subjected him to greater scrutiny. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b610 A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a post-trial motion is discretionary. <em>State v. Sheehan, </em>2005 MT 305, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 417, \u00b6 18, 124 P.3d 1119, \u00b6 18. We review such rulings in criminal cases for abuse of discretion. <em>Sheehan, </em>\u00b6 18. The burden of demonstrating abuse of discretion is on the party seeking reversal of the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ruling. <em>Sheehan, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in denying Griffin\u2019s motion to set aside the order modifying the conditions of his probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b612 Griffin argues that the District Court\u2019s order constituted a modification of his sentence, and as such, violated his constitutional rights. Specifically, Griffin claims that the District Court lacked the authority to modify his sentence eight years after it was issued, and that the ISP requirement violates <em>ex post facto </em>principles because it increased his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b613 In response, the State argues the District Court\u2019s order simply changed the conditions of Griffin\u2019s supervision on probation. The State maintains the court had the authority to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA. Because the court\u2019s order did not change the length, term, or substance of Griffin\u2019s sentence, the State claims that the modification does not implicate constitutional concerns. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b614 A. Did the District Court have authority to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4). MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b615 Section 46-23-1011(4), MCA, gives judges the authority to \u201cmodify or add any condition of probation or suspension of sentence at any time.\u201d At the time Griffin was sentenced, \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA (1998), only permitted judges to modify conditions of probation. In 2001, the statute was amended to permit judges to \u201cmodify or add\u201d to the conditions of probation. Section 46-23-1011(4), MCA, cmnt (2001). The Legislature specifically intended that the section be applied retroactively to offenders currently in the Department\u2019s custody. Section 46-23-1011(4), MCA, cmnt (2001). Even if the provision had not been made retroactive, under the terms of \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA (1998), at the time Griffin was sentenced, the District Court still had the authority to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AS2\">\u00b616 B. Did the District Court\u2019s order constitute a modification of Griffin\u2019s mmlshment. in violation of the <em>ex post facto, </em>double jeopardy, and due process clauses of the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b617 Not every modification of the conditions of a suspended sentence will implicate <em>ex post facto </em>concerns. The touchstone of the <em>ex post facto </em>analysis in this context is whether an offender\u2019s sentence has been changed in a punitive sense. <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 89, 317 Mont. 481, \u00b6 89, 78 P.3d 829, \u00b6 89 (adopting the intents-effects test to determine whether laws are punitive or non-punitive). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>modification of an offender\u2019s conditions of probation must be distinguished from a modification of an offender\u2019s sentence itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b618 It is conceivable that some applications of \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA, may violate <em>ex post facto </em>principles. If, for example, a district court added months or years to a defendant\u2019s sentence under the color of \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA, that would clearly violate the constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b619  Although the District Court\u2019s order modified the condition of Griffin\u2019s supervision pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA, it did not modify his punishment. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s order simply clarified the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation, and did not change his original sentence. As discussed in more detail below, Griffin\u2019s participation in ISP was contemplated by the original conditions of his suspended sentence. Further, the ISP program is not punitive in nature, and reinforces (rather than changes) the original conditions of Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence. Because Griffin\u2019s sentence itself has not been modified, it is unnecessary for us to reach his <em>ex post facto, </em>double jeopardy, and due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b620 <em>1. </em>Was <em>ISP contemplated as one of the original conditions of Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b621 As one of the conditions of his suspended sentence, the District Court ordered Griffin to \u201cabide by all the rules and conditions of [the Department of Corrections].\u201d Section 46-23-1002(3), MCA (1998), provides that the Department may \u201cadopt rules for the conduct of persons placed on parole or probation, except that the department may not make any rule conflicting with conditions of parole imposed by the board or conditions of probation imposed by a court.\u201d As we recognized in <em>Therriault, </em>ISP is a permissible exercise of the Department\u2019s authority under \u00a7 46-23-1002(3), MCA, so long as none of the ISP rules conflict with the offender\u2019s court-ordered conditions of probation. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 302 Mont. 189, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 14 P.3d 444, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b622  At the time of Griffin\u2019s sentencing, ISP was used by the Department as one of the rehabilitation programs for high-risk offenders like Griffin. While the District Court did not specifically require Griffin to complete ISP in its original conditions, it required him to abide by all the rules and conditions of the Department\u2019s probation program. One of the conditions that the Department attached to Griffin\u2019s probation in Billings was the requirement to complete ISP. Thus, we agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that ISP was contemplated as one of the original conditions of Griffin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b623 <em>2. Does the requirement to successfully complete ISP change Griffin\u2019s original sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s order modifies the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation by intensifying his level of supervision. However, the requirement to complete ISP is not punitive and does not change the terms of Griffin\u2019s original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b625 The Department first developed ISP in Billings in 1987. Since then, it has been available as an alternative to imprisonment for felony offenders requiring a higher level of supervision. The program is open to offenders on inmate status, as well as to those on parole or probation status. The stated purpose of the ISP is to provide \u201coffenders who need a structured environment, counseling, and supervision\u201d with \u201ca specialized form of adult probation . . . using a heightened level of supervision, monitoring devices and close scheduling.\u201d <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-42. ISP is a \u201ccommunity-based\u201d program which allows offenders to \u201clive at home [and] hold or seek jobs.\u201d <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b626 In <em>Therriault, </em>we explicitly rejected the notion that ISP was punitive in nature, and held that participation in the program could not change an offender\u2019s status from probationer to inmate. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-47. We specifically held that the rules and regulations of ISP may not conflict with the terms of a district court\u2019s sentence. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46-47. Rather, ISP is merely a \u201cspecialized form of adult probation and parole supervision\u201d which places the offender under greater scrutiny, but still requires him to abide by all the original conditions of his probation. <em>Therriault, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b627 Thus, the Department\u2019s recommendation that Griffin complete ISP does not change the terms of his original sentence. To the contrary, the District Court included a number of restrictive conditions on Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence. The District Court prohibited Griffin from contact \"with children under the age of eighteen; from using or possessing pornographic material, alcoholic beverages or drugs; from entering any establishments where alcohol is the primary item of sale; and from using or possessing any firearms. Further, the court ordered Griffin to seek and maintain full-time employment; to submit to random drug testing; to enroll in a chemical dependency treatment program; and to successfully complete a sex offender treatment program under the supervision of the Department. ISP will provide Griffin with the resources and tools he needs to comply with these original conditions of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">\u00b628 We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the ISP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>requirement simply requires Griffin to \u201cabide by the original conditions of probation ... subject to greater scrutiny.\u201d ISP was contemplated as one of the original conditions of Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence, and the requirements of ISP do not change the conditions of the District Court\u2019s sentence. Because the District Court\u2019s order does not modify Griffin\u2019s punishment, he has not suffered any due process, double jeopardy, or <em>ex post facto </em>violations. As a result, it is unnecessary to reach the other issues he raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b629 Finally, we must address Griffin\u2019s claim that he was coerced into signing the request to modify the conditions of his probation. Griffin has failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that he signed the request under duress. Thus, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b630  In conclusion, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Griffin\u2019s motion to set aside the order modifying the conditions of his probation. The District Court had the authority to modify the conditions of Griffin\u2019s probation pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1011(4), MCA. The original conditions of Griffin\u2019s suspended sentence contemplated the possibility of his participation in ISP. Griffin\u2019s participation in the ISP program ensures his compliance with each of the conditions imposed by the District Court in his sentence. The court\u2019s order does not modify the substance of Griffin\u2019s punishment, and as a result, does not implicate <em>ex post facto, </em>double jeopardy, or due process concerns. On appeal, Griffin bears the burden of proof in demonstrating that the District Court has abused its discretion. Here, he has failed to meet that burden of proof. Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Griffin\u2019s motion to set aside the order modifying the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
