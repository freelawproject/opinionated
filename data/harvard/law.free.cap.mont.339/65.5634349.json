He was asked to submit a breath sample on a Portable Breath Test device and refused. He was then arrested for driving while -under the influence of an intoxicating substance, and transported to the detention center in Missoula where he was asked to submit a breath sample for blood alcohol analysis. Goldsmith\u2019s driver\u2019s license was then taken from him for refusing to submit to testing of his breath to determine alcohol concentration in his blood. His driver\u2019s license was later suspended by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-20\">\u00b62 On June 22,2006, Goldsmith filed a petition in the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, to have his driver\u2019s license restored pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA. The petition was heard on October 26, 2006. At the hearing Goldsmith argued, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>counsel, that Officer Croft did not have the necessary particularized suspicion required to stop him and, therefore, he was not lawfully under arrest and his driver\u2019s license must be restored. A particularized suspicion to justify an investigative stop must be proven with objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences, and a resulting suspicion that a person is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. Whether a particularized suspicion exists to justify an investigative stop is a question of fact which depends on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Morris v. State, </em>2001 MT 13, \u00b6 9, 304 Mont. 114, \u00b6 9, 18 P.3d 1003, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b63 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">THE COURT: Well, there is no question that when Officer Croft saw the vehicle on Arthur and East Central, it appeared to be stopped, and bordering on driving towards the sidewalk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">He then decided to follow the vehicle that was driven by Mr. Goldsmith, and when he followed the vehicle on Maurice Avenue, he noticed the vehicle was coming to almost a stop at each intersection, and finally, to a complete stop on Evans Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">My difficulty in the matter is substituting my judgment for that of the street cop, and what stands out to that officer, and raises flags that there may be a driver who is impaired, and the officer decides to make a stop. I yield to the officer\u2019s experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">And, therefore, I deny the petition to reinstate the driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b64  A petition to reinstate a driver\u2019s license under \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, is a civil action. <em>State ex rel. Majerus v. Carter, </em>214 Mont. 272, 278, 693 P.2d 501, 505 (1984). The District Court made no findings of fact or conclusions of law as required by M. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Nor does the transcript contain sufficient information for this Court to determine the factual and legal basis of the District Court\u2019s decision. Further, no judgment on the petition was entered as provided by M. R. Civ. P. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u00b65  Because no findings of fact, no conclusions of law and no judgment were entered in the District Court, this Court does not have sufficient information upon which to base its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">\u00b66 NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">1. This APPEAL is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE and REMANDED to the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, for entry of findings of fact, conclusions of law and a judgment, as required by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>2. The Clerk of this Court shall mail a copy of this order to the presiding judge of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County, and to all counsel of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">DATED this 5th day of September 2007.</blockquote>\n<judges id=\"b91-5\">/S/ KARLA M.
