We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b62 Hogenson is a construction company located in North Dakota. Hogenson performed construction work in Montana. Montana law required Hogenson to have workers\u2019 compensation coverage for any employees working in Montana. Section 39-71-402(5), MCA. Hogenson maintained coverage in Montana through State Fund and paid premiums for the policy period from July of 2000 through July of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"AgBD\">\u00b63 Hogenson\u2019s policy incorporates all the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation laws of Montana \u201cas fully and completely as if written herein.\u201d The policy requires State Fund to assume Hogenson\u2019s liability \u201cunder the Workers\u2019 Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts of Montana ....\u201d State Fund agrees to defend \u201cclaims and actions which may at any time be instituted against the insured under the Workers\u2019 Compensation or Occupational Disease Acts of Montana....\u201d The policy states that \u201cState Fund has no duty to defend a claim, proceeding or suit that is not covered by this insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">\u00b64 Hogenson interviewed Harold Reynolds (Reynolds) in Oklahoma concerning a work detail in Montana. Hogenson hired Reynolds to assemble a crew to perform work in Glendive, Montana. Reynolds and his crew proceeded to Montana. Reynolds slipped on some ice on January 16,2001, while working for Hogenson at the Glendive job site. Reynolds fell onto his right elbow and injured his right shoulder, back, and lower neck. Reynolds claims that he reported his injury to Hogenson the day of the accident by submitting an Accident Investigation Report to Hogenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u00b65 Hogenson denies receiving notice of Reynolds\u2019s injury on January 16, 2001. Hogenson maintains that it first received notice of Reynolds\u2019s injury and claim more than one year later on July 15, 2002. Hogenson faxed an Employer\u2019s First Report of Injury to State Fund on that same day. State Fund sent both Reynolds and Hogenson a letter on July 16, 2002, denying liability. State Fund denied liability due to Reynolds\u2019s failure to notify his employer of his injury within thirty days as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA. State Fund also denied liability due to Reynolds\u2019s failure to file his claim within twelve months from the date of the accident as required by \u00a7 39-71-601, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">\u00b66 Reynolds filed a complaint in the Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. He filed his complaint by submitting a document labeled Form 3. Form 3 bears the following heading: \u201cEmployee\u2019s First Notice of Accidental Injury and Claim for Compensation.\u201d Reynolds signed the form and dated it July 12, 2002. Reynolds\u2019s Oklahoma counsel, Jack Tracy (Tracy), also signed the form. The filing date stamped on the Form 3 submitted by Reynolds is July 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b67 Tracy notified Hogenson of the Oklahoma claim in a letter dated September 9, 2002. Neither party indicates when or if State Fund received this letter or prior notification from Tracy. State Fund\u2019s records do indicate, however, that State Fund contacted Tracy on September 23, 2002. Tracy called State Fund on September 27, 2002, to inform it that Reynolds would pursue his claim in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b68 Hogenson retained its own Oklahoma counsel, Arlen Fielden (Fielden), to represent it in the Oklahoma workers\u2019 compensation claim. Fielden sent State Fund a letter on January 7, 2005. The letter notified State Fund of the January 13, 2005, trial date for the Oklahoma claim. Fielden attached the Form 3 filed by Reynolds to this letter. Fielden sent another letter by both overnight mail and fax on January 11,2005. The second letter demanded that State Fund defend Hogenson in the Oklahoma case. Fielden urged State Fund to acknowledge coverage and to enter an appearance in the case by January 13, 2005. State Fund did not respond to these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b69 Hogenson moved to join State Fund as a party to the Oklahoma case. The Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction over State Fund. The Oklahoma court awarded Reynolds $22,732. Hogenson appealed. An appellate panel of the Oklahoma Workers\u2019 Compensation Court upheld the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b610 Hogenson filed suit against State Fund in Montana District Court on January 24,2006. The amended complaint sought relief for breach of contract and common law bad faith. The parties filed cross-motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of State Fund. Hogenson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b611 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 18, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 18, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 18. We must determine whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b612 Hogenson argues that State Fund\u2019s refusal to defend Hogenson in Oklahoma frustrates the purposes behind the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Title 39, Chapter 71, MCA. Hogenson asks this Court to construe broadly the insurer\u2019s duty to defend to encompass Reynolds\u2019s claim in Oklahoma. An insurer has a duty to defend unless the claim against the insured unequivocally falls outside the policy coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24. The insurer must resolve any relevant factual disputes in favor of coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24. The insurer looks at facts beyond the allegations in the complaint at the insurer\u2019s risk. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b613 Our decision in <em>Staples </em>reveals that Reynolds\u2019s claim triggered State Fund\u2019s duty to defend unless the claim unequivocally fell outside of the policy coverage. The policy requires State Fund to assume only the \u201cliability of the insured to his employees under the Workers\u2019 Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts of Montana ....\u201d Hogenson\u2019s policy expressly states that \u201cState Fund has no duty to defend a claim, proceeding or suit that is not covered by this insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b614  The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of Montana requires all claimants to present their claims in a signed writing to the employer, insurer, or department within twelve months from the date of the accident. Section 39-71-601, MCA. These requirements are mandatory. <em>Grenz v. Fire and Cas. of Connecticut, 260 </em>Mont. 60, 64, 857 P.2d 730, 732 (1993). We stated in <em>Grenz </em>that \u201ccompliance with the time limits is essential to the action.\u201d <em>Grenz, </em>260 Mont. at 64, 857 P.2d at 732. We have described \u00a7 39-71-601, MCA, as \u201cunequivocally\u201d requiring presentment of claims within twelve months. <em>Grenz, </em>260 Mont. at 63, 857 P.2d at 732. Hogenson\u2019s policy insures it only for liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of Montana. The policy therefore covers only claims presented in writing within twelve months of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b615 Hogenson alleges that it first learned of Reynolds\u2019s injury on July 15, 2002. Hogenson informed State Fund of Reynolds\u2019s injury on that same day. The date on the Form 3 that Reynolds submitted in Oklahoma indicates that he filed his initial complaint no earlier than July 12, 2002. Neither party provides the exact date that State Fund first received notice of this claim. State Fund did have notice of Reynolds\u2019s claim, however, by September 27,2002. Reynolds\u2019s lawyer notified State Fund at that time of Reynolds\u2019s intention to pursue his claim in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b616  Reynolds claims that his injury occurred on January 16,2001. Montana law required Reynolds to present his claim by January 16, 2002. Section 39-71-601, MCA. Hogenson\u2019s policy expressly incorporates Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws. Hogenson\u2019s policy therefore obligates State Fund to defend the claim only if Reynolds had filed it by January 16, 2002. Reynolds filed his claim more than five months after the twelve month deadline. His claim unequivocally fell outside of the policy. State Fund did not have a duty to defend Hogenson under these circumstances. <em>Grenz, </em>260 Mont. at 63, 857 P.2d at 732; <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b617 Hogenson asserts that even if the policy does not cover the claim, State Fund impermissibly resolved this factual issue contrary to Hogenson\u2019s interests. Hogenson cites <em>Staples </em>for the proposition that an insurer must construe factual assertions from the perspective of the insured. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22. Indeed, a reviewing court must construe liberally the allegations of liability set forth in a complaint to resolve any doubts in favor of imposing a duty to defend. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22. Hogenson argues that State Fund should have resolved the factual dispute regarding Reynolds\u2019s notice of injury as imposing a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b618 Hogenson\u2019s dispute, however, concerned only the assertion that it had knowledge of Reynolds\u2019s injury before July 15, 2002. Reynolds submitted his first notice of accidental injury and claim for compensation on July 12, 2002, when he filed the Form 3 \u201cClaim for Compensation.\u201d This filing served as a signed writing claiming benefits and constituted the functional equivalent of a complaint. Form 3 alleged that Reynolds received his injuries on January 16, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b619  Hogenson, Reynolds, and State Fund do not dispute the date of the injury. The parties also do not dispute the filing date of the initial complaint through Reynolds\u2019s filing of the Form 3 in Oklahoma. The lack of dispute surrounding these dates relieved State Fund from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>having to resolve a factual issue. State Fund simply looked at the alleged date of injury and the filing date of the complaint and correctly determined that the claim fell outside the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>Grenz, </em>260 Mont. at 63, 857 P.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b620 Reynolds\u2019s claim, filed after the twelve month limit required by \u00a7 39-71-601, MCA, clearly fell outside Hogenson\u2019s coverage under the policy. We conclude that the belated filing of Reynolds\u2019s claim absolved State Fund of any duty to defend Hogenson in the Oklahoma action.</p>\n<p id=\"AhB\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
