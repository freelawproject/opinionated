We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err when it failed to consider Bullman\u2019s petition for re-designation based on the statutory language of \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005)?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">\u00b64 On October 28,1999, pursuant to a plea agreement, Bullman pled guilty to sexual intercourse without consent with a fifteen-year-old. The District Court sentenced Bullman to ten years, with five suspended, at Montana State Prison (MSP) and designated Bullman a level III sex offender. On March 1, 2005, the District Court revoked Bullman\u2019s suspended sentence after finding that Bullman possessed pornographic materials and failed to complete his sex offender program. Bullman then began serving the remainder of his original ten-year sentence at MSP.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">\u00b65 At the time of Bullman\u2019s sentencing, \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (1999), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">An offender designated as a level 2 or level 3 offender may petition the sentencing court to change the offender\u2019s designation if the offender has enrolled in and successfully completed the treatment phase of either the prison\u2019s sexual offender program or of an equivalent program approved by the department. After considering the petition, the court may change the offender\u2019s risk level designation if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender\u2019s risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has changed since the time sentence was imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">In 2002, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA, to allow only level II sex offenders to petition for a change in risk-level designation. Section 7, Ch. 22, Sp. L. Aug. 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">\u00b66 On October 19, 2006, Bullman petitioned the District Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>reduce his level III sexual offender designation to a level II designation. Bullman\u2019s petition claimed that he successfully had completed sex offender treatment and that MSP counselors supported his re-designation to a level II sex offender. The District Court applied \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005), and denied Bullman\u2019s petition because the statute permitted only sex offenders initially designated as level II offenders to petition for modification. Bullman appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b67 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2006 MT 313, \u00b6 7, 335 Mont. 39, \u00b6 7, 149 P.3d 551, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it failed to consider Bullman\u2019s petition for re-designation based on the statutory language of \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005)?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b69 Bullman contends that the District Court erred when it applied \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005), rather than \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (1999), and denied his petition for re-designation. Bullman claims that the District Court should have applied the earlier statute because Bullman was sentenced under the 1999 version of the code. Further, Bullman argues that the District Court\u2019s ruling violated the constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. Bullman correlates the District Court\u2019s application of the 2005 statute to a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under statutes enacted after an offense has been committed, a process we have held unconstitutional. <em>E.g. State v. Azure, </em>179 Mont. 281, 282, 587 P.2d 1297, 1298 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u00b610 The State counters that the District Court did not err when it applied the 2005 version of the law because the purpose of sex offender designations is to protect the public, not to punish sex offenders. The State relies on our holding in <em>State v. Mount, </em>wherein we held that the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act (the Act) did not violate <em>ex post facto </em>principles because both the intent and effect of the Act were non-punitive. 2003 MT 275, \u00b6 90, 317 Mont. 481, \u00b6 90, 78 P.3d 829, \u00b6 90. Thus, the State contends that, based on <em>Mount, </em>the District Court\u2019s ruling failed to violate <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions. Further, the State analogizes sex offender regulations to motor vehicle or driver\u2019s license regulations and argues that, as with any regulatory scheme, the Act\u2019s requirements and limitations are always subject to change. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>asserts that Bullman must comply with those changes as must other citizens in a regulated society. The State maintains that the District Court did not apply the law retroactively; rather, it applied the correct law based on Bullman\u2019s petition: Bullman filed his petition in 2006, and the District Court applied the then-applicable law-\u00a7 42-23-509(4), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b611 We agree with Bullman that the District Court erred in applying \u00a7 42-23-509(4), MCA (2005). When interpreting statutes, we seek to implement the Legislature\u2019s objectives. <em>Boettcher v. Mont. Guar. Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 393, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 629, \u00b6 19. The statute\u2019s plain language controls our interpretation if we can discern the legislative intent from the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words. <em>Boettcher, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b612  During the 2002 Special Session, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA, and deleted the language granting level III sex offenders the right to petition for a re-designation. Section 7, Ch. 22, Sp. L. Aug. 2002. The Legislature specifically stated that the amendment applies to \u201cconvictions on or after [the effective date of this act].\u201d Section 9, Ch. 22, Sp. L. Aug. 2002. The amendment became effective when it was approved on August 21, 2002. Section 8, Ch. 22, Sp. L. Aug. 2002. Thus, the plain language of \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2003), when construed with its applicability provision, stands for the proposition that level III sex offenders convicted on or after August 21, 2002, may not petition for re-designation of their sex offender status. The District Court sentenced Bullman on February 15, 2000, and thus, the amended statute does not apply to preclude Bullman\u2019s petition. We conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing Bullman\u2019s petition based on \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b613 We reverse and remand to the District Cotut based on the plain language of \u00a7 46-23-509(4), MCA (2003), regarding the statute\u2019s applicability, and thus, we do not reach the parties\u2019 <em>ex post facto </em>arguments. Bullman contends that he has met the clear and convincing standard, and he requests that we change his sex offender designation. We refuse to comment on the merits of Bullman\u2019s petition. We conclude only that Bullman has the right to petition the courts for re-designation; the District Court must determine whether Bullman qualifies for re-designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b614 We reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
