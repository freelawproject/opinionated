He argues that his right to due process was violated because he was not advised of the maximum sentence he could be subject to when he admitted to the offense of sexual assault. He also alleges that the imposition of an adult sentence after his case was transferred from Youth Court to District Court violated his right to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\u00b63 However, we conclude that the dispositive issue is whether the District Court erred in revoking Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation and committing him to the Department of Corrections (DOC) based on a violation of conditions not contained in the court-approved stipulation which transferred this case from Youth Court to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A1R\">\u00b64 On March 15, 2000, the State filed a formal petition in the Yellowstone County Youth Court alleging Andersen-Conway, who was thirteen years old at the time, was a delinquent youth because he had committed the offense of sexual assault. Andersen-Conway subsequently admitted the allegations in the petition. On October 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>2000, the Youth Court adjudicated him a delinquent youth and placed him on probation, with the requirement that he complete outpatient sexual offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b65 Andersen-Conway did not complete treatment as ordered. In 2002, the State filed a petition to revoke his probation. Andersen-Conway admitted to the violations alleged in the petition, and on July 18,2002, the Youth Court held a dispositional hearing. The Youth Court ordered that Andersen-Conway be committed to the DOC until he was 18, recommended placement at Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until successful completion of its sex offender program, and ordered that if Andersen-Conway failed to complete the treatment program, he would be required to register in the sexual offender registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b66 Andersen-Conway was placed at Pine Hills. He was making progress in the sex offender treatment program there; however, he was unable to complete the program before reaching age 18. On May 6, 2004, his eighteenth birthday, he was released from Pine Hills because he had \u201caged out\u201d of the facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b67 The State and Andersen-Conway entered into a stipulation to transfer supervisory authority over him from Youth Court to District Court, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA. The stipulation, dated May 13, 2004, states that the District Court retains jurisdiction over Andersen-Conway until he reaches age 25. It also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">[T]he purpose for this transfer of supervisory responsibility is to successfully complete an approved course of sex offender treatment, and that supervision may be discontinued upon successful completion. Further, that the Youth does not have to register as a sex offender for the period of time the Youth is in an approved sex offender treatment program. The original order to register will become effective if the Youth fails to successfully complete a sex offender treatment program prior to his twenty-fifth birthday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The stipulation placed no other conditions or restrictions on Andersen-Conway. The District Court added to the bottom of the stipulation the words \u201cAPPROVED and ORDERED this 17th day of May, 2004,\u201d and the District Court judge signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\u00b68 On June 3,2004, Andersen-Conway signed a form containing the standard conditions of probation adopted by the DOC. The form also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>listed other conditions of probation that were purportedly ordered by the District Court. However, as noted above, the District Court had not placed any conditions on Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation other than requiring that he complete treatment before age 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b69 On April 26, 2005, the State filed a petition to revoke Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation, alleging that he had been terminated from sex offender treatment and was violating other conditions of probation, including the requirements to seek and maintain employment and obey all laws. Later, the State filed an additional petition to revoke based on continuing and additional violations of the standard conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b610 On January 4, 2006, Andersen-Conway filed a motion to dismiss the revocation petition, arguing that the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over him ended when he turned 19 in May 2005, the extension of supervision until age 25 constituted double jeopardy, the transfer to District Court violated his right to a jury trial, and the transfer stipulation was valid only until his nineteenth birthday. In April 2006, the State filed a third petition to revoke, alleging on-going violations of the DOC\u2019s standard conditions of probation. On May 2, 2006, the District Court denied his motion to dismiss. On June 1, 2006, Andersen-Conway appeared before the District Court and admitted to the alleged violations of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b611 At the dispositional hearing, held July 20, 2006, Andersen-Conway\u2019s counsel noted in passing that the stipulation transferring authority to the District Court included \u201cno terms of a suspended sentence or a commitment to DOC.\u201d Nevertheless, the District Court committed Andersen-Conway to the DOC until May 5, 2011 (the day before he turns 25), for placement in an appropriate facility or program. He now appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss and the imposition of an adult sentence following the revocation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b612 We review a sentence for legality. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b613 The dispositive issue before the Court is whether the District Court erred in revoking Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation and committing him to DOC based upon conditions not ordered by the District Court in its order of May 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b614  Generally, this Court will not address arguments not raised or supported by the parties themselves. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6. However, we have \u201ch[e]ld that a serious error which appears on the face of [the] record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>reviewable, although not presented by the parties\u201d if ignoring the error would cause substantial injustice. <em>Kudrna v. Comet Corp., </em>175 Mont. 29, 51, 572 P.2d 183, 195 (1977). We have also noted that, \u201c \u2018[conventional notions of finality of litigation have no place where life or liberty is at stake and infringement of constitutional rights is alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kills On Top v. State, </em>279 Mont. 384, 400, 928 P.2d 182, 192 (1996) (quoting <em>Sanders v. U.S., </em>373 U.S. 1, 8, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 1073 (1963)). Andersen-Conway is subject to incarceration as a result of the District Court\u2019s order revoking his probationary sentence and committing him to the DOC. We have held that incarceration of an individual pursuant to a facially invalid sentence represents a grievous wrong, and a miscarriage of justice that warrants relief even if the defendant is otherwise procedurally barred. <em>Lott v. State, </em>2006 MT 279, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 270, \u00b6 22, 150 P.3d 337, \u00b6 22. Because we must conclude that the District Court erred in revoking Andersen-Conway's probation and, most importantly, in committing him to the DOC until he is 25 years of age, we raise and decide the dispositive issue <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b615 The Montana Youth Court Act provides that youth courts have original jurisdiction over cases involving persons under the age of 18. Section 41-5-203(1), MCA. A youth court may, on motion by the youth or the county attorney, transfer its supervisory authority over a case to district court. Section 41-5-208(1), MCA. Such a transfer terminates the youth court\u2019s jurisdiction and confers jurisdiction on a district court until the youth reaches age 25. Sections 41-5-205(2)(a), 41-5-208(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b616 The parties to a youth court case may also stipulate to the transfer of a case to district court, and the district court judge may approve and incorporate the stipulation into an order. If the parties stipulate to the transfer approved by the court, both the State and the youth are bound by the terms of the stipulation. <em>In re H.C.R., </em>2007 MT 64, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 336 Mont. 369, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 155 P.3d 1221, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Further, a district court errs if it does not require the State to abide by the conditions of such a stipulation and if it does not sentence a youth in accordance with the stipulation. <em>H.C.R., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b617 In this case, as <em>inH.C.R., </em>the parties stipulated to the transfer of the case from the Youth Court to the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, and the District Court approved and ordered the probationary sentence contained in the stipulation. The stipulation referred back to the July 18, 2002 disposition, which committed the youth only until age 18 and ordered that the only consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>failing to complete treatment was the requirement to register as a sex offender. The District Court order, which is in effect a sentence, provides that \u201cthe original order to register will become effective if the Youth fails to successfully complete a sex offender treatment program prior to his twenty-fifth birthday.\u201d Plainly, the stipulation placed only one condition on Andersen-Conway. That is, he is required to complete sex offender treatment before he turns 25, and if he does not, the sanction is that he will be required to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b618  Because Andersen-Conway is not yet 25, he has not violated the condition of his probation that he complete sex offender treatment. The standard conditions of probation promulgated by the DOC were imposed here not by the District Court, but by the DOC. The Department cannot add conditions to those articulated in a district court\u2019s judgment. <em>State v. Field, </em>2000 MT 268, \u00b6 15, 302 Mont. 62, \u00b6 15, 11 P.3d 1203, \u00b6 15. The District Court did not have the authority to revoke Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation because he did not abide by the conditions of probation added by the DOC after the sentence. In addition, the District Court had no authority to commit Andersen-Conway to the DOC, which resulted in his incarceration. By the District Court\u2019s own order, it had only the authority to require him to register as a sex offender if he does not complete treatment. Thus, we conclude that the District Court erred when it revoked Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation and committed him to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s judgment revoking Andersen-Conway\u2019s probation and committing him to the Department of Corrections is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> Youth correctional facilities such as Pine Hills only have statutory authority to provide services to youth who are age 10 or older, but younger than age 18.
