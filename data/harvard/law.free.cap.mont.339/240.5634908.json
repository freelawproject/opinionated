We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court apply the correct statutory criteria in terminating C.B.\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">\u00b64 II. What are the proper statutory criteria to be applied on remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b65 C.B. and her children first became involved with the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services (CFS) on a voluntary basis, due to C.B.\u2019s entanglement with drugs and an abusive boyfriend. Several months later, CFS removed the children from C.B.\u2019s home based on a tip that she was planning to flee the state with them. C.B. subsequently entered into a rehabilitation program at the Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC), which she did not successfully complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b66 CFS submitted a petition for adjudication that the children were youths in need of care and temporary legal custody (TLC). C.B. stipulated to the petition, and the District Court approved it without a hearing. The children were removed from their first foster home and placed with C.B.\u2019s maternal relatives. C.B. voluntarily began to get treatment and therapy, though no formal court-approved treatment plan was in place. The court-appointed special advocate (CASA) recommended increased, unsupervised visitation for C.B. All parties were working towards the goal of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b67 Regrettably, before that reunification could occur, C.B. was incarcerated again for a parole violation. C.B. was sentenced to seven months in prison for driving without liability insurance. C.B.\u2019s maternal relatives could no longer care for the children, and CFS placed them with a foster family seeking to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b68 Eight months after first removing the children from their home, CFS finally presented a treatment plan for C.B. to the District Court. The plan contained no less than six primary goals and twenty-two tasks and subtasks. The plan did not contain any timelines or deadlines. Each task was scheduled to start \u201cimmediately,\u201d and where an expected and actual completion date should have been listed, each task was simply classified as \u201congoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b69 C.B. objected to the plan on the grounds that it required her to undergo a neuropsychological evaluation. C.B. later withdrew this objection, and stipulated to the treatment plan. The District Court approved the treatment plan in December 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b610 C.B. was released from prison shortly after, and began work on the court-ordered treatment plan. At a meeting with CFS in February, C.B.\u2019s attorney raised concerns about C.B.\u2019s ability to complete the complicated plan without more assistance from CFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b611 Dr. Jacqueline Day examined C.B. in March. Following the exam, but before Dr. Day issued her report, a hearing was held on CFS\u2019s petition to extend TLC of the children. At the hearing, C.B. objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>that that a number of the tasks required by CFS were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AM9\">\u00b612 Dr. Day finally issued her report in April. Dr. Day diagnosed C.B. with mild to moderate cerebral dysfunction. As a result of this dysfunction, C.B. has severe deficits in vocabulary and auditory learning skills, and milder deficits in visual learning and interpretation of social cues. Dr. Day also reported that C.B. suffers from verbally-based learning disabilities, and has the reading comprehension skills of a fifth grader. Additionally, C.B. was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and paranoid and schizoid personality traits.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b613 Dr. Day recommended additional services that CFS could provide to C.B. to address her individual needs. She specifically advised that C.B. would be more successful if CFS provided her with written instructions, checklists, and reminders. Following Dr. Day\u2019s diagnosis of C.B.\u2019s cognitive disabilities, no alteration was made to the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b614 In July 2006, less than six months after the treatment plan was approved by the District Court, CFS filed a petition to terminate C.B.\u2019s parental rights, and award CFS permanent legal custody with the right to consent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b615 Four months later, the District Court conducted a hearing on the petition for termination of parental custody. In a post-hearing brief, C.B. again raised her objection that the treatment plan was too onerous, and that CFS did not provide her with adequate support. On December 28, 2006, the District Court issued an order terminating C.B.\u2019s parental custody. It is from this order which she appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 28, \u00b6 22, 168 P.3d 629, \u00b6 22. In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we consider \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re </em>K.J.B., \u00b6 22 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b617  A parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re </em>K.J.B., \u00b6 22. <em>See also In re A. T., </em>2003 MT 154, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 255, \u00b6 10, 70 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 10 (internal citations omitted). Thus, \u201cbefore terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, a district court must adequately address each applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>statutory requirement.\u201d <em>In re A.T., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b618 In order to satisfy these statutory requirements, the district court must make specific factual findings. <em>In re </em>\u00b6 23. We review these findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 23. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 23. Finally, the party seeking to terminate parental rights must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been met. <em>In re A.T., </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b619 I. Did the District Court apply the correct statutory criteria in terminating C.B.\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b620 Since the children were adjudicated youths in need of care, \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, provides the necessary criteria for terminating the parent-child relationship in the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">(1) The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence [that]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\u00b621 The District Court cited \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, in its opinion, but failed to make the specific factual findings required by the statute: namely, that C.B. did not comply with an appropriate treatment plan, and that her conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Instead of applying \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, the District Court relied on the legal presumption that termination is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">After considering all of the evidence in this case, as summarized above, the Court finds that it is uncontroverted that the children need permanency, and soon. There is a legal presumption that termination is appropriate in cases where children have been in foster care of [sic] 15 of the last 22 months. There is insufficient evidence here to rebut that presumption. To the contrary the clear and convincing evidence directs a finding that it is in the best interest of the children to accomplish permanency by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>terminating [C.B.\u2019s] parental rights and freeing the children for adoption by the Bates\u2019. The Court finds that the department has made reasonable efforts to accomplish alternatives, but that these efforts have been continually frustrated by [C.B.\u2019s] inability to follow through. Almost all of [C.B.\u2019s] failures were caused by cognitive and psychological problems that are not her fault and might be overcome by long term therapy and massive outside support for [C.B.]. Tragically, the children cannot wait to find out if these goals can ever be accomplished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b622 Section 41-3-604, MCA, provides that when a child has been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months, \u201cthe best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.\u201d Section 41-3-604, MCA. However, the procedures by which parental rights are terminated are governed by \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, not \u00a7 41-3-604, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b623  We have held that \u201cthe presumption in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, neither eliminates the substantive requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, nor diminishes the clear and convincing burden of proof on the party seeking termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>In re B.H., </em>2001 MT 288, \u00b6 29, 307 Mont. 412, \u00b6 29, 37 P.3d 736, \u00b6 29. Here, the presumption in favor of termination applies, but it does not excuse the District Court from making the specific statutory findings required by \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, or relieve the State from meeting its high burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b624  The District Court\u2019s reliance on this presumption impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to C.B. It is well-established that the party seeking termination bears the burden of proof to show by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination are satisfied. <em>See e.g. In re B.H., </em>\u00b6 16 (internal citations omitted). Yet the Court effectively shifted that burden from the State to C.B. by concluding that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence here to rebut that presumption.\u201d It was not C.B.\u2019s duty to rebut the presumption, but rather the State\u2019s duty to show by clear and convincing evidence that C.B. failed to complete an appropriate treatment plan, and that C.B.\u2019s conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s factual findings do not specifically address whether the treatment plan was appropriate, whether C.B. completed the treatment plan, or whether her condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Instead, the District Court\u2019s factual findings are centered on whether CFS made \u201creasonable efforts to accomplish alternatives.\u201d Under \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA, the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>is relevant to abuse and neglect proceedings, in preventing the removal of a child or in working towards reunification of a family separated by the state. While the question of whether CFS did or did not make reasonable efforts may be relevant in the instant case, it does not replace the two-prong statutory inquiry mandated by \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. Similarly, it does not relieve the State from meeting its burden of proof, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b626 Because a parent\u2019s right to custody of her children is fundamental, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re </em>K.J.B., \u00b6 22. In the instant case, those procedural safeguards are found in \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. Thus, the district court must adequately address each statutory requirement by making specific factual findings. <em>In re A.T., </em>\u00b6 10; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 23. Here the District Court failed to make specific findings under either \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f)(i) or (ii), MCA. Instead, the District Court improperly relied on the \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, presumption in favor of termination and the finding that the State had made reasonable efforts under \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b627  We conclude that the District Court erred by applying the wrong statutory standards to assess whether C.B.\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. Thus, the District Court\u2019s order terminating C.B.\u2019s parental rights must be reversed, so that the proper statutory criteria may be applied and considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b628 II. What are the proper statutory criteria to be applied on remand?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b629 Before parental rights can be terminated, the State must present clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to comply or failed to succeed at an appropriate, court-ordered treatment plan, and that the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. \u201cIn the context of termination of parental rights cases, we have defined clear and convincing evidence as simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof.\u201d <em>In re F.M., </em>2002 MT 180, \u00b6 48, 311 Mont. 35, \u00b6 48, 53 P.3d 368, \u00b6 48 (internal citations omitted). To provide the district courts with explicit guidance in applying the statutory criteria set out in \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, we discuss each prong of the test individually below.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b630 A. First prong: compliance with an appropriate treatment plan</p>\n<p id=\"AMP\">\u00b631 Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(i), MCA, directs the court to consider whether \u201can appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful.\u201d Thus, the first determination the court must make is whether there is an \u201cappropriate\u201d treatment plan in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b632 This Court has rejected any single, generalized definition of an \u201cappropriate\u201d treatment plan, \u201cbecause no bright line definition is possible in light of the unique circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>2000 MT 35, \u00b6 26, 298 Mont. 237, \u00b6 26, 995 P.2d 427, \u00b6 26. Instead, we consider a number of factors including: whether the parent was represented by counsel, whether the parent stipulated to the plan, and whether the plan \u201ctakes into consideration the particular problems facing both the parent and the child.\u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27. <em>See also In re A.A, </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 127, \u00b6 21, 112 P.3d 993, \u00b6 21. Even if the parent is represented by counsel and stipulates to the plan, these two factors alone do not establish that the plan was appropriate. <em>Matter of Custody and Parental Rights of M.M., </em>271 Mont. 52, 57, 894 P.2d 298, 301 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b633 The law places the burden on the State-not the parent-to prove that the treatment plan is appropriate by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re </em>A.N., \u00b6 24. Further, the State has a duty to act in good faith in developing and executing a treatment plan to preserve the parent-child relationship and the family unit. <em>In re A.A., </em>\u00b6 20; <em>In re A.T., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 24. The State\u2019s burden to ensure appropriateness and duty to act in good faith does not end once the court has approved a treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b634 Where the case involves a disabled parent or child, it is especially important to determine whether the plan \u201ctakes into consideration the particular problems facing both the parent and the child.\u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>\u00b6 27. While each case is unique, we have held that treatment plans must be customized to meet the needs of disabled parents. For example, in <em>In re J.B.K., </em>CFS specifically took the mother\u2019s disability into account in administering the treatment plan. 2004 MT 202, \u00b6 28, 322 Mont. 286, \u00b6 28, 95 P.3d 699, \u00b6 28. CFS recommended that the mother repeat classes to ensure she retained the information, and enrolled her in a special needs parenting program where she received one-on-one instruction tailored to her individual abilities. <em>In re J.B.K., </em>\u00b6 28. In another case, CFS recommended that the parents undergo psychiatric evaluations before the plan was developed, so it could be tailored to fit their needs. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b635 The fact that a parent is not diagnosed with a disability until after the plan is in place is not necessarily fatal. In <em>Custody of M.M., </em>we held that a treatment plan was appropriate for a father, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>it was written before his limited mental capacity was diagnosed. 271 Mont. at 60, 894 P.2d at 303. In that case the father\u2019s social workers and service providers testified that they were aware of his special needs, and adjusted the plan to meet them. <em>Custody of M.M., </em>271 Mont. at 58, 894 P.2d at 302. There must be clear and convincing evidence which shows that the plan either anticipated the disabled parent\u2019s or child\u2019s special needs or was modified to address the special needs after they were diagnosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b636 In weighing the appropriateness of a treatment plan, the courts must also inquire whether the plan contains reasonable timelines or deadlines. While each treatment plan is different, our review of cases over the years indicates that most treatment plans are divided into multiple phases of a specific duration, and that the tasks are assigned specific deadlines. <em>See e.g. In re J.W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6 11, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 11, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 11 (specifying four goals to be completed within a six-month period); <em>In </em>re A.N., \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 19 (consisting of three successive phases, each lasting ninety days, each with a progressively increasing number of goals and tasks); <em>In re A.T., \u00b6 </em>19 (identifying three goals and seven tasks for the father to complete within six months).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b637 The lack of deadlines in any treatment plan gives CFS a great deal of unchecked discretion in determining whether the parent has satisfactorily complied with the plan. In light of the fundamental liberty interest a parent has in the custody of their children, due process requires the inclusion of a timeline for completion of goals and tasks in a treatment plan. Where a parent suffers from a disability, CFS has a special duty to assist him or her in prioritizing and scheduling the tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b638 B. Second prong: conduct or condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b639 Next, the District Court must evaluate whether the parent\u2019s conduct or condition rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(ii), MCA. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA, provides the courts with guidance in applying the second prong of the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">(2) In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parents is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>care. In making the determinations, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">(c) excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b640  At this stage of the inquiry, the District Court may properly take the statutory presumption favoring termination into consideration. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA, provides that \u201c[i]n considering any of the factors in subsection (2) in terminating the parent-child relationship, the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.\u201d Section 41-3-604, MCA, provides that when a child has been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months, \u201cthe best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.\u201d Section 41-3-604, MCA. Thus, since the children here had been in foster care for more than fifteen of the last twenty-two months, the District Court properly found that the children\u2019s best interest outweighed the likelihood that C.B. would change within a reasonable amount of time. As stated above, however, that presumption alone is not a sufficient basis to terminate parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\u00b641  We hold that the District Court did not apply the correct statutory criteria required by \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, when it terminated C.B.\u2019s parental rights. The District Court should have inquired whether the State had shown by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that C.B. failed to comply or succeed with an appropriate, court-ordered treatment plan, and (2) that her conduct rendering her an unfit parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order terminating C.B.\u2019s parental rights and remand the case for application of the proper criteria set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. In determining whether C.B.\u2019s plan was appropriate, the District Court must take into consideration whether the plan adequately addressed C.B.\u2019s disabilities by, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>things, setting reasonable deadlines and providing her with the support required by law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
