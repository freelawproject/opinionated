Potts (Potts), an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Montana, objects to the Statement of Costs filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) on May 29, 2007, stemming from the disciplinary proceeding against Potts before the Commission on Practice of the Supreme Court of the State of Montana (the Commission). Potts also requests a hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel pursuant to Rule 9A(8), Montana Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (MRLDE), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Potts, </em>2007 MT 81, 336 Mont. 517, 158 P.3d 418. We deny Potts\u2019s objections to ODC\u2019s Statement of Costs. We grant Potts\u2019s request for a hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel regarding the reasonableness of ODC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b62 Potts misapprehends the scope and application of the MRLDE. He suffers from the misimpression that M. R. App. P. 33 and related Montana statutes control the issue of costs imposed as part of the discipline and sanction by the Court for Potts\u2019s violation of various provisions of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). We take this opportunity to disabuse Potts, specifically, and all members of the Bar, generally, of the proper application and interpretation of the MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b63 The Commission entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations on January 5,2006, regarding a complaint filed against Potts. The Commission concluded that Potts violated Rules 1.2(d) and 3.3(a)(2) of the MRPC during his representation of heirs in a will contest. The Commission recommended that this Court publicly censure Potts and suspend him from the practice of law for a period of thirty days. The Commission further recommended that the Court order Potts to pay the \u201ccosts of these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b64 We adopted the Commission\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, but we elected to revise the recommended discipline and sanction. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-80. We chose to impose a public censure, without any suspension, along with the costs of the disciplinary proceedings before the Commission as the appropriate discipline and sanction for Potts\u2019s violation of the MRPC. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 80 and 82. We censured Potts at a public session of this Court on May 2, 2007. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 81. Potts chose not to make any statement to the Court at the censure; he instead elected to have his counsel address the Court. Potts\u2019s counsel assured the Court that Potts accepted the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b65 We further directed ODC to assemble and serve upon Potts an itemized list of the costs and expenses incurred in this matter. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82. ODC filed its Statement of Costs on May 29, 2007. Potts\u2019s acceptance of the Court\u2019s decision at his public censure apparently did not include the Court\u2019s decision to impose costs as part of the discipline and sanction pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE. Potts timely filed his objection to the costs on June 8, 2007, and at the same time requested a hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b66 Potts presents the following objections to ODC\u2019s Statement of Costs:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b67 1. That ODC failed to claim costs within a timely manner as required by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and \u00a7 25-10-503, MCA; and</p>\n<p id=\"AY4\">\u00b68 2. That ODC improperly included costs not contemplated by \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b69 Our order in <em>Potts </em>directed Potts to \u201cpay, or make arrangements to pay, the costs of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82. We further directed ODC to assemble and serve upon Potts an itemized lists of the \u201ccosts and expenses\u201d incurred in this matter. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82. ODC assembled and served upon Potts its Statement of Costs on May 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b610 ODC requested costs of $10,388.96, including $7,553.55 for ODC, and $2,835.41 for the Commission. ODC\u2019s requested costs include travel, lodging, and meals for ODC investigation in Great Falls and for the hearing in Great Falls before the Commission on July 27, 2005. ODC\u2019s requested costs also include the costs of depositions, fees for professional services provided by several lawyers, and copying charges. ODC\u2019s requested costs for the Commission include the transcript of the hearing and travel expenses to Great Falls for the hearing for participating Commission members.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b611 Potts argues first that M. R. App. P. 33 governs costs in all civil cases. M. R. App. P. 33(d) provides that costs should be taxed pursuant to \u201cMontana Code Annotated, sections 25-10-101, 25-10-102, 25-10-103, and 25-10-105.\u201d Section 25-10-501, MCA, and \u00a7 25-10-503, MCA, in turn, set forth the process by which a party may claim costs in a civil action at the district court and on appeal. Section 25-10-501, MCA, provides that a party must serve a bill of costs within five days after the decision of the district court. Section 25-10-503, MCA, provides a 30-day window in which a party must file a bill of costs on appeal. As a result, Potts contends that ODC had to claim costs within five days if the Court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s recommendation in <em>Potts </em>constituted an original proceeding, and within thirty days if the Court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s recommendation in <em>Potts </em>constituted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b612 Potts points to the fact that we issued our decision in <em>Potts </em>on March 22,2007, and that ODC did not file its Statement of Costs until May 29, 2007. He suggests that our decision in <em>Delaware v. K-Decorators, Inc., </em>1999 MT 13, \u00b6 71, 293 Mont. 97, \u00b6 71, 973 P.2d 818, \u00b6 71, holds that ODC\u2019s untimely claim of costs waives its right to receive costs. <em>Delaware </em>simply stands for the proposition that a party must file a memorandum of costs within five days after the jury returns its verdict. <em>Delaware, </em>\u00b6 66. Here, of course, ODC did not seek its costs following a jury trial. ODC instead filed its Statement of Costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>as directed by the Court in <em>Potts. Delaware, </em>and its five-day rule, has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b613 ODC filed its memorandum in opposition on June 28,2007. ODC counters that the time limits in \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and \u00a7 25-10-503, MCA, do not apply to disciplinary proceedings before the Commission. ODC argues instead that Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, controls the assessment of costs in disciplinary proceedings. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b614 We declared in <em>Potts </em>that this Court \u201c \u2018possesses original and exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility under Article VII, Section 2(3) of the 1972 Montana Constitution and the provisions of Chapter 61, Title 37, Montana Code Annotated, in addition to its inherent jurisdiction, in all matters involving admission of persons to practice law in the State of Montana, and the conduct and disciplining of such persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 31 (quoting Introduction, MRLDE). We specifically adopted and promulgated the MRLDE in 2002 in the exercise of this jurisdiction. Introduction, MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b615 We rejected a similar attempt to limit the ability of the ODC to prosecute lawyer disciplinary complaints in <em>In the Matter of Joseph Engel, III, </em>2007 MT 172, 338 Mont. 179, 169 P.3d 345. Engel argued that the MRLDE did not allow for our review of ODC\u2019s objection to the Commission\u2019s decision unless ODC first sought reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s decision under Rule 14, MRLDE. We explained, however, that Rule 14\u2019s limitation of our review to matters that had been reconsidered by the Commission did not apply to formal complaints submitted by ODC. <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 20. The apparent ambiguity cited by Engel originated out of the former disciplinary rules that existed before we made \u201cglobal changes to the lawyer disciplinary system that became effective in July 2002.\u201d <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b616 Potts misplaces reliance on M. R. App. P. 33 as the authority for including costs of the proceedings before the Commission as part of the discipline and sanction imposed against him. M. R. App. P. 33 generally governs costs in civil cases and focuses on costs being awarded to the \u201csuccessful party\u201d in the underlying litigation. Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, by contrast, specifically allows for the assessment of \u201cthe cost of the proceedings, investigations and audits\u201d as a form of discipline and sanction to be imposed against the disciplined lawyer. We did not award \u201ccosts\u201d to ODC as the \u201csuccessful party\u201d in the underlying litigation pursuant to M. R. App. P. 33. The Court instead imposed costs against Potts pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, as part of the discipline and sanction against Potts for his violation of various provisions of the MRPC. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u00b617 Potts\u2019s argument founders when set against the plain language of Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, regarding the imposition of costs. Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, provides no time limit for the filing of a statement of costs by ODC. The only time limit imposed relates to the written objections filed by the lawyer who is the subject of the disciplinary proceedings. Our order in <em>Potts </em>likewise contains no time limit regarding the filing of the statement of costs by ODC. The order simply parrots the language in Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, regarding the time limit by which Potts could file written objections. <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b618 Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, makes no reference to \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, and \u00a7 25-10-503, MCA. It would be anomalous indeed to allow a statute never mentioned anywhere in the MRLDE to limit the scope of the discipline and sanction permitted by Rule 9(A)(8). In fact, to do so would contradict and render meaningless certain provisions of Rule 9(A)(8). For example, Rule 9(A)(8) allows the Court to impose discipline in the form of \u201c[ajssessment of the cost of the proceedings, investigations and audits.\u201d Section 25-10-201, MCA, makes no mention of costs including \u201cinvestigations and audits.\u201d Potts\u2019s position would prevent the Court from imposing a sanction against a lawyer that included the cost of the investigations and audits undertaken to develop and prosecute the disciplinary complaint. Nothing in Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, hints of such a prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b619 Potts also challenges ODC\u2019s claims for fees for professional services provided by Taleff Law Office, P.C. (Taleff), and Crowley, Haughey, Hanson, et. al (Crowley). Our unpublished order in <em>In the Matter of Flaherty, </em>No. 03-147 (Nov. 9, 2004), unnecessarily muddied the waters on this issue. Flaherty objected to the Commission\u2019s Bill of Costs to the extent that it claimed $7,889.85 in fees for professional services provided by a private lawyer. Flaherty contended that the MRLDE made no provision for the payment of fees for professional services. We agreed and concluded that the term \u201ccosts,\u201d as used in the MRLDE, should be interpreted consistently with \u201ccosts\u201d as used in the Montana Code. Although not binding as an -unpublished order, we nevertheless take this opportunity to distinguish, and to the extent necessary, overrule our conclusion in <em>Flaherty </em>that the Court may not impose attorney\u2019s fees as a form of discipline and sanction pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b620 ODC retained Dennis P. Clarke (Clarke) as special counsel to investigate and prosecute the complaint against Flaherty. The Commission\u2019s appointment or recruitment of a private lawyer to serve as \u201cinvestigator\u201d constituted routine practice before our adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>revised MRLDE in 2002. <em>See e.g., Goldstein v. Commission on Practice, </em>2000 MT 8, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 493, \u00b6 11, 995 P.2d 923, \u00b6 11. Rule 5(7), MRLDE, similarly authorizes this practice. In fact, Rule 5(7), MRLDE, refers to the duty of ODC to use, appoint, and supervise \u201cspecial investigators and volunteer special counsel\u201d when circumstances necessitate their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b621 ODC apparently used Clarke in one of these two capacities in <em>Flaherty. </em>Clarke investigated the complaint against Flaherty and ultimately prosecuted it in a hearing before the Commission. The Commission determined that Flaherty had violated Rule 1.8(a) and Rule 1.8(b), MRPC, and recommended that Flaherty be suspended for 90 days, that he be publicly censured, and that he pay \u201cthe reasonable costs of the proceedings in this matter before the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b622 The Court adopted the Commission\u2019s recommendations \u201cin their entirety.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Patrick F. Flaherty, </em>No. 03-147 (Oct. 6, 2004). Flaherty objected to the fees for professional services included in the Commission\u2019s statement of costs on the grounds that Rule 9, MRLDE, did not expressly include the term \u201cattorney\u2019s fees.\u201d We noted that Montana statutes distinguish between \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d and \u201ccosts,\u201d and thus the term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in Rule 9, MRLDE, also must not include attorney\u2019s fees. This result disregards the fact that Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, authorizes the \u201c[a]ssessment of the cost of proceedings, investigations and audits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b623 The reasoning in <em>Flaherty </em>would preclude the Court from imposing the cost of investigations and the costs of any audits. It strains the imagination how ODC could prosecute a complaint without conducting an investigation, and, occasionally, an audit of financial statements or other data. Rule 5(7), MRLDE, expressly authorizes ODC to use \u201cspecial investigators\u201d for these purposes. Nothing in Rule 5(7), MRLDE, prevents ODC from paying these special investigators for their services. We did not intend the MRLDE to tie ODC\u2019s hands in deciding what resources could be assigned to evaluate and prosecute a complaint. In fact, we left it to ODC\u2019s discretion to use outside investigators and counsel \u201cwhen circumstances necessitate their use.\u201d Rule 5(7), MRLDE. We likewise did not intend the MRLDE to limit the Court\u2019s options in choosing the appropriate discipline or sanction as Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, covers the waterfront in terms of acceptable forms of discipline. And we surely did not intend for \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, to limit the options provided by Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, as the rule makes no mention of this statute, or any other statute for that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">\u00b624 Moreover, the result in <em>Flaherty </em>conflicted directly with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>decision in <em>In re Johnson, </em>2004 MT 6, \u00b6 26, 319 Mont. 188, \u00b6 26, 84 P.3d 637, \u00b6 26, where we directed the disciplined lawyer to \u201cpay his pro rata share (one-fifth) of the costs incurred by the Commission associated with the prosecution of this matter and the other cases referred to above, in accordance with the attached statement of the Secretary of the Commission on Practice.\u201d The attached statement of the Commission\u2019s Secretary included professional fees for the special counsel. <em>See also In re Wenz, </em>2004 MT 7, \u00b6 27, 319 Mont. 200, \u00b6 27, 87 P.3d 376, \u00b6 27 (same); <em>In re Marra, </em>2004 MT 8, \u00b6 27, 319 Mont. 213, \u00b6 27, 87 P.3d 384, \u00b6 27 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b625  These decisions comport with Rule 5(7)\u2019s authorization to ODC to \u201cuse, appoint, and supervise\u201d private investigators. As noted in <em>Goldstein, </em>the Commission referred routinely to outside counsel as \u201cinvestigators\u201d under the former version of the disciplinary rules. <em>Goldstein, </em>\u00b6 11. We conclude that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, in no way limits or constrains the Court\u2019s options in imposing discipline or sanctions pursuant to Rule 9, MRLDE. Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, authorizes the Court to impose discipline or sanctions that include fees for professional services. To the extent that our order <em>in Flaherty </em>suggests otherwise, we overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b626 Here Potts argues that ODC listed a representative from Taleff and Crowley as witnesses, but called only Mick Taleff to testify. Potts further asserts that Mr. Taleff appeared at the hearing without a subpoena and thus ODC incurred no witness fees in connection with his testimony. ODC\u2019s Statement of Costs lists an expense for professional services from Taleff for services rendered on February 25, 2005. The Commission conducted Potts\u2019s hearing on July 27-28,2005. ODC\u2019s Statement of Costs similarly lists expenses for professional services from Crowley for services rendered on May 31,2005, June 30, 2005, and July 31,2005. None of these dates correspond with the dates of Potts\u2019s hearing. We are left to assume that ODC did not incur these expenses for witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b627  Rule 5, MRLDE, sets forth ODC\u2019s powers and duties in investigating and prosecuting lawyer disciplinary matters before the Commission. In particular, Rule 5(7), MRLDE, directs ODC to \u201cappoint and supervise\u201d special investigators for the performance of prosecutorial functions when circumstances necessitate their use. It is unclear whether the professional services rendered by Taleff and Crowley relate to investigations conducted by Taleff and Crowley as part of ODC\u2019s prosecution of this matter before the Commission. Rule 5(7), MRLDE, authorizes ODC to retain outside investigators to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>in the prosecution of a disciplinary proceeding when circumstances necessitate their use. We cannot evaluate on the record before us for what purpose ODC used Taleff and Crowley. The Adjudicatory Panel must make these assessments in the first instance following a hearing. Potts must pay the reasonable costs of these professional services, however, to the extent that they relate to \u201cthe cost of proceedings, investigations and audits,\u201d as described in Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b628 We turn then to Potts\u2019s remaining claim that ODC included other items in its Statement of Costs not authorized by our order in <em>Potts </em>or by Rule 9, MRLDE. In particular, Potts takes issue with ODC\u2019s claims for investigative costs on the grounds that our order in <em>Potts </em>referred only to the \u201ccosts of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d Potts also argues that ODC cannot recover for the travel expenses for the participating Commission members to the hearing in Helena on July 27 and 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b629 We first address Potts\u2019s challenge to ODC\u2019s claim for investigative costs. Rule 9, MRLDE, covers discipline and sanctions. Rule 9 provides for nine possible forms of discipline. Rule 9(A) specifically provides that the discipline \u201cmay take one or more of the following forms.\u201d These possible forms of discipline range from disbarment, to private admonition, to assessment of costs. Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b630 We opted in <em>Potts </em>to impose several forms of discipline, including a public censure and the imposition of \u201cthe costs of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82. Potts clings to the Court\u2019s use of the term \u201ccosts\u201d to argue that ODC cannot recover the costs of investigations and audits in this case. Potts contends that we \u201cspecifically limited\u201d ODC to recover only \u201ccosts.\u201d Potts conveniently ignores the very next sentence of <em>Potts </em>in which we direct ODC, pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, to assemble and serve upon Potts \u201can itemized list of the costs and expenses incurred in this matter.\u201d <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b631 Moreover, Rule 9(A)(8), provides for the \u201c[assessment of the cost of the proceedings, investigations and audits.\u201d Rule 5(11), MRLDE, likewise directs ODC to assemble and serve on the disciplined lawyer \u201can itemized list of the costs of proceedings, investigations and audits\u201d whenever <em>\u201ccosts </em>have been assessed against a lawyer by the Supreme Court.\u201d (Emphasis added). It appears that the MRLDE opted for the more generic term \u201ccosts\u201d when referring to the potential \u201c[assessment of the cost of proceedings, investigations and audits\u201d contained in Rule 9(A)(8). We assessed \u201ccosts\u201d in <em>Potts, </em>\u00b6 82, and these costs comprise the costs of the proceedings, investigations and audits. Rule 9(A)(8), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b632 Potts contends nevertheless that our omission of the terms \u201cinvestigations and audits\u201d from our order in <em>Potts </em>represents the law of the case and precludes ODC from seeking to recover the expenses associated with these matters. Potts cites to <em>Muri v. Frank, </em>2003 MT 316, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. 269, \u00b6 11, 80 P.3d 77, \u00b6 11, for the proposition that \u201ca prior decision of this Court resolving an issue between the same parties is binding and may not be relitigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b633 The law of the case doctrine expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen matters already decided. <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>283 Mont. 169, 175, 939 P.2d 998, 1001 (1987). The law of the case binds the parties, however, regarding only those issues that the Court previously has decided. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>2007 MT 146, \u00b6 27, 337 Mont. 449, \u00b6 27, 162 P.3d 87, \u00b6 27. Potts\u2019s law of the case argument thus relies upon his claim that we somehow elected to limit the matters for which ODC could recover to the \u201ccosts of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d Once again Potts seeks to limit the Court\u2019s discretion in imposing the appropriate discipline and sanction in a manner not contemplated by Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE. <em>See also </em>Rule 5(11), MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b634 Potts finally takes issue with the amount that ODC claims for travel expenses for the participating Commission members to the hearing in Helena on July 27 and 28, 2005. ODC requested $700.41 for these expenses, including mileage, food, and accommodations. Potts first claims that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, does not allow for such costs. He further argues that the Commission must have heard other matters during its time in Helena for Potts\u2019s hearing. As a result, Potts suggests, without citing any particular authority, that it would be \u201cneither fair nor proper to allocate such costs to this proceeding.\u201d He suggests that the Commission\u2019s expenses should be pro rated among the other lawyers who had their disciplinary proceeding before the Commission on those same days.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b635 We quickly dispense with Potts\u2019s claim that \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, does not allow the Court to impose the Commission\u2019s travel expenses as a discipline and sanction for Potts\u2019s violation of various provisions of the MRPC. As we discussed previously, Rule 9, MRLDE, sets forth the available range of discipline and sanctions that the Court may impose in a lawyer disciplinary proceeding. Section 25-10-201, MCA, in no way limits or constrains the Court\u2019s options in imposing discipline or sanctions pursuant to Rule 9, MRLDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b636 We turn then to Potts\u2019s dispute with the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Commission's travel expenses sought by ODC. The record indicates that the following Commission members participated in Potts\u2019s hearing: Chairman John Warren, Tracy Axelberg, Jan Brown, James F. Jacobsen, Carey E. Matovich, Arthur J. Noonan, and Mary Jo Ridgeway. All of the participating members, except for Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Jacobsen, live outside.Helena. The record further indicates that Potts\u2019s hearing convened at 1:30 p.m. on July 27, 2005. The proceedings adjourned at 5:05 p.m. on that day. The Commission reconvened on July 28, 2005, at 9:00 a.m., and the hearing concluded at 4:10 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b637 The participating Commission members would have needed lodging for the night of July 27, 2005. ODC seeks lodging expenses of $60 per night plus tax. The costs for the five non-Helena members would be $300 plus tax. All seven participating members would be entitled to food expenses for both days of the hearing. These food costs, at the rate of $23 per day, would be $322. The combined costs of lodging and food totals more than $622, which leaves less than $80 for mileage for the participating members at a rate of $0,445 per mile. Chairman Warren lives in Dillon, Commissioner Axelberg lives in Kalispell, Commissioner Matovich lives in Billings, Commissioner Noonan lives in Butte, and Commissioner Ridgeway lives in Miles City. Nothing in the MRLDE gives Potts the right to select Commission members only from the community in which the hearing will be held in order to defray costs. We deem Potts\u2019s objections to these Commission travel expenses to border on frivolous and a waste of the Court\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b638 We further remind Potts\u2019s counsel that M. R. Civ. P. 11, although not directly applicable to disciplinary proceedings, provides that a lawyer\u2019s signature on a pleading constitutes a certification that the signer \u201chas read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d The Court questions whether Potts\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s travel expenses could pass this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">THEREFORE IT IS ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b639 1. Potts\u2019s objection to ODC\u2019s Statement of Costs as being untimely filed is DENIED;</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b640 2. Potts\u2019s objection to ODC\u2019s inclusion in its Statement of Costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>items not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, is DENIED;</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\">\u00b641 3. Potts\u2019s request pursuant to Rule 9(A)(8), MRLDE, for a hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel is GRANTED to the extent that the Adjudicatory Panel shall consider the reasonableness of the amount requested by ODC for each category. The Adjudicatory Panel shall not evaluate the propriety of each category requested by ODC as we have determined that issue in this Order and our determination on the merits constitutes the law of the case. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b642 4. It is further ordered that ODC shall assemble and serve upon Steven T. Potts an updated itemized list of costs for consideration by the Court following the hearing before the Adjudicatory Panel. The updated itemized list of costs shall include the costs of the proceedings, investigations and audits incurred by ODC and its retained representatives in preparation for, and during, the hearing before the Adjudicatory Panel regarding Potts\u2019s objections to ODC\u2019s original Statement of Costs. Steven T. Potts shall then have 10 days thereafter to file written objections and, if he desires, to request a second hearing before an Adjudicatory Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b643 5. The Clerk of this Court is directed to mail copies of this Order to Steven T. Potts by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by ordinary mail to Steven T. Potts\u2019s attorney, the Chairman and the Secretary of the Commission on Practice, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana, and by electronic transmission to all Clerks of the District Courts of the State of Montana and to all District Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">DATED this 18th day of September, 2007.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-7\">/S/ BRIAN MORRIS</judges>\n<judges id=\"b220-8\">/S/ JOHN WARNER</judges>\n<judges id=\"b220-9\">/S/ JIM RICE</judges>\n<judges id=\"b220-10\">/S/ JOHN C.
