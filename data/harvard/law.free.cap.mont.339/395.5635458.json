We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in denying Fender a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b63 On December 3, 2004, Fender was charged in Lewis and Clark County with Partner or Family Member Assault for injuring her daughter, in violation of \u00a7 45-2-206, MCA. The court appointed counsel to represent Fender, and she requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b64 The trial was held in Justice Court on May 17,2005. The morning of the trial, the prosecutor made a motion in limine to preclude Fender from offering jury instructions on the defense of parental discipline permitted under \u00a7 45-3-107, MCA, because her counsel did not file the notice of this affirmative defense as required by \u00a7 46-15-323(2), MCA. The Justice Court granted the motion in limine, and the jury convicted Fender. She appealed her conviction to the District Court and requested a new trial, arguing she was denied effective assistance of counsel because her attorney did not properly raise a parental discipline defense. The District Court affirmed the judgment of the Justice Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and she now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. The underlying claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Trull, </em>2006 MT 119, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 332 Mont. 233, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 136 P.3d 551, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in denying Fender a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b67 Both Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee the right to effective assistance of counsel. To determine whether a defendant received effective assistance of counsel at trial, this Court applies the two-pronged test set forth <em>in Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 6, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 6. Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant bears the burden to show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell short of the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that there is a reasonable probability counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the outcome of the case. <em>Swan v. State, </em>2006 MT 39, \u00b6 16, 331 Mont. 188, \u00b6 16, 130 P.3d 606, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b68 The Court engages in \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within a wide range of reasonable professional conduct.\u201d <em>Hendricks, </em>\u00b6 7 (citations omitted). A \u201cmere conclusory allegation\u201d that counsel\u2019s tactics were ineffective is insufficient to overcome this strong presumption. <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 30, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 30, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 30 (citations omitted). Further, a defendant does not prove ineffective assistance simply because counsel did not pursue a particular defense if the defense had no merit or factual basis. <em>State v. Mahoney, </em>264 Mont. 89, 101, 870 P.2d 65, 73 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b69 On direct appeal, we generally address ineffective assistance of counsel claims only if they are record based claims, rather than non-record claims. <em>State v. Meyers, 2007 </em>MT 230, \u00b6 9, 339 Mont. 160, \u00b6 9, 168 P.3d 645, \u00b6 9. The key inquiry in determining if an action is non-record is whether \u201cthe record fully explain[s] <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20. ^Typically, counsel\u2019s failure to prepare a particular defense is a non-record based claim that we do not address on direct appeal. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18. If defendant raises a non-record argument, we will dismiss the claim without prejudice, and the defendant may raise the issue instead in a post-conviction proceeding where she can more fully develop the record to demonstrate counsel's ineffectiveness. <em>Meyers, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b610 In rare instances, however, we may conclude counsel was ineffective even if the record does not explain why counsel chose a particular tactic if there is \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 50, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 50, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 50. In <em>Jefferson, </em>we concluded that no justification could exist when counsel admitted his client\u2019s guilt on one of the charges during opening and closing arguments. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 50. Similarly, we have also concluded that there is no justification when counsel fails to request a jury instruction informing jurors to view accomplice testimony with distrust. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 292 Mont. 350, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 972 P.2d 321, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b611 In this case, nothing in the record or the Appellant\u2019s brief indicates why counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the parental discipline defense. As we stated in <em>Mahoney, </em>counsel was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to use this defense in Fender\u2019s case unless there was some basis for raising it. In fact, Appellant offers nothing more than a \u201cmere conclusory allegation\u201d that counsel should have raised the defense, without offering any facts to show the defense might have had merit. <em>Grixti, </em>\u00b6 30. Such a conclusory allegation is clearly not sufficient to overcome the strong presumption under the <em>Strickland </em>test that counsel\u2019s performance was sufficient. Thus, on the basis of the facts before us, we cannot say that counsel failed to meet the level of competence required.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b612  However, because this appeal is based on counsel\u2019s alleged error in not raising a defense, it is a non-record error more appropriately raised in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 18. Although Appellant attempts to liken her case to <em>Jefferson </em>and asserts no justification could exist for counsel\u2019s failure to raise the parental discipline defense, her reliance on <em>Jefferson </em>is misplaced. Unlike <em>Jefferson, </em>where no trial strategy could justify counsel\u2019s actions, Fender\u2019s counsel could easily be justified in not raising the parental discipline defense, particularly if, as stated above, the facts do not support it. Unless Fender presents facts in a post-conviction proceeding, not on the recordihere, that show the defense of parental discipline had some merit, she will not be able to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b613  We conclude the District Court did not err in denying Fender\u2019s request for a new trial based on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\"> While district courts generally conduct trial de novo on an appeal from a Justice Court, pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-311(1), MCA, the Lewis and Clark County Justice Court is a court of record. Therefore, the District Court in this cases was limited to review of the record and questions of law. Section 3-10-115(1), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
