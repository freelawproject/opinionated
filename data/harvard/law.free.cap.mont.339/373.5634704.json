Dudleys\u2019 3,000-square-foot shop did not violate a restrictive covenant limiting lot use within the parties\u2019 subdivision to residential use. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows: Did the District Court err in concluding that the shop on the Dudleys\u2019 lot did not violate the subdivision\u2019s restrictive covenant mandating that \u201c[n]o lot shall be used for any purpose except residential use\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b63 The Lincoln West Subdivision (the subdivision) is a 10-lot subdivision located in Lincoln County, Montana, near the town of Libby. On October 20, 1983, the subdivision\u2019s developers (William L. Anderson, Karen M. Anderson, and Fred D. Wolff) filed the subdivision\u2019s Declarations of Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions (restrictive covenants) with the Lincoln County Clerk and Recorder. Most relevant to this appeal is paragraph 6 of the restrictive covenants, which states: \u201cNo lot shall be used for any purpose except residential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b64 In 1994, Micklon purchased Lot 6 of the subdivision. The Dudleys purchased Lots 3 and 4 in 2004. Lot 3 was a vacant field at the time. Situated on Lot 4 was a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house, with an attached two-car garage. After purchasing Lots 3 and 4, the Dudleys constructed what the District Court termed \u201ca mammoth shop\u201d on Lot 3. The court described the shop, which is the only structure on Lot 3, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">The shop is 50\u2019 x 60\u2019 feet, or 3,000 square feet, not counting a loft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>which adds approximately another 840 square feet of interior space. The shop is sided with steel and is windowless. Inside the building is located a 36\u2019 x 60\u2019 garage, a 14\u2019 x 20\u2019 office/TV room, a 10\u2019 x 14\u2019 bathroom, a 14\u2019 x 20\u2019 wood shop/parts room. The garage area is accessed from the outside by two 14\u2019 tall garage doors. One bay of the garage has a \u201cwalk under pit\u201d to allow servicing a motor home from underneath, and the other bay has a hydraulic lift, which allows smaller vehicles to be hoisted into the air for servicing. The loft houses a \u201cgun room,\u201d where Mr. Dudley loads ammunition and stores guns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The court noted that \u201cthere is a fairly steady flow of traffic from friends dropping by the shop to visit and occasionally to have Mr. Dudley assist them in working on their vehicles.\u201d The court also noted that the area around the shop is landscaped with trees, shrubs, and a raised garden area.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b65 On June 21,2005, Micklon, along with George \u201cDoc\u201d Sargent and Patricia Sargent (who were the owners of Lot 2) filed suit in the District Court. They sought an order requiring the Dudleys to remove the shop from Lot 4 and permanently enjoining the Dudleys from violating the restrictive covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b66 On July 8, 2005, the Dudleys filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied on August 31, 2005. The Dudleys subsequently filed an answer and counterclaim on September 19, 2005, asserting that Micklon and the Sargents were in violation of a number of the restrictive covenants themselves. The District Court held a bench trial on May 2, 2006, and issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment on May 4,2006. The court noted that the Dudleys \u201chave more vehicles than their attached two-car garage could possibly house.\u201d Specifically, the court found that the Dudleys had \u201cat least three \u2018regular\u2019 vehicles, a large motor home, two ATVs, and a dune buggy.\u201d The court also found that the shop was not serving a commercial purpose and that the shop qualified as a \u201cresidential use,\u201d given that the Dudleys were actively using the shop in conjunction with their residential dwelling on Lot 4. The court concluded, therefore, that the shop did not violate paragraph 6 of the restrictive covenants. The District Court also concluded that Micklon was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>violation of the restrictive covenants. This appeal by Micklon followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjI\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a); <em>Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Commerce, </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 18, 333 Mont. 169, \u00b6 18, 142 P.3d 797, \u00b6 18. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if the findings are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or when a review of the record leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Denton, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>Sunday v. Harboway, </em>2006 MT 95, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 104, \u00b6 17, 136 P.3d 965, \u00b6 17; <em>In re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 28, 331 Mont. 208, \u00b6 28, 130 P.3d 619, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the shop on the Dudleys\u2019 lot did not violate the subdivision\u2019s restrictive covenant mandating that \u201c[n]o lot shall be used for any purpose except residential use\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b610 When interpreting documents containing restrictive covenants, we apply the same rules of construction as are applied to contracts. <em>Milltown Addition Homeowner\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Geery, </em>2000 MT 341, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 195, \u00b6 11, 15 P.3d 458, \u00b6 11. We read the restrictive covenants as a whole in order to ascertain their meaning. <em>Newman v. Wittmer, </em>277 Mont. 1, 6, 917 P.2d 926, 929 (1996); \u00a7 28-3-202, MCA. Furthermore, the language of the covenants is to be understood in its ordinary and popular sense. <em>Hillcrest Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Wiley, </em>239 Mont. 54, 56, 778 P.2d 421, 423 (1989); \u00a7 28-3-501, MCA. At the same time, however, restrictive covenants are to be strictly construed. <em>Higdem v. Whitham, </em>167 Mont. 201, 208-09, 536 P.2d 1185, 1189-90 (1975) (observing that \u201c[t]he overriding policy <em>of </em>individual expression in free and reasonable land use dictates that restrictions should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>aided or extended by implication or enlarged by construction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b611 Where the language used is plain and unambiguous, the language governs our interpretation. <em>Milltown, </em>\u00b6 11. Here, there is no serious contention that the language of paragraph 6, \u201cno lot shall be used for any purpose except residential use,\u201d is ambiguous. The Dudleys refer to this language at one point as \u201cvague\u201d; however, they offer no argument that the language is \u201csusceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings.\u201d <em>See Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 41, \u00b6 20, 164 P.3d 851, \u00b6 20. Accordingly, we will proceed to apply the language as written. In this regard, we note that the construction and interpretation of paragraph 6 is a question of law. <em>See Baker Revoc. Trust, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b612 Micklon offers a sole argument in support of his claim that the District Court erred in concluding that the Dudleys\u2019 shop did not violate paragraph 6: Based on our holding in <em>Hillcrest, </em>a shop built on a lot, <em>without a dwelling house on the same lot, </em>violates a restrictive covenant limiting the lot\u2019s use to residential purposes. Micklon contends that <em>Hillcrest </em>leaves no \u201cwiggle room\u201d for the District Court to conclude that the Dudleys\u2019 shop did not violate paragraph 6. The Dudleys respond that the District Court correctly determined that their shop was residential in use and that substantial evidence existed at the time of trial to support this finding. The Dudleys claim that the shop is \u201can important and continually used residential building to the Dudleys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b613 In support of its conclusion that the Dudleys\u2019 shop did not violate paragraph 6, the District Court cited and discussed two cases in which this Court held that structures similar to the Dudleys\u2019 shop <em>did </em>violate restrictive covenants \u2014 Hillcrest and <em>Tipton v. Bennett, </em>281 Mont. 379, 934 P.2d 203 (1997). In <em>Hillcrest, </em>the defendants constructed a steel-sided garage on their subdivision lot and the homeowners\u2019 association sued to enforce a restrictive covenant stating \u201c[n]o lot shall be used except for single family residential purposes, only one residence per lot and no lot shall be subdivided.\u201d <em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont. at 55, 778 P.2d at 422. Although the defendants planned on constructing a residence on the lot in addition to the garage, this was never accomplished. <em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont at 55, 778 P.2d at 422. In light of the covenant restricting lot usage to \u201csingle family residential purposes,\u201d we concluded that \u201ca garage, by itself, is not consistent with \u2018single family residential purposes\u2019 when the garage is not used in conjunction with a residential dwelling\u201d on the same lot and that the defendants had violated the restrictive covenants by building the garage and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>failing to build, within a reasonable time thereafter, a residential dwelling to accompany the garage. Hillcrest, 239 Mont. at 57, 778 P.2d at 423. In reaching this conclusion, we observed that \u201ccourts have held that a garage built on a lot without a dwelling house <em>on the same lot </em>violates a restrictive covenant when the covenant specifically limits a lot\u2019s use to \u2018residential purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont. at 56, 778 P.2d at 423 (emphasis added). We then quoted, with approval, the following passage from a Washington Court of Appeals case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201cA private garage is a proper appurtenance necessary to the enjoyment of a dwelling house and does not violate a \u2018for residence purposes only\u2019 covenant [cites omitted]. However, if the garage is placed on an adjoining lot, it is no longer deemed to be appurtenant and does violate such a restriction even though used in connection with a residence on an adjoining lot [cites omitted].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2or\"><em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont at 57, 778 P.2d at 423 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Sandy Point Improvement Co. v. Huber, </em>613 P.2d 160, 163 (Wash. App. 1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b614 In <em>Tipton, </em>the defendants purchased six lots and constructed a 3,200-square-foot storage building on one of the lots. <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 380, 934 P.2d at 204. The plaintiffs sued, claiming the structure violated a restrictive covenant requiring \u201c[t]hat the real property hereof shall be used strictly for residential purposes and no business, trade or manufacture of any sort or nature shall be conducted thereon.\u201d <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 380, 934 P.2d at 204. While the defendants described the building as a large garage, the district court found that \u201cit looked like a storage building rather than a residential garage.\u201d <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 381, 934 P.2d at 204. In <em>Tipton, </em>we took into account <em>Hillcrest </em>and <em>Sandy Point </em>and affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the storage building violated the restrictive covenant. <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 382-83, 934 P.2d at 205. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF-\">With or without a residence, a 3,200 square foot storage building is not an appurtenance necessary to the enjoyment of a dwelling house. The building violates the covenant, not only because it stands alone without a dwelling, but also due to the fact that a 3,200 square foot storage building is not consistent with \u201cresidential purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 383, 934 P.2d at 206. Thus, under <em>Hillcrest, Tipton, </em>and the language of paragraph 6, the Dudleys\u2019 shop had to be an appurtenance necessary to the enjoyment of a dwelling house and, in addition, had to be located on the same lot as that dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"A1_x\">\u00b615 The District Court, however, viewed the dispositive issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>somewhat differently. Specifically, given our statement in <em>Hillcrest </em>that <em>\u201ca </em>garage, by itself, is not consistent with \u2018single family residential purposes\u2019 when the garage is not used <em>in conjunction with a </em>residential dwelling,\u201d Hillcrest, 239 Mont. at 57, 778 P.2d at 423 (emphasis added), and our statement in <em>Tipton </em>that \u201ca 3,200 square foot storage building is not <em>an appurtenance necessary to the enjoyment of a dwelling house,\u201d Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 383, 934 P.2d at 206 (emphasis added), the District Court stated that \u201c[t]he question here is whether the Dudleys\u2019 use of lot 3 is sufficiently different from the uses [at issue in <em>Hillcrest </em>and Tipton] to justify a different result.\u201d In this regard, the court determined that the Dudleys\u2019 shop was \u201cactively incorporated into the Dudleys\u2019 daily routine\u201d and \u201cthere is nothing in the covenants to prevent the Dudleys from owning many vehicles and from having a state of the art facility in which to service those vehicles.\u201d On this basis, the court concluded that the Dudleys\u2019 shop was \u201cactively \u2018used in conjunction with a residential dwelling\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 382, 934 P.2d at 205), and, thus, was \u201can appurtenance\u201d to the Dudleys\u2019 residence. The court acknowledged that the Dudleys\u2019 shop was nearly the same size as the storage building in <em>Tipton, </em>but the court distinguished the shop as being \u201cnot just an amorphous \u2018large storage building\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Tipton, </em>281 Mont. at 382, 934 P.2d at 205). Thus, the court concluded that the shop did not violate the \u201cresidential use\u201d restriction contained in paragraph 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b616 However, in reaching this conclusion, the District Court overlooked our agreement, in <em>Hillcrest, </em>with the following two rules of law: \u201ca garage built on a lot without a dwelling house <em>on the same lot </em>violates a restrictive covenant when the covenant specifically limits a lot\u2019s use to \u2018residential purposes,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont. at 56, 778 P.2d at 423 (emphasis added), and a garage that is used in connection with a residence is not appurtenant to that residence \u201c \u2018if the garage is placed <em>on an adjoining </em>lot,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillcrest, </em>239 Mont at 56, 778 P.2d at 423 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Sandy Point, </em>613 P.2d at 163). Here, the Dudleys\u2019 shop stood alone on Lot 3, while their residential dwelling was located on the adjoining Lot 4. Under the rules set out in <em>Hillcrest, </em>this is a plain violation of paragraph 6, which states: \u201cNo lot shall be used for any purpose except residential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b617 The District Court\u2019s contrary conclusion that the Dudleys\u2019 shop had a \u201cresidential use\u201d rested entirely on the shop\u2019s association with the Dudleys\u2019 residential dwelling; in other words, the court made no finding that the shop, on its own, served a residential purpose. However, under <em>Hillcrest, </em>because the shop was located on its own lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>without an accompanying dwelling, it had to serve a residential purpose independent of the Dudleys\u2019 dwelling on an adjoining lot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject the Dudleys\u2019 argument that because their 3,000-square-foot shop is used in conjunction with their residential dwelling-though admittedly located on an adj oining lot-their situation is distinguishable from that in <em>Hillcrest </em>and warrants a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b618  In short, we conclude that the District Court erred in its determination that the Dudleys\u2019 shop does not violate paragraph 6 of the restrictive covenants limiting lot use to \u201cresidential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b619  We hold that when a restrictive covenant limits a subdivision lot\u2019s use to \u201cresidential use,\u201d a non-residential structure that is placed on that lot without an accompanying residential dwelling on the same lot violates the covenant, notwithstanding the fact that the structure is used in conjunction with a residential dwelling on an adjoining lot. Accordingly, because the Dudleys\u2019 shop was constructed on a lot unaccompanied by a dwelling house on the same lot, the District Court erred in concluding that the shop did not violate the subdivision\u2019s restrictive covenant limiting all lots to \u201cresidential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-T\">\u00b620 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> In its pretrial order dated April 13, 2006, the District Court stated that \u201cPlaintiff Sargent has sold his lot and no longer has standing to be a party Plaintiff,\u201d and in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment, the court noted that \u201c[Sargent] is no longer a party to the lawsuit.\u201d Presumably, the court\u2019s reference to \u201cSargent\u201d includes both George \u201cDoc\u201d Sargent and Patricia Sargent.
