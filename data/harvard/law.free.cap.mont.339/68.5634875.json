We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to law enforcement officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from her apartment and vehicle?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u00b63 On the evening of March 14, 2005, law enforcement officers responded to a report of underage drinking at Munson\u2019s apartment in Corvallis, Montana. Outside Munson\u2019s apartment, the officers encountered George Snell, who appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine. They discovered that Snell was on probation, interviewed him, and placed him under arrest. During an interview following his arrest, Snell alleged that he had seen evidence of methamphetamine use in Munson\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u00b64 At approximately 3:00 p.m. the following day (March 15, 2005), Detectives Jason Basnaw and Perry Johnson of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office (collectively, \u201cthe Officers\u201d) went to Munson\u2019s apartment building to follow up on Snell\u2019s allegation. The ensuing events were tape-recorded by the Officers, and a transcript of that recording is part of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">\u00b65 The Officers knocked on Munson\u2019s door. Munson\u2019s five-year-old son, Chase, opened the door and left it open while he went to get Munson. Standing at the doorway, Basnaw saw what he thought might be paraphernalia for the packaging of methamphetamine or small amounts of dangerous drugs in the living room. When Munson came to the door, Basnaw told her that he would \u201c[l]ike to visit with ya\u2019 for a minute if we could\u201d \u201cabout uh, that situation last night with Geroge Snell over here.\u201d Johnson asked Munson if he and Basnaw could come in, but Munson responded that \u201cactually my daughter\u2019s, I\u2019m just puttin\u2019 her down for a nap can you come back-------?\u201d Basnaw declined, stating: \u201cWell actually I don\u2019t have time. Um, I need to visit with ya\u2019 right now.\u201d Munson then let the Officers into the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">\u00b66 Basnaw asked Munson if she had had any methamphetamine in the apartment the previous night and if she had any drugs in the apartment at present. Munson replied \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. Basnaw then asked if Munson would consent to a search of the apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Munson twice replied, \u2018No.\u201d Next, Johnson asked Munson if she would consent to a search of her body. Munson again said, \u201cNo.\u201d Johnson asked Munson why she wouldn\u2019t give the Officers a urine sample and why she wouldn\u2019t allow them to search her home, and Munson explained, \u201cBecause George [Snell] doesn\u2019t hang out here or nothin\u2019, you know, I don\u2019t even hardly know him,\u201d and because \u201cI just don\u2019t fell [sic] that it\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b67 At this point, Johnson, who knew Munson when she was a young girl and also knew Munson\u2019s father in his (Johnson\u2019s) \u201cprofessional capacity,\u201d began questioning Munson about her lifestyle. He stated that he was \u201creally proud\u201d of her father because \u201conce he got his arms around whatever problems he had he got on with the rest of his life.\u201d Johnson told Munson that \u201cI want you to get on with the rest o\u2019 your life and I don\u2019t want ya\u2019 to do what you\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d He opined that she was at \u201ca fork in the road\u201d and stated that he wanted her to \u201cchoose wisely.\u201d Johnson also stated, \u201cI know that, that you\u2019re worried about what we\u2019re gonna\u2019 find if we shake your house down\u201d; thus, he told Munson that he and Basnaw were not there \u201cto threaten ya\u2019 or to beat ya\u2019 up or any o\u2019 that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b68 Johnson asked Munson, \u201cHow do you suggest that we resolve this? Are you lookin\u2019 for some help? You wanta\u2019 get on with it or do you wanta\u2019 keep goin\u2019 the way you been goin\u2019?\u201d Munson replied, \u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d Johnson inquired, \u201cIf you wanted to uh, if you wanted to quit right now the, the way you\u2019ve been livin\u2019 and change your life how would you do that?\u201d Munson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Johnson asked whether Munson thought she needed rehab and whether her parents might help her, at which point the transcript reflects that Munson was crying. The following dialogue then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Here\u2019s what I, I want you to know this. Here\u2019s what we didn\u2019t come here and do. We didn\u2019t come here and take that Miranda card out and tell you this. You have the right to remain silent and all o\u2019 that stuff. Right? And we didn\u2019t come here to threaten ya\u2019 or talk mean to ya\u2019. We came here because we\u2019re both dads and neither one of us guys is perfect I\u2019ll tell ya\u2019 that. And, and you know, we don\u2019t live right next door to ya\u2019 but this community\u2019s so small Julia we\u2019re still neighbors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>I know hhh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>And what affects you affects us and that\u2019s why the SherrifPs were [sic] last night \u2018cause that affected us. So is there some way that, that we can help you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>I\u2019m sure there is but I don\u2019t know------------hhh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Detective Johnson: </em>\u2018Kay. Well let\u2019s talk about your kids then for a minute. You wanta\u2019 raise \u2018em?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Do you think this is the way to do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Um, hmm. (Affirmative)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Well then how ya\u2019 gonna\u2019, how ya\u2019 gonna\u2019 manage that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\"><em>Julia </em>Munson:------------</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>\u2018Kay. Well I agree with ya\u2019. I don\u2019t think this is the way to raise \u2018em either. You know, worried about who\u2019s knockin\u2019 at the door, havin\u2019 \u2018em spend their time over at the neighbor\u2019s place. I\u2019d sure rather see \u2018em bein\u2019 held by their mom and her getting \u2018em to kindergarten and stuff like that. Chase go to kindergarten yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Yeah? Goes in the morning or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Yeah in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Yeah? You take him or does he just walk down there himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>I take him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Do ya\u2019? \u2018Kay. So have you got crank in this house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>How come we can\u2019t search it then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-17\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>\u2018Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-18\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>\u2018Cause why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-19\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>I have paraphernalia ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-20\">Munson also admitted that she had used methamphetamine during the previous twenty-four hours. Thereafter, Johnson stated that \u201cwe want that stuff and that\u2019s why we came\u201d; however, Munson insisted, again, that she didn\u2019t have any. Significantly, the Officers did not advise Munson of her rights under <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), before or at any point during this exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-21\">\u00b69 Despite the fact that Munson had neither consented to a search of her home nor been informed of her right to refuse to consent to a search of her home, Basnaw then presented Munson with a Consent to Search form. Basnaw explained that the form \u201cjust says that your, you\u2019re uh, having been informed of your right to refuse a search of your um, of your house,\u201d you \u201cauthorize the above member of Ravalli County Sheriffs Office to remove any letters, documents, papers, materials or other property which are considered pertinent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>investigation.\u201d In this regard, Basnaw stated that he was \u201cconcerned about meth and meth paraphernalia. Um, anything having to do with meth.\u201d Lastly, Basnaw indicated that by signing the form, Munson would be \u201cknowingly and voluntarily giv[ing] [her] consent to search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Auo\">\u00b610 Munson asked whether signing the Consent to Search form gave the Officers permission to search her whole apartment. Johnson answered affirmatively. Munson then indicated that she would retrieve the paraphernalia for them, and she reiterated that there was no methamphetamine in the apartment for them to find. Therefore, Munson asked, \u201cI have to sign this?\u201d to which Johnson replied, \u201cYeah. But here\u2019s why.\u201d Johnson then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Is because you have the right to refuse and what Jase [Basnaw] just told ya\u2019 I believe but I need to make sure that you believe it. We\u2019re not gonna\u2019 go and open your refrigerator. We\u2019re not gonna\u2019 look at your underwear. We\u2019re not gonna\u2019 do that stuff. But here\u2019s what we will do. When you leave this room...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Um, hmm. (Affirmative)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>...we\u2019ll follow you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Um, hmm. (Affirmative)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>\u2018Kay? And, and that\u2019s because we do have a family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>And because some people wanta\u2019 hurt us. \u2018Kay? So that\u2019s what the deal is. We\u2019re not gonna\u2019 toss your house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4b\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Okay. Hhhh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>But we still need to, to know that you understand that you don\u2019t have to sign that. And if you sign it you\u2019re doing it voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>And so if I don\u2019t sign it I can\u2019t even take you to the paraphernalia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Right, right. If you don\u2019t sign it here\u2019s what happens. We\u2019re gonna\u2019 get up and we\u2019re gonna\u2019 go out that door. We\u2019re gonna\u2019 leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>(Cough)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>And this is the deal Julia. This is the fork in the road. And today you\u2019re gonna\u2019 decide where you\u2019re gonna\u2019 be tomorrow and, and to be real honest with ya\u2019 today is March 15th. The decision you make today is gonna\u2019 determine where your children are raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-16\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>(Sniff)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Munson then signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b611 Munson and the Officers walked through the apartment, and she pointed out various pieces of paraphernalia, including a glass pipe with white residue, a Ziploc bag with white residue, two bongs, a glass vial, and five pill capsules. After the Officers had completed the search of Munson\u2019s apartment, they advised her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Basnaw also conducted a search of Munson\u2019s vehicle at some point during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b612 Munson started crying again and became upset when, having been under the impression that she would only be issued a citation for having the paraphernalia, Basnaw told her that he was going to arrest her, that someone would have to come and be with her children, and that the Department of Family Services would probably become involved. Munson called her father to take the children, and the Officers placed her under arrest. According to the transcript, Basnaw terminated the interview at \u201c16:45,\u201d which indicates that the Officers were at Munson\u2019s apartment building for approximately one hour and forty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b613 On March 28, 2005, the State charged Munson with criminal possession of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine), a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(1), (5), MCA, criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b614 Munson filed a motion to suppress \u201cany and all statements\u201d she had made to the Officers on the ground that she had been \u201cinterrogated while in custody without first being advised of her constitutional rights as required by <em>[Miranda].\u201d </em>She argued that her \u201cfreedom was significantly restricted by the detectives\u201d and that \u201cthe detectives ... persisted in their questioning until they forced Munson to make incriminating statements.\u201d Munson also moved to suppress \u201cany and all evidence\u201d collected from her person, residence, and automobile \u201cbecause the consent to search was not given freely and voluntarily as required by <em>[Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S. Ct. 2041 (1973)].\u201d She contended that \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances of the case at hand reveal that [her] consent to search was ... the product of coercive and lengthy interrogation tactics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b615 The State filed a response, Munson filed a reply, and the District Court held a suppression hearing. On September 13, 2005, the District Court issued an order denying Munson\u2019s motion. With respect to Munson\u2019s statements, the District Court concluded that the six considerations listed in <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 15, 314 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>402, \u00b6 15, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 15, each weighed in favor of the State and that Munson, therefore, had not been subjected to a custodial interrogation. With respect to the evidence seized from Munson\u2019s apartment and automobile, the court reasoned that Munson had been advised that she did not have to sign the consent form, that the Officers had not made Munson any promises before she signed the form, and that she had knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b616 Thereafter, the State filed an amended information, deleting the charge of criminal endangerment but retaining the charges of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Munson entered into a plea agreement and pleaded no contest to both charges; however, she specifically reserved her right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress. The District Court entered judgment on November 3, 2005, sentencing Munson to five years with the Department of Corrections, all suspended, and a concurrent six-month term in the Ravalli County Detention Center, also suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"A_9\">\u00b617 Munson now appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b618  In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence or statements, we determine whether the court\u2019s underlying factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Copelton, </em>2006 MT 182, \u00b6 8, 333 Mont. 91, \u00b6 8, 140 P.3d 1074, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 17, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 17, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 475, 914 P.2d 592, 601 (1996). The court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 21, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 21; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 475, 914 P.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err in denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress statements she made to the Officers?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b620 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be compelled in a criminal proceeding to testify or be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>witness against himself or herself. We discussed this privilege against self-incrimination in <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, 314 Mont. 402, 66 P.3d 297, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\">the prosecution may not use statements that stem from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant is warned, prior to questioning, that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney. <em>[Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1612 (1966).] These \u201cwarnings\u201d are often referred to as <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>accord State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6 17, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Wrzesinski, </em>2006 MT 263, \u00b6 29, 334 Mont. 157, \u00b6 29, 145 P.3d 985, \u00b6 29; <em>see also Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 608, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 2608 (2004) (Opinion of Souter, J.) (\u201c[F]ailure to give the prescribed warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.\u201d); <em>State v. Grey, </em>274 Mont. 206, 211-14, 907 P.2d 951, 954-56 (1995) (holding that Grey\u2019s confession was inadmissible due in part to the fact that the police had not given him adequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings). Accordingly, if Munson was subject to a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d then she was entitled to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before the Officers questioned her, and because Munson indisputably did not receive those warnings, her statements could not be used by the State in prosecuting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b621 There are two separate components to the \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d determination: (1) whether the individual was \u201cin custody\u2019 and (2) whether the individual was subjected to an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 299-301, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689 (1980); <em>Illinois v. Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297, 110 S. Ct. 2394, 2397 (1990). With respect to the former, a person is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>\u201cif they have been deprived of their freedom of action in any significant way or their freedom of action has been curtailed to a degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 27, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 30, 295 Mont. 212, \u00b6 30, 983 P.2d 916, \u00b6 30, in turn quoting <em>United States v. Ritchie, </em>35 F.3d 1477, 1485 (10th <em>Cir. 1994)). </em>The determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the questioning, not on the subjective views harbored by the officer(s) and the individual being questioned. <em>See Evans v. Montana Eleventh Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2000 MT 38, \u00b6 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>298 Mont. 279, \u00b6 21, 995 P.2d 455, \u00b6 21; <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S. Ct. 1526, 1529 (1994) (per curiam). Thus, an officer\u2019s undisclosed view that the individual may (or may not) terminate the interview and leave has no bearing on the question whether the individual was in custody at the time; rather, the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable person in the individual\u2019s position would have understood his or her situation. <em>See Elison, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Evans,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">\u00b6 21; <em>see also Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 323-25, 114 S.

On one hand, the State points out that Munson was interviewed in her home during the middle of the afternoon, as opposed to being dragged out of bed and down to the police station in the middle of the night. Furthermore, the State suggests that \u201cJohnson\u2019s use of his history with her family and his attempt to persuade her to cooperate were not threatening and appeared to be sincere.\u201d We also note here that the Officers wore plain clothes, did not display any weapons, and did not use physical force to coerce incriminating statements from Munson.</p>\n<p id=\"Ask\">\u00b628 On the other hand, there are a substantial number of circumstances which indicate that Munson was in custody. Although the Officers met with Munson in her home,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">it is not difficult to envision that a suspect\u2019s sense of captivity can actually be intensified by the intrusive and intimidating environment created when agents of the law take control of a person\u2019s private residence.

Griffin, </em>922 F.2d 1343, 1355 n. 15 (8th Cir. 1990). Indeed, in <em>State v. Osteen, </em>216 Mont. 258, 700 P.2d 188 (1985), we explained that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that interrogation occur at the police station in order to invoke the <em>Miranda </em>requirements. Interrogation which occurs in the suspect\u2019s home is subject to <em>Miranda </em>where it occurs in a coercive environment in which the suspect\u2019s freedom of action has been significantly restricted.\u201d <em>Osteen, </em>216 Mont. at 265, 700 P.2d at 193, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v.

The two officers then questioned Munson in tandem. During the course of the questioning, Munson sat on a couch, Johnson sat on a piece of furniture (another couch or a coffee table) three or four feet in front of her, and Basnaw alternated between standing, sitting, and kneeling near Munson while maintaining a distance of three to six feet. Meanwhile, Munson\u2019s infant daughter was napping and Munson\u2019s five-year-old son was alternately in and out of the apartment. Under these circumstances, Munson was not free to leave her apartment; rather, she was compelled to remain there. Indeed, Johnson acknowledged at the suppression hearing, \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get up and leave. We would have had to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b630 In this regard, Basnaw testified that \u201c[Munson] could\u2019ve asked us to leave, and we would\u2019ve left, and she would\u2019ve been there by herself.\u201d Yet, this fact was not conveyed to Munson during the interview, and an officer\u2019s undisclosed view that the individual may terminate the interview and ask the officers to leave has no bearing on the question whether the individual was in custody. <em>See Elison, </em>\u00b6 31; <em>Evans, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>cf. Berkemer, </em>468 U.S. at 441-42, 104 S. Ct. at 3151. Moreover, by their words and their actions, the Officers actually conveyed that they were determined to investigate the allegations of criminal activity in Munson\u2019s apartment and would not leave until they had done so. In particular, Johnson asked upon arriving, \u201cCan we come in Julia?\u201d and Munson replied, \u201cUm, actually my daughter\u2019s, I\u2019m just puttin\u2019 her down for a nap can you come back---------?\u201d Basnaw declined, stating: \u201cWell actually I don\u2019t have time. Um, I need to visit with ya\u2019 right now.\u201d Next, Basnaw asked Munson if she had had any methamphetamine in the apartment the previous night. Munson replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Basnaw asked her if she had any drugs in the apartment at present. Munson replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Basnaw asked Munson if she would consent to a search of the apartment. Munson replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Johnson cut in at this point and asked Munson if she would consent to a search of her body and if she would give them a urine sample. Munson replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Nevertheless, Johnson persisted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Because.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>\u2018Kay. And why wouldn\u2019t you allow us to search your home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\"><em>Julia Munson: </em>Because George [Snell] doesn\u2019t hang out here or nothin\u2019, you know, I don\u2019t even hardly know him. I know Josh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0k\"><em>Detective Johnson: </em>Uh, huh. (Affirmative)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Julia Munson: </em>And I just don\u2019t fell [sic] that it\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">This dialogue occurred within the first few minutes of the Officers\u2019 arrival at the apartment. Yet, notwithstanding Munson\u2019s -unequivocal assertions that there were no drugs in the apartment, that she would not consent to searches of the apartment or her body, and that she did not want to speak with the Officers at that time, the Officers remained in her apartment and pressed on with the interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6Y\">\u00b631 Given the Officers\u2019 persistence, it is hardly surprising that Munson felt, as she later testified at the suppression hearing, that \u201cuntil they either got what they wanted to hear or what they wanted to find they would not leave my home.\u201d It is also unsurprising, given Basnaw\u2019s statement that he needed to speak with Munson \u201cright now\u201d and the fact that she had an infant napping in the apartment, that she felt she was not free to terminate the interview and leave. In light of what the Officers stated to Munson and the other circumstances surrounding the interview, we conclude that a significant degree of pressure was applied by the Officers to detain Munson. For this reason, we cannot agree with the District Court that \u201c[tjhere was no restriction on Munson\u2019s liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b632 Likewise, we cannot agree with the District Court that Munson \u201cinvited the officers into her home to talk.\u201d To the contrary, the record reflects that Munson asked the Officers if they could come back, since she was just putting her daughter down for a nap. It was only when the Officers refused that Munson acquiesced to their entry. Notably, the Officers did not inform Munson that she could refuse to let them in.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b633 Lastly, we note that the Officers stated unequivocally to Munson at the outset of their visit that they were there to \u201cfollow up\u201d on allegations of criminal activity involving Munson and her apartment-in particular, Snell\u2019s allegations of methamphetamine use there. Yet, at no point did the Officers inform Munson that she was not under arrest, that she was free to leave, or that they would terminate the interview and leave upon her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b634  In light of the foregoing circumstances, we conclude that the Officers created a custodial atmosphere and that \u201c[Munson\u2019s] freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of action [was] significantly restricted,\u201d <em>Osteen, </em>216 Mont. at 265, 700 P.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b635 We reached this same conclusion with respect to the interviews at issue in <em>Osteen </em>and <em>Rushton. </em>In <em>Osteen, </em>we noted the following circumstances surrounding the officers\u2019 visit to the defendant\u2019s home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4\">Here, two armed and uniformed police officers appeared at defendant\u2019s door at night and sought entry. Meanwhile, another officer and the alleged victim waited in a vehicle outside defendant\u2019s home. The two officers entered defendant\u2019s home without a warrant or other authorization, and began to interrogate the defendant regarding the weapon, his vehicle and his activities that night. The defendant was alone in his home at the time. The questioning apparently exceeded ten minutes in length. The officers repeated their questioning until receiving satisfactory answers. Both officers testified that, at first, the defendant denied having the gun in his car that night. After additional questioning, the defendant admitted the gun was with him in the car and he was formally arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Osteen, </em>216 Mont. at 265, 700 P.2d at 193. We held that \u201c[t]hese facts establish that the defendant was significantly deprived of his freedom of action.\u201d <em>Osteen, </em>216 Mont. at 265, 700 P.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b636 Similarly, we noted the following circumstances in <em>Rushton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Here, two armed officers were in defendant\u2019s home late at night after arousing him from bed. When Detective Bailey and the other officers went to defendant\u2019s home, it is clear that they suspected defendant of criminal activity. Moreover, the officers specifically intended to obtain defendant\u2019s consent to conduct a search of his home because, for administrative reasons only, they did not attempt to get a warrant. Defendant was not told why the officers wanted to talk with him, nor that he had the right to refuse them entry. Although defendant quickly put on some clothes, his wife was dressed only in a robe and pajamas during the time they were questioned by Detective Bailey. Furthermore, after the Rushtons were told to sit on the couch, a second armed officer remained standing and blocked the exit from the room. Defendant testified that he did not feel he was free to leave and the officers present admitted their intention to stop and detain anyone who attempted to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\"><em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 256, 870 P.2d at 1360. On these facts, we concluded that \u201ca person in defendant\u2019s position could reasonably believe that his freedom was restricted and he was not free to leave.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 256, 870 P.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b637 The State asserts that <em>Osteen </em>and <em>Rushton </em>are distinguishable from Munson\u2019s situation. Yet, with respect to <em>Osteen, </em>the State identifies a number of similarities, rather than differences. For instance, the State observes that \u201c[t]he officers [in Osteen] had sufficient information for a warrant, but chose not to obtain one.\u201d The same appears to be true here, given the information the Officers had received from Snell in conjunction with Basnaw\u2019s personal observations, while standing in Munson\u2019s doorway, of what he thought might be \u201cparaphernalia for the packaging of methamphetamine or small amounts of dangerous drugs\u201d and Basnaw\u2019s reaction, upon entering Munson\u2019s apartment, to the presence of methamphetamine, including \u201c[t]he odor\u201d and his \u201cscratchy throat.\u201d The State further observes that in <em>Osteen, </em>\u201c[the officers] did not tell Osteen that he had a right to refuse entry ..., and they entered Osteen\u2019s home without a warrant or other authorization\u201d-both of which are also true here. Other similarities abound. In both <em>Osteen </em>and the case at hand, two officers began questioning the defendant upon entering the home. Osteen was alone at the time, as was Munson for all intents and purposes (Munson\u2019s infant daughter was napping and Munson\u2019s five-year-old son was alternately in and out of the apartment). The questioning in both cases exceeded ten minutes; and, most notably, the officers in both cases repeated their questions until they received the answers they wanted. Although in <em>Osteen, </em>the officers were armed and uniformed and appeared at Osteen\u2019s door at night, whereas here the Officers wore plain clothes, did not display any weapons, and appeared at Munson\u2019s door in the middle of the afternoon, we do not find these distinctions to be as significant as the similarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b638 With respect to <em>Rushton, </em>the State argues that \u201cRushton was faced with a more intimidating set of facts.\u201d In particular, whereas Rushton was rousted from bed at night, Munson was visited during the afternoon, and whereas an armed officer blocked the exit from the room where Rushton was interviewed, Munson allegedly \u201cwas free to make conscious decisions.\u201d We do not agree, however, that Munson\u2019s situation was necessarily less \u201cintimidating\u201d or that her decision-making ability was significantly less influenced. Whereas Rushton was interviewed in the company of his wife, Munson was questioned while she was, for all intents and purposes, alone in the apartment with two male officers, one of whom she \u201ckind of\u2019 recognized (Johnson) and one of whom she did not know (Basnaw). Furthermore, according to Munson, the Officers\u2019 presence and physical appearance were, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>her perspective, \u201cintimidating.\u201d (Munson was 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighed 110 pounds at the time.) And although an armed officer did not block the exit, the Officers effectively cornered Munson on a couch in her apartment, with Johnson sitting three or four feet in front of her, with Basnaw alternating between standing, sitting, and kneeling within three to six feet of her, and with both officers questioning her in tandem and without respite.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b639 But even if we could agree with the State that the facts faced by Rushton were \u201cmore intimidating\u201d than the facts faced by Munson, we have never said that an individual must be subjected to factual circumstances at least as \u201cintimidating\u201d as those in <em>Rushton </em>in order to be \u201cin custody.\u201d To the contrary, we have stated that this Court considers each case \u201con a case-by-case basis,\u201d focusing on whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have felt at liberty to terminate the questioning and leave. <em>See State v. Reavley, 2003 </em>MT 298, \u00b6 19, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6 19, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 33, 295 Mont. 212, \u00b6 33, 983 P.2d 916, \u00b6 33; <em>Rushton, </em>264 Mont. at 256, 870 P.2d at 1360. Thus, demonstrating that the facts of <em>Rushton </em>were \u201cmore intimidating\u201d would not establish that Munson was not in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b640 Finally, the State also argues that <em>Osteen </em>and <em>Rushton </em>are distinguishable because in the case at hand, Johnson stated to Munson: \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign [the Consent to Search form] here\u2019s what happens. We\u2019re gonna\u2019 get up and we\u2019re gonna\u2019 go out that door. We\u2019re gonna\u2019 leave.\u201d Yet, Johnson made this statement <em>after </em>Munson had admitted that she had paraphernalia in the apartment and that she had used methamphetamine there during the previous twenty-four hours. In point of fact, the Officers did <em>not </em>tell Munson at any point that they would leave if she simply asked them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b641  We remained convinced that under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the Officers\u2019 interview of Munson in her apartment, a reasonable person in Munson\u2019s position would not have felt free to terminate the interview and leave or ask the Officers to leave. Accordingly, we hold that Munson was, for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cin custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b642 Neither the State nor Munson sets forth a separate analysis on the question of whether she was subject to an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d Rather, they both treat \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as a single inquiry and focus primarily on the question of whether Munson was \u201cin custody.\u201d Here, we have concluded that Munson was, in fact, in custody. Yet, simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>because an individual was in custody does not mean that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 300, 100 S. Ct. at 1689 (\u201c[T]he special procedural safeguards outlined in <em>Miranda </em>are required not where a suspect is simply taken into custody, but rather where a suspect in custody is subjected to interrogation.\u201d). Thus, the State and the defendant should, in all cases, address both the \u201cin custody\u201d and the \u201cinterrogation\u201d questions with separate analyses. (Likewise, for purposes of creating a complete record on appeal, trial courts analyzing motions to suppress statements should include separate and clearly designated analyses of the \u201cin custody\u201d and \u201cinterrogation\u201d questions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b643 Irrespective of the parties\u2019 failure to set forth a separate analysis of \u201cinterrogation\u201d in their respective briefs, we consider this issue to be relatively straightforward on the record before us. As explained above, \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The primary focus in determining whether an incriminating response was reasonably likely to be elicited from the suspect is on the perceptions of the suspect, rather than on the intent of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b644 Here, at the outset of the Officers\u2019 \u201cvisit,\u201d Basnaw asked Munson if she had had any methamphetamine in the apartment the previous night and if she had any drugs in the apartment at present. He then explained to Munson that he and Johnson were there to \u201cfollow up\u201d on information that methamphetamine was presently, or had been the night before, in Munson\u2019s apartment. Next, Johnson opined that \u201c[t]here\u2019s some pretty bad stuff goin\u2019 on here,\u201d and he questioned Munson at length about her lifestyle, whether she needed rehab, and whether she was raising her children properly. Johnson then asked, \u201cSo have you got crank in this house?\u201d Shortly thereafter Munson admitted that she had paraphernalia and that she had used methamphetamine during the previous twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b645 The dialogue between the Officers and Munson reflects express questioning by the Officers as well as words and actions on their part that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses from Munson. Indeed, Basnaw testified at the suppression hearing that he \u201cwanted to speak to her about the activities that night, give her an opportunity to tell me if George Snell had been there and they had been using methamphetamine and if there were any drugs in the house.\u201d In addition, he testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cwanted to give her an opportunity either to prove or disprove the statements that were made basically against her by Mr. Snell.\u201d Likewise, Johnson testified that \u201cthe intent of that meeting [at Munson\u2019s apartment] was to conduct an interview with Julie [sic] Munson\u201d regarding \u201cinformation from George Snell, who had been arrested the night before or during the morning hours . . . that indicated there might be some drug activity there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b646  We hold, therefore, that Munson was, for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>subject to an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Custodial Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b647  Because Munson was interrogated in a custodial atmosphere, she was entitled to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings under the Fifth Amendment <em>to </em>the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. The Officers\u2019 failure to preface their questions with these warnings renders inadmissible the statements Munson made, and the District Court thus erred when it denied Munson\u2019s motion to suppress those statements. We accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress her statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b648 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized from her apartment and vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b649 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution safeguard the right of the people to be secure in their persons, papers, homes, and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures. Unlike its federal counterpart, however, the Montana Constitution also explicitly ensures the right of individual privacy. Specifically, Article II, Section 10, states: \u201cThe right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d Search analysis in Montana, therefore, is typically conducted under both Article II, Section 10, and Article II, Section 11. <em>See State v. Siegal, 281 </em>Mont. 250, 264-65, 934 P.2d 176, 184 (1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v.

Furthermore, we have long held that the unique language of the Montana Constitution affords Montanans broader protection than does the Fourth Amendment in cases involving searches of, or seizures from, private property. <em>See State v.

This test focuses on \u201cthe nature of [the individual\u2019s] subjective understanding,\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 230, 93 S. Ct. at 2049, which in turn depends on \u201cthe characteristics of [the individual] and the details of the interrogation,\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 226, 93 S. Ct. at 2047. A number of considerations are pertinent to this inquiry, such as whether the individual was in custody or under arrest at the time consent was requested; whether consent was sought after the search had already been conducted; whether the individual was expressly informed that he or she had the right not to consent to the search; whether the individual was told that a search warrant could be obtained; whether the individual was advised of his or her constitutional rights; the repeated and prolonged nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>questioning; the individual\u2019s age, education, and intelligence; and whether the individual was threatened or coerced in any manner. <em>See Wetzel, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 226, 93 S. Ct. at 2047; <em>United States v. Patayan Soriano, </em>361 F.3d 494, 502 (9th Cir. 2004). In the end, however, the determination of whether consent was given freely and voluntarily and without duress or coercion depends on the totality of all of the surrounding facts, and no single fact is dispositive. <em>Copelton, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b652 In its order denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence collected from her residence and automobile, the District Court stated that Munson \u201cwas aware the officers would leave her home if she decided not to talk with them,\u201d that she \u201cwas advised several times she did not have to sign the consent form,\u201d and that the Officers \u201cmade no promises to Munson before she consented to the search, nor did they threaten to circumvent the scope of her consent absent a warrant.\u201d The court thus reasoned that \u201cMunson analyzed the situation she was in, and came to the conclusion in her own mind that it was in her best interest to volunteer the drug paraphernalia, risk the possibility of what she thought was only a misdemeanor charge, and obtain help.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded, \u201cMunson knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b653 Munson challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion in light of the following circumstances. First, Munson points out that she was not informed by the Officers that she could refuse their entry into her apartment and, furthermore, that when she in fact asked them if they would come back, Basnaw insisted that he needed to visit with her \u201cright now.\u201d Second, although Basnaw told Munson that he and Johnson were there to visit with her regarding \u201cthat situation last night with George Snell over here,\u201d few of their questions actually pertained to Snell or his activities. Instead, Munson asserts, \u201c[the Officers] lectured her about her lifestyle, implied that they were there to help, and criticized her life to the point that [she] was crying for a good portion of the interview.\u201d Third, Munson refused twice at the outset of the questioning to consent to a search of her apartment, but the Officers did not accept her refusals and leave. Instead they asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d and continued to question her until she ultimately gave consent. Fourth, when Basnaw produced the Consent to Search form, he explained that the form \u201cjust says that your, you\u2019re uh, having been informed of your right to refuse a search of your um, of your house ...\u201d; however, at this point the Officers had not actually told Munson that she had the right to refuse the search. Munson points out that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201c[t]o the contrary, when she had refused to give consent fifteen minutes prior, the detectives had simply ignored her refusal, remained in her home, and continued their interrogation.\u201d Fifth, Munson contends that there was an \u201cimplied threat\u201d that she would be incarcerated if she did not consent to the search. According to Munson, Johnson\u2019s earlier comment that \u201c[w]e didn\u2019t come here and take that Miranda card out\u201d implied, at least in her mind, that \u201cif she doesn\u2019t cooperate, they will <em>Mirandize </em>her and arrest her.\u201d Lastly, Munson argues that in its order, the District Court \u201cblatantly ignore[d] the lengthy time of the interrogation, or the coercive nature of the interrogation\u201d and \u201cstate[d] the facts as if Ms. Munson willingly made admissions without any prompting or effort by the detectives.\u201d This view of the events, Munson maintains, \u201cis wholly unsupported by the facts.\u201d In sum, Munson asserts that the State did not meet its burden of proving that her consent was given freely and voluntarily and was uncontaminated by any express or implied duress or coercion, and that the District Court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b654 In response, the State argues that Munson\u2019s consent was given voluntarily for the following reasons. First, the State notes that Munson initially refused the Officers\u2019 request to search the apartment and Munson\u2019s person and that when she finally allowed a search for paraphernalia, \u201cshe retained some control over where the officers looked.\u201d Thus, in the State\u2019s view, \u201cMunson was not intimidated so as to deprive her of the power of consent.\u201d Second, the State maintains that \u201c[e]ven though the officers were there to investigate criminal activity, that does not contradict their stated desire to help Munson get out of the pattern of drug use that was evident to them all.\u201d The State acknowledges that the Officers \u201ccould have left to seek a warrant before they obtained Munson\u2019s consent to search, but how would that have benefited her?\u201d Third, the State suggests that the length of an interview \u201cis simply one of many factors, and it did not appear significant here.\u201d Lastly, the State asserts that \u201c[t]his is not a case in which the police wore down a suspect,\u201d since Munson \u201cwas in her own home\u201d and \u201cmade choices throughout the incident.\u201d Likewise, the State asserts that \u201c[t]his was not a coerced decision. It was made under emotional circumstances, and Munson certainly knew that her drug use was a problem for her, but she still made choices that reflected calculation-albeit with mistaken assumptions that were not the result of being misled by the police.\u201d Thus, in sum, the State maintains that the District Court \u201ccorrectly concluded, assessing all the circumstances, that Munson\u2019s consent to search was voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u00b655 Having considered the foregoing arguments and the record before us, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances weighs in Munson\u2019s favor. Although there unquestionably are circumstances supporting both sides of the consent issue, we consider the following facts to be most significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b656 First, Munson indicated to the Officers upon their arrival that she did not want to visit with them at that time, but they insisted on visiting with her \u201cright now,\u201d thereby creating a coercive dynamic at the outset of the interview. Second, Munson unequivocally refused <em>twice </em>at the outset of the questioning to consent to a search of her apartment, but the Officers nevertheless pressured her to change her mind, thereby conveying that they would not take \u201cNo\u201d for an answer. In this regard, we are not persuaded by the emphasis the State places on the Officers\u2019 altruistic motive in going to Munson\u2019s apartment \u201cto help [her] get out of the pattern of drug use\u201d-a characterization that is dubious in light of Basnaw\u2019s statement, upon the Officers\u2019 arrival, that he and Johnson were there to \u201cfollow up\u201d on allegations of criminal activity involving Munson and her apartment. Indeed, the State\u2019s portrayal of the events is belied by Basnaw\u2019s own characterization (while requesting transportation of Munson) of what had just transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">Hi Hillary it\u2019s Jase. Good. Hey that female I talked to ya\u2019 about I\u2019m at her house now. We did a consent to search and I\u2019m gonna\u2019 end up takin\u2019 her to jail. Yeah. We got a little bit o\u2019 meth and meth paraphernalia. She\u2019s got a 1-year-old and a 5-year-old. So how do ya\u2019 like that? Hahaha. Made to order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b657 Third, the Officers employed what could fairly be characterized as psychological tactics to obtain Munson\u2019s consent. <em>Cf. Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 229, 93 S. Ct. at 2049 (\u201cIn examining all the surrounding circumstances to determine if in fact the consent to search was coerced, account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions, as well as the possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents.\u201d). For instance, Johnson told Munson that \u201c[t]here\u2019s some pretty bad stuff goin\u2019 on here,\u201d opined that she was at \u201ca fork in the road,\u201d offered ideas on how she might change her life, and then suggested that signing the consent form would be the wise choice for her to make, noting that \u201c[t]he decision you make today is gonna\u2019 determine where your children are raised.\u201d As a result, Munson\u2019s consent ultimately was given while she was in an extremely emotional state brought on by the Officers\u2019 lecturing her at length about her lifestyle, her children, and her future. For this reason, we cannot agree with the State that \u201c[t]his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>is not a case in which the police wore down a suspect.\u201d To the contrary, our review of the thirty-one-page transcript covering the approximately one hour and forty-five minutes that the Officers were at Munson\u2019s apartment leads inescapably to the conclusion that Basnaw and Johnson\u2019s approach achieved exactly what they had intended: to wear Munson down to the point where she made inculpatory statements and yielded to their warrantless search of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b658 Lastly, although the Officers did indeed tell Munson that she <em>did not </em>have to sign the Consent to Search form, they also told her that she <em>did </em>have to sign the form. As a matter of fact, the transcript reflects virtually simultaneous contradictory statements by the Officers in this regard; at the very least, their statements to Munson that she did not have to sign the form were equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b659  Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Munson\u2019s consent was not given freely and voluntarily and without duress or coercion. Thus, all evidence seized by the Officers -under the guise of Munson\u2019s consent is inadmissible. We accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying Munson\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b660  Because Munson was interrogated in a custodial atmosphere, she was entitled to the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The Officers\u2019 failure to preface their questions with those warnings renders Munson\u2019s statements inadmissible, and the District Court therefore erred when it denied Munson\u2019s motion to suppress those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b661  Furthermore, because Munson\u2019s consent to search was not given freely and voluntarily and without duress or coercion, all evidence seized by the Officers under the guise of that consent is inadmissible, and the District Court therefore erred when it denied Munson\u2019s motion to suppress that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b662 Reversed and remanded with instructions to grant Munson\u2019s motion to suppress and for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-4\"> Some of our cases also refer to \u201cwhether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were gratuitously given.\u201d <em>See e.g. State v. Lapp, </em>202 Mont. 327, 331, 658 P.2d 400, 403 (1983); <em>State v. Osteen, </em>216 Mont. 258, 265, 700 P.2d 188, 193 (1985); <em>State v. Staat, </em>251 Mont. 1, 6, 822 P.2d 643, 646 (1991); <em>Evans, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. McKee, </em>2006 MT 5, \u00b6 28, 330 Mont. 249, <em>\u00b6 </em>28, 127 P.3d 445, \u00b6 28; <em>In re Z.M., </em>2007 MT 122, \u00b6 42, 337 Mont. 278, \u00b6 42, 160 P.3d 490, \u00b6 42. This and the other considerations set forth in <em>Elison </em>and <em>Rushton </em>derive from <em>Cummings v. State, </em>341 A.2d 294 (Md.App. 1975). <em>See Lapp, </em>202 Mont. at 331, 658 P.2d at 403 (citing <em>Cummings, </em>341 A.2d at 300-05). We note, however, that the point the Maryland court was making with respect to the gratuitous giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings was not that the gratuitousness of the warnings informs whether the suspect was \u201cin custody.\u201d Rather, the court\u2019s point was that \u201cthe gratuitous and unnecessary giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings will [not] operate to convert an otherwise noncustodial situation into a custodial one.\u201d <em>Cummings, </em>341 A.2d at 304. Thus, to clarify the relevance of this consideration in this and future cases, the fact that the officer gave <em>Miranda </em>warnings during the course of the encounter may be considered in determining whether the individual was in custody; however, if all other considerations dictate that the individual was not in custody, the fact that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given will not by itself convert the otherwise noncustodial situation into a custodial one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\"> That the Officers were determined to investigate the allegations of criminal activity in Munson\u2019s apartment and would not leave until they had done so is confirmed by Basnaw\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s respective testimony to this effect at the suppression hearing. Also, Basnaw explained at the hearing that it is \u201cfairly common\u201d after an individual has refused consent for him to sit and talk, with the individual about the individual\u2019s family and lifestyle in an effort to obtain the consent previously refused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
