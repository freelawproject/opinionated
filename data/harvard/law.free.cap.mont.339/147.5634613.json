We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in determining the evidence was insufficient to establish a change in the children\u2019s circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in awarding costs and attorney fees to David?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">\u00b65 David and Carol both resided in Thompson Falls when the District Court entered a decree dissolving their marriage in July of 2004. The decree incorporated a stipulated parenting plan, pursuant to which David and Carol would parent their four minor children-ages 12, 10, 8 and 7-\u201con an equal basis, using a 2/2/3-day rotation,\u201d with provisions for holidays and other special days.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">\u00b66 In December of 2004, Carol filed notice of her intent to move to Poison the following summer, together with a proposed amended parenting plan including a proposed revised residential schedule, pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA. She also moved for the appointment of a guardian ad litem. Carol characterized the existing parenting plan as \u201cvery difficult,\u201d and expressed concern that David\u2019s animosity toward her would increase in light of her move to Poison. Carol\u2019s proposed amended parenting plan retained the parties\u2019joint authority and responsibility for the children, but proposed that the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>would reside primarily with Carol and stay with David every other weekend, with other provisions for holidays and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b67 David opposed Carol\u2019s proposed amended parenting plan and motion for appointment of a guardian ad litem. He timely filed his own proposed amended parenting plan including a proposed revised residential schedule, as required by \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA. David proposed the children primarily reside with him and stay with Carol on alternating weekends during school years, and alternate every two weeks between the parents\u2019 residences during summers, with additional provisions for holidays and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b68 The District Court held a hearing in February of2005. After Carol presented her evidence and testimony-and before David presented his case-the court ruled from the bench that insufficient evidence supported changing the parenting plan. The court acknowledged Carol\u2019s right to move, but expressed concern about reducing David\u2019s parenting time, especially since a mediator assisted with the stipulated parenting plan in June of 2004. The court requested the parties to discuss whether they could reduce their conflicts without assistance from a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b69 Shortly thereafter, the District Court entered its order denying both parties\u2019 proposed amended parenting plans. It reiterated its oral ruling that the evidence was insufficient, and stated it would not reduce David\u2019s parenting time or \u201cchange the children\u2019s circumstances\u201d because Carol desired to move. The District Court took Carol\u2019s motion for appointment of a guardian ad litem -under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b610 In July, Carol filed notice of her change of address to a Poison post office box, and renewed her motion for appointment of a guardian ad litem. David responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b611 Later that month, the District Court appointed Nancy Combs as guardian ad litem to secure recommendations for resolution of the parties\u2019 problems with the parenting plan, implement visitation, and initially establish workable guidelines and schedules for visits. The court noted its previous rejection of the proposed amended parenting plans and the reasons therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u00b612 Combs first reported the parties\u2019 agreement to a temporary parenting schedule of alternating weeks, with the children continuing school in Thompson Falls and having Monday evening visits with the off-week parent. She also requested additional time to investigate the reasons underlying the three youngest children\u2019s wishes to stay with Carol. In her second report, Combs recommended that the oldest child reside primarily with David, with visits to Carol every other weekend, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and that the three younger children reside primarily with Carol, with visits to David every other weekend. David objected to Combs\u2019 recommendations and moved to strike portions of her second report. Carol responded, requesting that the court adopt Combs\u2019 recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b613 The District Court entered its second order denying proposed changes to the parenting plan in November of 2005, reiterating its earlier reasoning and characterizing its appointment of Combs as an effort to facilitate a mutual resolution. The court reasoned Combs\u2019 recommendations \u201cwould have resulted in a change of living arrangements but cite no substantial change in circumstances not considered by the Court at the time of the Court\u2019s previous order.\u201d On that basis, the court concluded it lacked authority to modify the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b614 Carol moved the District Court to alter its November order and adopt Combs\u2019 recommendations. David responded, and moved for costs and attorney fees based on both a provision in the parenting plan and \u00a7 40-4-110, MCA. The District Court denied Carol\u2019s motion and granted David\u2019s motion. Carol appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b615 We recently clarified that a district court\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>regardless of the context of the court\u2019s determination, because evidence is legally sufficient under applicable rules or it is not. <em>See Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 338 Mont. 19, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 162 P.3d 134, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 336 Mont. 105, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 152 P.3d 727, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Thus, we review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to establish a change of circumstances to determine whether it is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u00b616 <em>1. Did the District Court err in determining the evidence was insufficient to establish a change in the children\u2019s circumstances?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u00b617 Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that a court may amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and amendment is necessary to serve the child\u2019s best interests. The District Court made no findings regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>any facts arising since the stipulated parenting plan and dissolution decree. It concluded the evidence was insufficient to establish that the children\u2019s circumstances had changed and, as a result, it lacked authority under \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, to proceed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b618 On appeal, Carol contends her move to Poison subsequent to the stipulated and incorporated 2/2/3-day parenting plan resulted in changed circumstances for the children. David asserts Carol\u2019s decision to move need not affect the children\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b619 Both parties advance parenting plan cases, some of which address prior versions of \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, which differ from the version applicable here. None of the advanced cases addresses a district court\u2019s legal conclusion that evidence was insufficient to establish a change in the child\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b620 In any event, as set forth above, we review a court\u2019s conclusion regarding the sufficiency of the evidence for correctness. <em>See Giambra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Stated in the context of this case, the issue is whether the District Court erred in concluding insufficient evidence based on post-dissolution facts established a change in the children\u2019s circumstances. Thus, we turn to the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b621 At the time of the stipulated 2/2/3-day parenting plan and dissolution decree in 2004, Carol and David lived within five miles of each other in Thompson Falls. In Carol\u2019s pre-hearing affidavit, she referred to her intended move to Poison, and asserted the parenting plan was difficult and the two boys were having a difficult time with the transitions between the Thompson Falls households. David responded via an affidavit maintaining the children had-with the assistance of a counselor-made progress in adjusting to the 2/2/3-day parenting plan, and asserting Carol\u2019s intended move would \u201cdisrupt\u201d that progress and would make it impossible for both parents to have frequent and continuous contact with the children. He farther asserted his proposed parenting plan-which provided that the children would primarily reside with him in Thompson Falls-would allow the children to stay in a familiar home, community and environment with their close friends, family members, teachers and other people that had been part of their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b622 At the February 2005 hearing, Carol\u2019s attorney asked how the 2/2/3-day rotation had been working for the children, and Carol responded \u201c[h]orrible.\u201d Carol further testified the oldest child was having academic and other difficulties, and she felt she could not give him needed structure and discipline every two days. Carol also related that her older daughter was regularly taking her clothing to David\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>in grocery bags rather than wearing the clothes kept for her at David\u2019s house, and Carol needed to \u201ccoax[j\u201d her to go to David\u2019s and assure her that she would return to Carol\u2019s. In addition, Carol testified that she felt the transitions in the 2/2/3-day rotation were upsetting the children\u2019s routines, because she had trouble getting them to bed and \u201cit sounds like they\u2019re toddlers, but they don\u2019t sleep well.\u201d Carol testified she believed Poison provided more opportunities for the children than Thompson Falls, the children were excited about the move and they did not have needed stability during their week under the existing plan. David did not testify at the February 2005 hearing because, as mentioned above, the District Court ruled after Carol rested her case and before David presented his.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b623 The District Court ruled from the bench that the evidence was insufficient that the children\u2019s circumstances had changed due to Carol\u2019s intended move. The court also stated its concern about \u201cthe difficulty of the transfer back and forth and how often that\u2019s taking place\u201d and expressed willingness to consider a stipulation by the parties to adjust portions of the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b624 We note the District Court was technically correct about the lack of a change in the children\u2019s circumstances at the time of the hearing in February of 2005, insofar as Carol\u2019s intended move had not yet occurred. However, since 1997, \u00a7 40-4-217, MCA, has required a parent who intends to change residence in a manner that will significantly affect the child\u2019s contact with the other parent to submit a proposed revised residential schedule. Read together, \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-217 and -219(1), MCA, clearly contemplate that parties and district courts exercise foresight in relation to proposed amended parenting plans with proposed revised residential schedules. Here, the District Court persisted in its ruling after Carol\u2019s move and Combs\u2019 reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b625 The record since the February 2005 hearing reflects that Carol has moved, and the children travel approximately 90 miles each way between Poison and Thompson Falls to transfer between households and to attend school in Thompson Falls when staying with Carol in Poison. In addition, Carol has established a household with her current spouse and his four children, and she was expecting another baby after the February 2005 hearing. Combs also reported that David intended to move in with his current significant other, who also has children. When the 2/2/3-day rotation was implemented, the children were not driving 90 miles per day to go to school or between households, and they were not living with any other children or adults.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u00b626  We hold the evidence of record in the present case establishes as a matter of law that, based on facts which arose since the original 2/2/3-day parenting plan, a change in the children\u2019s circumstances occurred. Consequently, we also hold the District Court erred in concluding otherwise. Thus, we remand for the District Court\u2019s determinations of whether an amendment to the parenting plan is in the best interest of the children and, ultimately, whether and how it should amend the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b627  Because the District Court\u2019s decisions on remand will necessarily factor into a subsequent decision on whether to award attorney fees, we vacate the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees and costs to David.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b628 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b177-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A1d\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b629 I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that the evidence of record in this case establishes as a matter of law that a change in circumstances has occurred. In order to reach this conclusion this Court engages in fact finding. It is true that if Carol is believed, the District Court could have found that the change of circumstances requirement in \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA, has been met. However, in my view, the real problem is that the District Court made no findings of fact regarding any change in circumstances since the prior parenting plan was adopted. This is acknowledged by the Court at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b630 The District Court may have had good reasons for holding that the evidence was insufficient to establish a change in circumstances. The record in this case shows that these might well include that Carol is not credible, or that she orchestrated the move to Poison for the sole purpose of severely limiting David\u2019s time with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u00b631 I would remand to the District Court with directions to make appropriate findings of fact concerning why it reached the legal conclusion that there was no change in circumstances requiring a new parenting plan. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a); <em>Marriage of Jacobson, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 19, 333 Mont. 323, \u00b6 19, 142 P.3d 859, \u00b6 19. I would not leap directly to the legal conclusion that the required change in circumstances has been established, without knowing the facts. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
