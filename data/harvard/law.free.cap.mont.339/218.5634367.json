We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\u00b63 Did law enforcement\u2019s handling of evidence deprive Racz of his right to a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">\u00b64 Did the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on the validity of Racz\u2019s complaints concerning his attorney\u2019s effectiveness constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>error?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b65 Was Racz deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">\u00b66 Did the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument constitute prosecutorial misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b67 Does the cumulative error doctrine entitle Racz to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b68 On June 4, 2005, Billings police officers investigated a report of suspicious activity involving individuals loading items into a car trunk. Officers Iffland and Haines arrived at approximately the same time and located the vehicle, and Sergeant House soon joined them. The officers identified Racz and Sheila Velarde as the vehicle\u2019s occupants. Officers handcuffed Racz and placed him in Officer Iffland\u2019s patrol car after Racz told them that the trunk contained possibly stolen items. Once the officers determined none of the items had been reported stolen, Officer Iffland removed Racz\u2019s handcuffs and returned him to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b69 After releasing Racz, Officer Iffland checked the rear seat of his patrol car and discovered a baggie containing methamphetamine. Officer Iffland arrested Racz and gave the baggie to Officer Haines to place into evidence. Sergeant House discovered similar baggies in Velarde\u2019s purse and gave those to Officer Haines to place into evidence. Officer Haines placed in his right pocket the baggie found in Iffland\u2019s patrol car and associated with Racz; in his left pocket, he placed the baggies associated with Velarde. Officer Iffland testified that, though he completed an incident report, the report was missing at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b610 The State charged Racz with criminal possession of dangerous drugs. During voir dire, defense counsel challenged a prospective juror for cause due to a possible bias toward law enforcement. After the District Court denied the challenge, defense counsel failed to pursue follow-up questions. Defense counsel challenged a second prospective juror for cause, again due to possible law enforcement bias; however, after further questioning from both counsel, defense counsel withdrew the objection. Racz\u2019s counsel used peremptory challenges to remove both prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u00b611 At the trial\u2019s conclusion, defense counsel requested a jury instruction stating that \u201c[wjhen circumstantial evidence is susceptible to two interpretations, one which supports guilt and the other which supports innocence, you the jury must decide which is more reasonable.\u201d The jury convicted Racz of criminal possession of dangerous drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00b612 At sentencing, Racz read a letter to the court maintaining his innocence and claiming that, but for his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, he would have been exonerated. Racz focused on his counsel\u2019s failure to obtain fingerprint evidence from the baggies and failure to obtain videotape from the patrol cars, which he claimed would have shown that he was thoroughly searched and thus could have possessed no drugs when he was placed in the patrol car. The District Court informed Racz that he could pursue his remedies on appeal. The District Court sentenced Racz to ten years, with five suspended, at Montana State Prison and designated Racz a persistent felony offender. The District Court appointed different counsel to handle Racz\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b613 Whether a defendant has been denied a due process right presents a constitutional law question, and we exercise plenary review. <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 320 Mont. 268, \u00b6 9, 87 P.3d 408, \u00b6 9. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling on requests to substitute counsel. <em>State v. Holder, </em>2007 MT 41, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 91, \u00b6 19, 152 P.3d 722, \u00b6 19. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employing conscientious judgment, or \u201cexceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Hatz, </em>2006 MT 348, \u00b6 34, 335 Mont. 201, \u00b6 34, 150 P.3d 367, \u00b6 34. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims constitute mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 9, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b614 I. Did law enforcement\u2019s handling of evidence deprive Racz of his right to a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b615 Racz contends that the officers violated his due process rights and thus denied him a fair trial. First, Racz asserts that the officers\u2019 initial handling of the baggies compromised the integrity of the evidence. Second, Racz argues that the officers failed to follow his suggestions to test the baggies for fingerprints, which he asserts would have proven his innocence. Finally, Racz claims that the officers\u2019 actions indicated a lack of desire to protect his due process rights; specifically, Racz points to the officers\u2019 failure to provide him videotape of the initial arrest, the officers\u2019 failure to timely cooperate with the defense, and Officer Iffiand\u2019s missing incident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u00b616 Racz asserts this due process claim for the first time on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>We refuse to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal because \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Ramsey, </em>2007 MT 31, \u00b6 16, 336 Mont. 44, \u00b6 16, 152 P.3d 710, \u00b6 16. Racz has failed to preserve this issue for appeal and we decline to exercise our discretionary plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b617 II. Did the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on the validity of Racz\u2019s complaints concerning his attorney\u2019s effectiveness constitute error?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b618 Racz claims that the District Court erred in failing to conduct a hearing on the validity of his \u201cnumerous complaints and concerns about his representation.\u201d At sentencing, Racz read a letter asserting his innocence and announcing his decision to appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Racz\u2019s primary complaints against his attorney were (1) that she failed to procure fingerprint evidence from the baggies, and (2) that she failed to procure any videotape from the police cars. Racz claimed that the fingerprint and videotape evidence would have exonerated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b619  A court must make an adequate inquiry to determine whether a criminal defendant\u2019s complaints are \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d when presented with a request to substitute counsel based on counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 14, 288 Mont. 180, \u00b6 14, 955 P.2d 1371, \u00b6 14. A separate hearing is not required, however, if the defendant makes no request to substitute counsel. <em>Holder, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b620  In this case, though Racz raised issues of his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, Racz did not request substitution of counsel during his sentencing; thus, Racz\u2019s letter failed to implicate the \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d analysis and the need for a subsequent hearing. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct a hearing regarding Racz\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b621 III. Was Racz deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b622 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants the right to effective counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. We apply the two-pronged <em>Strickland </em>test to ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>Strickland v. Wash., </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 17, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 17, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 17. Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant must prove (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>defense. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b623 As a threshold matter when considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we must determine whether a direct appeal or a post-conviction hearing is the more appropriate forum. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 14, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 14. If we can discern from the record the reason counsel performed or failed to perform as alleged, we can properly address the claim on direct appeal. If, in reviewing the record, we cannot discern the reason, the defendant must raise the claim in a petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. The defendant can then develop a record explaining the reasons for counsel\u2019s action or inaction. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b624 <em>A. Did Racz receive ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b625 Racz claims that his trial counsel\u2019s improper questioning and failure to follow through on challenges forced Racz to use limited peremptory challenges on prospective jurors who should have been removed for cause. Racz offers as primary examples the questioning of prospective jurors 13 and 8. Defense counsel moved to strike prospective juror 13 from the panel after the prospective juror stated that Racz bore the burden of proving his innocence rather than that the State bore the burden of proving Racz\u2019s guilt. The District Court denied the challenge \u201cbased on [counsel\u2019s] one question[.]\u201d Instead of asking the prospective juror follow-up questions, Racz\u2019s counsel said, \u201c[o]kay. I\u2019ll just move on then.\u201d Defense counsel later used a peremptory challenge to remove prospective juror 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b626 Racz\u2019s counsel also moved to strike prospective juror 8 from the panel after the prospective juror, a police chaplain, indicated that he might give more emphasis to law enforcement because he was familiar with their training. After further questioning by the State and defense, Racz\u2019s counsel withdrew the objection but then removed prospective juror 8 with a peremptory challenge. Racz argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to further question prospective juror 13 and withdrawing the challenge for cause to juror 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b627 As a threshold matter, we must determine whether direct appeal is the proper forum for this claim. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. Though lawyers state their reasons for challenging prospective jurors during voir dire, \u201cthey do not state their reasons for <em>not challenging </em>a juror.\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis in original). The ineffective assistance of counsel claim at issue in <em>Herrman </em>originated when Herrman\u2019s lawyer failed to challenge potentially biased prospective jurors for cause. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>determined that a lawyer\u2019s reasoning for not challenging a prospective juror was not record-based; rather, a lawyer\u2019s reasoning was a \u201cmatter of internal thought processes[.]\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 28. Moreover, a lawyer may have a multitude of reasons to decline to challenge a prospective juror. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 28. We concluded in <em>Herrman </em>that we should not \u201cassume\u201d the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or inactions, but that they should be considered in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"Abv\">\u00b628 If the record adequately details the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions, however, we will consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim arising out of voir dire without the benefit of a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 10. For example, in <em>Lamere </em>one of the prospective jurors stated in a juror questionnaire that her daughter was a county attorney paralegal. The paralegal actively assisted the prosecutor during voir dire. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 3. Lamere\u2019s lawyer posed no questions to the mother about possible bias based on the relationship, and the mother was seated on the jury. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-5. When the lawyer subsequently realized the relationship, he moved to replace her and told the court, \u201cI take full responsibility for it, and the defendant certainly now is on notice that his attorney made a mistake.\u201d <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 6. We determined that the transcript provided an adequate record detailing the reasons for the lawyer\u2019s actions and thus proceeded to apply the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b629  We conclude that Racz\u2019s case is more akin to <em>Herrman. </em>Although Racz\u2019s attorney\u2019s reasons for initially challenging prospective jurors 8 and 13 are part of the record, her reasons for asking no followup questions and withdrawing her challenge for cause are not. Similar to a lawyer\u2019s reasoning for not challenging a juror, a lawyer\u2019s rationale for not asking further questions is a \u201cmatter of internal thought processes[.]\u201d <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 28. Racz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims relating to voir dire are more appropriately addressed through a petition for post-conviction relief. Thus, this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is dismissed without prejudice to its being raised in a post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b630 <em>B. Did Racz receive ineffective assistance of counsel during jury instructions?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b631 Racz claims that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by requesting a jury instruction, which the District Court adopted, that Racz asserts lowered the State\u2019s burden of proof. Racz\u2019s counsel offered an instruction that stated that \u201c[w]hen circumstantial evidence is susceptible to two interpretations, one which supports guilt and the other which supports innocence, you the jury must decide which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>more reasonable.\u201d Racz\u2019s trial counsel argued that the District Court should include this instruction in light of our decision in <em>State v. Hill, </em>2005 MT 216, 328 Mont. 253, 119 P.3d 1210, which overruled <em>State v. Ryan, </em>229 Mont. 7, 744 P.2d 1242 (1987), the case on which the State based its proposed circumstantial evidence instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b632  Defense counsel's offered jury instruction accurately reflected our holding in <em>Hill </em>and correctly stated the law regarding circumstantial evidence. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 17. We conclude that Racz has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s request of this jury instruction constituted deficient performance and, thus, we find no merit to this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Further, we decline Racz\u2019s suggestion that we reconsider our holdings overruling <em>Ryan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b633 IV. Did the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument constitute prosecutorial misconduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b634 Racz asserts that the prosecutor improperly vouched for Officer Iffland\u2019s credibility during closing arguments and that this constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Racz claims this misconduct deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b635 During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor referenced Officer Iffland\u2019s missing incident report and stated, \u201cOfficer Iffland has no reason to lie about whether he wrote a report or not. ... He was honest throughout his testimony. He did not make a lie to make the case or himself look better; he simply told the truth.\u201d At no time during the closing argument did defense counsel object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments. Instead, Racz\u2019s counsel also commented on Officer Iffland\u2019s and Racz\u2019s credibility, stating \u201c[y]ou heard [the prosecutor] say that Officer Iffland was honest with you, and I think he was. I think he made an honest mistake. But Mr. Racz was also honest with you and he was honest with the police officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b636 An attorney invades the jury\u2019s province and engages in highly improper behavior when an attorney characterizes the defendant or witnesses as liars or offers personal opinions on a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>State v. Hanson, </em>283 Mont. 316, 326, 940 P.2d 1166, 1172 (1997). To properly preserve an issue for appeal, however, the defendant must make a timely objection or it is considered waived. Section 46-20-104, MCA. Racz failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments and thus waived his objection. Having failed to object, Racz requests that we employ our discretionary plain error review and reverse on this issue. Our review of the closing arguments fails to persuade us that the prosecutor\u2019s comments resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice, undermined the trial\u2019s fundamental fairness, or compromised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>judicial process\u2019s integrity. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 20, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 20. We conclude Racz has failed to preserve this argument for appeal and we decline to exercise our discretionary plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b637 V. Does the cumulative error doctrine entitle Racz to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b638 Racz asserts that numerous errors coupled with the State\u2019s weak case, based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, cumulatively impacted the jury and deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Racz argues that the loss of potentially exculpatory evidence, his counsel\u2019s failure to thoroughly question during voir dire, and the burden-shifting jury instruction offered by his counsel are cumulative errors that necessitate reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b639  The cumulative errors doctrine requires reversal if numerous errors, considered together, prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Novak, </em>2005 MT 294, \u00b6 35, 329 Mont. 309, \u00b6 35, 124 P.3d 182, \u00b6 35. The defendant, however, must prove that prejudice exists; mere allegations of error fail to satisfy the doctrine. <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b640  We refuse to apply the cumulative error doctrine to Racz\u2019s claims. The alleged errors were considered separately above and determined to be either without merit or more appropriate for a post-conviction proceeding. The cumulative error doctrine is inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
