We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">\u00b62 Appellants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Nathan Rumph\u2019s garage liability policy did not cover the vehicle accident that injured Christian Nielsen?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred by failing to find that FUMIC was estopped from denying coverage due to FUMIC\u2019s delay in providing a defense of the Rumphs?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b65 3. Whether questions of fact existed to preclude the District Court from entering summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b66 Early in the morning on December 21, 2002, Alex Rumph was involved in a vehicle rollover accident resulting in severe injuries to Christian Nielsen. The uncontested facts indicate that the previous day, Alex had gone to a basketball game, then to a friend\u2019s house, and later to a bowling alley to socialize. Around 11:00 p.m. that night, Alex traveled to a Christmas party at the Bales Ranch. The accident occurred at approximately 4:00 a.m. the following morning as Alex drove himself and three passengers, including Christian, home from the party in a pickup truck owned by Alex\u2019s father, Nathan Rumph. The pickup was titled in Nathan\u2019s name, but was used primarily by Alex.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b67 The Nielsens filed an action against Alex, Nathan, and Nathan\u2019s businesses for injuries sustained by Christian. The Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint alleged claims for negligent entrustment against Nathan, negligence per se against the Biddle Store, Nathan, Alex, and Bales Ranch, and general negligence against Bales Ranch. The amended complaint also alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress suffered by Christian\u2019s parents, Mike and Tammy Nielsen, against all co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b68 Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint alleged that Alex had rendered the seatbelts in the rear seat of his pickup inoperable by installing two large speakers. Because the rear seatbelts were inoperable, the Nielsens alleged, the four occupants all had to ride unbelted in the front seat of the pickup on the night of the accident. The amended complaint also alleged that Alex was too intoxicated to safely drive his pickup when he left the Christmas party at Bales Ranch. The Nielsens and Rumphs eventually settled, the terms of which included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>confession of judgment by the Rumphs, an assignment to the Nielsens of the Rumphs\u2019 rights against their insurers, and a covenant by the Nielsens not to execute on the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b69 Nathan Rumph maintained automobile liability insurance on the pickup truck through National Farmers Union Property and Casualty (NFU). Because Nathan also owned the Cross Ranch Mercantile, Biddle Store, a separate automobile repair business, and his own ranch, Nathan also maintained four FUMIC policies, providing coverage for the general store operation, property damage insurance for the ranch, liability coverage for the ranch, and garage coverage for the automobile repair business. The Rumphs presented the Nielsens\u2019 complaint to both NFU and FUMIC, and NFU undertook defense of Nielsens\u2019 suit. FUMIC denied coverage and initially refused to provide a defense to the Rumphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b610 The Rumphs\u2019 attorney, Brad Anderson, thereafter discovered certain additional facts he believed brought the accident under Nathan\u2019s Commercial Lines Garage Policy. Through the course of multiple letters to FUMIC\u2019s counsel, Mr. Anderson alleged that the seatbelts in Alex\u2019s pickup had been disabled in Nathan\u2019s garage with Nathan\u2019s tools and materials. In those letters Mr. Anderson also characterized Alex, who installed the speakers in his own truck, as an employee of the garage, and contended that the pickup was used for garage-related errands. Appellants argue those facts brought <em>any </em>use of the pickup under the <em>garage </em>policy. However, none of those facts were included in the Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b611 Ultimately, FUMIC accepted the Rumphs\u2019 defense under a reservation of rights and filed this declaratory judgment action in the District Court. Appellants counterclaimed for declaratory relief to enforce the Rumphs\u2019 rights under the four policies, and also alleged breach of contract, violations of the Unfair Claims and Settlement Practices Act, and violation of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, for misrepresenting that FUMIC\u2019s attorney was actively working on the case, when his work was allegedly minimal. FUMIC responded that none of Nathan\u2019s four FUMIC policies provided coverage for Christian Nielsen\u2019s injuries. Appellants ultimately conceded that the general store\u2019s liability policy and the ranch\u2019s property and liability policies did not provide coverage for Christian\u2019s injuries, but maintained that the accident fell within the Commercial Lines Garage Policy because the accident arose from \u201cgarage operations.\u201d The District Court disagreed and granted summary judgment to FUMIC on its declaratory judgment action. The District Court then granted FUMIC summary judgment on Appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>counterclaims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 18, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 18, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 18. Pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56, we apply the same criteria as that applied by the district court: the moving party must establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 18. The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to establish, by more than mere denial or speculation, that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b613 1. Did the District Court correctly determine that Nathan Rumph\u2019s garage liability policy did not cover the vehicle accident that injured Christian Nielsen?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b614  \u201cMontana law is well-settled that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises when a complaint alleges facts which represent a risk covered by the terms of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Blair v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2007 MT 208, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 8, \u00b6 15, 167 P.3d 888, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20). \u201cThe insurance company must look to the allegations of a complaint to determine if coverage exists under an insurance policy, thus giving rise to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20). The duty to defend is independent from and broader than the duty to indemnify, and arises when a complaint alleges facts, which if proven, would result in coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 21. An insurer must defend unless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against the insured does not fall under the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b615 At issue before the District Court was the proper interpretation of Nathan Rumph\u2019s Commercial Lines Garage Policy, and more specifically, that section entitled \u201cOther than Covered Autos.\u201d Appellants argue the injuries suffered by Christian Nielsen arose from \u201cGarage Operations\u201d as defined within that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b616 Nathan Rumph\u2019s garage policy provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">We will pay all sums an \u201cinsured\u201d legally must pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies caused by an \u201caccident\u201d and resulting from \u201cgarage operations\u201d other than the ownership, maintenance or use of covered \u201cautos.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The policy goes on to define an \u201cinsured\u201d as the owner of the policy and the owner\u2019s partners, employees, directors or shareholders while acting within the course and scope of their duties. The policy defines \u201cgarage operations\u201d as \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use of locations for garage business and that portion of the roads or other accesses that adjoin these locations.... \u2018Garage operations\u2019 also include all operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.\u201d It is under the final clause of that definition, regarding \u201coperations necessary or incidental to a garage business,\u201d that Appellants argue the accident involving Christian Nielsen is covered. Alternatively, Appellants argue that the clause is ambiguous and should be construed in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"Akg\">\u00b617 Throughout their brief, Appellants argue that the Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint, when considered \u201ctogether with\u201d or \u201ccoupled with\u201d the facts Mr. Anderson later supplied to FUMIC\u2019s counsel, establishes that Alex Rumph\u2019s disabling of the seatbelts was a \u201cgarage operation.\u201d However, under this Court\u2019s well-settled law, Appellants\u2019 coverage argument cannot be considered as it is presented herein. The Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint makes no reference to Nathan Rumph\u2019s garage or to the fact that Alex allegedly disabled the seatbelts in that garage with the garage\u2019s tools. The amended complaint also fails to allege that Alex was Nathan\u2019s employee, or that the pickup was a \u201cshop vehicle,\u201d as Appellants now contend. Instead, the amended complaint only alleges that Alex disabled the seatbelts, and that he was intoxicated on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b618  It is irrelevant that the amended complaint \u201ctogether with\u201d additional facts may have triggered coverage under the garage liability policy. Montana law requires FUMIC to look to the allegations of the Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint to determine if coverage existed. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20. FUMIC is not required to look outside the complaint to determine if there is coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24. Indeed, in <em>Staples </em>we cautioned that \u201c[ajlthough the insurer is free to look at facts beyond the allegations in the complaint, it does so at its own risk.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24. Based on the facts alleged in the Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint, FUMIC correctly determined that the accident was outside the garage coverage, as no reference was made to anything remotely \u201cnecessary or incidental to a garage business.\u201d In other words, there was an \u201cunequivocal demonstration\u201d that the Nielsens\u2019 claim was not covered by Nathan Rumph\u2019s Commercial Lines Garage Policy. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b619 Because the amended complaint failed to allege any facts connecting Nathan Rumph\u2019s automobile repair business to the accident that injured Christian Nielsen, we decline to address Appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>argument that the phrase \u201coperations necessary or incidental to a garage business\u201d is ambiguous. Accordingly, the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">\u00b620 2. Did the District Court err by failing to find that FUMIC was estopped from denying coverage due to its delay in providing a defense of the Rumphs?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b621 Appellants argue FUMIC was estopped from denying coverage because it \u201cfirst unreasonably refused to supply a defense [to the Rumphs] and then offered a late defense as it aggressively pursued a declaratory judgment action against its insured.\u201d An insurer that unjustifiably refuses to defend is estopped from denying coverage. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b622  While FUMIC may have been slow to the punch in providing a defense, that delay was justified given the absence of facts in the Nielsens\u2019 first complaint indicating a covered event. The amended complaint also failed to allege facts bringing the claim within coverage. Because we hold that the Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint unequivocally demonstrated that the Nielsens\u2019 claim was not covered, no duty to defend arose and FUMIC was not estopped from denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"AkE\">\u00b623 3. Did questions of fact exist to preclude the District Court from entering summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b624 Appellants\u2019 final argument is that, even if FUMIC had no duty to defend, material questions of fact existed as to whether FUMIC conducted a prompt investigation, misrepresented facts, or delayed its denial of coverage. The third alleged error-that FUMIC delayed its denial of coverage-has been resolved under Issue 2, wherein we held that FUMIC\u2019s delay was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b625 Appellants correctly argue that an insurer must conduct a reasonable investigation into claims based on all available information, \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, and that such investigation must be \u201cprompt.\u201d <em>Daily Ditches Irrigation Dist. v. National Sur. Corp., </em>234 Mont. 537, 541, 764 P.2d 1276, 1279 (1988). However, where the complaint clearly demonstrates that no coverage exists, an insurance company fulfills its duty to investigate by reading the complaint. <em>Daily Ditches, </em>234 Mont. at 541-42, 764 P.2d at 1279. The Nielsens\u2019 amended complaint clearly and unequivocally demonstrated that no coverage existed under the Commercial Lines Garage Policy. Therefore, FUMIC satisfied its duty to investigate by reading the amended complaint and thereafter denying coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b626 Finally, Appellants provide no support on appeal for their contention that FUMIC misrepresented facts, and as such, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b627  The District Court correctly granted summary judgment to FUMIC on Appellants\u2019 counterclaims. Because the Nielsens\u2019 claim was not covered by any FUMIC policy, FUMIC is not liable for breach of contract or violations of the Unfair Claims and Settlement Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b282-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
