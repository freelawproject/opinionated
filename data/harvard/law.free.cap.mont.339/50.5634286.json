The court ordered that Marshall would not be eligible for parole until he successfully completes phases I and II of the sex offender treatment program, which he challenges on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in imposing sex offender treatment as a condition of sentence because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">a. The treatment can only be imposed upon one who has either been designated as a sex offender or convicted of a sex crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">b. The condition was not reasonably related to Marshall\u2019s burglary conviction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\u00b64 On January 3, 2004, two months after turning seventeen, Marshall broke into a residence in Boulder, Montana. Cutting his hand in the process, Marshall bled on items throughout the house. He proceeded to break items in the house. Marshall then became aroused after going through a woman\u2019s underwear drawer, took some of the woman\u2019s underwear out of the drawer and masturbated on her bed. Marshall was arrested and charged as an adult with Burglary, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA (2003); Attempted Theft, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a), MCA (2003); and Criminal Mischief, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-101(1)(a), MCA (2003). Marshall pled not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">\u00b65 Marshall\u2019s counsel moved for and was granted a psychiatric evaluation of Marshall by Dr. Robert Page (Dr. Page), a clinical member of the Montana Sex Offender Treatment Association. On October 13, 2004, pursuant to a pre-trial agreement, Marshall entered a plea of guilty to burglary, and the State moved to dismiss the remaining two charged offenses. The District Court accepted the plea and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the remaining offenses. The court imposed a six-year deferred sentence with a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conditions, including that Marshall enroll in and successfully complete all treatment recommended by Dr. Page, including, but not limited to, chemical dependency and sexual offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b66 On February 1, 2005, the State filed a petition to revoke Marshall\u2019s deferred sentence, alleging that he had violated numerous conditions of his deferred sentence, including, at issue here, failure to complete sex offender treatment. Marshall had been terminated from treatment due to his failure to follow the treatment rules. Marshall appeared for a dispositional hearing on the State\u2019s petition to revoke on March 30, 2005. After receiving evidence and arguments from the parties, the District Court concluded that Marshall had violated the terms and conditions of his deferred sentence by failing to remain law abiding, failing to maintain employment, failing to complete treatment with Dr. Page and leaving his assigned district.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b67 A sentencing hearing was held on August 10, 2005. Dr. Page testified regarding the evaluation of Marshall he had conducted approximately fifteen months earlier. During the hearing, the parties stipulated to continue the matter so Dr. Page could provide an updated evaluation. The court allowed Marshall to remain released on bond, but admonished Marshall that he must abide by the bond conditions, including a prohibition on the use of alcohol and the requirement that Marshall remain law abiding. Nonetheless, on September 22, 2005, Marshall was charged with several offenses arising out of the allegation that he had operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, including criminal endangerment, minor in possession, and DUI. The State subsequently moved to revoke Marshall\u2019s bond and requested that the District Court issue a bench warrant for his arrest, which motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b68 On September 27, 2005, Dr. Page filed an updated evaluation. The District Court reconvened the sentencing hearing on October 19, 2005, and heard testimony from Dr. Page and Marshall\u2019s probation officer, Cathy Murphy, of Adult Probation and Parole. Both recommended a more structured sex offender treatment program for Marshall. Dr. Page testified that a prerelease program would provide the structured environment that Marshall needed to complete his sex offender treatment, but further testified that if Marshall was not accepted into a prerelease program, then he should be sent to prison to complete phase I and II of the prison sex offender treatment program. Murphy testified that she did not believe there was any chance that Marshall would be accepted into a prerelease center, since she already had Marshall prescreened for placement in the Billings Prerelease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Center-where she felt he had the best chance of getting in-and he had been denied admission. Consequently, Murphy recommended a ten-year prison sentence with five years suspended and that Marshall be designated as ineligible for parole until he completed phases I and II of the prison sex offender treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the testimony and after the State made its recommendation of a prison sentence with sex offender treatment, Marshall\u2019s counsel argued that the court did not have the authority to order sex offender treatment because Marshall had been convicted of burglary, a non-sex offense. Marshall\u2019s counsel maintained that Marshall would be eligible for sex offender treatment only if he had been convicted of a sex crime and adjudicated a sex offender. The District Court disagreed, stating \u201cthat sex offender treatment is in play, it is a matter to be considered here,\u201d committed Marshall to the Department of Corrections for eight years with four years suspended, and ordered that Marshall would be ineligible for parole until he successfully completed phases I and II of sex offender treatment, as well as chemical dependency treatment, anger management treatment and mental health treatment. The court also designated Marshall a Level I sex offender. Marshall appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a criminal sentence for its legality; \u201cthat is, whether the sentence is within statutory parameters.\u201d <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 317, \u00b6 8, 106 P.3d 521, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 8, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in imposing sex offender treatment as a condition of sentence because:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\n<em>a. The treatment can only be imposed upon one who has either been designated as a sex offender or convicted of a sex crime?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">\u00b612 First, we note that Marshall\u2019s arguments challenging the imposition of sex offender treatment are directed both to his \u201csentence and re-sentence.\u201d However, it is clear that he cannot now appeal his original sentence. The original deferred sentence was imposed on October 13, 2004, and Marshall had sixty days from that date, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 5(b), to appeal to this Court, but did not do so. Therefore, he is precluded from now challenging the legality of the conditions imposed therein. <em>See State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>22, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 22, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 22. Having timely appealed from the sentence imposed upon revocation, Marshall may challenge the conditions of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b613 In the District Court\u2019s October 26, 2005, findings and judgment revoking deferred sentence and re-imposing sentence, the court designated Marshall as a Level I sex offender, following this colloquy at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">The Court: Do the parties wish the Court to make a designation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">Mr. Johnson: Your Honor, the State does not believe it\u2019s necessary, as long as Mr. Morris agrees with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Mr. Morris: I guess if the-Your Honor, as I recall from Dr. Page\u2019s report, he designated Mr. Marshall as having a low risk to re-offend; and based upon that, I think that\u2019s the only thing in the record that the Court could base a designation on. I would urge the Court, if the Court is going to adopt a designation, would be the lowest level, I think Level 1 risk to re-offend designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">The Court: So ordered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b614 Marshall contends the sex offender designation was not validly assigned because a sex offender designation may only be made after a \u201cstrict procedure\u201d is followed, citing \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA. He maintains the statute was not followed here and that the court made a designation based upon argument of the prosecution and not on any record evidence, and thus, Marshall will not be eligible for the prison\u2019s sex offender program and not be able to achieve eligibility for parole. Further, Marshall argues the condition is illegal because that program is limited to defendants convicted of sex crimes or validly designated a sex offender-neither of which Marshall contends occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u00b615 The State responds that \u00a7 46-18-111, MCA, merely requires the presentence investigation to include a psychosexual evaluation and treatment recommendation when the defendant has committed certain named sex offenses, but offers no support for Marshall\u2019s claim that the defendant must receive a sex offender designation or be convicted of a sexual crime prior to undergoing sex offender treatment in prison. The State also maintains that, in any event, the sex offender designation was not based on the prosecutor\u2019s argument, as the prosecutor did not request the designation and instead told the court he did not believe it was necessary, but rather was based upon the evidence offered at the hearing and upon the request of Marshall\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u00b616 Recently, in <em>State v. Leitheiser, </em>2006 MT 70, 331 Mont. 464, 133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>P.3d 185, we affirmed the imposition of sex offender treatment as a condition of Leitheiser\u2019s sentence for assault upon a minor. Leitheiser had argued that because he did not plead guilty to a sex offense, the court lacked authority to impose the condition. However, we concluded that the sentencing court had properly looked to \u201cthe facts underlying the plea to the charge to which Leitheiser pled guilty-that is, assault on a minor.\u201d <em>Leitheiser, </em>\u00b6 24. Leitheiser\u2019s actions had involved sexual contact with the victim. We agreed with the District Court\u2019s statement that it \u201cwould be remiss if it sentenced [Leitheiser] and ignored the underlying factual situation.\u201d <em>Leitheiser, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b617  The underlying factual situation here included sexual actions taken by Marshall during the burglary. Accordingly, the District Court was not precluded from imposing sex offender treatment as a condition of Marshall\u2019s sentence as a matter of law simply because Marshall had not been convicted of a sexual crime. Given this resolution, we need not further address the contention that Marshall was not validly designated a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">b. <em>The condition was not reasonably related to his crime?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b618 Marshall also insists that the sex offender treatment condition is not rationally related to the burglary to which he pled guilty, offering there is \u201cno correlation between the conviction of burglary and the condition of sex offender treatment\u201d and citing <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b619 In <em>Ommundson, </em>a defendant convicted of DUI challenged the District Court\u2019s imposition of sex offender treatment as a condition of his sentence. We reversed the condition, holding that in order to be reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society, a sentencing limitation or condition must have \u201csome correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11. Explaining that the objectives of the sentencing statute, now \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, were \u201c(1) to <em>rehabilitate </em>the offender by imposing restitution or requiring treatment so that he or she does not repeat the same criminal conduct that gave rise to the sentence; and (2) to <em>protect </em>society from further similar conduct,\u201d we noted the absence of evidence that indecent exposure leads to increased occurrences of DUI or that treatment for indecent exposure will reduce the reoccurrence of alcohol abuse or lessen the incidence of DUI in society at large. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 12. We therefore concluded no nexus had been established between the requirement that the defendant participate in a sex offender program and the charged DUI offense. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00b620 Section 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, permits a sentencing court to impose any sentencing limitation \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d The statutory terms \u201crehabilitation\u201d and \u201cprotection of the victim and society\u201d must be read in the context of the charged offense. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>see also State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, \u00b6 11, 335 Mont. 131, \u00b6 11, 151 P.3d 46, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe objectives of \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, are to rehabilitate the offender by imposing restitution or requiring treatment so that he or she does not repeat the same criminal conduct and to protect society from further similar conduct. Thus, a limitation or condition in a sentence must have a correlation or connection to the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11). Stated differently, to be legal, a condition of sentence must have a nexus to the conviction. <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b621 Here, the District Court found that the underlying facts of this burglary form a factual basis for the sex offender treatment requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">This is a burglary. This burglary is hinged upon conduct which has been ascertained to be and admitted to be sexual in nature, and sexually offensive in nature. The unrefuted evidence is that this Defendant should have sexual offender treatment, so the Court considers that as an item which is within the purview of those things which can be ordered as a condition of a sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">In his testimony, Dr. Page opined that \u201c[Marshall] ha[d] admitted to committing a sexual offense.\u201d While burglarizing the house, Marshall went through a woman\u2019s underwear drawer, removed some of her underwear, aroused himself, and then masturbated on her bed. The parties did not dispute that these actions were in accordance with the evaluator\u2019s definition of a deviant sexual act. Dr. Page further noted that this behavior-which he described as \u201cdeviant sexual patterns of arousal masturbatory behavior with the use of female clothing, or particularly female underwear\u201d-\u201cinvolves suggestions of paraphilia, and potential for future deviant sexual actions, without therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b622  We conclude that there was a correlation or nexus between sex offender treatment and the circumstances of this crime, and that the condition was reasonable. Thus, the District Court did not err by imposing the treatment as a condition designed to rehabilitate Marshall and protect society from further offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
