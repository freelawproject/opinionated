We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b62 The Druffels present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the Druffels possess standing to appeal the Missoula City Board of Adjustment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly dismissed the Druffels\u2019 appeal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">\u00b65 The Missoula City Board of Adjustment (the Board) granted a zoning variance to property owner Glen Moyer (Moyer) for his lot at 2702 Thames Street, Missoula. The variance allowed Moyer to build a residence on the 4,800-square-foot lot despite particular zoning restrictions that require a minimum lot size of 5,400 square feet to build a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">\u00b66 The Druffels live more than two blocks from Moyer\u2019s property. They filed in District Court an application for writ of certiorari and petition to appeal the Board\u2019s decision. The Druffels alleged that the Board\u2019s variance approval constituted an abuse of discretion that violated the Druffels\u2019 due process rights, Montana law, and Missoula City ordinances. The court issued the writ of certiorari and ordered the Board to submit certified transcripts of the record and proceedings surrounding the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b67 The Board submitted the certified copies and moved to dismiss the Druffels\u2019 appeal under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Board argued that the Druffels lacked standing to pursue such an appeal based on the fact that the Druffels are not landowners involved in the Board\u2019s decision or neighboring landowners. The Board also challenged the Druffels\u2019 standing based on their failure to establish any specific harm or prejudice that would result from the Board\u2019s grant of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b68 The court granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the Druffels lacked standing to appeal the Board\u2019s decision based on the fact that the Druffels alleged no injury other than a deprivation \u201cof their right to orderly development of property zoned as residential.\u201d The court alternatively dismissed the Druffels\u2019 appeal under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Druffels appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s ruling on standing constitutes a conclusion of law. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Sunburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, Inc., </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 28, 338 Mont. 259, \u00b6 28, 165 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 28. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Guest v. McLaverty, </em>2006 MT 150, \u00b6 2, 332 Mont. 421, \u00b6 2, 138 P.3d 812, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b6 10 <em>Whether the Druffels possess standing to appeal the Missoula City Board of Adjustment decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\u00b611 The Druffels argue that the District Court improperly concluded that they lacked standing to challenge the Board\u2019s decision. The Druffels maintain that they possess standing under \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. This statute grants \u201cany taxpayer\u201d the right to petition a court of record to set forth alleged illegalities in the Board\u2019s decision. Section 76-2-327(1), MCA. The Druffels point to <em>Stewart v. Bd. of Cty. Com\u2019rs of Big Horn Cty., </em>175 Mont. 197, 200, 573 P.2d 184, 186 (1977), in arguing this Court long has held that taxpayers possess standing to challenge \u201cthe legality of public acts\u201d even when no specific statutory authority exists to maintain an action. The Druffels maintain that <em>Stewart, </em>coupled with the legislature\u2019s express grant of taxpayer standing in \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, confers standing upon them to appeal the Board\u2019s decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00b612 The Board counters that the Druffels must allege some type of specific harm regardless of any statutory grant of standing in \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. The Board cites to a number of cases, including <em>Chovanak v. Matthews, </em>120 Mont. 520, 188 P.2d 582 (1948), <em>Carbon County v. Schwend, </em>182 Mont. 89, 594 P.2d 1121 (1979), and <em>Fleenor v. Darby School Dist., </em>2006 MT 31, 331 Mont. 124, 128 P.3d 1048, to support its position that taxpayers generally lack standing to enforce a public right or redress a public wrong absent an allegation of harm. The Board also relies on <em>Stewart </em>to contend that the Druffels, in order to have standing to sue a governmental entity, must \u201callege past, present or threatened injury to a property or civil right\u201d that differs from an injury to the general public. <em>Stewart, </em>175 Mont. at 201, 573 P.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b613 None of the cases on which the Board relies entail actions brought under a specific statutory grant of standing. For instance, <em>Chovanak </em>concerns a taxpayer\u2019s constitutional challenge to a statute. <em>Chovanak, </em>130 Mont. at 522-23, 188 P.2d at 583. We held in <em>Carbon County </em>that an individual taxpayer cannot enforce a public right or redress a public injury by appeal where the taxpayer suffers only an injury common to all other taxpayers. <em>Carbon County, </em>182 Mont. at 98-99, 594 P.2d at 1127. <em>Fleenor </em>involves a taxpayer\u2019s action brought against a school district for an alleged violation of the right-to-know provision of the Montana Constitution. The taxpayer had failed to allege any injury in her complaint, let alone an injury unique to her, and thus we held that she lacked standing to challenge the school district\u2019s action. <em>Fleenor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. No statute authorized the taxpayer actions in <em>Chovanak, Fleenor, </em>and <em>Carbon County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b614 Moreover, the Druffels, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Stewart, </em>do not bring suit against a governmental entity. The Druffels instead request judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. We recognized in <em>Stewart </em>that the concept of standing arises from two different doctrines: first, discretionary doctrines intended to manage judicial review of the legality of public acts and, second, constitutional doctrines drawn from Article III of the United States Constitution. <em>Stewart, </em>175 Mont. at 200, 573 P.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b615 The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 731-32, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 1364-65 (1972), the requirements to meet standing under the judicial review doctrine. The Court determined that where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">Congress has authorized public officials to perform certain functions according to law, and has provided by statute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>judicial review of those actions under certain circumstances, the inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><em>Sierra Club, </em>405 U.S. at 732, 92 S. Ct. at 1364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The Court first examined the words of the particular statute under which the parties sought review. The Court then determined whether the party seeking review could be brought within the meaning of the statute by considering whether the party alleged sufficient facts to show a direct stake in the outcome. <em>Sierra Club, </em>405 U.S. at 739, 92 S. Ct. at 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b616 No question exists here as to whether the Druffels fall within the meaning of the statute that grants parties the authority to petition for judicial review. Section 76-2-327(1), MCA, specifically authorizes \u201cany person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment or <em>any taxpayer or </em>any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality\u201d to petition a court of record to set forth allegations of illegality in the Board\u2019s decision. (Emphasis added). We must construe statutes as written. <em>Mont. for Justice v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 53, 334 Mont. 237, \u00b6 53, 146 P.3d 759, \u00b6 53. We neither insert that which has been omitted nor omit that which has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. \u201cThe plain language of the statute controls our interpretation if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Boettcher v. Montana Guar. Fund, </em>2007 MT 69, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 393, \u00b6 19, 154 P.3d 629, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b617  The plain meaning of \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, reveals the legislature\u2019s intent to grant two classes of parties the right to petition the district court concerning alleged illegalities in the Board\u2019s decision. The statute first grants any persons, even those who do not qualify as taxpayers of the municipality, the right to petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision if they have been aggrieved by such decision. Section 76-2-327(1), MCA. The statute also grants <em>\u201cany taxpayer </em>or any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality\u201d the right to petition for review. Section 76-2-327(1), MCA. (Emphasis added). The legislature, through the plain language of \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, granted the Druffels standing, as taxpayers of the municipality, to petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision. We reverse the court\u2019s decision that the Druffels lacked standing to file a petition for judicial review under \u00a7 76-2-327. MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court properly dismissed the Druffels\u2019 appeal for failure to state a claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b619 We address first the Druffels\u2019 procedural argument that M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) represents a \u201cnonsensical claim\u201d in an appeal to the district court. The Druffels point out that their claim involves an appeal, not a civil action to which the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure would apply. They assert that, even if the motion to dismiss constituted proper procedure, the Board waived its right to pursue such a motion under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) in light of the fact that the Board filed the motion after the court had issued the writ of certiorari. The Druffels argue that \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA, compels the court, upon issuing the writ of certiorari, to review the Board\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">\u00b620 The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cdo not supersede the provisions of statutes relating to appeals to or review by the district courts, but shall govern procedure and practice\u201d relating to the appeal to the district court insofar as the rules of civil procedure are not inconsistent with such statutes. M. R. Civ. P. 81(b). The Druffels\u2019 appeal made its way to the District Court by a writ of certiorari issued under \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. Section 76-2-327, MCA, sets forth the specific procedures in the event of an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b621 Section 76-2-327(2), MCA, requires the Board to submit to the court certified copies of the documents involved in the proceedings. The Board also may set forth \u201csuch other facts as may be pertinent and material\u201d to the grounds of the decision from which the adverse party takes an appeal. Section 76-2-327(2), MCA. The statute further provides the court with discretion to take testimony and evidence as it deems necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b622 Nothing in M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) conflicts with the procedures for review outlined in \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. In fact, \u00a7 76-2-327(2) allows the Board the opportunity to raise \u201csuch other facts\u201d concerning the appeal. The Board presented \u201csuch other facts\u201d in the form of a motion to dismiss based on its allegations that the Druffels\u2019 petition failed to meet the requirements for review allowed under \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. We conclude that the District Court properly considered the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) in light of the fact that M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) presents no inconsistency with \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. M. R. Civ. P. 81(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b623 We next consider whether the court correctly dismissed the Druffels\u2019 appeal for failure to state a claim. The Druffels argue that the petition was \u201cwell pled\u201d upon facts showing that the Board\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. The Druffels contend that they met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the statutory requirements for filing a petition by specifically setting forth alleged illegalities that may have flawed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">\u00b624 A petitioner may challenge only the legality of the Board\u2019s decision under \u00a7 76-2-327, MCA. The petitioner must file a verified petition \u201cspecifying the grounds of the illegality.\u201d Section 76-2-327(1), MCA. In considering a motion to dismiss, we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, taking all allegations of fact in the complaint as true. <em>Hall v. State, </em>2006 MT 37, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 171, \u00b6 10, 130 P.3d 601, \u00b6 10. We will affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal if we conclude that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief based on any set of facts that could be proven to support the claim. <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b625 The Druffels\u2019 petition alleges that the Board failed to place the burden of proof on Moyer to prove all of the elements for a variance as required by \u00a7 76-2-323, MCA, and Missoula City Ordinance \u00a7 19.84.020. The Druffels contend the Board wrongfully considered proof offered by the City of Missoula Office of Planning and Grants staff report.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b626 Section 76-2-323, MCA, and Missoula City Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 19.84.020, set forth the powers of the Board to consider an appeal. Nothing in \u00a7 76-2-323, MCA, mentions burden of proof for the granting of a variance. Section 19.84.020 establishes that the appealing party must present sufficient evidence to establish a record. The provision does not preclude the Board, however, from considering the city\u2019s staff report as part of such record. No set of facts could support the Druffels\u2019 claim that the Board failed to enforce the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b627  The Druffels also argue that the Board neglected its duty to consider whether Moyer must comply with a 20-foot setback requirement on his backyard under Missoula City Zoning Ordinances despite the variance granted on the lot size. The Druffels fail to recognize, however, that an exception to the setback requirement under Missoula City Zoning Ordinance \u00a7 19.04.220 applies to Moyer\u2019s lot. Section 19.04.220 provides an exception to the 20-foot setback requirement for a backyard where the parcel is a corner lot and contains a front yard and a side yard. Moyer\u2019s comer lot contains a front yard and a side yard and the Board properly determined that \u00a7 19.04.220 required no backyard under those circumstances. The Druffels\u2019 petition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted even when taking all the allegations contained in the petition in the light most favorable to the Druffels. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00b628  The Druffels next allege that the Board violated their constitutional due process rights by rendering its decision before the March 22, 2006, hearing on Moyer\u2019s variance request. The record attached to the Druffels\u2019 petition, however, shows that the Board granted approval of the variance at the March 22, 2006, hearing. No set of facts alleged in the Druffels\u2019 petition supports their claim that Moyer\u2019s variance had been granted before the hearing date. <em>Guest, </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b629  We conclude that the District Court improperly determined that the Druffels lacked standing to pursue an appeal of the Board\u2019s decision. Section 76-2-327, MCA, specifically conferred standing to the Druffels, as taxpayers of the municipality, to challenge the legality of the Board\u2019s decision. We further conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the Druffels\u2019 petition, however, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
