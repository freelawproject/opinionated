We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">\u00b63 Did the introduction of S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements violate Spencer\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">\u00b64 Did the District Court fail to comply with \u00a7 46-16-220, MCA, regarding the admissibility of child hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in excluding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s videotaped testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-17\">\u00b66 Bill and Lisa Weaver became foster parents of Spencer\u2019s infant daughter, T.S., twenty-two-month-old daughter, R.S., and three-and-a-half-year-old stepdaughter, S.S., on April 2, 2004. Shortly after beginning foster care, Lisa repeatedly observed S.S. and R.S. exhibiting sexualized behavior, such as masturbating, trying to touch other\u2019s breasts and genitals, trying to insert toys and other objects into their vaginas, and sexually playing with toys, dolls, T.S., and one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-18\">\u00b67 In May 2004, the Weavers informed Roger Johnson, a social worker with the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), of the girls\u2019 behavior, and he referred them to Dr. Nora Gerrity, a pediatrician, to determine whether the children had been abused. Dr. Gerrity physically examined R.S. and S.S. and discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>slight irregularities in R.S.\u2019s hjunen and a Ml transection in S.S.\u2019s hymen, consistent with a penetrating injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b68 Following the examinations with Dr. Gerrity, R.S. and S.S. began seeing Maggie Moffatt, a licensed clinical professional counselor. During the counseling sessions, S.S. made several statements indicating that Spencer had sexually abused S.S. Ms. Moffatt reported these statements to Johnson, who then reported this information to law enforcement. S.S. made similar statements to Lisa Weaver, S.S.\u2019s foster mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b69 The State charged Spencer with sexual intercourse without consent on June 8, 2004. The State later added a second count of sexual intercourse without consent for the alleged sexual abuse of R.S. Spencer pled not guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b610 The State filed on September 29, 2004, its first notice of intent to introduce S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements made to Ms. Moffatt, if S.S. was unavailable for trial. The State later filed a second and third notice to introduce S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements made to Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver. At an evidentiary hearing on January 3, 2005, the State and Spencer stipulated that S.S. would be \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify. Following briefing on the hearsay statements\u2019 admissibility, the District Court ruled that S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements could be admitted through the testimony of Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver. The State then filed a fourth notice of intent to introduce S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements made to Ms. Moffatt; this motion was orally granted at trial. At trial, the District Court also granted the State\u2019s motion to exclude video testimony of Dr. Michael Scolatti, a licensed clinical psychologist, whose testimony indicated that Spencer did not meet the diagnostic criteria of a pedophile. Spencer\u2019s jury trial began March 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b611 Ms. Moffatt testified about several statements S.S. made regarding sexual abuse and Spencer. Moffatt testified that on one occasion, in response to a question about naps, S.S.\u2019s \u201c \u2018eyes got really big and she said Kirk makes me rest on the couch and then he puts his potty thing inside me.\u2019 She says \u2018right here\u2019 and she points to her private area with her finger, \u2018and it hurts really lots.\u2019 \u201d Ms. Moffatt testified that S.S. told her that Kirk was \u201cmy dad.\u201d According to Ms. Moffatt, S.S. referred to \u201cKirk\u201d or \u201cmy dad or my daddy\u201d when discussing sexual behavior. Ms. Moffatt further testified that S.S. claimed that no one except her dad had ever touched her that way and that, \u201cDaddy told me not to tell anyone what he did.\u201d Ms. Moffatt also testified that S.S. related instances of Spencer performing oral sex on S.S. and R.S. Ms. Moffatt testified that S.S.\u2019s statements were unexpected and that she had not used leading questions or coaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>techniques to elicit S.S.\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b612 Lisa Weaver testified that on one occasion when Lisa was tucking S.S. in for bed, S.S. spontaneously stated that her \u201cmy daddy, my other daddy, stuck his pee-er in me and it hurt real bad[.]\u201d Lisa testified that she understood \u201cother daddy\u201d to mean Spencer. On another occasion, while S.S. and T.S. were playing in their play tent, Lisa overheard S.S. say, \u201c[n]ow, [T.S.], you lie down like this. It doesn\u2019t hurt-this is how Kirk does it[.]\u201d Lisa testified that she opened the tent and saw T.S. lying on her back with her legs lying wide open.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b613 The jury found Spencer guilty of sexual intercourse without consent with S.S. and not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent with R.S. The court sentenced Spencer to thirty-five years in Montana State Prison. Spencer appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b614 We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, \u00b6 8, 127 P.3d 458, \u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 8. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employing conscientious judgment, or \u201cexceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Matz, </em>2006 MT 348, \u00b6 34, 335 Mont. 201, \u00b6 34, 150 P.3d 367, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b615 I. Did the introduction of S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements violate Spencer\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b616 Spencer claims that the District Court incorrectly ruled that S.S.\u2019s statements to Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver were non-testimonial and thus implicated Montana hearsay law, rather than the Sixth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees criminal defendants the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them. Testimonial hearsay statements are inadmissible unless the declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d for trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford v. Wash., </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1374 (2004). The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause applies only to testimonial hearsay. <em>Davis v. Wash., </em>126 S. Ct. 2266, 2274-75 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b617  We discussed in <em>Mizenko </em>what constitutes a testimonial statement. In general, a declarant\u2019s statements are presumed testimonial if they are knowingly made to a police officer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>government agent. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. A statement is presumed non-testimonial, however, if the declarant had \u201cobjective reason to believe\u201d that the statement served only \u201cto avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger\u201d and the agent receiving the statement lacked intent to create evidence. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. A statement made to a nongovernmental agent is non-testimonial <em>unless </em>the declarant had \u201cclear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant[.]\u201d <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. Thus, whether the declarant\u2019s statement was to a governmental agent or to a non-governmental agent determines which standard applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b618 Spencer claims that Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver were acting under color of law as State investigators for the purpose of criminally prosecuting him. Spencer bases this assertion primarily on the fact that foster parents and social workers are statutorily required to report child abuse or neglect to DPHHS. Section 41-3-201, MCA. Spencer further asserts that law enforcement waited for and completely relied on results from Ms. Moffatt\u2019s interviews with S.S. and R.S. to identify Spencer. Based on these assertions, Spencer claims that his criminal prosecution is the result of a \u201cjoint investigation\u201d by law enforcement, the Fergus County Attorney, DPHHS, Ms. Moffatt, and the Weavers. Spencer further argues that because S.S.\u2019s statements to Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver were made during this \u201cjoint investigation,\u201d the statements are testimonial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">\u00b619 Though we can conceive of factual circumstances that could support an \u201cunder color of law\u201d argument, Spencer has offered scant evidence to support his conclusory statements. Spencer is correct that \u00a7 41-3-201, MCA, requires foster parents and social workers to report suspected child abuse or neglect. In addition to foster parents and social workers, the statute also requires reporting by physicians, residents, interns, and other hospital staff; nurses, osteopaths, chiropractors, podiatrists, medical examiners, coroners, dentists, optometrists, and other health or mental health professionals; religious healers; school teachers and school employees; day-care facility staff; and, clergy members, among others. Section 41-3-201, MCA. There is no indication, however, that the Legislature intended to deputize this litany of professionals and individuals into law enforcement, and we refuse to attach that significance to the duty to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b620 Moreover, the trial testimony belies Spencer\u2019s claim of a \u201cjoint investigation.\u201d Ms. Moffatt is employed as a counselor with a private practice, not the State. She counsels children and adults on a variety of issues, including depression, anxiety, and abuse. Ms. Moffatt testified that she began seeing S.S. and R.S. in May 2004 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>continued to see S.S. and R.S. after Spencer was charged, including up to the time of her testimony. She testified that she counsels the children on issues other than sexual abuse, including basic memory and learning skills. Ms. Moffatt testified that S.S.\u2019s initial statements regarding sexual abuse were unexpected and not the product of coaching or leading questions. Ms. Moffatt further testified that she did not know who \u201cKirk\u201d was when S.S. declared that \u201cKirk... puts his potty thing inside me ... and it hurts really lots.\u201d It was only later, again in response to a non-leading question, that S.S. identified \u201cKirk\u201d as her dad. Though the record indicates that Spencer was charged the day after Ms. Moffatt communicated Spencer\u2019s identity to DPHHS, Ms. Moffatt\u2019s testimony indicated she was unaware that law enforcement awaited the results of her interviews with S.S. and R.S. before charging Spencer. We conclude that Ms. Moffatt served solely as a counselor to S.S. and R.S. and did not function as a State investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"ACt\">\u00b621 Lisa Weaver testified that as a licensed foster parent she was trained to write things down that seemed important and to contact the DPHHS social worker if problems persisted. Lisa testified that if she encountered such issues she usually contacted Roger Johnson, a DPHHS social worker, so that she could learn how to best help S.S. and R.S. Lisa\u2019s testimony indicated that she contemplated S.S. and R.S. living with the Weavers permanently and that she spoke with Ms. Moffatt about how to build trust for the future. Lisa described as \u201cout of the blue\u201d S.S.\u2019s statement that \u201cmy daddy, my other daddy, stuck his pee-er in me and it hurt real bad[.]\u201d Lisa further testified that she did not ask follow-up questions because her job is to give the children a good home life not to be a counselor. Our review of the record indicates that Lisa Weaver heard S.S.\u2019s statements in her capacity as a foster parent, not as a State investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b622 Having determined that Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver were not acting as governmental agents when they heard S.S.\u2019s statements, <em>Mizenko </em>counsels that S.S.\u2019s statements are non-testimonial <em>unless </em>she had \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d the statement would be used against Spencer in court. <em>Mizenko, </em>\u00b6 23. However, the <em>Mizenko </em>\u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard as applied to a three-and-a-half-year-old childdeclarant is unworkable; it is strained, awkward, and easily capable of abuse. We find the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Davis </em>helpful in resolving this issue. In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in police interrogations, a statement\u2019s classification as testimonial or non-testimonial depends largely on the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interrogation producing the statement, based on objective circumstances. 126 S. Ct. at 2273-74. If the interrogation\u2019s primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>purpose is to aid police in an ongoing emergency, the statements are non-testimonial; if the interrogation\u2019s primary purpose is to establish past facts potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution, the statements are testimonial. <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b623 Applying <em>Davis\u2019s </em>reasoning to this case, the objective circumstances indicate that when Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver heard 5.5. \u2019s statements the primary purpose of their interactions with S.S. and R.S. were counseling and parenting, respectively. Ms. Moffatt\u2019s interactions with S.S. and R.S. took place in her office, often while she played on the floor with them. As discussed in \u00b6 20, Ms. Moffatt\u2019s purpose was to help counsel S.S. and R.S. Based on these circumstances, the primary purpose of Ms. Moffatt\u2019s interaction with S.S. and R.S. was to provide them counseling, not to establish past facts from them for use in Spencer\u2019s prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b624 Similarly, Lisa Weaver interacted with S.S. and R.S. in the home. Lisa was tucking S.S. into bed when S.S. stated that her \u201cother daddy\u201d had abused her. Lisa overheard S.S.\u2019s statement to T.S.-to \u201clie down like this. It doesn\u2019t hurt - - this is how Kirk does it\u201d-while the girls were playing and she was getting camping supplies together. In essence, the primary purpose for Lisa\u2019s interactions with S.S. and R.S. was parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b625  We hold that S.S.\u2019s statements were non-testimonial. Thus, the introduction of S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements did not violate Spencer\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b626 II. Did the District Court fail to comply with \u00a7 46-16-220, MCA, regarding the admissibility of child hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b627 Spencer asserts that the District Court failed to hold a hearing addressing the trustworthiness of S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements and failed to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law setting forth its reasoning for admitting S.S.\u2019s statements; thus, Spencer argues, the District Court failed to comply with Montana\u2019s child hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u00b628 The District Court held a hearing on January 3, 2005, in which the State and Spencer questioned Ms. Moffatt and Lisa Weaver regarding S.S.\u2019s statements. At the hearing, Spencer\u2019s counsel stated in a question to Ms. Moffatt, \u201cI will try not to repeat what [the prosecutor] has already gone through because he has done a good job in looking at the <em>statutory criteria that the Judge needs to look at.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Then, after allowing supplemental briefing, the District Court issued its order admitting S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements on March 8, 2005. We find no error in the District Court\u2019s hearing process. \u00b629 The admissibility of non-testimonial hearsay statements is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>governed by the individual states\u2019 hearsay laws. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S. Ct. at 1374. Section 46-16-220, MCA, sets forth the requirements for admitting child hearsay in Montana criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b630  A district court may admit a child-victim\u2019s hearsay in criminal cases if the child is unavailable as a witness; the hearsay is evidence of a material fact, and more probative than any other available evidence; the offering party gives proper notice of the statement; and the court finds the statement has circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. Section 46-16-220, MCA. If these elements are met, the statute then instructs a court to set forth its reasoning on the admissibility of the child-hearsay in findings of fact and conclusions of law. Section 46-16-220, MCA. The statute specifically instructs courts to consider the child-victim\u2019s attributes, information regarding the testifying witness, information regarding the statement, corroborating evidence, and other considerations. Section 46-16-220, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b631 In this case, the District Court issued a twelve-page order setting forth its reasoning regarding the admissibility of S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements. The District Court noted that the parties had stipulated to S.S.\u2019s unavailability. The District Court adopted as findings of fact the State\u2019s three \u201cNotice[s] of Intent to Introduce Hearsay Statements,\u201d which contained detailed descriptions of the hearsay statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court also concluded that S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements were the most probative evidence because the crime \u201cleft only modest physical evidence.\u201d The District Court then proceeded to analyze one-by-one the factors listed in \u00a7 46-16-220, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">1. The Attributes of the Child Hearsay Declarant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">a. The child\u2019s age: S.S. was approximately three and one-half years old when she made the initial statement to her counselor and her foster mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">b. The child\u2019s ability to communicate verbally: S.S.\u2019s ability to communicate was slightly less than age appropriate and, according to her counselor, difficult to understand at times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">c. The child\u2019s ability to comprehend the statements or questions of others: Again, age appropriate, but marginal compared to a typical competent witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">d. The child\u2019s ability to tell the difference between truth and falsehood: Probably age appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>e. The child\u2019s motivation to tell the truth (i.e., whether the child understands the general obligation to speak truthfully and not fabricate stories): There is no reason to believe that S.S. does not love her father or that she would want him to get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">f. Whether the child possessed sufficient mental capacity at the time of the alleged incident to receive an accurate impression of it: S.S. apparently received an accurate impression of what had happened to her, as evidenced by the repetition of similar facts on separate occasions, one being with no adults present whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">g. Whether the child possesses sufficient memory to retain an independent recollection of the events at issue: S.S. repeated the allegations several times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">2. The Witness Relating the Hearsay Statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">a. The witness\u2019s relationship to the child: The witnesses who would testify about their conversations with S.S. are her foster mother and her counselor. There is also an audiotape which is not altogether clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">b. Whether the relationship between the witness and the child might have an impact on the trustworthiness of the hearsay statement: This seems very unlikely given the manner and timing of the various statements; emphasizing again that the same facts were revealed in circumstances where the child did not know an adult was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">c. Whether the witness might have a motive to fabricate or distort the child\u2019s statement: No, neither the counselor nor the foster mother showed any animosity to the father and genuinely appeared to want to represent the statements as accurately as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">d. The circumstances under which the witness heard the child\u2019s statement, including the timing of the statement in relation to the incident at issue and the availability of another person in whom the child could confide: The first statement was made at an unknown time after the crime. By clear and convincing evidence, this Court finds and concludes that the child\u2019s counselor maintained a strict patient-counselor relationship and at no point did this counselor become an interrogator or interviewer. She was first, foremost and always a therapist. Given that, the child\u2019s revelation to Ms. Moffatt is deemed by this Court to have been at a reasonable time after the incidents and that no one else was available for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>revelation except the foster mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">The Court wants to specifically note that it has had frequent recourse to the testimony of Ms. Moffatt. Not only is she highly credible, reliable and professional, there are few witnesses whose testimony this Court would deem more trustworthy. While the Court finds and concludes that the revelations to the foster mother also were made in reasonable relation to the incidents and that she was clearly one of the few people in this child\u2019s life she could trust or could make such statements to, the indicia of reliability is even higher here. As noted above, the foster mother overheard S.S. tell her <em>1\u00bd </em>year old sister, \u201cLay down, this won\u2019t hurt, this is how Kirk does it.\u201d The circumstances of that revelation bear a very high indicia of reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">3. The Statement Itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">a. Whether the statement contains knowledge not normally attributed to a child of the declarant\u2019s age: It is unknown whether a child of S.S.\u2019s age would typically be able to conceive of having her private parts licked or probed. It would be the height of irrationality to deem it otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">b. Whether it was volunteered spontaneously: The initial statements to the counselor and the foster mother were volunteered. The subsequent statements were also volunteered. The statements were each and all highly similar. These were not interviews or interrogations which gave rise to the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">c. The suggestiveness of prior statements by the witness relating the statement or third parties present when the statement was made: This Court specifically rejects any contention that there was suggestion implanted prior to any of these statements or that the presence of a third person might have stimulated them - there was no third person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">d. If statements were made by the child to more than one person and were very consistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">4. Other Considerations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">The particular facts of a case may present the court with considerations other than those outlined above that in the court\u2019s judgment will bear on the admissibility of the proffered testimony: It is inconceivable that a child of <em>3\u00bd </em>would have the sexual knowledge and behaviors exhibited here. That is a persuasive consideration. Exceptionally persuasive was the statement made by S.S. to her sister and overheard by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>foster mother. Reflecting as it did the precise statements made at other times to both the foster mother and the counselor, this constitutes a fundamental consideration which leads this Court to conclude that the statements of S.S. have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Cross-examination of S.S. about these statements would be of decidedly marginal utility and would in fact be destructive of the very fragile psyche of this young child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b632  After considering all the factors required by statute, the District Court determined that S.S.\u2019s statements were admissible through Ms. Moffatt\u2019s and Lisa Weaver\u2019s testimony. Though the District Court did not specifically label a heading \u201cfindings of fact\u201d and \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d we cannot say that the District Court acted arbitrarily, without employing conscientious judgment, or that its decision exceeded the bounds of reason and resulted in substantial injustice. <em>Matz, </em>\u00b6 34. We hold that the District Court adequately complied with \u00a7 46-16-220, MCA, and did not abuse its discretion in admitting S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b633 We note further that the District Court did not discuss the \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d factors in light of our holding in <em>State v. S.T.M. </em>that corroborating evidence could no longer be considered in assessing a hearsay statement\u2019s reliability. 2003 MT 221, \u00b6 34, 317 Mont. 159, \u00b6 34, 75 P.3d 1257, \u00b6 34. We decided <em>S.T.M. </em>prior to <em>Crawford </em>and our holding was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>in Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S. Ct. 3139 (1990). We removed the corroborating evidence factor because we could not \u201cconceive of a case in which the admission of the hearsay statements of an alleged victim of child sexual abuse would not implicate the Confrontation Clause as well as the rule against hearsay.\u201d <em>S. T.M., </em>\u00b6 34. The Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis </em>recently have clarified that the Confrontation Clause only applies to testimonial statements; thus, it is now entirely conceivable that a hearsay statement that fails to implicate the Confrontation Clause may nevertheless be inadmissible hearsay. <em>Davis, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2274-75. However, the \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d factor does not affect the case before us; the District Court\u2019s lack of \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d analysis could only advantage Spencer because the District Court did not consider as evidence S.S.\u2019s and R.S.\u2019s physical injuries discovered by Dr. Gerrity. Thus, we leave for another day an analysis of S.T.M.\u2019s continued vitality. In light of <em>Crawford, </em>however, we note that courts must again consider Confrontation Clause and hearsay challenges independently, contrary to our announcement in <em>S.T.M., </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00b634 III. Did the District Court err in excluding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s videotaped testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b635 Spencer claims that the District Court erred in excluding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s videotaped testimony in which Dr. Scolatti stated that Spencer lacked the diagnostic criteria of a pedophile. Spencer argues that Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony served to rebut the mental state element of sexual intercourse without consent. Spencer directs us to \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, in support of his contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">When a... licensed clinical psychologist... who has examined the defendant testifies concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition, the ... licensed clinical psychologist... may make a statement as to the nature of the examination and the medical or psychological diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b636 Spencer\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, is misplaced. When read in its proper context, \u00a7 46-14-213, MCA, applies only if mental disease or defect is an issue or if a defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed is in question. Section 46-14-213, MCA. Our review of the record reveals neither of these issues exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b637 The District Court excluded Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony as improper character evidence -under M. R. Evid. 404. Though we note that Rule 404 contains an exception that allows a defendant to offer pertinent character evidence, we cannot say the District Court excluded Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony arbitrarily, or without employing conscientious judgment, or that its decision exceeded the bounds of reason and resulted in substantial injustice. <em>Matz, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b638 Spencer argues on appeal, as he did below, that Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony served to generally rebut the mental states of purposely and knowingly. The District Court rej ected this contention, stating that the testimony was \u201cdistinctly not about the Defendant\u2019s mental condition but about his not being a member of a diagnostic group-pedophiles.\u201d The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">Defendant argues that because he was diagnosed as not being a pedophile, he could not have the requisite intent. That clearly was a matter for the province of the jury. Given that the \u201cdiagnostic criteria\u201d here was less a diagnosis of mental condition and more whether the Defendant was or was not includable in that grouping called pedophiles and thus whether he could or could not exhibit behaviors of members or non-members of that class, it would be impermissible testimony before the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u00b639 Our review of Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that such testimony would be improper in this case. Moreover, we question the relevance of Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>whether it could have assisted the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b640 Though Dr. Scolatti conducted a number of tests and psychological evaluations, much of his testimony focused on the Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest test (the Abel test). The Abel test consists of two-parts: (1) a questionnaire focusing on a variety of areas including demographics, sexual-interest, social desirability, and the problematic thinking of sex offenders; and (2) a test measuring the visual reaction time to a series of slides that feature various gender and age categories. In his testimony, Dr. Scolatti stated that the Abel test is controversial among researchers and that he thought the test could be \u201cbeaten.\u201d He also stated that, when applied to an existing offender group, the Abel test identified child molesters \u201cwith different levels of success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b641 Dr. Scolatti further testified that Spencer did not have the diagnostic criteria of a pedophile based, in part, on the fact that \u201cSpencer ... did not tell me he had any sort of sexual interest pattern or sexual interest or arousal to children in fantasy.\u201d Finally, Dr. Scolatti observed that not all people who commit sex crimes have a deviant interest pattern and that a person could fail to meet the criteria of a pedophile yet still sexually abuse a child. We conclude that whatever relevance Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony may have possessed, the dangers of confusing the issues or misleading the jury substantially outweighed its probative value, and thus it ran afoul of M. R. Evid. 403. We will uphold a district comet\u2019s correct decision even if its reasoning was incorrect. <em>State v. Rensvold, </em>2006 MT 146, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 392, \u00b6 34, 139 P.3d 154, \u00b6 34. Based on our review of the District Court order and Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony, we hold that the District Court acted within its discretion in excluding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b642  We conclude that S.S.\u2019s statements were non-testimonial and did not implicate Spencer\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Additionally, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting S.S.\u2019s hearsay statements and excluding Dr. Scolatti\u2019s testimony. We affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\"> As discussed in \u00b6 10, the District Court granted the State\u2019s fourth notice of intent (filed March 10, 2004) at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
