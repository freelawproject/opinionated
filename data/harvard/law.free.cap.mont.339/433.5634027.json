We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is as follows: Does the District Court\u2019s written judgment and commitment conform to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">\u00b63 On October 29, 1993, Garland was charged by information with one count of deliberate homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. This charge stemmed from an October 22, 1993 incident in which Garland shot and killed his wife, Nina Jean Garland. Garland pleaded not guilty to the charge on November 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">\u00b64 On March 16, 1994, Garland changed his plea to guilty of one count of mitigated deliberate homicide. The District Court, the Honorable Dorothy McCarter presiding, ordered a presentence investigation and set Garland\u2019s sentencing hearing for April 26, 1994. Present at that hearing were Judge McCarter, Lewis and Clark County Attorney Mike McGrath, Garland, and his attorney, J. Mayo Ashley. Initially, Judge McCarter imposed a 30-year sentence for mitigated deliberate homicide and a 10-year sentence for use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of this offense and ordered these sentences to be served consecutively. Judge McCarter then explained her reasoning behind the sentence as well as the conditions on Garland\u2019s parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">\u00b65 After doing so, Judge McCarter asked the county attorney if she had omitted anything, at which point the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">MR. MCGRATH: Your Honor, for point of clarification in terms of supervision upon his release from a practical standpoint what would work much better would be for the Court to impose a 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>year sentence with ten suspended so that then it is clear you are still impossing [sic] the identical sentence but then it is clear there is a suspended portion of the sentence and that allows the probation office to supervise him with the conditions that you have imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">THE COURT: I am wondering how that will affect the time of his parole eligibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">MR. MCGRATH: It doesn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">THE COURT: It won\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">MR. MCGRATH: It is the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">MR. MCGRATH: The effect is the same, just adds a tail at the end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">MR. ASHLEY: I am not sure that is true, Your Honor. If you have got two sentences running consecutively, you have got to discharge one, at least one portion of it before the other one kicks in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">THE COURT: I think with the previous ten years consecutive after the 30 y\u00e9ars-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">MR. MCGRATH: I understand from Mr. Piskolich [the probation and parole officer who prepared the presentence investigation report] that they can parole him from the first sentence to the second sentence and my understanding is it works the same, but what this does is give us a suspended portion so that they know what they are supposed to do and have the ability to supervise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-13\">THE COURT: Okay. We will do that. So it will be 40 years with ten suspended. As long as-I want it understood that as long as that doesn\u2019t make his parole eligibility sooner. I don\u2019t want his parole eligibility any sooner than it would be with 40 straight years. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\">MR. MCGRATH: That will be fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-15\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">\u00b66 The following day, Judge McCarter entered the written judgment and commitment, which reflected the original sentence of 30 years for the offense of mitigated deliberate homicide plus 10 years for use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of this offense, to be served consecutively and with no portion of either sentence suspended. As a result, Garland wrote a letter to Judge McCarter, inquiring as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APB\">I was sentenced on April 22 [sic], 1994 in your court. You sentenced me to 30 years with 10 years suspended + 10 years for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>use of a weapon to run consecutively. The court sent the papers to the prison in error and did not reflect the 10 year suspension you gave me but 40 years non-dangerous. Is it possible for someone to send me a copy of the sentencing transcript so I can get the proper credit and correct sentence you gave me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b67 In response to this letter, Judge McCarter wrote to Garland explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">As you recall, during the sentencing proceeding I discussed with the attorneys the possibility of suspending a portion of your sentence. However, upon further discussion with the attorneys, it became apparent that suspending a portion of the sentence would affect your parole eligibility. It was my intention that your parole eligibility be based on 40 straight years. Therefore, I ultimately decided to impose a sentence of 30 years for the offense, and 10 years for use of a dangerous weapon, both sentences to run consecutively. I did not suspend any portion of your sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Judge McCarter concluded that the sentence contained in the written judgment and commitment \u201cis accurate,\u201d and Garland did not appeal this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b68 Almost twelve years later, on August 15, 2006, Garland submitted a Petition to Modify Defendant\u2019s Written Judgment to Conform to the Courts\u2019 Oral Pronouncement of Sentence. Garland relied on \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA (1993),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which states: \u201cThe court may correct an erroneous sentence or disposition at any time ....\u201d Garland claimed that the sentence contained in the District Court\u2019s written judgment dated April 27, 1994, was erroneous because it was different than, and in direct conflict with, the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence the previous day. Garland claimed this violated State <em>v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, 288 Mont. 286, 957 P.2d 9, and its progeny, which hold that the sentence orally pronounced from the bench, in the defendant\u2019s presence, is the legally effective sentence and final judgment. <em>See Lane, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>State v. Simpson, </em>1999 MT 259, \u00b6 14, 296 Mont. 335, \u00b6 14, 989 P.2d 361, \u00b6 14; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 290, \u00b6 15, 302 Mont. 265, \u00b6 15, 14 P.3d 480, \u00b6 15; <em>State v. Lucero, </em>2004 MT 248, \u00b6 24, 323 Mont. 42, \u00b6 24, 97 P.3d 1106, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b69 The State filed a response to Garland\u2019s petition on August 28, 2006, and on September 5,2006, the District Court entered its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and order denying Garland\u2019s petition on the ground that the written judgment was not in conflict with the oral pronouncement. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">Everyone, including Defendant, understood the discussion at the sentencing hearing that the ten years would be suspended only if it had no effect on the time of parole eligibility. Prior to signing the written judgment, the Court learned that suspending ten years would indeed shorten the time of Defendant\u2019s parole eligibility. Thus, the written judgment indicated a straight 40-year sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b610 We review a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b6 11. A determination of a sentence\u2019s legality is a question of law and we review such questions de novo. <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, \u00b6 7, 336 Mont. 416, \u00b6 7, 156 P.3d 15, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u00b611 <em>Does the District Court\u2019s written judgment and commitment conform to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">\u00b612 Garland contends that the written judgment, under which he was sentenced on April 27, 1994, and is currently incarcerated, is invalid as it does not conform to the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. Citing <em>Lane, </em>\u00b6 40, Garland argues that the sentence orally pronounced from the bench in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment. Garland claims that while his sentence at the April 26, 1994 hearing was pronounced as 40 years with 10 years suspended, the written judgment reflects a sentence of 30 years plus 10 years to be served consecutively and with no portion of either sentence suspended. Garland asserts, therefore, that the District Court erred in denying his petition and that we should vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing to reflect what Garland claims was the orally pronounced (and legally effective) sentence of 40 years with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">\u00b613 We note that at the time Garland was sentenced, our cases held that the oral pronouncement of sentence was <em>not </em>the final judgment and the court could change the sentence prior to entry of the written judgment. <em>See e.g. State v. Enfinger, </em>222 Mont. 438, 444, 722 P.2d 1170, 1174 (1986); <em>State v. Wirtala, </em>231 Mont. 264, 270, 752 P.2d 177, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>181 (1988). Garland, however, relies on <em>Lane, </em>a case decided nearly four years after his conviction and sentencing, for the proposition that the oral pronouncement of sentence is the legally effective sentence. Garland apparently assumes that <em>Lane </em>applies retroactively to his sentence. We need not decide that question, however, because we conclude that Garland\u2019s assertion that the oral and written sentences conflict is factually incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b614 As discussed above, Judge McCarter initially imposed a sentence of 30 years for mitigated deliberate homicide plus 10 years for use of a dangerous weapon at the April 26,1994 sentencing hearing. She did not say that any portion of this sentence was to be suspended. The county attorney then requested that the court instead impose a 40-year sentence with 10 years of that suspended. The court agreed to do so but only \u201cas long as that doesn\u2019t make [Garland\u2019s] parole eligibility sooner.\u201d This contingency was stated explicitly and in Garland\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b615  As it turned out, Judge McCarter subsequently determined, \u201cupon further discussion with the attorneys,\u201d that suspending a portion of Garland\u2019s sentence would, in fact, make his parole eligibility sooner. Therefore, her written judgment reflects the original sentence pronounced at the hearing-30 years for mitigated deliberate homicide plus 10 years for use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of an offense, to be served consecutively and with no portion of either sentence suspended. Simply stated, the contingency was not satisfied and, thus, the original sentence remained effective. The written judgment accurately reflects this fact. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s written judgment and commitment conforms to the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b616  We hold that the District Court did not err in refusing to grant Garland\u2019s Petition to Modify Defendant\u2019s Written Judgment to Conform to the Courts\u2019 Oral Pronouncement of Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> The applicable sentencing statutes are those in effect at the time the underlying offense was committed. <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, \u00b6 8, 336 Mont. 416, \u00b6 8, 156 P.3d 15, \u00b6 8. As noted above, Garland\u2019s offense was committed October 22, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
