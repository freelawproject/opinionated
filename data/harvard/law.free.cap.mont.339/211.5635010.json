The alleged victim was his ex-wife, Cody Lodge (Lodge). On March 22, 2005, a jury found him guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b64 Prior to trial, Parker filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior crimes or wrongs. The State did not object and the District Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b65 At the trial, the following dialogue occurred during the direct examination of the complaining witness Lodge:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">Q: So, what did you do when he reached down to help you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-12\">A: I\u2019m trying to remember the whole scenario because it happened so quick. Well, I was like I said, I was on the floor and when he reached down to help me I just kind of turned. I slid backwards. I was crawling backwards because I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. I mean he\u2019s never been physical with me before. I just didn\u2019t know what was going to take place, so I just, he came on me he was on top of me at that point....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\u00b66 The State then requested a recess to discuss a matter of law outside the presence of the jury. A discussion was held in chambers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>outside of the presence and hearing of the jury. No record of the discussion was made. However, neither party disputes that the State moved for an order allowing it to impeach Lodge by asking her questions relating to a prior conviction of Parker for assaulting Lodge. Parker\u2019s counsel did not object to the State\u2019s motion. The motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b67 After the recess, the State asked the following questions and Lodge gave the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">Q: Ms. Lodge, I just wanted to get back to something you said on direct. You had made the comment that the defendant had never been physical with you before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">A: Mmhm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Q: Is that what you said, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">A: Well yeah, I mean anything else is I mean were [sic] just I don\u2019t know how to explain it really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">Q: So, he\u2019s never been physical with you before is what you had said, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">A: Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">Q: Do you remember back in [sic] August 4th of 2002 the police being called out for another domestic violence situation where you were the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">A: In 2002?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">Q: 2002, you had been living at 2020 Livingston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\">A: I don\u2019t even remember the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-15\">Q: Officers that responded were Jerry McGee, Jennifer Johnson, and Buck Herron. It was within the city of Helena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">A: I\u2019m just trying to remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-17\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-18\">A: In 2002, okay now that I see the name on there yes I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-19\">Q: You remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-20\">A: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-21\">Q: And, do you also know that the defendant was later convicted on October 11, 2002 for the assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-22\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-23\">Q: And you were the victim in this assault, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-24\">A: I, yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-25\">\u00b68 The jury found Parker guilty of partner or family member assault and the Justice Court sentenced him. Parker then appealed his conviction to the District Court, arguing that evidence of his prior conviction was erroneously admitted. The District Court affirmed the Justice Court, holding that Parker\u2019s reliance on his motion in limine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>did not preserve the issue for appeal and that the testimony relating to Parker\u2019s prior conviction was properly admitted to impeach Lodge. Parker appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b69  We review evidentiary rulings to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion. A justice court and a district court have broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, we will not overturn a trial court's evidentiary determination. An abuse of discretion occurs when the court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 15, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">\u00b610 A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 15, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b611 Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution and the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee a person the right to the effective assistance of counsel. This Court adopted the two-pronged test of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish that his or her counsel was ineffective, a defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel's performance fell below the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases and (2) that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defense. The defendant bears the burden to show that his or her counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 33, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 33 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b612 Parker contends Lodge\u2019s testimony concerning his prior conviction was character evidence prohibited by M. R. Evid. 404(b). Parker argues that his defense counsel was ineffective because he made no objection on the record to that portion of Lodge\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b613 The State responds that the District Court properly admitted the evidence for purposes of impeachment under M. R. Evid. 607. The State argues that because the evidence was admissible, failure to make an objection cannot amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b614 Whether the District Court properly admits evidence requires inquiry into both the purpose of the testimony and the potential effect on the jury. When considering the admissibility of evidence used to challenge the presumption of a witness\u2019s truthfulness through impeachment, consideration must be given to \u00a7 26-1-302, MCA, and M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>R. Evid. 607, 401 and 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b615 Section 26-1-302, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">A witness is presumed to speak the truth. The jury or the court in absence of the jury is the exclusive judge of his credibility. This presumption may be controverted and overcome by any matter that has a tendency to disprove the truthfulness of a witness\u2019s testimony; such matters include but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">(7) inconsistent statements of the witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">(8) an admission of untruthfulness by the witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">(9) other evidence contradicting the witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u00b616 The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party. M. R. Evid. 607. If a party objects to relevant impeachment evidence on the ground that it is unduly prejudicial, the trial court must consider whether it should be excluded because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">\u00b617 The District Court, in affirming the Justice Court, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">A review of the trial testimony discloses that Lodge\u2019s credibility was a crucial factor in the prosecution of Defendant. Her descriptions at trial of the incident were in direct conflict with her initial reports to law enforcement. What began as a serious and painful physical assault by Defendant ended at trial as an accidental fall. The State had every right to impeach her testimony at trial by calling her on her statement that Defendant had never been physical with her before. The relevance of this testimony, in the Court\u2019s opinion, outweighs any prejudice to Defendant. [M. R. Evid. 403].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">\u00b618 We agree with the District Court. Lodge\u2019s comment was gratuitous and did not appropriately respond to the question the prosecutor asked. The evidence of Parker\u2019s prior assault conviction was not aimed at his character, but at the credibility of Lodge\u2019s statement that Parker had never been physical with her before. In light of the probative value and purpose for which the evidence was admitted, we conclude that the Justice of the Peace did not abuse his discretion in allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">\u00b619 An instruction to the jury that it was to consider the evidence of Parker\u2019s prior conviction of partner or family member assault only as it might bear on Lodge\u2019s credibility could have been appropriate. Parker has not argued that his counsel should have requested such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b620  A failure to object to properly admitted evidence does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 21, 326 Mont. 63, \u00b6 21, 106 P.3d 1175, \u00b6 21. In this case, Parker\u2019s counsel\u2019s lack of an objection to the evidence of his prior conviction did not render him ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-14\"> The Helena Justice Court has been established as a justice court of record.

I would conclude that counsel for the Defendant arguably rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in registering no objection to the introduction of Parker\u2019s prior conviction, and in further failing to request any of the procedural and substantive protections attendant to <em>Just </em>Notice that this Court has said must be implemented when evidence of bad acts is to be placed before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b623 According to M. R. Evid. 404(b), evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove the character of a person to demonstrate that he acted in conformity therewith; such evidence may however be admitted for other purposes \u201csuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d (Notably, impeachment of the complaining witness is not among these exceptions.) We have been called upon to address the requisites of this Rule many times. Recently, in <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463, we reiterated the procedural protections that must be followed before and after evidence of prior bad acts is introduced, as previously announced in <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 77, 315 Mont. 395, \u00b6 77, 68 P.3d 768, \u00b6 77. Among other things, at the time of the introduction of the evidence, the trial court must explain to the jury the limited purpose for the admission of the evidence. Then, the court shall, in its final charge, again instruct the jurors as to the limited purpose for the evidence, and warn that the defendant is not being tried for the prior crime and may not be unjustly convicted by them for the other offense. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 48. These important safeguards were not implemented here, nor did defense counsel ask for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b624 The Court concludes that the relevance of the prior crime testimony outweighs any prejudice to the Defendant. Under other circumstances, I might disagree yet conclude that the decision was nonetheless within the permissible bounds of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Here, however, the evidence came in without any of the cautionary instructions which we said in <em>Ferguson </em>must be implemented when such evidence is admitted. As a result, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>prejudice to Parker was manifest. At best, counsel should have objected to the admission of the evidence in violation of the Order <em>in Limine. </em>At a minimum, once it became evident the evidence would be admitted, counsel should have insisted on such instructions for the protection of his client. The failure to do either was, in my judgment, arguably below the objective standard of reasonableness and prejudicial to the Defendant. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S. Ct. at 2063-64. I would therefore either reverse outright on this basis or dismiss for consideration in postconviction proceedings. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
