Rosenthal also appeals the denial of his M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion requesting further discovery filed after the Defendants filed their summary judgment motion, as well as the District Court\u2019s denial of his request to add a claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the private attorney general doctrine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b62 Rosenthal filed a malicious prosecution claim and later amended it to include claims for intentional and negligent emotional distress, alleging that he suffered injuries to his reputation and business as a result of a misdemeanor complaint filed but later dismissed by Zenker. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants after determining that Zenker\u2019s conduct was within the scope of the County Attorney\u2019s statutory authority and, therefore, was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity, barring an action against all defendants. Rosenthal argues Zenker\u2019s conduct is not entitled to absolute immunity, but rather is entitled at best to only qualified immunity, because Zenker acted outside the quasi-judicial function by accusing Rosenthal of a violation of the Montana Streambed Preservation Act, advising the Madison County Sheriff about investigating Rosenthal, and compiling a file of reports about Rosenthal\u2019s alleged harassment to send to the Attorney General\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b63 Rosenthal raises four issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b64 (1) Did the Montana Tort Claims Act, \u00a7 2-9-305(1), MCA, abrogate the common law doctrine of prosecutorial immunity;</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u00b65 (2) Did the District Court correctly conclude that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">\u00b66 (3) Did the District Court correctly deny Rosenthal\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion for additional discovery to allow investigation into Zenker\u2019s role as an investigator and legal advisor before ruling on summary judgment; and</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u00b67 (4) Did the District Court err in denying Rosenthal\u2019s request to add a claim for attorney's fees under the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b68 On December 6,2001, the Ruby Valley Soil Conservation District (RVSCD) sent County Attorney Zenker reports of a potential violation of the Montana Streambed Preservation Act, \u00a7\u00a7 75-7-101-125, MCA, by Reid Rosenthal (\u201c310 violation\u201d). Along with the reports was a letter from the RVSCD chairman requesting prosecution of these violations and a copy of the letter from Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologist Richard Oswald to RVSCD indicating that Rosenthal\u2019s log and utility line project along Wisconsin Creek was a 310 violation. On January 3, 2002, Zenker received a letter from the RVSCD Board of Supervisors requesting prosecution of Rosenthal and stating that Don McIntyre, attorney for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, advised that Rosenthal\u2019s project was a 310 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b69 These reports and letters indicated that Rosenthal, as manager of the Three Creeks Ranch, LLC, had begun a bridge project by placing a log across Wisconsin Creek. A utility line ran -under the log. Neighboring property owners who had seen the log grew concerned that it was an unauthorized project contributing to environmental degradation of the Creek. Six people reported it to the RVSCD. Prior to filing a complaint Zenker wrote to Rosenthal, informing him of the potential violation and offering him an opportunity to acquire the requisite permit or remove the log and utility line. Through a number of correspondences, Rosenthal responded that his project was legal, that he had the requisite permit, and that he would not remove the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b610 On January 24, 2002, Zenker filed a misdemeanor complaint charging Rosenthal with a 310 violation. On <em>June </em>7,2002, the District Court granted Rosenthal\u2019s request to allow an expert to testify on his behalf. The State retained its own expert. Upon learning that the State\u2019s expert was not confident there was a 310 violation beyond a reasonable doubt, Zenker moved to dismiss the complaint against Rosenthal on July 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b611 On July 21, 2003, Mr. Curtis Kruer sent a letter to the Madison County Sheriff asking that Rosenthal be investigated and punished for threatening behavior towards Stephanie Kruer. Sheriff David Schenck notified Zenker of these complaints, seeking Zenker\u2019s input, and Zenker responded by suggesting a more thorough investigation. Zenker then contacted the Attorney General\u2019s Office regarding its possible prosecution of Rosenthal because Zenker perceived a potential conflict of interest between the parties. The victim in the case, a local public defender, had worked with Zenker in the past, creating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>potential conflict. Additionally, Zenker believed Rosenthal held a grudge against the Madison County Attorney\u2019s Office because of the 310 case, and further involvement by Zenker would only inflame that grudge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b612 The Attorney General assigned the case to Barbara Harris, who charged Rosenthal with stalking and, in the alternative, trespass to property. According to Harris, a copy of the investigative file sent to her by Zenker was in turn copied and sent to Rosenthal on November 10, 2003, and April 9, 2004. Eventually, a trial was held and Rosenthal was found not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b613 On May 14, 2004, Rosenthal filed his original malicious prosecution complaint against the Defendants herein. The court set October 15 as the deadline for amended pleadings. On October 22, Rosenthal requested leave to amend the pleadings, which Defendants opposed. On January 3, 2005, the District Court granted Rosenthal\u2019s motion to amend all counts but Count VI, which was a request for attorney\u2019s fees under the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b614 On December 8, 2004, seven months after filing the complaint, Rosenthal\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Defendants\u2019 attorneys asking to arrange depositions for 19 people. On December 21, Paul Johnson, Attorney for the State and Zenker, responded to the request with deposition dates. On December 28, Rosenthal filed a notice of service of the first set of discovery requests sent to Defendant Zenker.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\u00b615 On January 14, 2005, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on absolute immunity. They filed a brief and the supporting affidavits of Zenker and Harris five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\u00b616 On January 25,2005, Rosenthal filed his amended complaint and jury trial demand. The amended complaint set forth no additional facts, but added causes of action for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, based on \u201cDefendants\u2019 intentional acts\u201d without specifying those acts. The Defendants filed a motion for protective order the next day, a renewed motion for summary judgment on January 31, and an answer to the first amended complaint on February 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\u00b617 Between February 4 and 11, Rosenthal filed notices of depositions and subpoenas duces tecum for nine individuals. On February 11, Zenker filed an emergency motion to quash and the court granted it that day, forbidding the parties from conducting depositions before determination of summary judgment. On February 15, Rosenthal filed his \u201crefusal\u201d of summary judgment and a request for more time for discovery. On February 16, Rosenthal\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>opposition to the motion for summary judgment, asserting personal knowledge of the facts at issue. Rosenthal\u2019s own affidavit was not filed until March 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b618 On March 14, Defendants filed a response to Rosenthal\u2019s request for more time to conduct discovery, treating it as a M. R. Civ. P. 56(f). Defendants argued that Rosenthal failed to present a sufficient affidavit to meet the movant\u2019s burden under M. R. Civ. P. 56(f). Additionally, Defendants argued that further discovery would undermine the purpose of prosecutorial immimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b619 On March 25, the District Court granted Zenker and the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice, later clarifying that the summary judgment was granted in favor of Madison County as well. After finding that summary judgment was appropriate, the District Court declined to address the additional motions of the parties because they were moot. On April 4, Rosenthal filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b620 In April, May and June, Rosenthal\u2019s attorney conducted depositions of Zenker, Harris, David Schenck, the Madison County Sheriff, and Evan Andren, the Madison County Undersheriff, in a separate unrelated matter involving a property dispute. During the deposition of Zenker, Rosenthal\u2019s attorney tried to ask Zenker questions regarding the malicious prosecution case. Zenker objected. In addition, during the deposition of Andren, Harris, and Schenck, Rosenthal asked questions relating to the malicious prosecution case. These questions were answered without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b621 Based upon what he learned in the depositions, Rosenthal filed a M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) motion for relief, asserting newly discovered evidence that defeated Zenker\u2019s claim of absolute prosecutorial immimity, followed a week later by another motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. However, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to rule thereon in light of Rosenthal\u2019s previously filed notice of appeal. Consequently, Rosenthal sought from this Court a stay of the summary judgment appeal in order for the District Court to regain limited jurisdiction to rule on his M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) discovery motion. We granted his motion for remand. The District Court then ordered the parties to brief the M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) motion. After some procedural confusion involving another appeal and remand, the District Court denied Rosenthal\u2019s motion for relief under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) on March 30, 2006, on the basis that the newly discovered evidence was not material to the allegations in the first amended complaint and did not mandate a different result on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>summary judgment motion. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b622 We review orders of summary judgment de novo. <em>Bradley v. Crow Tribe of Indians, </em>2005 MT 309, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 329 Mont. 448, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 124 P.3d 1143, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15. The purpose of summary judgment is to eliminate the burden and expense of unnecessary trials. <em>Hughes v. Pullman, </em>2001 MT 216, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 420, \u00b6 20, 36 P.3d 339, \u00b6 20. However, \u201call reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Cape v. Crossroads Correctional Center, </em>2004 MT 265, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 140, \u00b6 12, 99 P.3d 171, \u00b6 12. Where the movant has met its burden of showing that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the opposing party bears the burden of establishing an issue of material fact. The opposing party\u2019s facts must be material and of a substantial nature, and not fanciful, frivolous, or conjectural. <em>Fleming v. Fleming Farms, Inc., </em>221 Mont. 237, 241, 717 P.2d 1103, 1105-06 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b623 The district court has discretion to decide whether to continue a motion for summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(f), on the basis that the party opposing the motion needs further discovery. This court reviews the denial of a M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Stanley v. Holms, </em>1999 MT 41, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 343, \u00b6 19, 975 P.2d 1242, \u00b6 19. Similarly, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees is a discretionary ruling which we review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Harding v. Savoy, </em>2004 MT 280, \u00b6 68, 323 Mont. 261, \u00b6 68, 100 P.3d 976, \u00b6 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Did) the Montana Tort Claims Act, \u00a7 2-9-305(1), MCA, abrogate the common law doctrine of prosecutorial immunity?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u00b624 Rosenthal first asserts that the enactment of the Montana Tort Claims Act, \u00a7 2-9-305, MCA, abrogated the common law doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity. He contends that \u00a7 1-2-103, MCA, supports this interpretation because it allows for a broad reading of a statute when it is at odds with the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u00b625 This argument is without merit. In 1976, we said: \u201cIt is an established general principle that any statutory waiver of a state\u2019s immunity from suit is to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Storch v. Board of Dir. of East. Mont. Reg. Five M.H.C., </em>169 Mont. 176, 179, 545 P.2d 644, 646-47 (1976). That same year, this court held that unless a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>specifically refers to prosecutorial immunity, we cannot imply the abolishment of the well-founded common law doctrine. <em>State, etc. v. Dist. Ct., 8th Judicial Dist., </em>172 Mont. 88, 92, 560 P.2d 1328, 1330 (1976). Although Article II, Section 18, of the 1972 Montana Constitution abolished the concept of \u201csovereign immunity,\u201d we have stated that neither the Constitution nor the Montana Tort Claims Act abolished prosecutorial immunity. <em>State, etc., </em>172 Mont. at 92, 560 P.2d at 1330. In fact, we have extended the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity to include county and state governments employing the prosecutors who find themselves named defendants in tort actions. <em>Ronek v. Gallatin County, </em>227 Mont. 514, 517-19, 740 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1987); <em>Koppen v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>233 Mont. 214, 220, 759 P.2d 173, 176 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b626 In the alternative, Rosenthal maintains that Zenker is not entitled to statutory immunity because his conduct constituted oppression, fraud, and/or malice, and as such, did not arise out of the course and scope of his employment. See \u00a7 2-9-305(6)(a), MCA. However, as we explain below, we conclude that Zenker\u2019s actions were undertaken within the authority vested in Zenker as a prosecutor, and were not outside of the course and scope of Zenker\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Did the District Court correctly conclude that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"AFY\">\u00b627 \u201cThe doctrine of immunity evolved to protect not only judges, but also certain participants in the judicial process whose functions are closely associated with those of judicial officers.\u201d <em>Steel v. McGregor, </em>1998 MT 85, \u00b6 25, 288 Mont. 238, \u00b6 25, 956 P.2d 1364, \u00b6 25. Prosecutors Eire entitled to absolute immunity as \u201cquasi-judicial officers\u201d when their judgments and conduct are functionally comparable to those implemented by judges. <em>Steel, </em>\u00b6 25, citing Butz <em>v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 512, 98 S. Ct. 2894, 2913 (1978). In <em>Steel, </em>\u00b6 26, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">Like judicial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity benefits the public-not the person being sued-by ensuring that quasi-judicial officers exercise their functions unfettered by fear of legal consequences; also like judicial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity extends only to acts within the scope of the actor\u2019s jurisdiction and with the authorization of law----To be protected by quasi-judicial immunity, the person asserting the immunity must have acted in a quasi-judicial capacity. [Internal citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">\u00b628 Rosenthal alleges that Zenker\u2019s conduct fell outside the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the quasi-judicial capacity (1) when Zenker filed a complaint against Rosenthal for a 310 violation; (2) when Zenker discussed with Undersheriff Evan Andren the investigation of a stalking complaint against Rosenthal; and (3) when Zenker compiled and sent the investigative file on the stalking and trespassing to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. We address these allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">A. Zenker\u2019s filing a misdemeanor complaint and later dismissing the same complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b629 Filing and maintaining criminal charges are among the many duties of a prosecutor and when a prosecutor acts within the scope of these duties, that prosecutor is absolutely immune from civil liability, regardless of negligence or lack of probable cause. <em>State, </em>etc., 172 Mont. at 92, 560 P.2d at 1330; <em>Ronek, </em>227 Mont. at 518-519, 740 P.2d at 1118. It is clear from the record that Zenker acted within the prosecutorial authority when Zenker filed a complaint against Rosenthal for the 310 violation. Zenker also acted within the quasi-judicial function, and according to prosecutorial ethics, when Zenker later dismissed the complaint upon learning of another expert\u2019s opinion. This is precisely the type of conduct that the prosecutorial immunity doctrine was designed to protect. As noted by the U.S. Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">To allow this would open the way for unlimited harassment and embarrassment of the most conscientious officials by those who would profit thereby. . . . There would always be a question of possible civil action in case the prosecutor saw fit to move dismissal of the case.... The apprehension of such consequences would tend toward great uneasiness and toward weakening the fearless and impartial policy which should characterize the administration of this office. The work of the prosecutor would thus be impeded and we would have moved away from the desired objective of stricter and fairer law enforcement, [citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"As0\"><em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 423-24, 96 S. Ct. 984, 992 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"AdLI\">\u00b630  As the U.S. Supreme Court has held, the prosecutorial immunity doctrine requires a functional analysis of whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was quasi-judicial rather than an emotional analysis of whether the prosecutor had malice. <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 429-30, 96 S. Ct. at 994. Therefore, even if Zenker had arguably improper motives that influenced the decision to file the complaint, the decision to file the complaint was within Zenker\u2019s authorized discretion and such motives cannot deprive a prosecutor of absolute immunity. Zenker properly exercised discretion, both in filing the complaint and in subsequently dismissing it when faced with the State\u2019s expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>equivocation. Accordingly, we conclude that Zenker is entitled to absolute immunity for this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">B. The stalking complaint andl prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b631 Rosenthal argues that Zenker improperly participated in the investigation and gave legal advice to the Undersheriff who had been assigned to the stalking case. The State and Zenker contend that all of the conduct of which Rosenthal complains centers around the initiation and prosecution of criminal charges, for which absolute immunity attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b632 After several complaints by the Kruers, Sheriff Schenck forwarded the complaints to Zenker for a determination on how to proceed. After reading the chronology, Zenker wrote a letter to Schenck on April 1, 2003, in which Zenker advised Schenck to go ahead with a thorough investigation. Zenker asked the Sheriff to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">[p]lease assign an officer to conduct a further investigation and provide me with a report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Among the things you deem necessary, please ask the officer to recover all evidence referred to in the chronology (Copies of all letters, emails, telephone answering machine tapes, etc.). Also the officer should please ask the Kruers to provide a written statement regarding whether, and to what degree they suffered substantial emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Finally, I recommend that the investigating officer offer the suspect the opportunity to make a statement. Specifically, the officer should ask for clarification of the purpose of his continued attempts to communicate with the Kruers despite their repeated attempts that he not do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u00b633  After the investigator compiled the complaints and performed his investigation, he forwarded the information to Zenker at the Madison County Attorney\u2019s Office. Zenker in turn sent the file to the Attorney General\u2019s Office for further handling, asking them to review the file and prosecute any charges that the Attorney General deemed viable. Zenker properly handed the case off to the Attorney General precisely because Zenker concluded that further participation in the case could be perceived as a conflict. While Zenker may have encouraged the Attorney General to prosecute the case, the ultimate decision to file a complaint was made by the Attorney General and not Zenker. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Zenker was entitled, at the very least, to qualified immunity for those actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">C. Qualified immunity still protects Zenker</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b634  Where allegedly injurious conduct arguably falls outside of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>quasi-judicial functions, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct is entitled to qualified immunity rather than absolute immunity. \u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity operates to shield government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Losleben v. Oppedahl, </em>2004 MT 5, \u00b6 13, 319 Mont. 269, \u00b6 13, 83 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 13. We use a two-part test for determining whether the qualified immunity shield applies. <em>Sacco v. High Country Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411, 415 (1995). First, we consider in a light most favorable to the party asserting injury, whether the official\u2019s conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right. <em>Losleben, </em>\u00b6 14, citing <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156 (2001). If not, qualified immunity bars the suit and the case should be dismissed. <em>Losleben, </em>\u00b6 14. If so, we determine whether a reasonable person or official would have known that his conduct violated that right. <em>Losleben, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b635 Rosenthal does not allege, nor does the record reveal, the violation of any constitutional right by virtue of the Defendants\u2019 actions. This being so, under <em>Losleben, </em>qualified immunity bars the suit (assuming for the sake of Rosenthal\u2019s argument that absolute immunity does not). Moreover, as the District Court pointed out in its Decision and Order, Zenker\u2019s performance of those prosecutorial duties with respect to both the 310 violation and the stalking complaint was guided by the existence of sufficient probable cause. Among other things, Zenker was presented with (1) the RVSCD chairman\u2019s letter requesting prosecution of Rosenthal based on specific complaints of six individuals who lived along Wisconsin Creek; (2) a letter from Richard Oswald, a biologist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, indicating that Rosenthal was in violation of the 310 law; (3) several investigation reports, including photos, prepared by members of the State inspection team indicating that the log and power line crossing were in violation of the 310 law; and (4) the January 3, 2002, letter from the RVSCD Board of Supervisors requesting that Madison County prosecute Rosenthal. As to the stalking matter, the case was brought following several complaints and at the instigation of Curtis Kruer, a citizen who perceived that his wife was being threatened by Rosenthal. Zenker did not instigate this case, nor did Zenker prosecute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b636  In sum, we conclude the District Court did not err in determining that under the facts presented, Zenker was entitled to immunity-be it absolute or qualified-for his actions undertaken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>connection with the prosecutions of Rosenthal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Rosenthal\u2019s Rule 56(f) Motion?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b637 Next, Rosenthal argues the District Court erred in denying his M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion for additional discovery. As we have stated many times, the district courts have inherent discretionary power to control discovery. <em>Environmental Contractors, LLC v. Moon, </em>1999 MT 178, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 268, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 390, \u00b6 19. \"This discretionary power extends to deciding whether to deny or to continue a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56(f), M. R. Civ. P., on the basis that the party opposing the motion needs further discovery.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 19. M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b638  A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying a M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion where the party opposing a motion for summary judgment does not establish how the proposed discovery could preclude summary judgment. <em>J.L. v. Kienenberger, </em>257 Mont. 113, 120, 848 P.2d 472, 477 (1993, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds); <em>Howell v. Glacier General Assur. Co., </em>240 Mont. 383, 386, 785 P.2d 1019, 1020 (1989, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b639 Rosenthal claims that additional discovery would allow him to demonstrate Zenker\u2019s animus toward him. He argues that he should not be required to specify with precision what information he believes he will secure from discovery because he is unsure what he will learn from facts in the possession of others. He asserts that his affidavit sets forth sufficient evidence to support his claim that Zenker acted with oppression and malice. We disagree. Rosenthal\u2019s affidavit fails to meet the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and 56(f) because his statements are speculative and based on belief rather than personal knowledge. Throughout his affidavit, Rosenthal accuses Zenker of threatening remarks yet is unable to substantiate these accusations or provide affidavits of additional witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b640  Moreover, the affidavit of Rosenthal\u2019s attorney is wholly inadequate because he lacks personal knowledge of the threats and is merely restating his client\u2019s version of the story. As we said in <em>Hiebert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>v. Cascade </em>County, 2002 MT 233, \u00b6 30, 311 Mont. 471, \u00b6 30, 56 P.3d 848, \u00b6 30, \u201c[w]e have previously held that \u2018an attorney\u2019s affidavit is admissible only to prove facts that are within his personal knowledge and as to which he is competent to testify; an affidavit stating what the attorney believes or intends to prove at trial will be disregarded.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">\u00b641 Rosenthal argues that he has not been afforded any opportunity to perform discovery and that the District Court\u2019s denial of his M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) request denied him that opportunity. This argument misconstrues the facts. Rosenthal had every opportunity between May 14, 2004, when he filed his malicious prosecution claim, and January 14, 2005, when Defendants filed their summary judgment motion, to request discovery from the Defendants. However, Rosenthal made no attempts at discovery until December 8, 2004, when he sent a letter to Defendants\u2019 attorneys asking them to calendar depositions with 19 people, and December 28, when he filed a notice of service of the first set of discovery requests to Defendant Zenker. On the other hand, the record is clear that the Defendants complied with discovery rules and Rosenthal\u2019s demands for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b642 A court need not force a party to undergo more discovery when \u201c[t]he only reason to believe that additional, relevant evidence would materialize ... is the [plaintiffs] apparent hope of finding a proverbial \u2018smoking gun.\u2019\u201d <em>Davis v. G.N. Mortg. Corp., </em>396 F.3d 869, 885 (7th Cir. 2005). Rosenthal has failed to establish what evidence he aimed to secure or how that evidence would preclude summary judgment on the basis of absolute immunity. Moreover, even if we were to speculate with Rosenthal that new evidence would establish that Zenker\u2019s conduct was entitled to qualified immunity rather than absolute immunity, he does not show how he will pierce the qualified immunity shield protecting Zenker.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b643 Although the District Court did not reach the merits of the M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion on the basis that it was moot after granting summary judgment, \u201c[w]e will uphold a district court\u2019s decision if correct, regardless of the reasons given below for the result.\u201d <em>State v. Rensvold, </em>2006 MT 146, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 392, \u00b6 34, 139 P.3d 154, \u00b6 34. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Rosenthal\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Rosenthal\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the private attorney general doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b644 Rosenthal argues that the allegations in his complaint were sufficient to satisfy the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d fee shifting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>requirement. The State of Montana rebuts that the court correctly denied Rosenthal\u2019s request to add this new count to his amended complaint on the basis of futility, because on the face of the pleadings this case does not qualify for fee shifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b645 We agree. Moreover, in light of our conclusion here that summary judgment was appropriate, we need not address the propriety of an amendment to support Zenker\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b646  We conclude that summary judgment on the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity was appropriate. The moving parties met their burden by showing that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The burden then shifted to Rosenthal to show that there was a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment. Construing the facts in favor of Rosenthal, we conclude that Rosenthal has not met his burden because one cannot do so by merely speculating that malicious conduct may be revealed by further discovery. We further conclude that the District Court did not err in refusing to allow Rosenthal to state a claim for attorney\u2019s fees under the private attorney general doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b647 Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
