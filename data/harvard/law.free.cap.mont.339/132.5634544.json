The two children, L.W. and E.K., were four and six years old at the time of the assaults and were children of friends of the defendant. Rogers appeals his conviction by jury in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">\u00b62 Rogers raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Rogers\u2019 challenge for cause of Juror Welter?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied Rogers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err by giving the jury a \u201cdynamite\u201d instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by failing to apply the statutory exception to the mandatory minimum sentence, and by sentencing Rogers based upon his lack of participation in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>court-ordered psychosexual evaluation?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b67 On February 14, 2005, the State of Montana filed an information charging Rogers with two counts of sexual assault upon two child victims, L.W. and E.K., in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. The District Court conducted a jury trial on October 18 and 19, 2005, after which the jury found Rogers guilty of both counts. On appeal, Rogers takes issue with certain aspects of his trial, including voir dire proceedings, his motion for a directed verdict, an instruction given to the jury during their deliberations, and his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b68 During voir dire proceedings, prospective juror Bennie Welter revealed that it would be difficult for him to be an objective juror given that sexual assault of children was at issue. The following dialogue took place between Juror Welter and counsel for the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">MS. HARRINGTON: All right. Let\u2019s get to the issues in the case. This defendant has been charged with two counts of Sexual Assault alleged to have been committed on two separate girls.... Just knowing that this trial is going to involve issues of sexual assault upon a child, is there anyone who feels they cannot sit as a juror? Yes, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">JUROR WELTER: I have an 11-year old daughter of my own and I don\u2019t, for lack of a better description, prefer to sit in that chair. I can\u2019t be objective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">MS. HARRINGTON: There are a lot of emotions associated with that-that first confrontation with the issue of a child being molested. There are a lot of jurors here, prospective jurors who have kids. As a matter of fact, everybody with kids under the age of 25, why don\u2019t you throw up your hands. Okay, almost everybody. Do you think that part of this process in determining whether or not the State can prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt should involve parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">JUROR WELTER: I really don\u2019t see how it can go without it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">MS. HARRINGTON: Okay. And that the goal of the process is, if proven guilty, convict him, keep him from doing it again, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">JUROR WELTER: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">MS. HARRINGTON: But if we don\u2019t, to keep somebody who has been accused, maybe wrongfully, from being convicted at a criminal trial. Is that fair? ... But the real question is, did it happen. Would you agree that that is a conclusion that you can\u2019t come to until you\u2019ve heard all the evidence in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>JUROR WELTER: That would be true, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">MS. HARRINGTON: And until you hear that evidence from the mouths of the witnesses on that witness stand, Mr. Rogers is presumed innocent of the charges against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">JUROR WELTER: Supposed to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">MS. HARRINGTON: Supposed to be. You have a-a gut feeling otherwise?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">JUROR WELTER: Well, just the fact that kids are involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">MS. HARRINGTON: All right. Let\u2019s get back to the impartiality issue. Do you think that just because the defendant is sitting there, that he\u2019s guilty of something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">JUROR WELTER: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u00b69 After the State had completed its voir dire, defense counsel questioned Juror Welter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">MS. MARSHALL: Now, Mr. Welter, I\u2019m going to come back to you. You talked about having a daughter and how this is an emotional thing for you. Tell me what kinds of emotional components or emotional things you have with that. Tell me what about this case, what kind of gets your hackles up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">JUROR WELTER: My first thought when I heard what the case entails is-was my daughter and what I would have done had my daughter been in the same situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">MS. MARSHALL: And I\u2019m not looking for the reaction so much as if your daughter had come to you and said, somebody touched me inappropriately in my private area, what would you want to know, what would you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">JUROR WELTER: I would want to know who and where this individual was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">MS. MARSHALL: And how would you investigate that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">JUROR WELTER: Confrontation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-17\">MS. MARSHALL: In light of your feelings with your daughter, and it sounds like you have strong feelings about this particular subject, do you think that you could be fair to [Rogers] if you were chosen to be on the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">JUROR WELTER: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-19\">MS. MARSHALL: Do you think that-have you read about sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-20\">JUROR WELTER: Somewhat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-21\">MS. MARSHALL: How long have you felt strongly about this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">JUROR WELTER: Since my daughter was born.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">MS. MARSHALL: And are you likely to change your mind within the next week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">JUROR WELTER: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">MS. MARSHALL: And if the judge tells you, to be a juror on this case, you have to leave your opinion about your own daughter or your own circumstances at the door, and completely abandon it for the duration of the trial, you could-even if you could do it, it\u2019d be very difficult, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">JUROR WELTER: It\u2019d be pretty difficult, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">MS. MARSHALL: And you could bring yourself to decide that perhaps [Rogers] didn\u2019t do these acts, but it\u2019d be really hard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbH\">JUROR WELTER: Anything\u2019s possible, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">MS. MARSHALL: So, you\u2019d start out wanting to think that, yeah, he probably did this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">JUROR WELTER: More than likely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">MS. MARSHALL: And deciding against that would be pretty hard for you, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">JUROR WELTER: It depends on what the case proves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Counsel for Rogers then moved the District Court to dismiss Juror Welter for cause. The State objected, and the District Court agreed that defense counsel had to do more to prove bias, since the totality of Juror Welter\u2019s answers both to the State\u2019s questioning and defense counsel\u2019s did not indicate that Juror Welter would be unable to follow the District Court\u2019s instructions regarding the presumption of innocence. Defense counsel concluded her voir dire of Juror Welter with the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">MS. MARSHALL: Do you think that your ability to sit on the jury would be impaired at all, in any way, by your belief about sexual assault crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">JUROR WELTER: At this point, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">Defense counsel then moved on to questioning other jurors, and subsequently used a peremptory challenge to remove Juror Welter. Defense counsel used all of her peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">\u00b610 The evidence produced at trial established that Maggie and Dan H. are married and have a son, I.H., and two daughters, E.K. and L.W. According to trial testimony, Rogers would visit Maggie and Dan\u2019s home approximately once a month, and often sat on the couch in the living room with the girls, tickling them and holding them on his lap, while Maggie and Dan were occupied with other chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u00b611 On January 19, 2005, Rogers was in the living room with Dan while E.K. and L.W., then four and six years old, were eating dinner in the kitchen with Maggie. Without any prompting or inquiry, E.K. stood up and told Maggie, \u201cRusty does this,\u201d and stuck her hand inside her pants, touching her vaginal area. When Maggie asked E.K. to explain what Rogers had done, E.K. reiterated that \u201cRusty touches me and [L. W.] on our potty,\u201d and put her hand in her pants to demonstrate again. Later that evening after Rogers had left, L.W. also confirmed to Maggie that Rogers had put his hand in her and E.K\u2019s pants. Both girls indicated that Rogers had done so multiple times. Maggie then contacted the Bozeman Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b612 On January 25, 2005, Bozeman Police Detective Brandon Olson separately interviewed Maggie, E.K., and L.W. Detective Olson videotaped his interviews with E.K. and L.W., and allowed the girls to use gingerbread drawings to demonstrate what Rogers had done to them. Detective Olson then conducted a video recorded interview with Rogers, during which Rogers stated that his hand might have accidentally slipped between the girls\u2019 legs and landed on their crotch. However, Rogers denied that he had groped the children or had any interest in young girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b613 Both E.K. and L.W. testified at trial. E.K. identified Rogers from the witness stand and stated that he had, on multiple occasions, touched the place that \u201cpee\u201d came from. L.W. also identified Rogers and stated that he had touched her and her sister \u201cin a private spot\u201d three times, which she identified as the place that pee comes out when she goes to the bathroom. Both girls testified that when Rogers touched them, his hand was under their clothes and underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b614 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Rogers\u2019 counsel moved the District Court for a directed verdict. Defense counsel argued that the State failed to establish that Rogers had touched the girls for the purpose of sexual gratification, and therefore failed to prove that element of the sexual assault charge. The State opposed the motion, arguing that sufficient evidence was presented from which the jury could infer Rogers\u2019 mental state. The District Court denied Rogers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, and the defense presented its case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b615 After the jury convicted Rogers of both counts, the District Court ordered Rogers to undergo a psychosexual evaluation prior to sentencing, as required by \u00a7 46-18-111(1), MCA. Fred Lemons (Lemons) conducted the psychosexual evaluation, during which Rogers repeatedly refused to answer questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>right against self-incrimination. Rogers was only minimally cooperative when asked non-incriminating questions as well. Lemons ultimately concluded there were no treatment options available to Rogers within the community, and recommended that Rogers complete Phases I and II of the sex offender program at Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"A06\">\u00b616 The District Court conducted a sentencing hearing on January 24, 2006. Defense counsel recommended the District Court impose a ten-year commitment to the Department of Corrections, with Rogers\u2019 entire sentence deferred because Lemons characterized Rogers as a Level I, low risk offender. The State recommended a sentence of twenty years in prison with ten years suspended based, in part, on Lemons\u2019 assessment that Rogers was not amenable to treatment in a community setting. The District Court sentenced Rogers to twenty-year concurrent prison terms on both counts, with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b617 The District Court based its sentence on a number of factors, including the serious nature of Rogers\u2019 crimes, the ages and number of the victims involved, the considerations submitted in testimony at the sentencing hearing, the State\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s recommendations, the presentence investigation report, and Lemons\u2019 psychosexual evaluation of Rogers. The District Court ultimately concluded that the safety of the victims and the community, as well as the lack of treatment options available in the community, required that Rogers be incarcerated in Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b618 We review denial of a challenge to dismiss a juror for cause for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 126, \u00b6 14, 89 P.3d 958, \u00b6 14. \u201cAbuse of discretion occurs if a court fails to excuse a prospective juror if actual bias is discovered during voir dire.\u201d <em>Richeson, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b619 We review denial of a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal <em>de novo. State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 19, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 19. \u201cA directed verdict is only appropriate if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there is no evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b620 We review a criminal sentence for legality only. Thus, our review is confined to whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute. <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 362, \u00b6 24, 84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>P.3d 648, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted). When the issue on appeal concerns whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated at sentencing, the question is a matter of law which we review <em>de novo. Legg, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Rogers\u2019 challenge of Juror Welter for cause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b622  Rogers asserts that the District Court erred by denying his challenge of Juror Welter for cause, and points to several of Welter\u2019s responses during voir dire which indicated that Welter was concerned whether he could be impartial. The State argues that mere hesitancy or concern about one\u2019s ability to be impartial does not in and of itself render a potential juror subject to a challenge for cause. We agree that Juror Welter\u2019s responses as a whole establish that he neither had a state of mind indicating actual bias nor a substantial impairment rendering him unable to act impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b623  Dismissal for cause is favored when a serious question arises about a juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 8, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 8 (citing <em>Richeson, </em>\u00b6 14). In determining whether to dismiss a juror for cause, district courts are guidedby \u00a7 46-16-115(2), MCA. One specified basis for dismissal occurs where a juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. A challenge for cause under \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, must be analyzed with reference to the aforementioned statutory language and the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 16, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 16, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b624 We recently held in <em>State v. Heath, </em>under similar circumstances, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied two challenges for cause, thereby requiring the defendant to use his peremptory challenges. In that case, the defendant was charged with sexual intercourse without consent. During voir dire, one of the prospective jurors, Juror Caldwell, stated that she had volunteered as a rape survivor advocate in college, and also that her ex-boyfriend had stalked her. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 17. Upon questioning by defense counsel, Caldwell admitted that another juror probably could be more impartial, and that she might not be the best juror for the case. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 25. However, questioning also revealed that Caldwell would be able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to look at the facts objectively, that her experience would not affect her judgment, and that she could set aside her prior experiences. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 25. Moreover, Caldwell\u2019s responses indicated that her familiarity with sex crime victims was not unique, and that she could follow the law as given to her by the district court. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27, 29. In addition, because Caldwell\u2019s stalking experience had been classified as a \u201cproperty offense,\u201d and was thus dissimilar from the rape charges that would be presented at trial, we held there was insufficient evidence that Caldwell had an improper state of mind or was biased. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b625 Similarly, in the present case Juror Welter ultimately demonstrated that he did not have an improper state of mind, and no serious question existed in that regard. Juror Welter\u2019s feelings regarding sexual assault are common among parents, and the fact that he had children of his own was by no means unique among other prospective jurors. Despite his initial response, Juror Welter\u2019s subsequent responses indicated that he was unbiased or impartial. For example, Juror Welter acknowledged that he would have to hear all of the evidence before he could conclude that Rogers was guilty. Juror Welter also admitted that just because Rogers was the defendant, Rogers was not necessarily guilty of something, and also acknowledged that kids are more susceptible to suggestion than adults and must be scrutinized. And finally, Juror Welter ultimately recognized that his ability to sit on the jury would not be impaired \u201cat all, in any way, by [his] belief about sexual assault crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b626  Under the totality of the circumstances, Juror Welter\u2019s responses indicated neither a \u201cstate of mind\u201d affecting his ability to be fair and impartial, nor a \u201cserious question\u201d in that regard. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rogers\u2019 motion to remove Juror Welter for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied Rogers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b628 A person commits the offense of sexual assault if he knowingly subjects another person to any sexual contact without consent. Section 45-5-502(1), MCA. \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined as \u201ctouching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person of another ... in order to knowingly or purposely ... arouse or gratify the sexual response or desire of either party.\u201d Section 45-2-101(67), MCA. Any consent to sexual contact is ineffective if the victim is under fourteen and the offender is three or more years older than the victim. Section 45-5-502(5)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u00b629 On appeal, Rogers argues that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for a directed verdict. Rogers argues that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that he touched E.K. and L.W. for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his sexual response or desire. Rogers claims the only evidence presented regarding his mental state was the video statement he gave to the Bozeman Police Department in which he denied having any sexual interest in girls, and L.W.\u2019s statement to Detective Olson that Rogers\u2019 lap felt \u201csoft\u201d when she sat in it, implying that Rogers did not have an erection. Because the State did not present direct conflicting evidence regarding his mental state, Rogers argues the evidence showed that he did not receive any gratification from touching the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b630 This Court has previously held that the State need not prove direct evidence of arousal, or intent to be aroused, in order to meet its burden of proving the \u201csexual contact\u201d element of sexual assault. \u201c[I]t is well-settled that the jury may infer intent of sexual arousal from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>State v. Skinner, </em>2007 MT 175, \u00b6 24, 338 Mont. 197, \u00b6 24, 163 P.3d 399, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted). In <em>Skinner, </em>the defendant claimed the State failed to meet the \u201cintent\u201d prong of \u201csexual contact\u201d despite proving that he had placed his hand down the back of his eleven-year-old daughter\u2019s underwear while she was asleep. <em>Skinner, </em>\u00b6 23. We held that, \u201cwhile there is no direct evidence of arousal, such as an erection, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to infer arousal, or that the purpose of Skinner\u2019s act was arousal. Skinner was not casually touching T.D. during an ordinary act.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b631  Rogers\u2019 argument is indistinguishable. While the State may not have presented direct evidence that Rogers was aroused, a jury could infer that Rogers\u2019 multiple acts of putting his hand inside E.K.\u2019s and L.W.\u2019s underwear was for the purpose of arousal. As in <em>Skinner, </em>Rogers was not casually touching E.K. or L.W. during an ordinary act when, on more than one occasion with both girls, he placed his hand on their vaginas. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could have found that Rogers made \u201csexual contact\u201d with E.K. and L.W. Consequently, the District Court did not err in denying Rogers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b632 <em>Did the District Court err by giving the jury a \u201cdynamite\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>instruction?</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b633 Rogers\u2019 third allegation of error is that the District Court erred when it allegedly instructed the jury, at 10 p.m. on its first day of deliberation, that it would only have an additional half-hour to reach a decision, and if it could not, it would have to reconvene in the morning. Rogers refers this Court to its holding in <em>State v. Randall, </em>137 Mont. 534, 353 P.2d 1054 (1960), in which we held it was error for the district court to instruct minority members of a jury to give further consideration to the majority members\u2019 view, thereby suggesting that the minority members \u201cought to surrender their own convictions and follow the majority.\u201d <em>Randall, </em>137 Mont. at 542, 353 P.2d at 1058. According to Rogers, the given instruction had the effect of pressuring any juror not in agreement with the majority to change his or her opinion, so as to avoid inconveniencing the jury as a whole. However, we need not reach this issue today.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b634 As noted by the State, Rogers fails to direct the Court to any record of this deliberation instruction in the transcript or in the District Court\u2019s minutes, and thus has failed to document the issue for appeal. As the appellant, it is Rogers\u2019 duty to present us with a record sufficient to enable us to rule on the issue raised. M. R. App. P. 9(a). An appellant cannot meet the burden of establishing error without citations to the record and to relevant authorities. <em>City of Billings v. Peterson, </em>2004 MT 232, \u00b6 36, 322 Mont. 444, \u00b6 36, 97 P.3d 532, \u00b6 36; M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4). It is also the appellant\u2019s duty to ensure that the appendix contains any relevant given or refused jury instruction. M. R. App. P. 25(b)(2). Rogers provides no citations to the record, and we find nothing in the record supporting Rogers\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b635 Rogers\u2019 reply brief indicates that he has filed a motion before the District Court, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 9(f), for the record to be supplemented. However, that request was made to the District Court on September 25, 2006, and the record is still devoid of the allegedly erroneous instruction. Because the record does not support Rogers\u2019 contention, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence by failing to apply the statutory exception to the mandatory minimum sentence, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>by sentencing Rogers based upon his lack of participation in a court-ordered psychosexual evaluation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b637 On appeal, Rogers makes two arguments against the sentence imposed by the District Court. First, Rogers argues he satisfied the eligibility criteria for an exception to the mandatory minimum sentencing statute, and therefore should have received a deferred sentence. Second, Rogers argues he had a Fifth Amendment right to decline to participate in the psychosexual evaluation, and that such refusal should not have been considered in determining his sentence. We find no error in the court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I. Mandatory Minimum Sentence Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">\u00b638 Section 45-5-502(3), MCA, provides for a mandatory minimum prison sentence of four years, or a maximum of 100 years, upon conviction of sexual assault on a minor. However, \u00a746-18-222(6), MCA, provides for an exception to that mandatory minimu m sentence if the District Court \u201cdetermines that treatment of the offender in a local community affords a better opportunity for rehabilitation of the offender and for the ultimate protection of the victim and society ....\u201d Rogers argues the District Court should have applied this exception because, among other things, Rogers\u2019 history of sexual assault was limited to the present offenses, which he argues were relatively minor, and for which Lemons only classified Rogers as a Level I sex offender. Rogers also points out that none of Lemons\u2019 conclusions came from the two tests in which Rogers raised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and from which the State characterized Rogers as uncooperative. Therefore, Rogers argues, the exception to the mandatory minimum sentence applies to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b639 Despite Rogers\u2019 arguments, this Court has \u201cconsistently held that the exceptions set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, do not apply in cases in which the district court sentences the offender to more than the minimum sentence.\u201d <em>Legg, </em>\u00b6 49 (citations omitted). In other words, the exceptions only apply if the district court is predisposed to sentencing the defendant to the mandatory minimum sentence. <em>State v. Zabawa, </em>279 Mont. 307, 317, 928 P.2d 151, 157 (1996). In this case, the mandatory minimum sentence was four years imprisonment. Section 46-18-222(3), MCA. The District Court sentenced Rogers to twenty years imprisonment, ten suspended. Thus, the District Court sentenced Rogers to more than the minimum sentence, making the exception for which Rogers argues inapplicable. Moreover, the State correctly points out that even if Rogers had received the minimum sentence, he presented no evidence that he could be better treated or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>rehabilitated in the community. In fact, the opposite was true: the District Court accepted Lemons\u2019 conclusion that there were no treatment options available to Rogers within the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">II. Participation in Psyehosexual Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"AYM\">\u00b640 Rogers\u2019 second argument is that his refusal to cooperate at the presentence psyehosexual evaluation was used against him in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Rogers argues that Lemons recommended, and the District Court imposed, a harsher sentence solely because Rogers refused to admit responsibility or express remorse at the psyehosexual evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b641 Rogers\u2019 assertion is not supported by the record. As a preliminary matter, Rogers\u2019 lack of cooperation was not limited to only those instances in which he could have incriminated himself. Rather, Lemons noted that Rogers was extremely closed and defensive in providing a social and sexual history, and Rogers was only minimally cooperative in completing probation and parole\u2019s presentence investigation report. This lack of cooperation does not fall within the Fifth Amendment umbrella.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b642 In accordance with \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA, the District Court articulated the reasons for its sentence. As discussed previously, the District Court first noted that the mandatory minimum sentence was four years for a violation of \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA, and that the exception was inapplicable because no treatment options were available within the community which would address Rogers\u2019 issues of sexual abuse. The District Court observed that, contrary to Rogers\u2019 argument that Lemons recommended a harsher sentence based solely upon his refusal to incriminate himself, Lemons\u2019 recommendation for treatment was based on an interview with Rogers, administration of a number of tests and screening tools, and a review of the background information and court documents related to the specific offense. In fact, Lemons did not comment on Rogers\u2019 refusal to respond to questions posed to him during testing, and the District Court correctly noted that there was \u201cno indication that the failure to complete these tests in any way affected Mr. Lemons [sic] recommendation for treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b643  The District Court summarized the reasons for its sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">The correctional policy to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation and reintegration of a defendant into the community has to be balanced against the issue of public safety. Based on the serious nature of these crimes, the ages and number of victims affected, the considerations submitted in the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>presented at the sentencing hearing, and [sic] the recommendations of the State and Defense Counsel, the PreSentence Investigation Report and the letters attached to that Report, the evaluation of Mr. Lemons, and the memoranda provided by Counsel, the Court finds that the safety of the victims and the community require that the defendant be incarcerated. Also, in order to protect the public safety, as well as to provide for rehabilitation, the Court finds that sex offender treatment has to be required, and it is not available outside of the prison in this case. In order to ensure that sex offender treatment is completed, the defendant will be restricted from parole until Phases I and II of the sex offender treatment program at the prison have been successfully completed ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The District Court\u2019s considerations in its \u201cReasons for Sentence\u201d were many, and, notably, did not even reference Rogers\u2019 refusal to answer incriminating questions during the psychosexual evaluation. Because nothing in the record supports Rogers\u2019 claim that his refusal served as a basis for his sentence, we decline to address Rogers\u2019 argument that the Fifth Amendment permits a defendant to refuse to participate in a court-ordered psychosexual evaluation. The District Court\u2019s sentence was within the parameters provided by statute, and is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">A \u201cdynamite\u201d instruction is also called an <em>Allen-type </em>instruction, and is so named for <em>Allen v.

In my view, Welter\u2019s responses quoted in the Court\u2019s Opinion demonstrated that he had a state of mind in reference to the case [and to Rogers] that would prevent him from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to Rogers\u2019 substantial rights. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 8, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 8. Moreover, at least from the colloquy quoted, I believe that the voir dire examination did raise a serious question about Welter\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial. <em>State v. Richeson, </em>2004 MT 113, \u00b6 14, 321 Mont. 126, \u00b6 14, 89 P.3d 958, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b646 That said, following the trial court\u2019s denial of defense counsel\u2019s challenge to Welter for cause and the judge\u2019s admonition that she needed to \u201cestablish more\u201d-in light of the fact that the court would be instructing the jurors on, among other things, the presumption of innocence and the State\u2019s burden of proof-counsel stated to Welter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Ms. Marshall: <em>I\u2019m going to stick with you. </em>Do you think that your ability to sit on the jury would be impaired at all, in any way, by your belief about sexual assault crimes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">Mr. Welter: At this point, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Ms. Marshall: Okay.

Whether that was a wise decision is not before us. However, I agree with our determination to affirm as to Issue 1 because the challenge for cause was withdrawn.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
