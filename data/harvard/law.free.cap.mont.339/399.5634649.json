We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b63 (1) Did the State introduce evidence of other crimes and acts without notice and in violation of Price\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by permitting the testimony of Dr. James Quirk, Jr. as an expert on the potential for injury by a stun gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b65 On April 12, 2005, at approximately 4:30 a.m., Price entered the home of his girlfriend, Tabitha Olson (Olson), applied a \u201cBlack Cobra\u201d stun gun to her temple, and shocked her as she slept on the couch. On April 15,2005, the county attorney filed an information charging Price with assault with a weapon. A two-day bench trial followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">\u00b66 At trial, Olson testified to the events of April 11 and 12, 2005. Olson testified that she and Price had an altercation on the evening of April 11 over the whereabouts of two of Olson\u2019s handguns. Price eventually left the house but returned in the early morning while Olson slept on the couch. Olson testified that the next thing she remembered after falling asleep was \u201c[wjaking up to the stun gun\u201d on her temple which made \u201ca real loud, crackling noise.... \u201d Olson testified that when she awoke, Price was standing over her and she exclaimed, \u201c[y]ou just zapped me -with a stun gun.\u201d After the attack she was disoriented and soiled her garments. At the time of trial seven months later, the mark left on Olson\u2019s temple by the stun gun was still visible. During her testimony she referenced Price\u2019s use of alcohol and drugs. Price\u2019s counsel objected to the testimony regarding Price\u2019s drug use, and the court sustained the objection. Olson also stated that after the initial altercation she telephoned Undersheriff Thomas Rieger because she \u201cwas scared to call the police line\u201d as Price \u201chad threatened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Aryan Brotherhood ....\u201d Price\u2019s counsel did not object to the \u201cAryan Brotherhood\u201d reference but rather questioned Olson about the Aryan Brotherhood during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b67 The State called Undersheriff Thomas Rieger (Rieger) as a witness. Rieger testified that he had known Olson for approximately ten years and that Olson had telephoned him prior to and after the assault. Rieger testified that after the initial altercation but prior to the assault, he went to Olson\u2019s house but Olson had then refused to make a statement. Rieger stated that during the first visit Olson told him that Price \u201cpreviously had assaulted her ....\u201d Price\u2019s counsel objected to the mention of a previous assault, and the court agreed, stating, \u201cI\u2019ll strike any reference to previous criminal acts and will not consider the same.\u201d Rieger continued his testimony, informing the court that after the stun gun assault he and the sheriff went to Olson\u2019s home where she told them what happened and showed them \u201cthe injury she received on the side of her temple. She also showed [them] some injuries that she had from her previous domestic.\u201d Price\u2019s counsel did not lodge an objection with respect to the comment about a \u201cprevious domestic\u201d and there were no further questions asked on the topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b68 During Price\u2019s case-in-chief, Price took the witness stand and testified to his version of the story. During the cross-examination of Price, the State, among other things, asked Price about his feelings toward the Aryan Nation, whether he had a sniper handbook, his sexual relationship with one of his employees, and his 1982 conviction in the State of California for voluntary manslaughter. With the exception of the Aryan Nation question, Price\u2019s counsel interposed objections to the questions regarding these topics, and the court repeatedly sustained the objections. Specifically, as to the 1982 manslaughter conviction, the court determined that while Price had indicated during his direct examination that he was a felon and was on parole, it did not \u201copen the door\u201d to detailed questioning regarding the 1982 conviction. Rather, the court allowed the State to elicit from Price for which offense he was currently on parole. Price\u2019s counsel did not object to this decision and thanked the court for disallowing questioning regarding the 1982 conviction. As a result, Price testified that he was currently on parole for \u201cintimidation.\u201d On re-direct, Price\u2019s counsel asked additional questions about the felony conviction for intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b69 As part of its case, the State called Dr. James Quirk, Jr. (Dr. Quirk), Olson\u2019s treating physician, as an expert witness regarding Olson\u2019s physiological and psychological injuries suffered as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the stun gun attack. Dr. Quirk testified to Olson\u2019s injuries and the types of trauma that could be caused by a stun gun. Dr. Quirk indicated that there was a potential for the development of post traumatic stress disorder after such an attack. Price\u2019s counsel objected to Dr. Quirk\u2019s testimony, claiming that he was not an expert on stun guns. The court overruled his objection, ruling that Dr. Quirk was qualified to \u201cgive an opinion related to trauma, that a person may experience from electrical shock ....\u201d Following the trial, the District Court found Price guilty. The District Court subsequently found Price to be a persistent felony offender and sentenced him to a term of forty years in the Montana State Prison. Price appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b610 \u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 24, 315 Mont. 395, \u00b6 24, 68 P.3d 768, \u00b6 24. \u201c[T]he test for abuse of discretion is whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b611 (1) Did the State introduce evidence of other crimes and acts without notice and in violation of Price\u2019s due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b612 Price argues that the State introduced evidence of Price\u2019s other crimes and acts in violation of M. R. Evid. 404(b) by failing to give Price notice of \u201cits intent to introduce other crimes and bad acts evidence ....\u201d The State contends that Price waived his right to appeal this issue by failing to object to the complained of evidence and by actively participating in its introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b613 A district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts as defined by M. R. Evid. 404(b), is guided by the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule which requires four elements be met before the evidence is allowed. These elements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">(1) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must be similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">(2) The other crimes, wrongs or acts must not be remote in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-12\">(3) The evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in- conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-13\">(4) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 73. In addition to satisfaction of the above stated elements the party offering the evidence must also follow certain procedural requirements. These requirements include in pertinent part providing \u201cwritten notice to the defendant that such evidence is to be introduced. The notice ... shall specify the evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts to be admitted, and the specific ... purpose or purposes for which it is to be admitted.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 77 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b614  However, before reaching the merits of the application of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule, the issue must be properly before the Court. This Court considers issues presented for the first time to be untimely and will not consider them on appeal. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 38, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 38, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 38. This includes new arguments and changes in legal theory. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 38. We refuse to fault a trial court \u201c \u2018where that court has not been given the opportunity to rule on the admissibility of evidence and to correct itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Vukasin, </em>2003 MT 230, \u00b6 29, 317 Mont. 204, \u00b6 29, 75 P.3d 1284, \u00b6 29 (quoting <em>State v. Stuit, </em>277 Mont. 227, 230, 921 P.2d 866, 868 (1996)). The Court recognizes an exception to this rule only where an appellant invokes the \u201cplain error doctrine.\u201d Under the plain error doctrine, it is within this Court\u2019s discretion to review claimed errors that, while not preserved for appeal, implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. <em>State v. Dasen, </em>2007 MT 87, \u00b6 38, 337 Mont. 74, \u00b6 38, 155 P.3d 1282, \u00b6 38. However, \u201c[w]e utilize plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Dasen, </em>\u00b638. Absent implication of a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, we will decline to review whether the district court properly admitted evidence under M. R. Evid. 404(b), if the district court did not have an opportunity to rule on the issue. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b615 Moreover, review of an alleged error is limited by statute. \u201cThis Court may review the verdict or decision and any alleged error objected to which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Scarborough, </em>2000 MT 301, \u00b6 73, 302 Mont. 350, \u00b6 73, 14 P.3d 1202, \u00b6 73 (relying on \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA). The purpose of stating an objection is two-fold. First, it allows the district court to correct itself if warranted and second, it preserves the issue for appeal. <em>Scarborough, </em>\u00b6 74. Therefore, absent an objection, an alleged error is not appropriate for review. Furthermore, \u201cwhere objectionable evidence or testimony is elicited by a party\u2019s own actions, that party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>waives the right to allege error on appeal because of the party\u2019s active participation in creating the error.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, 2005 MT 18, </em>\u00b6 <em>10, </em>325 Mont. 374, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 553, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b616 Here, Price claims that the State violated the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule by allowing questioning and testimony regarding Price\u2019s other bad acts. Price claims it was error to allow any reference to Price\u2019s (1) alleged involvement in the Aryan Nation; (2) alleged sexual relationship with an employee; (3) use of drugs and alcohol; (4) alleged ownership of a Sniper handbook; (5) previous domestic abuse charges; (6) 1982 manslaughter conviction; and (7) prior felony conviction for intimidation. We discuss the alleged errors in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b617 As to the testimony regarding the Aryan Nation and Price\u2019s use of alcohol, Price\u2019s counsel failed to lodge any objection. Rather, Price\u2019s counsel actively participated in the line of questioning during both the cross-examination of Olson and during the direct examination of Price, respectively. As such, Price has waived his right to appeal introduction of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b618 Regarding the felony conviction for intimidation, Price\u2019s counsel failed to lodge an objection. While Price\u2019s counsel objected to introduction of the 1982 manslaughter conviction, Price did not object to the court\u2019s decision to allow questioning regarding Price\u2019s current parole for the intimidation conviction. Accordingly, Price has not preserved this issue for appeal. Moreover, on re-direct, Price\u2019s counsel asked several questions about the prior intimidation felony, thereby actively participating in the error Price now complains of. As such, Price\u2019s appeal is also waived for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b619 As to the remaining allegations of error, Price\u2019s counsel objected, and the District Court sustained the objections. Consequently, Price cannot claim error where the District Court disallowed introduction of the allegedly improper evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b620  Finally, Price does not argue for review under the plain error doctrine by arguing that his fundamental constitutional rights were affected by the alleged improper evidence. At most, Price contends that the character evidence contributed to his conviction. Price also briefly argues that because improper evidence was introduced at trial, the judge sentenced him, in part, because of his \u201cpropensity for violence,\u201d despite the court\u2019s statement that it would \u201cstrike any reference to previous criminal acts and [would] not consider the same.\u201d Given our conclusion that proper objections were not made, the evidence was thus properly admitted during the trial, and this argument is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we decline to review Price\u2019s claims further, and do not reach the merits of the Modified <em>Just </em>Rule argument. Accordingly, we conclude there was no abuse of discretion by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZe\">\u00b621 (2) Did the District Court abuse its discretion by permitting the testimony of Dr. James Quirk, Jr. as an expert on the potential for injury by a stun gun?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b622 Price argues that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the testimony of Dr. Quirk. Price contends that Dr. Quirk\u2019s expert opinion was not reliable and did not meet the standards set forth in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), and <em>Kuhmo Tire, Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b623 Expert Testimony is governed by M. R. Evid. 702, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0f\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cthe test for admissibility of expert testimony is whether the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of the expert will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 36 (internal citations omitted). Only where the introduction of \u201cnovel scientific evidence\u201d is sought do we apply the <em>Daubert </em>standard. <em>State v. Cline, </em>275 Mont. 46, 55, 909 P.2d 1171, 1177 (1996). Where <em>Daubert </em>applies, a district court must look to several non-exclusive factors for considering if scientific evidence may be admitted, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(a) whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">(b) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (c) the known or potential rate of error in using a particular scientific technique and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation; and (d) whether the theory or technique has been generally accepted or rejected in the particular scientific field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-9\"><em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 52, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 52, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 52 (citing <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-95, 113 S. Ct. at 2796-98). However, where <em>Daubert </em>is inapplicable \u201cit is better to admit relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>testimony and allow its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation.\u201d <em>Barmeyer v. Montana Power Co., 202 </em>Mont. 185, 193-94, 657 P.2d 594, 598 (1983) (internal quotations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds, Martel v. Montana Power Co., </em>231 Mont. 96, 103, 752 P.2d 140, 145 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b624 Here, Price argues that the District Court erred by not applying and excluding Dr. Quirk\u2019s testimony under the <em>Daubert </em>standard. We disagree. Medical diagnosis is not \u201cnovel scientific evidence\u201d and therefore the <em>Daubert </em>standard does not apply. Consequently, we review the record to determine if the court abused its discretion in allowing Dr. Quirk\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b625 At trial, the State established a foundation that Dr. Quirk is a medical physician who is trained in how to \u201ctreat electrical shock and electrical burns[,]\u201d has conducted \u201cprivate research concerning injuries resulting from exposure to electric shock via a stun gun[,]\u201d and specializes in \u201c[flamily practice and emergency medicine.\u201d Price\u2019s counsel did not object \u201cto the foundation for the medical diagnosis\u201d and objected only to Dr. Quirk as an expert \u201cin regards to a stun gun ....\u201d In response to this objection the District Court found that Dr. Quirk was qualified to give an \u201copinion related to trauma, that a person may experience from electrical shock ....\u201d On cross-examination, Price\u2019s counsel elicited that Dr. Quirk used medical literature provided by the prosecution and did not know the difference in power between a stun gun and a taser.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b626  Looking to the record, it was not \u201cbeyond the bounds of reason\u201d for the District Court to allow Dr. Quirk to testify about the potential for serious bodily harm from a stun gun. <em>Ayers, </em>\u00b6 26. Given the foundation of Dr. Quirk\u2019s medical knowledge, the court reasonably found that Dr. Quirk was qualified to give a medical opinion that would, \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue ....\u201d M. R. Evid. 702. We adhere to the settled principle of admitting relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony and allowing its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation. <em>Barmeyer, </em>202 Mont. at 194, 657 P.2d at 598. Here, cross-examination allowed Price ample opportunity to address his concerns regarding Dr. Quirk\u2019s knowledge of stun guns and the trauma they may induce. Consequently, we find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony of Dr. Quirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\"> Price raises no separate issue regarding the propriety of the information considered by the District Court during sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
