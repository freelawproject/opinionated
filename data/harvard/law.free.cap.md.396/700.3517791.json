Hill filed a state common law negligence action against the forklift operator, appellee Daniel Knapp. The primary issue we must decide is whether the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 83 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, preempts a state tort claim for damages by a longshoreman against a co-employee in the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d We shall hold that the federal act preempts such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">On August 14, 2004, Christopher Hill, a dockworker, was on Pier C, Clinton Street, in Baltimore City, assisting the Rukert Terminals Corporation with the discharge of bundles of plywood from the vessel M/V TOFT ON. While performing this work, Hill was struck by a load of plywood dropped on him by a forklift operated by Knapp. Hill was a borrowed servant of Rukert,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Knapp was an employee of Rukert, and the two were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>co-employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Hill filed a claim for compensation and medical expenses under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Md.Code (1999, 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for accidental injury suffered in the course of employment. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission notified Hill in October 2004 of his award. Hill received compensation beginning on February 18, 2004 at a rate of $294 per week as well as necessary medical treatment and services as provided by the Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-660 through \u00a7 9-664 and \u00a7 9-689 of the Maryland Annotated Code. The Commission\u2019s award listed Onsite Commercial Staffing as Hill\u2019s employer. Hill was eligible for compensation under the LHWCA, but he did not file a claim under the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Hill filed a Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Daniel Knapp on June 2, 2005, alleging that Knapp was negligent in that \u201che failed to observe dockworkers around him, failed to stop in order to avoid an accident, failed to keep his vehicle under control, and failed to operate his vehicle in a reasonable and prudent manner.\u201d Hill sought one million dollars in compensation for the emotional and physical damages he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Knapp filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Hill filed a Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The Circuit Court held a hearing and granted Knapp\u2019s motion, denied Hill\u2019s Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tered summary judgment in favor of Knapp. The Circuit Court determined that \u201cthe remedies a state may apply within the twilight zone include tort remedies,\u201d but \u201cit is still necessary to decide whether a particular provision of state law is preempted by federal law.\u201d In analyzing whether the LHW CA\u2019s prohibition against co-employee suits preempts state law, the trial judge examined the purpose of the preemption provision. The Circuit Court noted that Congress enacted the immunity provision because it was concerned with \u201cthe hazardous work in which the parties to this suit were engaged\u201d and that depriving \u201ca worker of the immunity conferred upon him would frustrate the purpose of the Act.\u201d The Circuit Court held that the LHWCA preempted the state co-employee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Hill filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own initiative prior to decision by that court to consider (1) whether the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act precludes a state negligence claim against a co-employee in the \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d and (2) whether an employee who is eligible for benefits under the LHWCA is a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Hill v. Knapp, </em>393 Md. 477, 903 A.2d 416 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">As originally enacted in 1927, the federal LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>established a compensation scheme for maritime employees injured on navigable waters of the United States if recovery was unavailable through state workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. 715, 717-18, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 2435, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980); <em>see also Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962) (describing history of the LHWCA); <em>Peter v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., </em>903 F.2d 935 (3d Cir.1990) (providing detailed history of Supreme Court decisions interpreting LHWCA). As a result, longshoremen were provided, theoretically, with workers\u2019 compensation coverage regardless of the location of their injury. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>U.S. at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435. In practice, however, individuals injured at the boundary at which state remedies gave way to federal remedies were often forced to make a jurisdictional guess before filing a claim, and an improper guess resulted in, at best, additional expense and, at worst, foreclosure of the claim by statute of limitations. <em>Id.; Davis v. Department of Labor, </em>317 U.S. 249, 254, 63 S.Ct. 225, 228, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Since passage of the LHWCA, several Supreme Court cases have interpreted the applicability of state and federal workers\u2019 compensation in order to address the jurisdictional challenges of particular claims. We note briefly the historical development of the key cases to provide context for our analysis of the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA and the leading Supreme Court case interpreting the 1972 amendments, <em>Sun Ship, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged that a distinct \u201cborder\u201d between federal and state compensation schemes did not exist. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435; <em>Davis, </em>317 U.S. at 256, 63 S.Ct. at 229. Instead, the Court recognized a \u201ctwilight zone\u201d of concurrent jurisdiction where state and federal coverage overlapped. <em>Davis, </em>317 U.S. at 256, 63 S.Ct. at 229. Because it was difficult to determine whether state or federal law should apply in the \u201ctwilight zone,\u201d a case-by-case analysis was required to determine the permissible recovery scheme. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435; <em>Davis, </em>317 U.S. at 256, 63 S.Ct. at 229. In <em>Calbeck, </em>the Supreme Court further extended applicability of the LHWCA to \u201call injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters whether or not a particular injury might also have been within the constitutional reach of a state workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d <em>Calbeck, </em>370 U.S. at 117, 82 S.Ct. at 1198. <em>Calbeck </em>did not make federal compensation the exclusive remedy, but indicated that either state or federal law could provide compensation. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 719,100 S.Ct. at 2435-36; <em>Calbeck </em>at 126-32, 82 S.Ct. at 1203-06. The Supreme Court also held that the acceptance of payments under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the state act \u201cdoes not constitute an election of the remedy under state law precluding recovery under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act.\u201d <em>Calbeck, </em>370 U.S. at 131, 82 S.Ct. at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In 1972, Congress made significant amendments to the LHWCA. <em>See </em>Oct. 27, 1972, Pub.L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251. The purposes of the 1972 amendments were to extend the coverage of the LHWCA landward beyond the shoreline of navigable waters, to raise the amount of compensation available to longshoremen, to eliminate the longshore worker\u2019s strict liability seaworthiness remedy against shipowners, to eliminate the shipowner\u2019s claims for indemnification from stevedores, and to promulgate certain administrative reforms. <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, U.S. Dept. of Labor v. Perini North River Associates, </em>459 U.S. 297, 313, 103 S.Ct. 634, 645, 74 L.Ed.2d 465 (1983); <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 92-1125, at 1-2 (1972); H.Rep. No. 92-1441 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4698, 4698-4711. The 1972 amendments extended coverage to protect additional workers, for example, by amending 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) to include injuries that occurred \u201cupon the navigable waters of the United States <em>(including any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, or building a vessel).\u201d </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903(a) (2006) (emphasis added to show 1972 amendment); Oct. 27, 1972, Pub.L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Congress did not amend the sections of the LHWCA, adopted in 1959, that immunize workers from suits by fellow employees. Both sections 933(a) and 933(i) preserve the right of longshore and harbor workers to recover damages from third persons other than \u201cthe employer <em>or a person or persons </em>in his employ.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(a) (2006) (emphasis added to show 1959 amendment); Aug. 18,1959, Pub.L. 86-171, 73 Stat. 391. Section 933(i), adopted in 1959, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201cThe right to compensation or benefits under this chapter shall be the exclusive remedy to an employee when he is injured, or to his eligible survivors or legal representatives if he is killed, by the negligence or wrong of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>person or persons in the same employ: <em>Provided, </em>That this provision shall not affect the liability of a person other than an officer or employee of the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">S.Rep. No. 428, at 4-5 (1959); Aug. 18,1959, Pub.L. 86-171, 73 Stat. 391; <em>see also Bynum v. The S.S. Mormacteal, </em>188 F.Supp. 763 (E.D.Pa.1960) (noting that the 1959 amendments to \u00a7 933 insulate \u201cnot only the employer, but also the fellow employees of the injured party from any liability in damages to the injured party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The Supreme Court interpreted Congress\u2019 1972 amendments in <em>Sun Ship, Inc., v. Pennsylvania, </em>447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980). The five individuals injured in <em>Sun Ship </em>were eligible for benefits under the 1972 amended LHWCA, but each individual instead filed a claim for benefits under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act with state authorities. <em>Id. </em>at 716, 100 S.Ct. at 2434. The injured workers\u2019 employer, Sun Ship, Inc., asserted that the federal LHWCA was the employees\u2019 exclusive remedy because the employees were injured after the effective date of the 1972 amendments, which had expanded jurisdiction of the LHWCA landward. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201cThe single question presented by these consolidated cases is whether a State may apply its workers\u2019 compensation scheme to land-based injuries that fall within the coverage of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), as amended in 1972. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\"><em>Sun Ship </em>focused on Congress\u2019 intent through the 1972 amendments to provide relief for workers despite jurisdictional challenges. The Supreme Court reviewed the history of \u201ctwilight zone\u201d jurisdiction and noted that <em>Davis </em>\u201ceffectively established a regime of concurrent jurisdiction\u201d and <em>Calbeck </em>subsequently \u201cfurther overlapped federal and state-law coverage for marine workers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 100 S.Ct. at 2435. Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, emphasized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck </em>were still relevant to the interpretation of the 1972 amendments. The Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">\u201cAbsent any contradicting signal from Congress, the principles of <em>Davis v. Department of Labor, supra, </em>and of <em>Calbeck v. Travelers Insurance Co., supra, </em>direct the conclusion that the 1972 extension of federal jurisdiction supplements, rather than supplants, state compensation law. Given that the pre-1972 Longshoremen\u2019s Act ran concurrently with state remedies in the \u2018maritime but local\u2019 zone, it follows that the post-1972 expansion of the Act landward would be concurrent as well---- The language of the 1972 amendments cannot be fairly understood as preempting state workers\u2019 remedies from the field of the LHWCA, and thereby resurrecting the jurisdictional monstrosity that existed before the clarifying opinions in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Calbeck.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 719-20,100 S.Ct. at 2436.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Justice Brennan emphasized that Congress adopted the 1972 amendments with knowledge that state programs provided fewer benefits and that Congress wanted to address the disparities between state and federal compensation schemes. The Supreme Court stated: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201cWorkers who commence their actions under state law will generally be able to make up the difference between state and federal benefit levels by seeking relief under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, if the latter applies ... we find no evidence that Congress was concerned about a disparity between adequate federal benefits and <em>superior </em>state benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 724, 100 S.Ct. at 2438-39. The Court held that a state may apply its workers\u2019 compensation scheme to land-based injuries that fall within the expanded coverage of the LHWCA and that injured longshoremen could receive an award under the state <em>and </em>federal acts because the two schemes are complementary rather than exclusive. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 720, 100 S.Ct. at 2436; <em>Hess Oil, </em>903 F.2d at 948-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\"><em>Sun Ship </em>addressed state workers\u2019 compensation programs generally and did not specifically consider the context of a state negligence claim as is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Before this Court, appellant Hill argues that the federal LHWCA does not preempt a negligence claim authorized by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act against a co-employee for an injury that occurred where there is concurrent state and federal jurisdiction, <em>ie. </em>the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d Appellee Knapp maintains that appellant\u2019s state tort claim against co-employees is barred by \u00a7 933 of the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which immunizes workers from suits by co-employees, and preempts state tort law. Appellee also argues that appellant is not a \u201ccovered worker\u201d under \u00a7 9-223(a) of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and thus must seek compensation only through the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Rockwood Casualty Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 106, 867 A.2d 1026, 1030 (2005). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we independently determine first whether a dispute of material fact exists and only where such dispute is absent will we proceed to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 579, 831 A.2d 18, 24 (2003). We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party. <em>Rockwood, </em>385 Md. at 106, 867 A.2d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">It is well established that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not exclude tort actions between co-employees, but it does exclude an action in tort by an employee against his employer. Md.Code (2006), \u00a7 9-901 <em>et seq. </em>of the Lab. &amp; Empl. Article; <em>Suburban Hospital v. Kirson, </em>362 Md. 140, 145-46, 763 A.2d 185, 205 (2000); <em>Hutzell v. Boyer, </em>252 Md. 227, 232, 249 A.2d 449, 452 (1969). We must discern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>whether the federal LHWCA, sections 933(a) and (i), preempt a negligence claim authorized by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act against a co-employee for an injury that occurred where there is concurrent state and federal jurisdiction, <em>i.e. </em>the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Article VI, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution commands that the laws of the United States \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. CONST, art. VI, cl. 2. Under the Supremacy Clause, Congress may preempt a state law by express language, by intent to occupy the legislative field, or by implication to the extent that the state law actually conflicts with federal law and such a conflict arises when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, </em>533 U.S. 525, 541, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 2414, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001); <em>Geier v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>529 U.S. 861, 869-74, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 1919-22, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000); <em>Sweeney v.

The LHWCA lacks an express preemption clause regarding state negligence claims. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (2006). Nor do the 1972 amendments of the LHWCA and their interpretation in <em>Sun Ship </em>demonstrate a Congressional intent to preempt any state legislation affecting events occurring within the twilight zone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id.; Sun Ship, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>447 U.S. 715, 100 S.Ct. 2432, 65 L.Ed.2d 458. Thus, we focus our inquiry on whether the state law actually conflicts with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Our analysis is guided by the frequently made statement that \u201cthe purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d in every preemption case. <em>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 2617, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992); <em>Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, </em>375 U.S. 96, 103, 84 S.Ct. 219, 223, 11 L.Ed.2d 179 (1963). In the absence of specific preemption language, we look to the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole as revealed not only in the text, but through this Court\u2019s reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute to affect longshoremen. <em>See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485-86, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250-51, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996); <em>Sweeney v. Savings First, </em>388 Md. 319, 327, 879 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The legislative history of the 1959 amendments provides us with insight as to Congress\u2019 purpose in immunizing workers from negligence suits by fellow employees. The House Report states that the House Subcommittee on Safety and Compensation was concerned with \u201csuits by injured workers against co-employees which have resulted in large recoveries ultimately paid by the employer.\u201d H.R. Rep. 86-229, at 3 (1959). Senate Report No. 86-428 describes in even greater detail Congress\u2019 rationale for immunizing co-employees from negligence suits. The Senate Report states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u201cThe other major provision of the bill relates to the immunization of fellow employees against damage suits. The ratio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>nale of this change in the law is that when an employee goes to work in a hazardous industry he encounters two risks. First, the risks inherent in the hazardous work and second, the risk that he might negligently hurt someone else and thereby incur a large common-law damage liability. While it is true that this provision limits an employee\u2019s rights, it would at the same time expand them by immunizing him against suits where he negligently injures a fellow worker. It simply means that rights and liabilities arising within the \u2018employee family\u2019 -will be settled within the framework of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATO\">S.Rep. No. 86-428, at 2 (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>1959 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2134, 2135. This legislative history indicates that Congress weighed the trade-offs between allowing or eliminating co-employee negligence suits and determined that injured workers were better served by avoiding protracted litigation and receiving certain, albeit sometimes smaller, payments. <em>See Perron v. Bell Maintenance &amp; Fabricators, Inc., </em>970 F.2d 1409, 1412 (5th Cir.1992). Additionally, as mentioned in the House Report, employers benefitted by not being ultimately responsible for damages awarded in co-employee negligence suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Nothing in the legislative history of the 1972 amendments indicates that Congress changed its mind regarding the value of immunizing co-workers from negligence suits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> ******14Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>1972 amendments did not modify \u00a7 933 and it is implicit throughout the legislative history that fellow workers were not to be held liable in tort.

As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sun Ship, </em>\u201cwe therefore find no sign in the 1972 amendments to the LHWCA that Congress wished to alter the accepted understanding that federal jurisdiction would coexist with state compensation laws\u201d in the twilight zone. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 722, 100 S.Ct. at 2437-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We conclude that the main purposes of the 1959 and 1972 amendments were to immunize longshoremen from co-employee negligence suits, to provide a uniform compensation system for injured maritime workers, regardless of whether their injury occurred on land or over water, and to eliminate dual recovery by employees indirectly from their employers through co-worker suits or directly through the seaworthiness remedy. We agree with appellant that \u201cthe purpose of the 1972 LHWCA amendments is to supplement, not supplant, state law,\u201d thereby enhancing benefits to injured workers, but we are of the opinion that the LHWCA and Maryland law are in direct conflict as to the maintenance of co-employee suits. We hold that allowing a state negligence claim stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress\u2019 goals of immunizing longshoremen from co-employee negligence suits and providing longshoremen with a uniform compensation system.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Alabama considered this issue and reached the same conclusion as we reach today.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Fillinger v. Foster, </em>448 So.2d 321 (Ala.1984). In <em>Fillinger, </em>the longshoreman sued his eo-em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ployee for injuries allegedly sustained while working on the job. <em>Id. </em>at 322. As is the case with appellant Hill, the longshoremen applied for state workers\u2019 compensation benefits but did not apply for benefits under the LHW CA even though he was eligible for them. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Alabama stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cWe can perceive no greater conflict than that which would be presented if we allowed this employee to sue his co-employee because he was a land-based maritime worker, and a maritime worker injured on a navigable waterway would be precluded from maintaining such a suit; therefore, we are persuaded to hold that the exclusivity provisions of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(i) apply and that the state action was barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We agree with the Alabama court\u2019s reasoning.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Permitting a negligence claim disrupts the uniformity of benefits Congress intended to provide to longshoremen in the 1972 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ments and does not further the availability of no-fault compensation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Hill and Knapp were longshoremen operating within the jurisdiction of the LHWCA, and Knapp is entitled to the immunity established in \u00a7 933, even where Hill did not file a LHWCA claim. Maryland law, which conflicts with this immunity, must therefore yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We note also that <em>Sun Ship </em>perceived that preemption of certain clauses in a state compensation scheme might be necessary to ensure proper implementation of both the state and federal compensation statutes. <em>Sun Ship, </em>447 U.S. at 724 n. 6, 100 S.Ct. at 2438 n. 6. Specifically, the Supreme Court acknowledged that it is appropriate to preempt a state compensation exclusivity clause that declares its award final because it was Congress\u2019 intent to allow an injured worker who first seeks inferior state benefits to then make a claim under the LHWCA to obtain the difference between state and federal benefits. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cMost often, state workmen\u2019s compensation laws will not be treated as making awards thereunder final or conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>sive \u2014 Admittedly, if a particular state compensation law provision does indisputably declare its awards final, a conflict with the LHWCA may possible arise where a claimant seeks inferior state benefits in the first instance.... At any rate, although the question is not directly before us, we observe that if federal preclusion ever need be implied to cope with this remote contingency, a less disruptive approach would be to preempt the state compensation exclusivity clause, rather than to preempt the entire state compensation statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>where the state compensation scheme conflicts with federal law, state law is preempted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The 1972 amendments and <em>Sun Ship </em>allow Maryland to apply its workers\u2019 compensation scheme to land-based injuries that fall within the expanded coverage of the LHWCA, but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>related negligence claim against a co-employee is not permitted because it conflicts with the exclusivity provisions in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit considered whether a different exclusivity provision, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a), barred a state tort suit by an employee injured in the twilight zone against his employer in <em>Peter v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., </em>903 F.2d 935 (3d Cir.1990).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court analyzed the preemption issue and noted that the LHWCA, as amended in 1972, embraces a <em>quid pro quo </em>where the employer provides no-fault compensation in exchange for immunity from tort liability for damages. <em>Id. </em>at 951. The Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cWe are unable to distinguish state imposed negligence liability from federally imposed negligence liability, and the appellant has tendered no suggestion as to why Congress might have wanted to grant immunity from the latter and not the former. The appellant\u2019s judgment based on Virgin Islands\u2019 law is every bit as disruptive of Congress\u2019 <em>quid pro quo </em>as would be a negligence judgment based on federal maritime law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 951-52. The court concluded that \u201cthe application of Virgin Islands tort law in situations like this does not further the availability of no-fault compensation for injured maritime workers; it simply obstructs the purposes of LHWCA by depriving maritime employers of their side of LHWCA\u2019s <em>quid </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>pro quo.\u201d Id. </em>at 953. Accordingly, the court held that \u00a7 905(a) of the LHWCA and the Supremacy Clause bar a state or territorial tort recovery against the employer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 953. Although the statutory exclusion provision involved in the case <em>sub. .judice </em>differs, the <em>Hess Oil </em>analysis supports our conclusion that state tort claims are preempted if they conflict with the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We hold that a state law negligence claim against a co-employee, as authorized by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of the LHWCA. <em>Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>533 U.S. at 541, 121 S.Ct. at 2414; <em>Geier, </em>529 U.S. at 869-74, 120 S.Ct. at 1919-22; <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941). Allowing a negligence claim is in direct conflict with Congress\u2019 intent to immunize longshoremen from co-employee negligence suits and to permit a uniform compensation system for injured maritime workers, regardless of whether their injury occurred on land or over water. In light of this direct conflict, we hold that the exclusivity provisions of the federal LHWCA are controlling and preempt negligence claims under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We turn to appellee Knapp\u2019s assertion that Hill is not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under \u00a7 9-223(a) of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We need not address this issue because of our holding on the issue of preemption. Preemption of the state negligence claim filed by Hill has rendered appellee Knapp not liable to Hill. Thus, Knapp no longer has any interest in Hill\u2019s ability to redeem benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or the LHWCA. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>cause Knapp lacks a sufficient interest in whether Hill is a \u201ccovered employee,\u201d we decline to consider his position regarding Hill\u2019s status under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contains a similar sanctions clause in \u00a7 9-509, but Hill's employer participated in the Act and therefore we do not address whether a tort claim against an employer would be preempted if an employer opted out of the Maryland Workers' Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) states as follows: \u201cThe liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee ... except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee ... may elect to claim compensation under the chapter, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death. In such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, or that the employee assumed the risk of his employment, or that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee. For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor's employees only if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by section 904.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">.
