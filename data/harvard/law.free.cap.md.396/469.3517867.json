In addressing this query, we are required to determine, in the context of discriminatory discharge cases filed pursuant to Montgomery County, Md., Code \u00a7 27-19, whether the <em>\u201coccurrence </em>of the alleged discriminatory act\u201d means (1) the notification of an employee\u2019s impending discharge, or (2) the actual cessation of an employee\u2019s employment. Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 42(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">I. FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In October 1998, Petitioner Suzanne Haas was hired as a Program Administrator in the Lockheed Martin Corporation\u2019s Mission Systems division. At the time of her hiring, she possessed a Master\u2019s degree and was near completion of her Doctorate, lacking only a finished dissertation. From the date of hiring until October 1999, Haas worked under the supervision of Katie Sterrett, who gave Haas largely positive formal, as well as informal, performance reviews. By all accounts, Haas initially achieved the level of performance expected of new employees. In June 1999, however, Sterrett noted, and Haas acknowledged, a problem with Haas\u2019s attention to details. This difficulty persisted for several months and, in January 2000, Haas sought a psychiatric evaluation of the situation. Tests yielded a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder (\u201cADD\u201d) and learning disabilities, both of which were to be treated with medication. Several months later, Haas informed her new supervisor, Amy Lowenstein, of the diagnosis and assured her that the medication was alleviating the adverse symptoms of her condition. In June 2000, Lowenstein completed an annual personnel review, called a \u201cContribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Assessment\u201d, of Haas\u2019s performance at Lockheed. The conclusion classified Haas as a \u201ccontributor\u201d to the company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In May or April 2000, as part of a structural reorganization at Lockheed, Haas began dividing her work time between her Missions Systems position and a new post in the consolidated human resources unit called Corporate Shared Services. In this role, Haas reported to a supervisor in the Learning Services unit of Corporate Shared Services, Candice Phelan, who also was aware of Haas\u2019s medical condition. Haas and Phelan exchanged correspondence where Haas clarified that her medical condition would have no adverse effect on her work and Phelan expressed her confidence in their future working relationship. Nonetheless, a conflict arose shortly after Haas began assuming more responsibilities under the supervision of Phelan.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Petitioner, in her later filed complaint, alleged a number of instances where Phelan exhibited a general disapproval of Haas\u2019s work and assertedly made undue and frequent criticisms of her performance. Among these instances were claims that Phelan consistently suggested that Haas should not be assigned tasks involving writing, mathematical calculations, exercise of judgment, computers, or attention to detail. Petitioner also alleged that Phelan told Petitioner that she should consider a teaching career, as opposed to remaining at Lockheed Martin. Phelan purportedly went so far as to forward to Haas, unsolicited, a job posting from outside the company. Petitioner assigned a malevolent motive to the remarks and actions of Phelan, in contrast to the praise she apparently received from customers and others who encountered her work. Reprimands from Phelan continued for what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Haas described as various minor deficiencies in Haas\u2019s performance, such as spelling errors in written work that allegedly passed without criticism when committed similarly by other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In April 2001, Phelan informed Haas that the functions Haas performed at Learning Services were to be transferred to the company\u2019s Institute for Leadership Excellence (\u201cILE\u201d) at some time in the near future. On 10 April 2001, the Director of the ILE, Dorothea Mahan, posted on the company\u2019s Career Network website link a notice for an opening for a staff position dedicated, <em>inter alia, </em>to the logistical and planning functions previously performed by Haas for Learning Services. Haas applied for this position, but neither was selected for an interview nor offered the position. Mahan explained, in a deposition taken following the filing of Haas\u2019s complaint, that, in her view, Haas lacked the requisite experience in event planning to serve the needs of the position. It is uncertain exactly when Haas was informed that her application was unsuccessful,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it suffices to say that she was not aware that she had not been selected for the ILE position until shortly before she received a notification of layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On 11 June 2001, Phelan placed Haas on a Performance Improvement Plan (\u201cPIP\u201d), a type of formal discipline apparently meant to direct the improvement of the disciplined employee\u2019s performance. Phelan dispatched a memorandum to Haas confirming the topics discussed at a meeting between the two to review the PIP, including Phelan\u2019s perceptions of Haas\u2019s shortcomings in judgment, planning, and attention to detail. Also part of the PIP discussion was a reference to the theft of a laptop under Haas\u2019s control while at a business meeting. The PIP memorandum indicated that a failure to correct the issues highlighted therein might subject Haas to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>further disciplinary action, including dismissal. Petitioner disputed the accuracy of various issues raised in the PIP when it was issued, as echoed in her complaint, along with the contention that, with regard to the laptop theft, she was disciplined more severely than other employees in similar situations. Petitioner further stated in her complaint that Phelan\u2019s issuance of the PIP and its contents were merely subtexts to harm Petitioner\u2019s standing at the company and simultaneously disqualify her from any possible promotions, transfers, or other opportunities at Lockheed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Phelan dispatched a memorandum to Haas on 24 September 2001 indicating that the relevant aspects of her performance had improved sufficiently and, as a result, she was being taken off the PIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On 28 June 2001, Phelan completed an annual Contribution Assessment of Haas, in which she rated Haas as a \u201cmarginal contributor.\u201d Although Phelan indicated that she was impressed with several of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cvery positive attributes\u201d, she stated that Petitioner exhibited below-standard performances in judgment, compliance with company policy, attention to detail, and planning. Petitioner, at the time, disputed the reliability of her lower rating because she believed that Phelan had not taken into account positive feedback from two customers she serviced.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Phelan composed a memorandum to Haas, dated 9 October 2001, with the subject line \u201cNotification of Layoff,\u201d indicating that Haas\u2019s position was to be eliminated effective 23 October 2001. The text of the memorandum made reference to the layoff as a \u201cReduction in Force\u201d. It also contained a description of the company\u2019s severance benefit plan, a contact with \u201coutplacement services\u201d, and a request to complete an exit interview prior to Haas\u2019s last day of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Haas, pointing to her supervisors\u2019 alleged reactions to her diagnosed ADD, filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Montgomery County on 22 October 2003 alleging, under Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-19, disability discrimination in Lockheed\u2019s termination of her employment. Lockheed responded with a Motion to Dismiss, filed on 25 November 2003, contending that the Complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and raising certain constitutional issues, the latter of which are not relevant to this Court in the posture the case reaches us. As a result of Lockheed\u2019s arguments challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 27-19, Montgomery County, Maryland, moved to intervene, which was allowed, and opposed Lockheed\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court, after a hearing, denied the Motion to Dismiss. Following discovery, on 1 November 2004, Lockheed filed a Motion for Summary Judgment which Haas opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Lockheed\u2019s posited in its summary judgment motion that Haas\u2019s claim was time-barred in the first instance because it accrued upon notice of her layoff, rather than upon her final day of work. Maryland Code, Article 49B, \u00a7 42(b)(1) provides: \u201cAn action under [the relevant local anti-discrimination ordinance] shall be commenced in the circuit court for the county in which the alleged discrimination took place not later than 2 years after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.\u201d Lockheed also contended that Haas had not proven in her complaint that she was improperly \u201cregarded as\u201d being disabled by her supervisors under Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-6 and additionally that the acts challenged as discriminatory were legitimate business acts. Haas responded in her opposition that the relevant statute of limitations only began to run upon her final day of employment. She also submitted that the issues of her being regarded as disabled, and whether she was discriminated against on that basis, were material facts in dispute, which could not be resolved on summary judgment. After a hearing, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment to Lockheed upon the statute of limitations ground. Haas filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a reported opinion. <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>166 Md.App. 163, 887 A.2d 673 (2005). Haas petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">A. Standard of Review of the Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">This case requires us to review the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondent Lockheed Martin. We consider, <em>de novo, </em>first, whether a material fact was placed in genuine dispute, thus requiring a trial, and, second, if trial by a fact-finder is not required, whether the Circuit Court was legally correct in granting summary judgment. <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 9, 862 A.2d 33, 38 (2004) (citing <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98,105 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The standard for reviewing the grant of summary judgment is well-settled in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501 indicates that a motion for summary judgment is appropriate \u2018on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 A motion for summary judgment may be supported by affidavit. When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment we must determine whether a material factual issue exists, and all inferences are resolved against the moving party. \u2018[E]ven where the underlying facts are undisputed, if those facts are susceptible of more than one permissible inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law, but should be submitted to the trier of fact.\u2019 The function of a summary judgment proceeding is not to try the case or to attempt to resolve factual disputes but to determine whether there is a dispute as to material facts sufficient to provide an issue to be tried. A \u2018material fact\u2019 is one which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">An appellate court reviewing a summary judgment examines the same information from the record and determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the same issues of law as the trial court. We are often concerned with whether a dispute of material fact exists when reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion. We recently reiterated the standard of review for a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment in <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 892 A.2d 520 (2006):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">\u2018The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal. <em>Livesay v. Baltimore, </em>384 Md. 1, 9, 862 A.2d 33, 38 (2004). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Md. Rule 2-501, we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 862 A.2d at 38. We review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 10, 862 A.2d at 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 203, 892 A.2d at 529.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\"><em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 65-67, 899 A.2d 819, 825-826 (2006) (some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">There are no material facts in genuine dispute here bearing on the legal ground upon which summary judgment was granted. The parties agree that, on 9 October 2001, Petitioner was issued a written notification of her layoff, which was to become effective on 23 October 2001. Petitioner\u2019s employment at Lockheed ceased on 23 October 2001. Therefore, we shall consider whether the grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court in favor of Lockheed Martin based on the applicable statute of limitations, was correct as a matter o f law. <em>Livesay, </em>384 Md. at 9, 862 A.2d at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">B. The Date of Accrual for Wrongful Discharge and the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Section 42 of Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Article 49B authorizes individuals in Prince George\u2019s, Montgomery, and Howard Counties to pursue private, civil claims of discrimination, pursuant to the provisions of the respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>county codes, and seek both damages and injunctive relief. The provision of the Montgomery County Code relevant here makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cdischarge any individual\u201d on the basis of the \u201cdisability of a qualified individual.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The County Code defines \u201cdisability\u201d not only in terms of an actual \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of an individual\u2019s major life activities\u201d, but also \u201cbeing regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d Montgomery County, Md., Code \u00a7 27-6. Petitioner has staked her claim on the notion that her supervisors at Lockheed mistakenly regarded her as being disabled. No contention is advanced here that Petitioner is not entitled to the protection afforded by County Code \u00a7 27-19 and we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that she is so entitled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A private, civil action brought under this regulatory scheme must be filed within two years of the \u201coccurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 42(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The Circuit Court granted, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, summary judgment for Lockheed on the ground that Petitioner\u2019s cause of action for discrimination was time-barred by the statute of limitations imposed by Maryland Code, \u00a7 42(b) of Article 49B. Essentially, as the reasoning of the Circuit Court went, Haas\u2019s cause of action accrued no later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>than on 9 October 2001, the date she received Phelan\u2019s layoff memorandum, thus requiring the initiation of suit by no later than 9 October 2003. Having filed her Complaint on 22 October 2003, Haas\u2019s claim was time-barred. The trial court and the intermediate appellate court both found persuasive on this question the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980) and <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981) (per curiam), reasoning that the term \u201cdischarge\u201d, as used in \u00a7 27-19 of the County Code, meant the notification of discharge from employment, as opposed to the date of the complete cessation of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">While both of these cases, one of which construes the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are relevant authorities because our courts traditionally seek guidance from federal cases in interpreting Maryland\u2019s Article 49B,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they do not bind us here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Ricks, </em>Columbus Ricks, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>black Liberian professor at Delaware State College, alleged that the College discriminated against him on the basis of his national origin when he was denied tenure after serving several years on the faculty. 449 U.S. at 252,101 S.Ct. at 501. After the Board of Trustees formally voted against tenure for Ricks following a reconsideration by the Faculty Committee on Promotions and Tenure, Ricks pursued an internal grievance process through the Board\u2019s Educational Policy Committee. <em>Id. </em>While this grievance was pending, the College followed its policies regarding the termination of non-tenured junior faculty members, which included an offer of a one-year \u201cterminal\u201d contract. <em>Ricks, 449 </em>U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 501. Ricks signed the contract and, within eight days thereafter, the Board of Trustees informed Ricks that his grievance was denied. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 253-54, 101 S.Ct. at 501-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">After the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter to Ricks, he filed suit in federal District Court alleging that he had been the subject of discrimination. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 502. The District Court dismissed the action as untimely for the reason that the applicable statute of limitations of 180 days became engaged on the day the College offered Ricks the terminal one-year contract and therefore Ricks failed to file his EEOC complaint before the expiration of the relevant limitations period. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 502. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that Ricks\u2019s cause of action accrued upon the expiration of his terminal contract, rather than on its offer. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. at 503. The Third Circuit relied heavily on public policy reasoning that to require litigation to commence contemporaneously with the employee\u2019s last days on the job would reduce productivity and confound conciliation attempts in light of the possibility that the initial decision to terminate may be reversed before it became effectuated. <em>Ricks, </em>449 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>U.S. at 255-56, 101 S.Ct. at 503. The Third Circuit extolled the benefits of a bright-line rule based on the final day of work as a better guide for both employees and courts regarding the triggering of limitations. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit, holding that the limitations period commenced upon the College\u2019s notification to Ricks that he was denied tenure and offered a terminal contract. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 261-62, 101 S.Ct. at 506. The Court analyzed the timeliness issue by first identifying \u201cprecisely the \u2018unlawful employment practice\u2019 of which [Ricks] complains, \u201d based on the allegations contained in Ricks\u2019s complaint. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 257, 101 S.Ct. at 503-04. Finding in Ricks\u2019s complaint that he had not alleged any discriminatory acts through the time of his actual discharge, the Court opined that he could not breathe new life into his complaint for denial of tenure by arguing later that his discharge was also discriminatory. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977)) (\u201cMere continuity of employment, without more, is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment discrimination.\u201d). The Court, in its analysis, hewed to the acts of discrimination alleged in the complaint, notwithstanding when the effects of those acts are manifested. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504 (\u201cThe proper focus is upon the time of the <em>discriminatory acts, </em>not upon the time at which the <em>consequences </em>of the acts become most painful.\u201d (quoting <em>Abramson v. Univ. of Hawaii, </em>594 F.2d 202, 209 (9th Cir.1979))). Because Ricks failed to allege that \u201cthe manner in which h is employment was terminated differed discriminatorily from the manner in which the College terminated other professors who also had been denied tenure,\u201d the only discriminatory act for the Court to consider was the denial of tenure. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that the result reached in <em>Ricks </em>was dictated by the particular facts in that case and that the \u201cwidely varying circumstances\u201d of other discriminatory discharge cases require that the principles discussed in <em>Ricks </em>be applied on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Less than one year after <em>Ricks, </em>the Supreme Court granted certiorari in another tenure denial case, <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6. In <em>Chardon, </em>several non-tenured administrators in the Puerto Rico Department of Education were notified by letter that their appointments would conclude within a certain time frame. 454 U.S. at 6-7,102 S.Ct. at 28. One employee contested the legality of the termination by filing a lawsuit, which was dismissed by a federal District Court as time-barred, premised on the reasoning that the cause of action accrued upon the receipt of the termination notification letters. <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 7, 102 S.Ct. at 28. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the District Court, holding that the accrual date was the actual day that the appointments ended. <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 6, 102 S.Ct. at 29. The Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the First Circuit stating that its decision was contrary to the holding in <em>Ricks, </em>which could not be distinguished from <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 7-8, 102 S.Ct. at 29. Specifically, the Court noted that \u201cin each case, the operative decision was made\u2014and notice given\u2014in advance of a designated date on which employment terminated.\u201d <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. at 29. Because the administrators in <em>Chardon </em>did not allege any discriminatory acts following the decision to terminate them appointments, the Court held that the limitations period on their claims commenced on the date they were notified of their impending terminations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">As Petitioner and Respondent in the present case demonstrated in their briefs and at oral argument, there exists a split across jurisdictions as to the acceptance of the eponymous <em>\u201cRicks/Chardon </em>rule\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It appears that the majority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>states<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> have adopted this rule in discriminatory discharge cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There are, however, a number of states that rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule in favor of the approach that considers, in applying a limitations period to a discrimination claim, a discharge to have occurred upon the actual cessation of employment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Of the states that adopted <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>and held that a discriminatory discharge action accrues upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>employee\u2019s receipt of an anticipatory discharge notice, many have done so with little analysis or discussion. For example, in <em>Quicker v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, </em>the Colorado Court of Appeals simply acknowledged that no Colorado authority previously interpreted Colorado\u2019s discriminatory discharge statute for limitations purposes and adopted the <em>Ricks </em>holding to fill the vacuum. 747 P.2d 682, 683 (1987). In <em>Humphreys v. Riverside Manufacturing Company, </em>the Court of Appeals of Georgia merely offered naked citations to <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon </em>in its adoption of the rule. 169 Ga.App. 18, 311 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1983). These cases, and the others following <em>Ricks/Chardon, </em>appear to us to adopt the rule out of convenience because their state provisions are sufficiently similar to Title VII and that the Supreme Court has spoken on the federal side of the issue. On the other hand, those state appellate courts charting a different course than that plotted by <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon </em>tend to devote themselves to greater analysis and consideration of the issues raised by the accrual question, perhaps due in part to a perceived need to justify more fully why they deviate from the \u201cmajority view\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The divergent opinions from Hawaii, California, and New Jersey seem to us to epitomize best the arguments gainsaying adoption of the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule. The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in <em>Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Company, </em>76 Hawai'i 454, 879 P.2d 1037 (1994), produced the first substantial opinion contrary to the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule. The court there dealt with an employment discrimination regulatory scheme nearly identical to the one involved in the present case. <em>Ross, </em>879 P.2d at 1038 n. 2. In fact, the Hawaii regulatory scheme, like the one in Maryland, involves one statute prohibiting a discriminatory discharge, <em>compare </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 378-2, <em>with </em>Montgomery County, Md., Code \u00a7 27-19, and another setting forth the limitations period. <em>Compare </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 378-4(c), <em>with </em>Md.Code, Art. 49B, \u00a7 42(b). In both cases, the meanings assigned to the statutory words \u201cdischarge\u201d and \u201coccurred\u201d became dispositive. <em>Ross, </em>879 P.2d at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In rejecting the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule, the Hawaiian court examined the plain language of the statutes involved. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>That examination yielded a finding that \u201cdischarge\u201d is commonly understood to mean the termination of employment and that \u201coccurred\u201d ordinarily refers to the past happening of some event. <em>Id. </em>Taken together in the context of an alleged discriminatory discharge, the words conveyed a sense that the statute of limitations only commences after the termination from employment. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ross </em>court buttressed its holding that accrual occurs upon actual discharge by touting the virtues of a bright line rule benefiting employees and employers alike. 879 P.2d at 1044-45. As a practical matter, the court noted that most employees do not become aware of their legal remedies, or even suspect that they have a viable claim for discrimination, until after the actual discharge. <em>Ross, </em>879 P.2d at 1045. Accordingly, a bright line rule favors the resolution of such claims on their merits, which in turn furthers the remedial purposes of the statutory scheme in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>Because employers ultimately control the time that notice of discharge is delivered and the actual termination is executed, the threat of stale claims may be limited effectively. <em>Id. </em>Finally, a bright line rule brings certainty and simplicity to an otherwise confounding decision of when an employee might be, or should have been, aware of his or her cause of action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In the age discrimination case of <em>Romano v. Rockwell International Incorporated, </em>the Supreme Court of California echoed the same considerations noted by the high court of Hawaii: the plain language and remedial purpose of the wrongful discharge statute, limited burden on the employer, and simplicity of a bright line. 14 Cal.4th 479, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114, 1122-23 (1996). The <em>Romano </em>Court added that were it to adopt the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule such would \u201cpromote premature and potentially destructive claims, in that the employee would be required to institute a complaint ... while he or she still was employed, thus seeking a remedy for a harm that had not yet occurred.\u201d 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d at 1123. The chances of conciliation between the employer and employee seriously would be jeopardized and judicial economy could be hampered by the possibility that suits will be filed based on a notice of termination that might later be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>rescinded. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it was noted that <em>Ross </em>distinguished the academic setting of the factual contexts of <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon </em>from the other types of workplaces, in that a notification of termination in the other employment contexts does not lead inevitably to an actual discharge, as it does where denial of tenure is involved at an academic institution. 59 Cal. Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d at 1125. <em>Ross </em>was also noted as criticizing the rationale of <em>Ricks </em>for being contrary to the \u201ccustomary principles of limitations law\u201d because it requires an employee to dispute a termination that has not taken place yet. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 9, 102 S.Ct. at 29 (Brennan, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The New Jersey cases departing from the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>line of authority, <em>Alderiso v. Medical Center of Ocean County, Incorporated, </em>167 N.J. 191, 770 A.2d 275 (2001) and <em>Holmin v. TRW Incorporated, </em>330 N.J.Super. 30, 748 A.2d 1141 (2000), also discussed many of the same points raised by the Hawaiian and Californian high courts. The analysis in <em>Alderiso </em>started with an evaluation of the plain meaning of the statutorily undefined term \u201cdischarge.\u201d 770 A.2d at 280, 279. After settling on \u201cdischarge\u201d as meaning the last day of paid salary, the New Jersey court referred to the reasoning in Justice Stevens\u2019s dissent in <em>Ricks </em>as more persuasive support for the clearer and simpler rule for the commencement of limitations on the actual termination date. <em>Alderiso, </em>770 A.2d at 281. The <em>Holmin </em>case, which dealt with a claim for fraudulent inducement to retire, rather than a discriminatory discharge, analyzed and discarded the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule for many of the same reasons already discussed <em>supra. </em>748 A.2d at 1142. <em>Holmin </em>rejected the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule as \u201carbitrary\u201d and criticized those cases adopting it as lacking \u201cany persuasive discussion of a sound policy basis\u201d for doing so. 748 A.2d at 1151. Rather, the court praised the more compelling points made in the cases antedating the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon:</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the termination decision may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>rescinded before its effective date; a bright line rule brings clarity to both the conciliatory and litigation processes; and no viable action can exist until the termination actually occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">C. We Reject the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>Rule as Applied to the Present Case<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We find the collective rationales of the Hawaii, California, and New Jersey cases persuasive in interpreting our statutory scheme. Like the statutes involved in those cases, the pertinent language in Art. 49B of the Maryland Code and \u00a7 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code are not defined in the legislation. We therefore must utilize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>principles of statutory construction to determine the meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d in Art. 49B, \u00a7 42(b) and \u201cdischarge\u201d in Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-19(a)(l)(A). We begin with the familiar command to effectuate the plain meaning of the language as conceived by the \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language.\u201d <em>Adventist Health Care Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 124 n. 13, 896 A.2d 320, 333 n. 13 (2006) (quoting <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004)). The Court of Special Appeals appears to have sidestepped this principle in favor of relying on federal decisional law construing Title VII as a surrogate for analysis of the meaning of the terms used in the Maryland enactments. <em>Haas, </em>166 Md.App. at 177, 887 A.2d at 681-82. While it certainly is permissible to have recourse to federal law similar to our own as an aid in construction of Maryland statutory law, it should not be a substitute for the pre-eminent plain meaning inquiry of the statutory language under examination. <em>See Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738 n. 8, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 n. 8 (1993) (citing <em>Metro. Mortgage Fund, Inc. v. Basiliko, </em>288 Md. 25, 27, 415 A.2d 582 (1980); <em>State v. Gross, </em>134 Md.App. 528, 621, 760 A.2d 725, 774 (2000) (admonishing that persuasive federal law may be looked to, but not necessarily to the exclusion of independent judgment and analysis by Maryland courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Consultation with several popular dictionaries reveals that the commonly understood, plain meaning of \u201cdischarge\u201d concurs with the view that a discharge occurs at the time the employee is terminated actually from employment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>regard, we agree with our sister courts who reached the same result. <em>See, e.g., Alderiso, </em>770 A.2d at 280; <em>Romano, </em>59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d at 1122; <em>Ross, </em>76 Hawai'i 454, 879 P.2d 1037, 1044. Even were we to consider alternatively that the meaning of \u201cdischarge\u201d was ambiguous, we are not bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII in our interpretation of Art. 49B, as noted earlier, notwithstanding the arguable similarity in the two regulatory schemes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Were we confronted with ambiguity regarding legislative intent, it is our duty to announce a rule that we are convinced is best supported by sound jurisprudential policy germane to the pursuit of legislative intent.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We said recently in <em>Stoddard v. State </em>that when supervening policy considerations outweigh the consensus interpretation of a rule according to the principles of statutory construction, we should not hesitate to make our conclusions based upon policy. 389 Md. 681, 704 n. 6, 887 A.2d 564, 577 n. 6 (2005). <em>Stoddard </em>held, contrary to the majority of other federal and state jurisdictions, that \u201ca declarant\u2019s lack of intent to communicate a belief in the truth of a particular proposition is irrelevant to the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>whether the words are hearsay when offered to prove the truth of that proposition.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> 389 Md. at 703, 887 A.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We hold that, for the purpose of claims filed pursuant to \u00a7 42 of the Maryland Code, Article 49B, a \u201cdischarge\u201d occurs upon the actual termination of an employee, rather than upon notification that such a termination is to take effect at some future date. In doing so, we find more persuasive the reasoning employed by those states that have rejected the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule in favor of the one we adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">First, we consider the remedial nature and purpose of Article 49B. Our cases consistently refer to Article 49B as being remedial in nature. <em>See, e.g., Wholey v. Sears Roebuck, </em>370 Md. 38, 52-53, 803 A.2d 482, 490 (2002); <em>State v. Sheldon, </em>332 Md. 45, 63-64, 629 A.2d 753, 763 (1993) (\u201c[W]hat is necessary are laws which <em>remedy </em>the effects of pernicious beliefs, <em>see e.g. </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol.) Art. 49B (anti-discrimination laws), and which thereby force justice on those who are as yet unwilling to embrace it in their hearts and minds.\u201d) (emphasis added and removed); <em>Watson v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. 467, 484-85, 588 A.2d 760, 768 (1991); <em>Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 626, 561 A.2d 179, 190 (1989) (\u201cIn cases of discharge motivated by employment discrimination prohibited by Title VII and Art. 49B the statutes create both the right ... and <em>remedies </em>for enforcing that exception\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Vavasori v. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>65 Md.App. 237, 243, 500 A.2d 307, 310 (1985) (\u201cThe <em>remedy of Art. 19 B </em>was created, regulated, and enforced by the State.\u201d) (emphasis added). The remedies provided by Article 49B further the crucial objective of eliminating discrimination and advancing equal opportunity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>Sheldon, </em>332 Md. at 63-64, 629 A.2d at 763; <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U.S. v. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>290 Md. 333, 344, 430 A.2d 60, 66 (1981) (\u201cThe legislature in enacting and amending Article 49B leaves no room to doubt its intent and purpose, i.e., to eradicate the vestiges of discrimination in the categories designated.\u201d); <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Amecom Div. of Litton Sys., Inc., </em>278 Md. 120, 124, 360 A.2d 1, 4 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">As a remedial statute, \u00a7 42 of Article 49B should be construed liberally in favor of claimants seeking its protection. <em>Montgomery County Bd. of Educ. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., </em>383 Md. 527, 544, 860 A.2d 909, 919 (2004); <em>Harris v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard, County, </em>375 Md. 21, 38, 825 A.2d 365, 375 (2003) (quoting <em>Victory Sparkler &amp; Specialty Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 382, 128 A. 635, 640 (1925)) (\u201c \u2018The Maryland act is remedial and should receive a liberal construction so as to give to it the most beneficial operation.... \u2019 \u201d); <em>Marsheck v. Bd. of Trs. of Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys. of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 256, 674 A.2d 951, 957 (1996) (quoting <em>Harrison v. John F. Pilli &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>321 Md. 336, 341, 582 A.2d 1231, 1234 (1990)) (\u201c[R]emedial statutes are to be liberally construed to \u2018suppress the evil and advance the remedy.\u2019 \u201d). Nonetheless, we observed that \u201c[t]he general rule of liberally construing remedial statutes is approached with caution when the scrutinized legislative scheme contains a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Marsheck, 358 </em>at 403, 749 A.2d at 779. The workers compensation scheme at issue in <em>Marsheck, </em>however, differs markedly from the anti-discrimination scheme in the present case. Neither the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> nor its implementing regulations,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> contain provisions requiring good faith attempts at conciliation and negotiation before litigation may be pursued. Both Article 49B and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Montgomery County anti-discrimination scheme mandate that such efforts be made.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 42 allows a complainant, such as the Petitioner, to file a private civil suit to contest an alleged discriminatory discharge, subsection (c) of \u00a7 42 expressly requires that the complainant wait at least 45 days after he or she has filed a complaint with the county agency responsible for handling such matters. This provision presumably is meant to further judicial economy by having the County screen out non-meritorious claims as well as to encourage the conciliation of meritorious ones.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule frustrates this conciliation process whenever the actual discharge occurs after the expiration of the 45 day waiting period required by \u00a7 42(c).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because the rule establishes that accrual begins upon notification, it behooves discharged employees to file a lawsuit as soon as possible to avoid having their claims barred under the statute of limitations. Thus, when the 45 day waiting period has ran, but the employee has not yet been actually discharged, the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule motivates the employee to file a lawsuit regardless of whether the conciliation process is concluded. As the states opting for other than the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule have pointed out, this choice represents a poor public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>where either a chilling effect on the employee filing in the most timely manner occurs, or the employee sues his or her employer before the termination becomes final, thus dooming any chance at conciliation. <em>See Holmin, </em>748 A.2d at 1151; <em>Romano, </em>59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d at 1123. To be sure, the <em>Ricks/'Chardon </em>rule provides <em>an </em>effective means of avoiding lawsuits for discriminatory discharge: the \u201csharp\u201d employer might set the effective date of termination at one day after whatever the statutory period is will have run its course. The majority of employees put on notice that they are slated to be terminated at some relatively remote date in the future likely would hesitate to institute a claim for discriminatory discharge; first, because the action may not appear final because it is so far in the future and; second, because they reasonably are apprehensive about suing the party with whom they currently have, and may try to maintain, a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In the same vein as the conciliation consideration is the contention that the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule propagates the filing of claims not yet ripe for adjudication. Under the rule, it is possible theoretically that employees who challenge their putative discharge could arrive for their day in court before they actually are discharged from employment. Further, <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon </em>create a paradoxical situation where an employee, at the time he or she is notified of the termination yet to come, must possess the prescience to know of the future \u201cdiscriminatory acts that continue[] until, or occur[ ] at the time of, the actual termination of his [of her] employment.\u201d <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 257,101 S.Ct. at 504; <em>see also Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. at 29. If employees desire to challenge their terminations specifically, as opposed to other discriminatory acts preceding it, they probably ought not be expected to file a claim disputing events that have not yet come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">A significant consideration supporting our conclusion today is the relative simplicity in application of a bright line rule in this context. For courts, the determination of a statute of limitations question is made simpler thereby, obviating the need for the sometime tortured analysis under the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d for when notice is adequate. For employees, the rule we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>announce today is clear and logical. Most workers reasonably expect that, until actually discharged, they have no claim for wrongful discharge because there has yet to be harm that may be remedied. <em>See Ross, </em>879 P.2d at 1045. The rule We announce today best facilitates the remedial purposes of Article 49B by making certain that meritorious suits are not foreclosed for purely technical reasons. For employers, our holding makes clear how their record-keeping and termination proceedings must be approached in order to defend properly against a wrongful discharge action. Employers are far less inconvenienced, if at all, by our holding today than employees would be if we followed the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule. The entirety of the termination process is within the control of the employer, as opposed to the employee who should not have to guess whether or what type of termination notice is final so that he or she then may decide when to sue an employer who is still paying a wage and providing benefits. This delicate situation is best resolved in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Our holding should not deter employers from offering their employees advance notice of terminations. Indeed, there should be no great burden or adverse effect on employers because notice periods typically would not be of great duration in advance of the actual discharge. Our rule prevents the possibility of employers using exceptionally long notice periods for the purpose of deterring an employee from filing a discharge claim out of apprehension that they will be terminated earlier than scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The specter of employers having to defend against stale claims is not a persuasive argument. We have noted that \u201c[o]ne principal purpose of statutes of limitations is to provide defendants with notice of a claim within a sufficient period of time to permit the defendant to take necessary steps to gather and preserve the evidence needed to defend against the suit.\u201d <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Christensen, </em>394 Md. 227, 256, 905 A.2d 340, 357-58 (2006); <em>see also Hecht v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>333 Md. 324, 338, 635 A.2d 394, 401 (1994). From the defendant\u2019s perspective, the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>limitations is remedial. <em>Marsheck v. Bd. of Trs. of the Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys. of City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 404-05, 749 A.2d 774, 779-80 (2000). \u201cOnce the limitation period passed, the statute, which once provided opportunity, closes the window and the claim is barred thereafter. The legislature, in drafting such legislation, implicitly recognizes that as time passes, difficult evidentiary issues arise, such as proof of the cause of injury, faded memories, and the availability of witnesses.\u201d <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 404-05, 749 A.2d at 780; <em>Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 665, 464 A.2d 1020, 1026 (1983); <em>Bertonazzi v. Hillman, </em>241 Md. 361, 367, 216 A.2d 723, 726 (1966). Statutes of limitation are also meant to eliminate, after the allotted time, the financial uncertainty defendants experience while potential claims remain unlitigated. <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 405, 749 A.2d at 780. The time allotted usually has little, if any, specific grounding in empirical logic, but \u201c \u2018simply represents the legislature\u2019s judgment about the reasonable time needed to institute suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 405, 749 A.2d at 780 (quoting <em>Doe v. Maskell, </em>342 Md. 684, 689, 679 A.2d 1087, 1089 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The concerns animating the statute of limitations defense in most cases simply are not present here. As we have noted, employers ordinarily are in control of the termination process, so they may not maintain credibly an argument that they would be without adequate notice of a wrongful discharge action. The decision and execution of a discharge, along with records thereof, easily may be orchestrated in harmony with our holding today to ensure that an employer-defendant is not caught unaware of an unlawful discriminatory discharge claim. In the majority of instances, the time elapsed between the rendition of notice and effectuation of a termination is not so long as to foster relevant evidence falling victim to fading memories, missing documentation, or other spoliation concerns. The voluminous record of thorough depositions, internal e-mails, and other materials created in the present case is testament to this prediction. We also observe, merely in passing, that \u201c[t]he statute of limitations, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>defense that does not go to the merits, is disfavored in law and is to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Marsheck, </em>858 Md. at 405, 749 A.2d at 780 (quoting <em>Newell v.

The parties have briefed and argued the present case as if it placed us at a jurisprudential crossroads requiring that we choose, for all employment discrimination claims, the path of the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule or the minority alternative epitomized in the decisions of the high courts of Hawaii, California, and New Jersey discussed <em>supra. </em>Although we choose the latter in the present case, that may not necessarily be the case were we confronted with a context similar to that found in <em>Ricks </em>and <em>Chardon. </em>Even the <em>Ricks </em>Court acknowledged that its general principles must be applied \"on a case-by-case basis\u201d given the \"widely varying circumstances\u201d of discriminatory termination complaints. <em>Rides, </em>449 U.S. at 258 n. 9, 101 S.Ct. at 504 n. 9.

Where the only claimed discriminatory act is associated with the denial of tenure, regardless of whether employment in some capacity continues for some period, the cause of action for alleged wrongful denial of tenure properly may accrue from the notice of denial of tenure and not at some subsequent cessation of continued employment. That, of course, is not the case with regard to Haas\u2019s circumstances as pled in her complaint. Thus, we shall leave for another day whether the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule would be adopted in Maryland regarding an allegation of discriminatory denial of academic tenure (or a tenure-like situation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\">.

Section 27-19 of the Montgomery County Code provides that an employer must not \u201cfail or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>refuse to hire, fail to accept the services of, discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual\u201d on the basis of race, gender, religion, or other discriminatory grounds. Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-19 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In this case, the Petitioner, Suzanne Haas, alleged in her complaint that \u201c[t]he actions of Lockheed [Martin] in terminating [her]\u201d from her position as Program Administrator constituted \u201chandicap discrimination\u201d because \u201cLockheed clearly regarded Haas as being disabled\u201d on account of her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Although she physically left her employment on October 23, 2001, because of her employer\u2019s sufferance, the statute of limitations began to run on October 9, 2001, when Lockheed Martin notified Ms. Haas by letter of the termination of her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Our jurisprudence, as well as that of the Supreme Court, federal circuit courts of appeals, and the majority of our sister states supports this result. The majority, however, rejects not only our precedent, but the plethora of cases that reach the opposite result in order to accommodate negotiation and conciliation between employers and employees, efforts which the majority concedes were not the basis for Ms. Haas\u2019s delay in filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In <em>Delaware State College v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), the Supreme Court addressed the instant issue. In <em>Ricks, </em>a professor alleged that the Delaware State College discriminated against him in its decision to deny him tenure. The trial judge dismissed the professor\u2019s claim on the ground that it was untimely filed because the discriminatory act occurred when the college made its decision not to grant the professor tenure; therefore, the statute of limitations had begun to run on the date that the professor was officially notified of the college\u2019s decision, rather than when he left his employment. The Supreme Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling and held that \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2014and the filing limitations periods therefore commenced\u2014at the time the tenure decision was made and communicated to [the professor].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 101 S.Ct. at 504, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>66 L.Ed.2d at 439-40. The Supreme Court noted that, although the alternative approach, in which the statute of limitations begins to run on the last day of employment, may provide a simpler approach, \u201cCongress has decided that time limitations periods commence with the date of the \u2018alleged unlawful employment practice\u2019,\u201d and that decision \u201c \u2018reflects a value judgment concerning the point at which the interests in favor of protecting valid claims are outweighed by the interests in prohibiting the prosecution of stale ones\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 260, 101 S.Ct. at 505, 66 L.Ed.2d at 440, 441, quoting <em>Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 463-64, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1721-22, 44 L.Ed.2d 295, 303 (1975). Further, the Court observed that the alternative \u201cfinal day of employment\u201d rule could discourage employers from giving employees a grace period to seek employment elsewhere. <em>Id. </em>at 260 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. at 505 n. 12, 66 L.Ed.2d at 441 n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The Supreme Court revisited this issue in <em>Chardon v. Fernandez, </em>454 U.S. 6, 102 S.Ct. 28, 70 L.Ed.2d 6 (1981), in which the plaintiffs alleged discrimination in the decision of the Puerto Rico Department of Education to terminate their employment. The trial court dismissed the claim as untimely, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that the claims began to accrue not upon the plaintiffs\u2019 notification of the employer\u2019s decision to terminate them, but when their employment was actually terminated. The Supreme Court, in reversing, concluded that the <em>Chardon </em>and <em>Ricks </em>cases were indistinguishable; \u201cin each case, the operative decision was made\u2014and notice given\u2014in advance of a designated date on which employment terminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 102 S.Ct. at 29, 70 L.Ed.2d at 8. Emphasizing that \u201creasonable notice cannot extend the period within which suit must be filed,\u201d the Supreme Court therefore held that the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs were <em>notified </em>of their employer\u2019s final decision, not when their employment actually terminated. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Although not controlling, Supreme Court precedent should be afforded deference because, as our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals so recognized when they affirmed summary judgment for Lockheed Martin, Article 49B is patterned after Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act. <em>Montrose Christian Sch. Corp. v. Walsh, </em>863 Md. 565, 580, 770 A.2d 111, 120 (2001) (stating that Article 49B of the Maryland Code \u201cwas modeled after the federal anti-discrimination law\u201d); <em>Molesworth v. Brandon, </em>341 Md. 621, 632-33, 672 A.2d 608, 614 (1996) (concluding that, because Article 49B was modeled after federal law, the Court may look to the legislative history of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act to discern the legislative intent behind Article 49B).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The General Assembly passed the Maryland Fair Employment Practices Law, codified at Article 49B, in response to the federal enactment of Title VII and acted so quickly that Article 49B went into effect one day before its federal counterpart. <em>See Makovi v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>316 Md. 603, 607, 561 A.2d 179, 181 (1989). As Title VII has been updated at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the federal level, the General Assembly has harmonized Article 49B to federal law. <em>See </em>1973 Md. Laws, Chap. 493; <em>Molesworbh, </em>341 Md. at 632-33, 672 A.2d at 614 (explaining that Chapter 493 of the Acts of 1973 states that it was passed to generally conform the State Fair Employment Practices Law to the 1972 Amendments of Title VII, Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.); <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>280 Md. 35, 40-43, 371 A.2d 645, 674-49 (1977) (noting that the General Assembly\u2019s amendments to Article 49B were needed to conform Maryland law to the 1972 amendments of Title VII and looking to Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act to define \u201cperson\u201d as used in the newly conformed and reenacted \u00a7 18 of Article 49B). The Montgomery County Code also mirrors the unlawful employment practices prohibited by Title VII and Article 49B, differing only because the County Code contains a more expansive list of unlawful practices. Montgomery County Code \u00a7 27-1 (b) (2001) (\u201cThe prohibitions in this article are substantially similar, but not necessarily identical, to prohibitions in federal and state law.\u201d). Considering the mimicry of state and local laws to Title VII, it is appropriate to consider federal precedents when interpreting state and local laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The Majority concludes incorrectly that the \u201cplain meaning of \u2018discharge\u2019 concurs with the view that a discharge occurs at the time the employee is terminated actually from employment.\u201d As used in \u00a7 27-19, the aspect of discharge that constitutes the \u201coccurrence of the alleged discriminatory act\u201d is the <em>decision </em>by the <em>employer </em>to terminate the employee. Maryland and Montgomery County\u2019s statutory scheme focuses on the discriminatory act and provides that an <em>employer </em>must not \u201cdischarge any individual,\u201d and that an employee has two years \u201cafter the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act\u201d to file a claim. Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-19(a); Maryland Code (1957,1998 Rep. vol.), \u00a7 42(b)(1) of Article 49B. The notice to terminate incorporates the allegedly discriminatory decision and provides the basis for a claim under \u00a7 49B. An alleged discriminatory act occurs upon notice of termination. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe proper focus is on the time of the <em>discriminatory act, </em>not the point at which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>consequences </em>of the act become painful.\u201d <em>Chardon, </em>454 U.S. at 8, 102 S.Ct. 28 at 29, 70 L.Ed.2d at 9 (emphasis in original). Moreover, notice of termination is a very significant event\u2014 especially when the employee questions the legality of the employer\u2019s decision\u2014and it is likely to cause the employee mental and emotional suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The Majority relies on judicial decisions in Hawaii, California, and New Jersey that have declined to follow the <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>rule, but fails to consider that the reasoning of those courts was influenced by the underlying statutes and facts of those cases, all of which are significantly different than the statutes and facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Company, </em>76 Hawai'i 454, 879 P.2d 1037 (1994), the statute of limitations at issue was 90 days long, as opposed to Maryland\u2019s generous two years. The <em>Ross </em>court based its decision on an analysis of the plain language, but then proceeded to further justify its departure from the <em>Ricks/Char-don </em>rule by emphasizing that less savvy employees would fail to pursue the filing of an administrative complaint within ninety days if the statute of limitations started upon notice. <em>Id. </em>at 1045. Maryland\u2019s two year statute of limitations guarantees the protection against discrimination by employers\u2014even for less savvy employees\u2014while also protecting employers from the burden of defending employment decisions that are long past.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The employee in <em>Romano v. Rockwell International, Inc., </em>14 Cal.4th 479, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 20, 926 P.2d 1114 (1996), was given notice in December 1988 that he would be terminated when he reached 85 service points under the company retirement plan, which would occur May 31, 1991. Thus, Romano had approximately one and a half years notice of his unequivocal termination. In construing the state\u2019s one year statute of limitations, the Supreme Court of California relied on <em>Ross </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and emphasized that adoption of <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>would require an employee to initiate a complaint while still employed. <em>Romano </em>addresses a unique set of facts and a shorter statute of limitations. Haas, like the majority of employees, received two weeks notice of her impending termination. If an employee in Maryland chooses not to file a claim while still working, the employee is in no way impeded from filing a claim in the next 102 weeks. Even when a <em>Romano-]ike </em>situation develops, the Supreme Court has made it clear that, \u201c[i]t is true that \u2018the filing of a lawsuit might tend to deter efforts at conciliation.\u2019 But this is the \u2018natural effect of the choice Congress has made\u2019 in explicitly requiring that the limitations period commence with the date of the \u2018alleged unlawful employment practice\u2019 \u201d. <em>Ricks, </em>449 U.S. at 259 n. 11,101 S.Ct. at 505 n. 11, 66 L.Ed.2d at 440 n. 11, quoting <em>Johnson, </em>421 U.S. at 461, 95 S.Ct. at 1721, 44 L.Ed.2d at 302 (internal citations omitted). Furthermore, if the parties are able to reconcile their differences, the employee may nonetheless feel he or she was discriminated against and file a civil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The New Jersey cases also are not persuasive. In <em>Alderiso v. Medical Center of Ocean County, Inc., </em>167 N.J. 191, 770 A.2d 275 (2001), a one year statute of limitations was at issue and the employee was given oral notice of termination. Maryland\u2019s statute is two years and Haas was given unequivocal notice in writing. <em>Holmin v. TRW, Inc., </em>330 N.J.Super. 30, 748 A.2d 1141 (2000), considered a claim for fraudulent inducement to retire, a claim subject to a six year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Many of our sister courts, which also have espoused the date of notification approach, have done so on the grounds that it promotes and protects many important public policies. The Utah Court of Appeals in <em>Clarke v. Living Scriptures, Inc., </em>114 P.3d 602 (Utah Ct.App.2005), stated that a contrary approach</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">would discourage employers from providing post-termination benefits. <em>See, e.g., Naton v. Bank of Cal., </em>649 F.2d 691, 695 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201c[A] rule focusing on the date of termination of economic benefits might dissuade an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>er from extending benefits to a discharged employee after the employee has ceased working.\u201d); <em>Bonham v. Dresser Indus., </em>569 F.2d 187, 191-92 (3d Cir.1977) (\u201c[W]e would ... view with disfavor a rule that penalizes a company for giving an employee periodic severance pay or other extended benefits after the relationship has terminated rather than severing all ties when the employee is let go.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 606. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin in <em>Hilmes v. Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, </em>147 Wis.2d 48, 433 N.W.2d 251 (Ct.App.1988), emphasized that \u201c[kjeying an \u2018occurrence\u2019 of discrimination to a time prior to termination can afford the employee an opportunity to prevent\u2014rather than rectify\u2014wage loss and other harmful effects <em>of </em>the discriminatory practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. The Supreme Court of Minnesota determined in <em>Turner v. IDS Financial Services, Inc., </em>471 N.W.2d 105 (Minn.1991), that the date of notification was the correct measure because at that time the plaintiff \u201cimmediately attains a lame duck status and, prior to actual discharge, may well incur employment agency fees and sustain damages for \u2018mental anguish and suffering\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The last-day-of-employment approach, embraced by the majority for reasons not implicated in the present case, discourages employers from extending employment and other benefits beyond the date of notification, which provides employees a much needed grace period to locate alternative employment; conversely, the date-of-notification approach motivates both the employer and employee to begin conciliation as soon as possible, possibly avoiding wage loss and other harmful effects of the alleged discriminatory decision. The date-of-notification approach also recognizes and compensates for the fact that employees begin to accrue damages, both emotional and financial, from the time that the employer communicates what could be a discriminatory decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">More importantly, however, I believe that the majority is wrong in rejecting the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Ricks/Chardon </em>Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>because it fits tongue and groove with this Court\u2019s long adherence to the discovery rule, which provides that the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff discovers, or through the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered, the injury, damages or potential claim. <em>See Feldman v. Granger, </em>255 Md. at 288, 291-97, 257 A.2d 421, 422-26 (1969). <em>See also Dual Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>383 Md. 151, 167-68, 857 A.2d 1095, 1104 (2004); <em>Bank of N.Y. v. Sheff, </em>382 Md. 235, 244, 854 A.2d 1269, 1275 (2004); <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 95-96, 756 A.2d 963, 973 (2000); <em>Lumsden v. Design Tech Builders, Inc., </em>358 Md. 435, 442-43, 749 A.2d 796, 800 (2000); <em>Pennwalt Corp. v. Nasios, </em>314 Md. 433, 452, 550 A.2d 1155, 1165 (1988); <em>Waldman v. Rohrbaugh, </em>241 Md. 137, 145, 215 A.2d 825, 830 (1966); <em>Hahn v. Claybrook, </em>130 Md. 179, 187, 100 A. 83, 86 (1917). We adopted the discovery rule because it provides adequate time for diligent plaintiffs to initiate an action while also ensuring fairness to defendants by encouraging the prompt filing of claims, suppressing stale or fraudulent claims, and avoiding inconvenience which may stem from delay. <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>360 Md. at 94-95, 756 A.2d at 973; <em>Lumsden, </em>358 Md. at 441-42, 749 A.2d at 799-800; <em>Pennwalt Corp., </em>314 Md. at 441, 550 A.2d at 1159; <em>Pierce v.

Clemens, </em>184 Md. 520, 41 A.2d 473 (1945) (involving an action for negligent construction); <em>Mattingly v.

Moreover, in <em>Poffenberger v.

Board of Education of Howard County, </em>381 Md. 646, 851 A.2d 576 (2004), we were called upon to determine when a school guidance counselor\u2019s claim against the Howard County Board of Education for wrongful termination began to run\u2014upon notification of his termination, or upon the date of his actual termination. We concluded that, pursuant to Section 10-222(h) of the State Government Article, the employee was required to exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 851 A.2d at 584-85. Accordingly, the statute of limitations for the employee\u2019s claim began to run when the administrative agency made its <em>final </em>determination to terminate him. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 851 A.2d at 589.
