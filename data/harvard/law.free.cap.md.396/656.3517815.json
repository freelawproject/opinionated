Mundey, Jr. (\u201cMundey\u201d), age 21,.sustained serious injuries as a result of an auto collision that occurred while he was the front-seat passenger in a vehicle driven by Amber Rose Burgess (\u201cBurgess\u201d). At the time of the accident, Burgess was insured under a Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) policy which provided the minimum statutory liability coverage of $20,000. Mundey filed a complaint against Burgess in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking damages, in excess of the MAIF policy limits, for injuries caused by Burgess\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">The complaint was amended to add a declaratory judgment count against Mundey\u2019s parents\u2019 insurer, respondent, Erie Insurance Group (\u201cErie\u201d), to determine if Erie\u2019s uninsured/underinsured (\u201cUM\u201d) motorist endorsement insured Mundey, in light of his living arrangements, at the time of the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In that regard, Mundey sought a declaration that the UM endorsement in the Erie policy covered damages that he sustained as a result of the motor vehicle collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The negligence claim against Burgess was settled for $20,000 and that count was subsequently dismissed. As to the declaratory judgment count, the parties entered into a stipulation as to the facts with regard to Mundey\u2019s residence. The trial court ruled in favor of Erie, finding that Mundey was not entitled to coverage under Erie\u2019s policy. Mundey noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Mundey v. Erie Ins. Group, </em>167 Md.App. 444, 893 A.2d 645 (2006). Thereafter, Mundey filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We granted the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Mundey v. Erie Ins. Group, </em>393 Md. 245, 900 A.2d 751 (2006). We hold that Mundey is not entitled to recover under his parents\u2019 uninsured motorist endorsement because he was not a resident of their household or otherwise insured under the automobile liability insurance policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We adopt the facts as stated by Judge Frederick Sharer, writing for a panel of the Court of Special Appeals in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0n\">The Erie \u201cPioneer Family Auto Insurance Policy\u201d purchased by [petitioner\u2019s] parents provided policy limits of $250,000. The policy\u2019s uninsured/underinsured provision, at issue in this appeal, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A17f\">UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED MOTORISTS COVERAGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>OUR PROMISE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">We will pay damages for bodily injury and property damage that the law entitles you or your legal representative to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle. Damages must result from a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership or use of the uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle as a motor vehicle and involve:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">1. bodily injury to you or others we protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">OTHERS WE PROTECT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">1. Any relative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201cRelative\u201d is defined in the policy\u2019s definitions section: \u201crelative\u201d means a resident of your household who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">1. a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">2. a ward or any other person under 21 years old in your care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201cresident\u201d means a person who physically lives with you in your household. Your unmarried, unemancipated children under age 24 attending school full-time, living away from home will be considered residents of your household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">The declaratory judgment action came on for trial on August 26, 2004. Neither party called live witnesses; rather, each proffered evidence from which the Circuit Court could have found the following: On or about February 14, 2001, [petitioner], then 20 years old, was arrested and incarcerated for failure to pay a court-ordered fine. [Petitioner\u2019s] parents, Richard A Mundey, Sr. and Sharon Mundey, agreed to post his bail if he would agree to, <em>inter </em>alia&gt; move out of their home in Lusby, Maryland, and into his grandmother\u2019s home in Waldorf, Maryland. It was further agreed that [petitioner] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>would have to get a job and \u201cget his act together\u201d before he could move back into his parents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Upon the posting of bail by his parents,[petitioner] was released from jail and moved into the home of his grandmother, Shirley Sterling, in Waldorf. Shortly thereafter [petitioner] got a job in Waldorf; first at Oak Ridge Construction Company and then at Damon\u2019s Restaurant. Approximately one month after he moved in with his grandmother [petitioner] obtained his driving learner\u2019s permit. [Petitioner] was not, at any time relevant to the issues in this case, enrolled in college.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">[Petitioner] lived with his grandmother in Waldorf for the 11 months preceding the accident. During that time he visited his parents\u2019 home approximately four to six times. He spent the night at their house on two occasions-Thanksgiving and Christmas night. On those occasions, [petitioner] slept on an extra bed in his younger brother\u2019s room, as his former bedroom had been converted to other family use.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">At his grandmother\u2019s home, [petitioner] had his own bedroom and was free to use the entire house, and the telephone. [Petitioner] ate his meals with his grandmother and, when he was not at work, he either watched television or spent time with his girlfriend at his grandmother\u2019s house. In December 2001, [petitioner\u2019s] father denied [petitioner\u2019s] request to move back into the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Except for his pay record at Damon\u2019s Restaurant, [petitioner] continued to use his parents\u2019 Lusby address as his home address. Although [petitioner] never filed for a change of address in Lusby, his mother either brought his mail when she visited her mother, or mailed it to [petitioner] at the Waldorf address.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">After hearing the proffers and arguments of counsel, the Circuit Court issued an opinion from the bench providing, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">It appears to me that the definitions used in Erie\u2019s policy are not void against public policy, but are in fact logical, clear, and stated in plain language, sufficient to put all policyholders on notice of the extent of risk that this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tract is intended to cover. The temporary residence of the [petitioner] at his grandmother\u2019s home was temporary based on the limits placed by the homeowners who are the insureds under this policy. That is it was entirely up to his parents, the named insured homeowners, to determine how long that temporary residence would continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">The policy anticipates that issue in its specific statement regarding full-time students living away from home who are unemancipated children under age 24....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Here we have a young man who was emancipated absolutely. He was over 18. He was living, and working on his own. He was not dependent for any purpose for his parents, and therefore could not even be considered an unemancipated child over 18 .... Only a temporary residence for school purposes for an unemancipated child between the ages of 18 and 24 would allow that person to still be continued as a member of the household. I see nothing void against public policy in this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">. We have, in addition, the intention declared by the parents that he was not to be considered a member of the household in any number of ways. One, they forwarded his mail to him at the other location. Two, he was supposed to be self-supporting at another location. Three, they did not notify the insurance company of his driving on his learner\u2019s permit because they were not permitting him to use their vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">All of those intentions clarify the intention that he not be considered a resident of the household at the time of this incident. It is sad, it is tragic, but it is the law, and I see nothing in public policy or in the statutory language, or in any of the appellate decisions, to suggest otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The Circuit Court\u2019s oral opinion was followed by a declaratory judgment order, filed on October 19, 2004. The order declared that the relevant policy provisions did not violate public policy and that, because [petitioner] was not physically living in his parents\u2019 household for the 11 months prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>accident, he was \u2018not an insured by definition under the policy and does not qualify for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.\u2019 <em>Mundey, </em>167 Md.App. at 447-50, 893 A.2d at 646-48 (alterations added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">We turn first to Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Insurance Law and our interpretation of the uninsured motorist provisions. Petitioner contends that Erie narrowed the required coverage, without any statutory authority, by inserting into the common declaration, what is in petitioner\u2019s view, an unduly restrictive definition of \u201cresident.\u201d Petitioner posits that the policy requirement that \u201cresidents\u201d physically live in the \u201cnamed insured\u2019s\u201d household is invalid and illegal and further that Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Insurance Laws are to be liberally construed so as to provide coverage for Mundey. In order to determine whether Mundey is entitled to collect under the uninsured motorist provision of his parents\u2019 automobile liability insurance policy, we must interpret Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 19-509 of the Insurance Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>UM Endorsement and subsequent definitions of \u201crelative\u201d and \u201cresident.\u201d Our interpretation must conform to the well-settled principles of statutory construction. As this Court recently said in <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 571-573, 911 A.2d 427, 431-433 (2006),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u2018[t]he cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v.

Mehrling, </em>343 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>155, 174, 680 A.2d 1052, 1062 (1996) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). We have said that there is \u2018an ambiguity \u25a0within [a] statute\u2019 when there exist \u2018two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u2019 <em>Chow, </em>393 Md. at 444, 903 A.2d at 395 (citations omitted).

Auto. Ins. Co. v. DeHaan, </em>393 Md. 163, 900 A.2d 208 (2006), informs our discussion. In <em>DeHaan, </em>we noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">[t]he Legislature first enacted the uninsured motorist statute as Chapter 73 of the Acts of 1972. This section was part of a large bill which also created the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF), the bill provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>\u2018(c) In addition to any other coverage required by this subtitle, every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued, sold, or delivered in this State after January 1, 1973 MAY contain coverage, in at least the amounts required under Section 7-101 of the Article 66% of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1970 Replacement Volume and 1972 Supplement), for damages which the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured motor vehicle</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">The statute was later amended and codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.), Art 48A, \u00a7 541(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">The enactment of this section complied with one of the recommendations made in a Report of the Special Committee on No-Fault Insurance dated January 31, 1972. The committee\u2019s recommendation stated: \u2018To complement the first party coverage and to protect more fully a Maryland driver, the second bill requires the driver to carry uninsured motorist coverage in the event he suffers damage caused by an out-of-state driver not protected by liability insurance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHJ\"><em>DeHaan, </em>393 Md. at 171-72, 900 A.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">As one commentator has noted, \u201cthe Maryland Uninsured Motorist Endorsement specifically establishes three classes of persons\u2019 ability to recover under the policy.\u201d Andrew Jan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>quitto, <em>Uninsured Motorist Coverage in Maryland, </em>21 U. Balt. L.Rev. 171, 221 (1992). Of the three classes of persons, this case concerns only what has been labeled \u201cclause 1 insureds:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u2018Clause 1 insureds\u2019 consists of the named insured, the named insured\u2019s spouse, and members of the named insured\u2019s household----The coverage granted to ... [them] is personal and comprehensive: it does not run with the insured vehicle. Rather the policy covers clause 1 insureds in a variety of situations: when they are occupying a vehicle under the policy, when they are occupying most other vehicles, when they are riding bicycles, and when they are pedestrians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>Id. </em>We have stated that the phrase \u201cresident of the same household\u201d is not ambiguous, but rather \u201c[t]he words themselves are clear, simple, and in general use.\u201d <em>Peninsula Ins. Co. v. Knight, </em>254 Md. 461, 477, 255 A.2d 55, 63 (1969)(holding that the insured was a member of his parents\u2019 household and that their claim against him was precluded by an exclusionary clause in a policy of insurance issued by Peninsula. Further acknowledging that \u201c[a] \u2018resident\u2019 of a household may have a status ranging from temporary to permanent but ... he is nonetheless a resident\u201d in light of a number of factors including his usage of the living space and the storage location of his belongings.) Petitioner urges this Court to consider him a \u201cclause 1 insured\u201d under his parents\u2019 automobile liability policy at the time of the accident and therefore entitled to coverage. For the reasons discussed <em>infra, </em>we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The essence of this appeal is our interpretation of subsection (c)(1) of \u00a7 19-509. Subsection (c)(1), requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO9\">each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in the State ..., shall contain coverage for damages, subject to the policy limits, that: (1) the <em>insured </em>is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the uninsured motor vehicle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>(Emphasis added). The statute does not define the word \u201cinsured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u201d Because the Legislature failed to define \u201cinsured,\u201d we must examine what the Legislature intended \u201cinsured\u201d to mean in light \u201cof the Legislature\u2019s general purpose and in context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 76, 854 A.2d 879, 885 (2004) (citation omitted).

Fed. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 717, 475 A.2d 454, 459 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Petitioner expands upon an argument presented by commentator, Andrew Janquitto, in a treatise on Maryland motor vehicle law. Mr. Janquitto urges that \u201c[because the UM statute does not indicate who must be insured, the only guidance is a negative implication from the exclusions. In other words, if certain persons such as family members, can be excluded under some specified circumstances, they must be included in all other circumstances.\u201d Andrew Janquitto, Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance \u00a7 8.9(A)(1) (2006 Supplement). Petitioner further expands upon Mr. Janquitto\u2019s argument by citing specific statutes from which, Petitioner contends, this Court can imply the meaning of the word \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Petitioner contends that the Legislature intended \u201cinsured\u201d to include all family members of the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d including those who are temporarily absent from the household. Accordingly, petitioner avers that Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Insurance Laws do not authorize an exclusion for temporarily absent resident relatives. Further, petitioner asserts that had the General Assembly intended to give insurers permission to narrow the coverage in this way, it would have expressly included a provision to that effect in the original UM statute or, later, after this Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cresident\u201d in <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>322 Md. 689, 589 A.2d 944 (1991). Moreover, petitioner argues that the definition of \u201cresident\u201d contained within Erie\u2019s policy is invalid because it restricts the legislatively mandated coverage and, moreover, that the policy provisions are inconsistent with Maryland\u2019s UM statute and are thus invalid. Finding no explicit definition of \u201cinsured\u201d within the UM statute, petitioner contends that this Court should look to the exclusions contained within the UM statute and elsewhere within the motor vehicle insurance scheme, and that these exclusions show by negative implication that the Legislature intended the term \u201cinsured\u201d to include family members of the named insured that are temporarily absent from the household. Petitioner relies on several sections of the Insurance Article for this proposition. Specifically, petitioner cites \u00a7 19-505 and \u00a7 27-606 as instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 19-505, the personal injury protection (PIP) statute, automobile insurance companies that issue, sell, or deliver policies in Maryland must provide PIP coverage for \u201cthe first named insured, and any family member of the first named insured who resides in the first named insured\u2019s household.\u201d Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 19-505(a)(l)(i) of the Insurance Article. Insurers are, however, permitted to exclude from coverage those persons enumerated in subsection (c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of \u00a7 19-505. Petitioner contends that the exclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>allowed under subsection (c) are very limited, that, pursuant to \u00a7 19-505, Mundey should be provided PIP coverage, and that it can be concluded that the Legislature intended the word \u201cinsured\u201d to mean all resident family members of the \u201cnamed insured,\u201d whether temporarily absent or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Section 27-606 permits a family automobile to remain insured, instead of having the insurance policy canceled, by excluding from the insurance policy a member of the household whose driving record would have warranted a cancellation or non-renewal of the policy. Petitioner contends that the operative language in \u00a7 27-606 is \u201cfamily members residing in the household of the excluded operator or user or vehicle owner.\u201d Md.Code (1997, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 27-606 of the Insurance Article. Petitioner asserts that the policy issued by Erie exceeds the statutory authorized exclusions by seeking to exclude him from PIP and UM coverage while he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a non-relative. Petitioner cites additional sections of the Insurance Code in support of his argument. Petitioner suggests that the intent of the Legislature is revealed by reading \u00a7\u00a7 19-509 and 20-601 together. Here, petitioner contends that the operative language, \u201cfamily who resides in the household,\u201d indicates the Legislature\u2019s intention to require insurers to cover family residents to the same extent that the state fund covers them, through MAIF. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Finally, petitioner contends that the intent to include household residents in the term \u201cinsured\u201d is revealed in various other sections including \u00a7 19-506, the waiver of PIP benefits; \u00a7 20-603, notice of claim for damages; \u00a7 27-601, notice for cancellation or non-renewal of a policy; \u00a7\u00a7 27-604 and 27-605, both addressing premium increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In opposition, respondent contends that, at best, the group of persons who are to be provided uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage would be the named insured and his or her family members who reside in the named insured\u2019s household, but that there is no mandate for any other persons to be covered. Respondent argues that coverage need not be extended to a named insured\u2019s relatives who intend to move in with the named insured in the future or those who do not physically reside with the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We first address petitioner\u2019s contention that the exclusions contained within the UM statute and elsewhere within the motor vehicle insurance scheme show by negative implication that the Legislature intended the term \u201cinsured\u201d to include all relatives of the named insured who are temporarily absent from the household. In <em>Johnson v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>\u201c[t]he question before us ... [was] whether \u00a7 19-509 of the Insurance Article require[d] an insurer to provide uninsured motorist coverage for the wrongful death of a person who was not an insured under the policy.\u201d 388 Md. 82, 86, 878 A.2d 615, 617 (2005). Jaedon Johnson, a minor, sought to recover under his mother\u2019s insurance policy for the death of his father, a man who was not a named insured under that policy, was not married to the policyholder, and did not live with the policyholder, arguing that \u00a7 19\u2014509(c)(2) required the insurer to pay the benefits sought. As part of our analysis in that case, we considered the plain language of \u00a7 19-509(c)(l), noting that \u201c[t]he words of the statute require each motor vehicle liability insurance policy to include coverage for that policy\u2019s insured for bodily injuries sustained by that policy\u2019s insured, in a motor vehicle accident involving the use of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>388 Md. at 89, 878 A.2d at 619 (emphasis in original). The minor argued that recovery under his moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>er\u2019s policy was necessarily conditioned on his being a survivor of an insured under the statute. Finding his argument illogical, we opined that such an interpretation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVU\">would mean that the [L]egislature was requiring every policy to provide uninsured motorist coverage to an unknown number of people, not named in the policy, who are related to (but not living with) someone who is protected by the policy, in the event that those unknown people should be involved in an accident with an uninsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AON\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 19-509(c)(l) and analysis of legislative intent as explicated in Johnson are instructive. Although the term \u201cinsured\u201d is not defined, within the context of the uninsured motorist statute, its ordinary meaning is <em>covered or coverage at the time of the accident. See Johnson, </em>388 Md. at 89, 878 A.2d at 619; <em>Forbes, </em>322 Md. at 708, 589 A.2d at 953. It is our view that the Legislature intended for coverage to be extended to the insured motorist and all family members residing with the named insured. By contrast there may be situations where a family member of the named insured who resides with the named insured and is occupying an insured or uninsured motor vehicle or is struck as a pedestrian by an insured or uninsured motor vehicle that is owned by the named insured or an immediate family member or operated or used by an individual who is excluded from coverage under \u00a7 27-606 of the Insurance Article. In those situations, by virtue of statutorily-created exceptions, an insurer may exclude the injured family member from the benefits of uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-509(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is not a case of exclusion, as an entire class of persons who are statutorily required to be covered are not being denied coverage. <em>Cf. Pa. Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734 (1980) (holding that the exclusion contained in the policy at issue in that case denied PIP coverage to a class of persons statutorily required to be covered and was consequently invalid and that as a result, the named insured was entitled to benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the policy\u2019s PIP provision). This case is not a case of exclusion, rather it is a matter of determining if the Legislature contemplated that Mundey and similarly situated individuals should be covered under the UM statute. We are unpersuaded that the Legislature intended to require coverage for family members of the named insured who do not physically live with the named insured. We hold, therefore, that \u00a7 19-509 requires automobile liability insurance contracts to provide uninsured motorist coverage, at a minimum, to the named insured as well as any family members who reside with the named insured. :</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Petitioner argues that Erie\u2019s policy continued to provide UM coverage during Mundey\u2019s absence from his parents\u2019, the \u201cnamed insured\u2019s,\u201d home. Thus, petitioner contends that the Court should apply <em>Forbes, </em>and conclude that Mundey was an insured under his parents\u2019 policy. Petitioner further argues that in <em>Forbes </em>this Court relied on the Supreme Court of Rhode Island\u2019s analysis in <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Carrera, </em>577 A.2d 980 (R.I.1990). According to Petitioner, in <em>Carrera, </em>in its analysis of \u201cresident,\u201d that court considered intent to remain for more than a mere transitory period and intent to return to the residence within the reasonable foreseeable future. The Court of Special Appeals, in petitioner\u2019s view, failed to consider the intent element in its analysis of the case <em>sub judice. </em>Petitioner notes that temporary absences from one\u2019s household are frequent and that the application of narrow interpretations would result in there being no coverage during these temporary situations. Respondent asserts that the subject policy is unambiguous and further that this Court should enforce the policy as written. In turn, respondent discourages the application of <em>Forbes </em>in this context. As explained below, we disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that his absence from his parents\u2019 home did not preclude him from UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We turn first to our previous holding in <em>Kendall v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>348 Md. 157, 702 A.2d 767 (1997). In <em>Kendall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>at issue was the proper construction of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage provisions contained in an automobile liability insurance policy. In that case, petitioner argued that the insurance policy at issue was ambiguous. This Court stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">[ujnder Maryland law, when deciding the issue of coverage under an insurance policy, the primary principle of construction is to apply the terms of the insurance contract itself. \u2018Maryland does not follow the rule, adopted in many jurisdictions, that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer. Rather, following the rule applicable to the construction of contracts generally, we hold that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained if reasonably possible from the policy as a whole.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\"><em>Kendall, </em>348 Md. at 166, 702 A.2d at 771 (citations omitted). We conclude that the plain language of the policy in this case is unambiguous and clearly indicates who is covered by the policy. Coverage is provided for \u201crelatives\u201d who physically live in the named insured\u2019s household and the named insured\u2019s unemancipated children under twenty-four who live away from home, but attend school.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, Erie was exposed to greater risk by insuring unemancipated children who live away from home. Our decision in <em>Amalgamated Cas. Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 539, 212 A.2d 311, 318 (1965), allows for policy provisions that narrow the insurer\u2019s liability in a manner not inconsistent with statutory requirements. Likewise, an insurer may expand the scope of uninsured/underinsured coverage so long as the expansion is consistent with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We agree with respondent\u2019s contention that because the language of the residency clause contained in the policy is unambiguous and because it does not conflict with Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Insurance Law, Mundey is not entitled to coverage. Furthermore, in our view, Mundey does not qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>as a resident under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set out in <em>Forbes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">First, we look to the decisions of other jurisdictions that have interpreted similar residency clauses. In <em>Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. McEachern, </em>135 Ga.App. 628, 218 S.E.2d 645 (1975), the court was asked to analyze the policy language extending uninsured motorist protection to any relative of the named insured if a \u201cresident of the same household.\u201d In that case, the insured\u2019s son was married and purchased a home nearby. The insured provided the down payment for the purchase of the home and, although the son paid most of his wife\u2019s expenses, the couple continued to take their meals at the insured\u2019s residence. The son\u2019s wife was injured by an unidentified driver who left the scene. The wife sought uninsured motorist coverage under the insured\u2019s policy for damages sustained. The court held that the named insured\u2019s son did not qualify as a \u201cresident\u201d of the named insured\u2019s household. The court noted that although financial support was an important factor in determining whether the insured\u2019s son and wife were members of the insured\u2019s household, there was no support for the son\u2019s contention that the insured\u2019s support extended the insured\u2019s household to include the son\u2019s new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In <em>Girrens v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>238 Kan. 670, 715 P.2d 389 (1986), the issue was whether a son was a \u201cdependent person\u201d under his father\u2019s automobile insurance policy. Following a motorcycle collision, the insured\u2019s son sought recovery of uninsured motorist coverage benefits. Specifically, the policy under review in that case provided uninsured coverage to \u201cany dependent person whose legal residence is the household of the insured.... \u201d <em>Girrens, </em>715 P.2d at 391. The insured\u2019s son argued that the term \u201cdependent person\u201d was ambiguous under the policy, and had to be construed to include the injured party. The court disagreed and found the term, as used in the policy, unambiguous. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, which found in favor of the insurer. In so doing, the court approved the standard employed to determine if the son was a dependent, specifically, whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201csubstantial contribution required to provide the necessities of life\u201d was made by his parents. <em>Girrens, </em>715 P.2d at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We find persuasive <em>United Serv. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Swann, </em>170 Vt. 302, 749 A.2d 23, 26 (2000), which noted the \u201cshared characteristics of residency ... to be \u2018physical presence within a common abode on [a] reasonably regular basis at a reasonably recent time, regardless of whether the individual uses the address for various legal and practical purposes or subjectively considers it his home.\u2019 \u201d <em>Swann </em>involved the construction of a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. The issue before the Court was whether, under Maryland law, Swann was a resident of his parent\u2019s home at the time of the accident. <em>Swann, </em>749 A.2d at 24. Chief Judge Amestoy, writing for the court in <em>Swann, </em>predicted that \u201cMaryland Courts would approve the rationale adopted by the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Patterson, </em>231 Va. 358, 344 S.E.2d 890 (1986).\u201d <em>Swann, </em>749 A.2d at 26. According to the court in <em>Patterson, </em>\u201cwhile a person\u2019s intention to become a member of a particular household need not be coupled with continuous residence, the intention must be accompanied by a reasonable degree of regularity in the person\u2019s residential contacts with the household; casual, erratic contacts are not sufficient.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>344 S.E.2d at 893. As suggested, we agree with the <em>Patterson </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>this Court has, in other cases, interpreted residency clauses in insurance policies, though none involve facts identical to those of this case. Our decision in <em>Knight </em>is instructive insofar as it details the factors that the Court looks to when making a determination of residency. In <em>Knight, </em>we were asked \u201cto construe ... an exclusionary clause in a policy of insurance issued by ... [Peninsula Insurance Company].\u201d 254 Md. at 463, 255 A.2d at 56. In <em>Knight, </em>the Court was asked to construe the words \u201cresident\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d as they were used in the insurance policy at issue. In that case, the insured moved out of his family home and into his parents\u2019 home. Subsequently, his parents were injured in an auto collision, and, later, sued their son to recover compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>their damages. The Court found that the insured was a resident of his parents\u2019 household at the time of the accident. In finding him a resident of his parents\u2019 home, the court noted several factors as important, including that the insured, \u201coccupied one bedroom, not an apartment, ... did not buy and cook ... [his] own food,\u201d and all his belongings were in the attic. <em>Knight, </em>254 Md. at 478, 255 A.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">At issue in <em>Carrera </em>was whether Mark Read, who was killed by an uninsured motorist in an auto collision and was the son of the insured, Concetta Carrera, was a resident of the insured\u2019s household at the time of the accident. Carrera argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court in that case failed to consider decedent\u2019s intentions to return to the insured\u2019s household. That court agreed \u201cthat decedent\u2019s intention is pertinent to a determination of residence.\u201d <em>Carrera, </em>577 A.2d at 984. The court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">[t]he meaning of the term \u2018residence\u2019 or \u2018resident\u2019 is a mixed question of law and fact. In order to determine if a person is a resident of a particular household, the court must consider whether in the totality of the circumstances that person maintains a physical presence in the household with intent to remain for more than a mere transitory period, or that person has a reasonably recent history of physical presence together with circumstances that manifest an intent to return to the residence within a reasonably foreseeable period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"><em>Carrera, </em>577 A.2d at 985. Additionally, that court cited favorably Blacks Law Dictionary, 1176 (West 5th Ed. 1971), which noted that although</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u2018domicile\u2019 and \u2018residence\u2019 are usually in the same place, they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile. Residence means living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>Carrera, </em>577 A.2d at 983. This Court has said that \u201c \u2018[t]he words reside or resident mean domicile unless a contrary intent is shown. A person may have several places of abode or dwelling, but he can have only one domicile at a time.\u2019\u201d <em>Oglesby v. Williams, </em>372 Md. 360, 373, 812 A.2d 1061, 1068 (2002) (citations omitted). Further, we have defined \u201cdomicile\u201d as \u201c\u2018the place with which an individual has a settled connection for legal purposes and the place where a person has his true, fixed, permanent home, habitation and principal establishment, without any present intention of removing therefrom, and to which place he has, whenever he is absent, the intention of returning. The controlling factor in determining a person\u2019s domicile is his intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We caution conflating \u201cdomicile\u201d with \u201cresidency\u201d in this context, because in our view, this Court\u2019s domicile analysis places greater emphasis on \u201cintent,\u201d and therefore is not the appropriate test for residency. The appropriate test for residency, in our view, is that elucidated in <em>Forbes, </em>as it requires more than mere intent to return to a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In <em>Forbes, </em>Carol Forbes was killed, and her children injured, in an automobile collision that occurred while they were riding as passengers in an uninsured\u2019s motor vehicle. The issue was whether Carol Forbes, who left the family home, was still a resident of that previous household. At the time of the accident, Carol Forbes was not living with her husband in the family home, instead she was living with the uninsured motorist. Carol Forbes\u2019s husband sought a declaratory judgment to establish that Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company, which had issued an automobile liability policy on a jointly titled family vehicle, was responsible for providing UM coverage under the uninsured motorist provision contained in the policy. This Court adopted a totality of the circumstances test to determine residency and held \u201cunder the circumstances, ... that Carol Forbes was an \u2018insured\u2019 and a \u2018covered person\u2019 at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Forbes, </em>322 Md. at 709, 589 A.2d at 953. We considered the parties\u2019 marital status at the time of the accident, that no divorce discussions or proceedings had begun, the length of time of the separation, the address on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Carol Forbes\u2019 driver\u2019s license, her voter registration, as well as the temporary nature of her living arrangements. In holding that Carol Forbes was still a resident of the family household, notably, we did not explicitly consider her \u201cintent to return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Petitioner contends that in <em>Forbes, </em>the Court relied on <em>Carrera, </em>and that the Court of Special Appeals did not consider the <em>Forbes </em>Court\u2019s reliance and, as a result, misconstrued the law. The result, petitioner argues, was that the Court of Special Appeals placed excessive emphasis on the physical presence factor and trivialized evidence of Mundey\u2019s intent to return to his parents\u2019 household. We are unconvinced that the Court in <em>Forbes </em>relied on the rationale of Carrera to the extent suggested by Petitioner. <em>Forbes </em>cites <em>Carrera </em>for the principle that residence is \u201c \u2018a conclusion based on the aggregate details of the living arrangements of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Forbes </em>322 Md. at 705-06, 589 A.2d at 952, <em>(citing Davenport v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>144 Ga.App. 474, 241 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1978); <em>Carrera, </em>577 A.2d at 985). <em>Forbes </em>does not, however, directly adopt the rationale of <em>Carrera </em>nor does it explicitly factor intent to return into the residency analysis. In our view, the Court of Special Appeals appropriately analyzed the facts of <em>Forbes </em>and concluded that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test was applicable. As discussed <em>infra, </em>we agree and find nothing wrong with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 application of the <em>Forbes </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">For purposes of this decision, we will assume that Mundey intended to return to his parents\u2019 home in Lusby, Maryland. We agree, however, with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe facts of <em>Forbes ... </em>[are] more compelling than the facts of the case ... <em>[sub judice].\u201d Mundey, </em>167 Md.App. at 454, 893 A.2d at 650. In the case at bar, Mundey had been excluded from the family home for nearly one year and his parents denied his requests to return. Mundey had not contributed to the family expenses and his bedroom had been converted to other family use. Further, he visited infrequently, and spent only two nights at his parents\u2019 home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>after moving into his grandmother\u2019s residence. In our view, even if Mundey intended to return to his parents\u2019 home, his visits were so infrequent that it cannot be argued that they occurred with any reasonable degree of regularity. Mundey\u2019s contacts with his parents\u2019 home were casual and erratic and, as a result, insufficient to support a conclusion of residency. His presence in his parents\u2019 household was neither continuous nor significant. Unlike his connection to his parents\u2019 home, Mundey spent a considerable amount of his leisure time at his grandmother\u2019s home; he had a room there, ate his meals there, and was free to invite guests. We are not presented with the question of whether Mundey was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s home, rather, the question is whether he was a resident of his parents\u2019 home. We disagree with petitioner\u2019s contention that the application of the <em>Forbes </em>\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test dictates a finding that Mundey was a resident of his parents\u2019 home, because, <em>inter alia, </em>his attachment to his parents\u2019 household was, in fact, attenuated. The Circuit Court, therefore, was correct in finding that Mundey was not physically living in his parents\u2019 household at the time of the accident, that he is not an insured, by definition, under the policy and that he does not qualify for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. We reiterate that we are not dealing with a situation in which a resident of a household is temporarily absent for employment related purposes or because of a planned vacation. In this case, Mundey was not a resident of his parents\u2019 household and therefore was not entitled to coverage. Moreover, a short term absence from a household by a resident does not, by itself, exclude that person from coverage. We limit the holding in this case to the particular facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">.
