In <em>Roskelly v. Lamone, </em>396 Md. 27, 912 A.2d 658 (2006), this Court considered a petition to refer Senate Bill 478 (2005) , the act, <em>see </em>Chapter 5, Laws of Maryland 2006, establishing early voting in Maryland, to the voters for ratification. Concluding that the appellants, the proponents of the referendum, had been advised of the determination by the State Administrator of Elections that their petition was deficient because it had not been filed timely, but did not timely seek judicial review, we affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which had dismissed their action. 396 Md. at 47, 912 A.2d at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The early voting scheme was substantially amended during the 2006 session of the General Assembly by House Bill 1368 (2006) , Chapter 61, Laws of Maryland 2006. Marirose Joan Capozzi, Bettye B. Speed, and Charles W. Carter, the appellees herein, have challenged the constitutionality of the act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. In the instant case, we address the constitutionality of early voting, probing whether the acts establishing the process are inconsistent with, and, thus, in derogation of, the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The Maryland Constitution designates when elections in Maryland will occur. Article XV, \u00a7 7 of the Maryland Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201c \u00a7 7. General elections</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">\u201cAll general elections in this State shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November, in the year in which they shall occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Other constitutional provisions, addressing specific elections, are consistent, <em>e.g., </em>Article XVII, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Article II, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Article IV, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Article XV, \u00a7 7 of the Maryland Constitution states that all elections in Maryland \u201cshall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>of November, in the year in which they shall occur.\u201d Article XVII, \u00a7 2 of the Maryland Constitution states that \u201celections by qualified voters for State and county officers shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November, in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-six and on the same day in every fourth year thereafter.\u201d Article II, \u00a7 2 of the Maryland Constitution states that the \u201celection of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, under this Constitution, shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November.\u201d Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution states that judges of the Circuit Courts shall be elected \u201cat the general election to be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.\u201d Thus, historically, the general elections occur on one day, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, specified by Article XV, \u00a7 7 of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The Maryland Constitution also addresses, in Article I, \u201cThe Elective Franchise,\u201d recognizing two methods of exercising it, one it prescribes expressly and the other it authorizes the General Assembly to prescribe. The first method, \u201cby ballot,\u201d the Maryland Constitution expressly provides for. It is contained in Article I, \u00a7 1, which defines who may vote, where he or she may vote, and the qualifications for doing so. Captioned \u201cElections by ballot, qualifications to vote,\u201d it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3q\">\u201cAll elections shall be by ballot. Every citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election, <em>shall be entitled to vote in the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>ward or election district in which he resides at all elections to be held in this State. </em>A person once entitled to vote in any election district, shall be entitled to vote there until he shall have acquired a residence in another election district or ward in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Under this provision, the ballot must be cast in-person and at the polling place in the Ward or election district in which the voter resides.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Article I, \u00a7 1 provides that a voter is entitled to vote in his residential election district or ward \u201cuntil he shall have acquired a residence in another election district,\u201d a voter who moves from one ward or election district and acquires a new residence in another may only vote in the newly acquired ward or election district.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The second method of voting is by \u201cAbsentee Voting,\u201d to address those situations when voters, for whatever reason, are unable to vote in-person, at his or her designated polling station on the designated day. While, unlike voting \u201cby ballot,\u201d the Maryland Constitution itself does not mandate absentee voting, it authorizes the General Assembly to do so. Article I, \u00a7 3, entitled \u201cAbsentee Voting,\u201d of the Maryland Constitution, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201cThe General Assembly of Maryland shall have power to provide by suitable enactment for voting by qualified voters of the State of Maryland who are absent at the time of any election in which they are entitled to vote and for voting by other qualified voters who are unable to vote personally and for the manner in which and the time and place at which such absent voters may vote, and for the canvass and return of their votes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The Constitution, in addition to Article 1, \u00a7 3, also delegates to the General Assembly a significant role in the regulation of the election process. <em>See </em>Article III, \u00a7 49.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>provision, it is empowered to enact laws to regulate \u201call matters\u201d relating to elections, including election judges, their \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d and the manner of making election returns. The General Assembly\u2019s authority in this area is subject to one, albeit significant, limitation: its regulation and the laws it enacts may not be \u201cinconsistent with this Constitution;\u201d the statutes and regulations enacted by the General Assembly to govern the exercise of the elective franchise must be consistent with the constitutional provisions that provide for the exercise of the elective franchise and which they supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The General Assembly, acting pursuant to Article III, \u00a7 49, has taken seriously its responsibility to regulate all aspects of Maryland elections. The many statutes it has enacted are codified in the Election Law Article (\u201cEL\u201d). Maryland Code (2003, 2006 Cum.Supp.). Many of the statutes involve in-person, ballot voting, <em>e.g. </em>Title 9, Subtitles 1 and 2 of the Election Article, which, <em>inter alia, </em>they aim to facilitate, make uniform and make more reliable. For example, EL \u00a7 9-205 and 9-206 dictate the Content and Arrangement of the words on the ballot, EL \u00a7 9-210 dictates how candidates names shall be listed on all ballots, and EL \u00a7 9-208 explains that, if there is a late change or error in the ballots, the local board shall reprint the ballot if there is enough time, or print a sufficient number of stickers to be affixed to each ballot incorporating the change or correction, taking steps also to notify all candidates of the changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Moreover, EL \u00a7 9-101 of the Election Law Article establishes that \u201ca voting system for voting in polling places and a voting system for absentee voting,\u201d shall be selected and certified, and that this certified system \u201cshall be used in all counties.\u201d EL \u00a7 9-101(b). This voting system requires that \u201call voting shall be cast by ballot,\u201d EL \u00a7 9-201(a)(l), and that \u201conly votes cast on a ballot shall be counted.\u201d EL \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>201(a)(2). The State Board of Elections certifies these ballots and each local board of elections prepares the ballots in accordance with the State Board of Elections\u2019 prescription, EL \u00a7 9-202(b), such that each ballot is \u201ceasily understandable by voters,\u201d EL \u00a7 9-203(1), and \u201cas uniform as possible.\u201d EL \u00a7 9-204(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The General Assembly also has acted, pursuant to the authority given it by Article 1, \u00a7 3, to provide \u201cby suitable enactment\u201d for qualified voters \u201cwho are absent at the time of any election in which they are entitled to vote,\u201d and \u201cwho are unable to vote personally,\u201d to vote and \u201cfor the manner in which and the time and place\u201d where they may do so. <em>See </em>Title 9 Subtitle 3. The right to vote absentee applies to every Maryland election. EL \u00a7 9-301. The State Board is required to establish guidelines for the administration of absentee voting by the local boards of election, EL \u00a7 9-303, each of which is required to keep a record of absentee voting. EL \u00a7 9-302.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> EL \u00a7 9-304 prescribes who may vote absentee. Although it now states simply, \u201cAn individual may vote by absentee ballot except to the extent preempted under an applicable federal law,\u201d before its amendment by Chapter 6, \u00a7 1, Maryland Laws 2006, it set out a series of circumstances that comported with the dictates of Article 1, \u00a7 3. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2003, 2005 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 9-304 of the Election Law Article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Absentee ballots may be obtained from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>local board of elections by filling out an Absentee Ballot Application. EL \u00a7 9-305(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An absentee voter may use an agent in the absentee voting process and that agent may pick up and deliver the absentee voter\u2019s ballot, EL \u00a7 9-307,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>absentee voter may use a special envelope provided by the State Board. EL \u00a7 9-310. An absentee voter may also receive assistance in marking his or ballot. EL \u00a7 9-308. By utilizing this method of voting, a voter who is unable to vote personally on Election Day may exercise his or her elective franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The General Assembly, on April 9, 2005, two days before the end of the 2005 legislative session, passed Senate Bill 478, which authorized early voting in Maryland. This bill was intended to give Maryland voters a second alternative to in-person balloting, absentee balloting being the other. The Governor vetoed the bill on May 20, 2005. Early in the next legislative session, on January 16, 2006, both houses of the General Assembly overrode the Governor\u2019s veto, enacting Senate Bill 478, as Chapter 5, Maryland Laws 2006. <em>See </em>Article II, \u00a7 17(d) of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A new \u00a7 10-301.1 thus was added to the Election Law Article. That section permitted voters to vote early, eight hours each day for a five-day period beginning the Tuesday before a primary or general election through the Saturday before the election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>day, at sites designated by the local board of elections as early voting sites. At least three locations were required to be established in Anne Arundel, Harford, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s and Baltimore Counties and in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">During the 2006 legislative session, another bill pertaining to early voting, House Bill 1368, was introduced and passed, as emergency legislation. That bill repealed \u00a7 10-301.1 and reenacted it with amendments. As amended, \u00a7 10-301.1 extended the early voting period from eight hours to eleven hours daily and specified, either generally<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or with particularity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> where early voting would take place in each county and Baltimore City. HB 1368 was passed on March 29, 2006 and vetoed by the Governor on April 7, 2006. Both houses overrode the Governor\u2019s veto on April 10, 2006, thus enacting HB 1368. Chapter 61, Laws of Maryland 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On July 16, 2006, the appellees, registered voters in Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland, filed, in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County, a Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> against the appellants, the State of Maryland, Linda Lamone, in her capacity as Administrator of the Maryland State Board of Elections, and the Maryland State Board of Elections. They alleged in the complaint that \u00a7 10-301.1 of the Election Law Article was enacted in derogation of Article I, \u00a7 1, Article XV, \u00a7 7, and Article XVII, \u00a7\u00a7 1<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>2<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the Maryland Constitution. In essence, the appellees complained that early voting was not authorized by any part of the Constitution, as the provisions of Article I only acknowledged two ways to vote: in-person ballot voting and absentee balloting.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The case was transferred on July 28, 2006, upon motion of the appellants and pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2002 RepLVol., 2006 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 6-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The appellants filed an opposition to the appellees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, and their own motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. At the hearing, the appellants argued that Article I, \u00a7 1 was not a prohibitory provision; rather, they maintain, it merely sets forth the <em>entitlement </em>to vote of those who meet its enumerated qualifications. Stated differently, its \u201cgoal was not to restrict voters from voting outside of their district, but to prevent the Legislature from forcing voters to travel great distances\u2014especially in the times of horse and buggy\u2014to exercise their franchise.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Thereafter, on August 8, 2006, the Circuit Court issued its Memorandum Opinion. In the accompanying Order, it held that \u00a7 10-301.1 and the implementing legislation were unconstitutional and void. The court concluded, specifically, \u201cthe provisions in early voting that would allow some voters to cast votes in a district or ward other than the one in which they reside are inconsistent with the language of Article I, Section 1.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. 235, 238, 24 A. 606, 607 (1892), in which this Court stated that \u201c[one] cannot lawfully vote in a ward or election district in which he does not resides, even though that ward or election district be within the legislative district or county where he has residence,\u201d and <em>Smith v. Hackett, </em>129 Md. 73, 76-77, 98 A. 140, 141 (1916), in which we noted that \u201c[t]he only condition imposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Constitution as to the place where the right to vote shall be exercised is that it must be in the election district of which the voter is a resident,\u201d the Circuit Court concluded that the Constitution entitled qualified voters to cast votes only in the election district in which they reside. It also found that Article 1, \u00a7 1 is mandatory and cannot be waived; its instruction is not simply permissive. Accordingly, the Circuit Court rejected the appellants\u2019 \u201centitlement\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The court reasoned that because the case involved constitutional interpretation, and \u201c[t]he Maryland Constitution was carefully written and solemnly adopted by the Constitutional Convention of 1867, and approved by the people of the State,\u201d <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. 280, 285-286, 13 A.2d 348, 351 (1940), it should be careful not to depart from the plain language of the instrument. Moreover, it continued, while Article III, \u00a7 49 gives the General Assembly the power to enact laws that relate to the time, place, and manner of elections, that power is specifically constrained and cannot give rise to laws that are \u201cinconsistent with [the Maryland] Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Early voting was also found by the Circuit Court to be inconsistent with the requirement in Article XV, \u00a7 7 of the Maryland Constitution that \u201c[a]ll general elections in this State shall be held on the Tuesday next after the first of Monday in the month of November, in the year in which they shall occur.\u201d The court agreed with the appellees, who argued that the word \u201cheld\u201d contemplated a specific time period, a day, when the voters cast the votes,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and not, as the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>lants would have it, the end of the process, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe date upon which voting is concluded and the transition to tabulating the votes begins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The Circuit Court was not persuaded by <em>Foster v. Love, </em>522 U.S. 67, 118 S.Ct. 464, 139 L.Ed.2d 369 (1997), which it determined to be inapposite\u2014it only provided that the voting system utilized by a state may not produce a winner in a federal Senatorial and Representative race <em>prior </em>to the first Tuesday following the first Monday of November, 522 U.S. at 72, 118 S.Ct. at 468, 139 L.Ed.2d at 375. Nor did the court find the federal cases following Foster<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> helpful or persuasive, pointing out that they \u201call dealt -with early voting within the umbrella of absentee ballot provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Finally, the Circuit Court rejected the argument that Article I, \u00a7 3, authorizing absentee voting, provided the requisite authority for early voting legislation. On the contrary, referencing \u00a7 10-301.1(A)\u2019s express exception of \u201cAbsentee Voting\u201d from its coverage,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it observed that \u201c[a]s drafted, early voting goes far beyond the specifically authorized absentee voting language, creating a \u2018no excuse\u2019 needed category for voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>who need not be absent or unable to vote personally.\u201d That is made clear, the Circuit Court opined, by the explicit language distinguishing absentee voting provisions from the early voting provisions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Accordingly, the Circuit Court enjoined the appellants from further implementing or enforcing early voting.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The appellants immediately noted an appeal of the judgment to this Court<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and also filed a Petition for Certiorari, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>granted. <em>Lamone v. Capozzi, </em>394 Md. 307, 905 A.2d 842 (2006). Oral argument was heard on August 25, 2006. By Order issued on that same day, this Court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. We now provide the reasons for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This case involves constitutional interpretation. The principles that apply and their application are well settled. We recently restated them in <em>Roskelly v. Lamone:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cAs early as 1873, this Court recognized that where a \u2018general rule for the construction of statutes\u2019 exists, there \u2018can be no good reason suggested why this same general principle ... should not also apply as a rule of interpretation of the Constitution.\u2019 <em>New Central Coal Co. v. George\u2019s Creek Coal and Iron Co., </em>37 Md. 537, 557 (1873). We continue to adhere to that principle. <em>Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 536-537, 873 A.2d 1122, 1133-35 (2005). <em>See Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004) (\u2018When interpreting constitutional provisions, we generally employ the same rules of construction that are applicable to the construction of statutory language.\u2019); <em>Fish Market v. G.A.A., Inc., </em>337 Md. 1, 8, 650 A.2d 705, 708 (1994); <em>Luppino v. Gray, </em>336 Md. 194, 204 n. 8, 647 A.2d 429, 434 n. 8 (1994) (\u2018The rules governing the construction of statutes and constitutional provisions are the same\u2019); <em>Andrews v. Governor of Maryland, </em>294 Md. 285, 290, 449 A.2d 1144, 1147 (1982) (\u2018in ascertaining the meaning of a constitutional provision, we are governed by the same rules of interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>which prevail in relation to a statute\u2019); <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 277, 412 A.2d 396, 398 (1980) (the same rules that are applicable to construction of statutory language are employed in interpreting constitutional verbiage); <em>Perkins v. Eskridge, </em>278 Md. 619, 639, 366 A.2d 21, 36-37 (1976) (observing that the same rules apply in constructional construction as apply in statutory construction).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">396 Md. at 48, 912 A.2d at 670-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Thus, when this Court seeks to ascertain the meaning of a constitutional provision, it first will look to the \u201cnormal, plain meaning of the language,\u201d and, if the language is clear and unambiguous, it will not look past those terms. <em>Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. 516, 536-537, 873 A.2d 1122, 1134-1135 (2005). <em>See also Comptroller v. Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590, 594 (2005) (\u201cIf the plain language ... is unambiguous and is consistent with the [enactment\u2019s] apparent purpose, we give effect to the [enactment] as it is written\u201d); <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 256-257, 863 A.2d 297, 304 (2004); <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004) (\u201cWe begin with the plain language of the [enactments]\u201d); <em>Arundel Corp. v.

Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 595, 770 A.2d 111, 129 (2001) (the \u201cphrase \u2018to perform purely religious functions\u2019 clearly does not mean what is suggested____We decline to construe \u2018purely\u2019 as if it were \u2018primarily\u2019 or \u2018some\u2019 \u201d); <em>Dodds v.

Indeed, Article III, \u00a7 49 of the Maryland Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201c \u00a7 49. Regulation of elections</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cThe General Assembly shall have power to regulate by Law, <em>not inconsistent with this Constitution, </em>all matters which relate to the Judges of election, time, place and manner of holding elections in this State, and of making returns thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The appellants argue that Article III, \u00a7 49 <em>validates </em>the General Assembly\u2019s constitutional power to regulate the time, place, and manner of elections. They emphasize only a por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion of \u00a7 49, that portion that gives the General Assembly \u201cpower to regulate ... <em>all matters </em>which relate to the ... time, place and manner of holding elections in this State.\u201d (Emphasis added). This is confirmed, they assert, by the language of Article I, \u00a7 4, cl. 1 of the United States Constitution (\u201cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof...\u201d) and the absentee voting provision, Article I, \u00a7 3, of the Maryland Constitution. In addition, the appellants rely on <em>County Council for Montgomery County v. Montgomery Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>274 Md. 52, 333 A.2d 596 (1975). That case, they say, makes clear that the Framers intended that the General Assembly should regulate elections, 274 Md. at 60, 333 A.2d at 600, has \u201cpervasive control\u201d over elections, 274 Md. at 62, 333 A.2d at 602, and is \u201cobligated\u201d to enact a comprehensive plan for the conduct of elections. 274 Md. at 64, 333 A.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In <em>County Council, </em>Montgomery County enacted three ordinances, designed to regulate the campaign finance practices of candidates for County Executive and the County Council in that county, that provided for the reporting of campaign contributions, a ban on corporate contributions, a limit on contributions from individuals and from candidates to their own campaigns, and a limit on campaign spending. The respondents requested a declaratory judgment that the three ordinances were invalid and sought an injunction prohibiting prosecutions under the ordinances, alleging that the county had not been delegated authority by the General Assembly to enact the ordinances, that the field of regulation of election practices had been completely occupied by the General Assembly in enacting the State Election Code, that the ordinances conflicted with specific provisions of the State Election Code, and that enactment of the ordinances violated the Federal Constitution. 274 Md. at 54, 333 A.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">This Court held that election laws enacted by Montgomery County were preempted by state elections laws, and thus, were void. 274 Md. at 64, 333 A.2d at 603. While it is true that this Court, in <em>County Council, </em>made the points attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to it by the appellants, <em>County Council does </em>not stand for the proposition that the General Assembly\u2019s role in the regulation of elections is so pervasive or its obligation so great as to enable it to enact laws in derogation of the Maryland Constitution. Nothing in <em>County Council </em>suggests that to be the case and the facts of the case do not support that proposition. In fact, to make this argument, the appellants must emphasize, as we have seen them do, just a part of Article III, \u00a7 49, and simply disregard the critical provision that the laws passed to regulate elections \u201cnot [be] inconsistent with this Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Stressing that \u201celections ought to be free and frequent; and every citizen having the qualifications prescribed by the Constitution, ought to have the right of suffrage,\u201d <em>quoting </em>Md. Decl. Rights., Art. 7, the appellants argue that early voting would facilitate the ability of qualified voters to exercise their franchise, and, in that way, would safeguard the rights of those voters to participate in our democratic system. They rely on <em>Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, </em>383 U.S. 663, 667, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 16 L.Ed.2d 169, 172 (1966), for the proposition that \u201cthe political franchise of voting\u201d is a fundamental right that preserves all other basic civil rights, <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. at 241, 24 A. at 608, for the proposition that the elective franchise is the \u201chighest right of the citizen, and the spirit of our institutions requires that every opportunity should be afforded for its fair and free exercise,\u201d and the Maryland Declaration of Rights for the proposition that \u201cthe right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best security of liberty and the foundation of all free Government.\u201d Md. Decl. Rights, Art. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">They also rely on <em>Norris v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 192 A. 531 (1937). In <em>Norris, </em>opponents of the use of voting machines argued that their use conflicted with Article I, \u00a7 1, which provided that \u201c[a]ll elections shall be held by ballot.\u201d This Court rejected the argument that the term \u201cballot\u201d could not include voting machines, as they did not exist in 1867. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cwhile the principles of the Constitution are unchangeable, in interpreting the language by which they are expressed it will be given a meaning which will permit the application of those principles to changes in the economic, social, and political life of the people, which the framers did not and could not foresee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">172 Md. at 675-676, 192 A. at 535. The appellants urge that, in light of <em>Norris, </em>this Court should reject the \u201ccramped construction of the relevant constitutional provisions\u201d that was employed by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><em>Norris </em>is inapposite. The case <em>sub judice </em>does not involve, as <em>Norris </em>did, an improvement in technology or social progress that would, in effect, replace an instrument or aspect of the election process, while leaving the overall scheme intact. Early voting, instead, fundamentally <em>changes </em>the very principles established in the Constitution. Moreover, while we do appreciate both the right of voters to exercise their franchise and the General Assembly\u2019s attempts to make the exercise of that right more convenient and easier, we note that the importance of such a right, nevertheless, does not give the General Assembly <em>carte blanche </em>authority to enact laws and implement procedures that are in derogation of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">That EL \u00a7 10-301.1 authorizes voters to cast ballots \u201cbeginning the Tuesday before a primary or general election through the Saturday before the election,\u201d is clearly inconsistent with the words of, and the plain meaning of Article XV, \u00a7 7 and the other constitutional provisions that designate the \u201cTuesday next after the first Monday of November,\u201d as the date of the general election. The appellants argue, nevertheless, that there is <em>no </em>inconsistency between the constitutional provisions and the early voting statute. This is so, they submit, because an \u201celection\u201d is not singularly the \u201ccasting of a ballot,\u201d as the Circuit Court held, but, rather, it is, as articulated by <em>Foster v. Love, </em>522 U.S. 67, 71, 118 S.Ct. 464, 467, 139 L.Ed.2d 369, 374 (1997), \u201cthe combined actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an office holder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In <em>Foster, </em>Louisiana voters brought an action against state officials, alleging that the state\u2019s \u201copen primary\u201d system was in conflict with 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and 7.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 522 U.S. at 68-69, 118 S.Ct. at 466, 139 L.Ed.2d at 373. Louisiana used an \u201copen primary\u201d system, enacted in 1975, in which \u201call candidates, regardless of party, appear on the same ballot, and all voters, with like disregard of party, are entitled to vote.\u201d 522 U.S. at 70,118 S.Ct. at 467,139 L.Ed.2d at 374. If one candidate won a majority of the votes during that early voting period, he was \u201celected,\u201d \u201cand no further act is done on federal election day to fill the office in question.\u201d 522 U.S. at 70, 118 S.Ct. at 467, 139 L.Ed.2d at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Supreme Court agreed with the challengers that this system conflicted with the federal statutes creating a uniform federal election day. In so holding, it opined that the federal statutes, in reference to \u201celections,\u201d plainly meant the \u201ccombined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder.\u201d 522 U.S. at 71, 118 S.Ct. at 467, 139 L.Ed.2d at 374. By holding the \u201celection\u201d before the federally mandated election day, Louisiana\u2019s system was in conflict with federal statutes. 522 U.S. at 72, 118 S.Ct. at 468, 139 L.Ed.2d at 375. The Supreme Court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>state\u2019s rationale that the \u201copen primary\u201d system did not effect the \u201ctiming\u201d of the federal election day, but only the \u201cmanner\u201d of election. 522 U.S. at 72, 118 S.Ct. at 468, 139 L.Ed.2d at 375. Thus, while, to be sure, <em>Foster </em>defines an \u201celection\u201d as the combined action of voters and election officials, the context in which it was applied is instructive. That definition was employed to ensure that federal offices were not filled by elections finalized before the federal election day. <em>Foster, </em>therefore, contrary to the appellants\u2019 contentions, does not authorize voting on any other than the day specified for an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><em>Foster, </em>as the appellants point out, has been interpreted by two federal Courts of Appeal, <em>Voting Integrity Project, Inc. v. Bomer, </em>199 F.3d 773 (5th Cir.2000), and <em>Millsaps v. Thompson, </em>259 F.3d 535 (6th Cir.2001), to permit early voting. Neither of these cases, however, addressed whether the early voting scheme at issue was constitutional under the applicable state constitution. The issue in each case was whether the early voting scheme was preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In <em>Bomer, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Texas\u2019 Early Voting statutes did not directly conflict with the federal election statutes establishing a single election day and, therefore, were not preempted. 199 F.3d at 777. The Voting Integrity Project (\u201cVTP\u201d) filed a declaratory judgment action against Elton Bomer, the Texas Secretary of State (\u201cState\u201d), challenging Tex. Elec.Code \u00a7\u00a7 81.001,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> 82.005,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and 85.001<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (\u201cthe Texas Early Voting statutes\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>These statutes authorized voting to begin in Texas federal elections seventeen days before the federal election day; however, they did not allow the election results to be released until the votes were tabulated on federal election day. 199 F.3d at 774. Unlike traditional \u201cabsentee\u201d voting, the Texas scheme did not require the voter to give any reason to vote early. 199 F.3d at 774. Arguing that \u201celection\u201d is synonymous with voting, and as such, voting is confined to a single day, the VIP claimed that these statutes violated 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7 and 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which, collectively, established the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as <em>the day </em>for the election of federal representatives, senators, and presidential electors throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, noting that \u201ca state\u2019s discretion and flexibility in establishing the time, place and manner of electing its federal representatives has only one limitation: the state system cannot directly conflict with feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>al election laws on the subject,\u201d 199 F.3d at 775, found no conflict. In doing so, it rejected the VIP\u2019s argument that, under the statutory language, the entire election, including all voting, must occur on one day. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cAllowing some voters to east votes before election day does not contravene the federal election statutes because the final selection is not made before the federal election day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">199 F.3d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The court relied on <em>Foster </em>for the meaning of the term \u201celection,\u201d \u201cthe combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder.\u201d 199 F.3d at 775, <em>citing Foster, </em>522 U.S. at 71, 118 S.Ct. at 467, 139 L.Ed.2d at 374. It also pointed out that <em>Foster </em>did not prohibit early voting, only that elections \u201cmust not be \u2018consummated\u2019 before federal election day,\u201d 199 F.3d at 775, <em>citing Foster, </em>522 U.S. at 72 n. 4, 118 S.Ct. at 468 n. 4, 139 L.Ed.2d. at 375 n. 4. Under the Texas scheme, the court held, the election was not consummated early.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Also critical to the court\u2019s reasoning was the effect of a contrary holding on absentee voting. Conceding that, if the early voting statutes at issue were held to be inconsistent with federal law, then absentee balloting would be as well, a result that Congress did not contemplate or seek to effect, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\u201c[W]e cannot logically hold that Texas\u2019 system of unrestricted advanced voting violates federal law without also finding that absentee balloting-which occurs in every state-violates federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">\u201cWe do not believe that Congress would have allowed absentee balloting to occur under state laws if it attached the meaning to the federal election statutes urged by the VIP. More than a century ago, some states began to allow absentee voting, and all states currently provide for it in some form, ... yet Congress has taken no action to curb this established practice. We are unable to read the federal election day statutes in a manner that would prohibit such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>universal, longstanding practice of which Congress was obviously well aware.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">199 F.3d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Bomer </em>does not support the appellants\u2019 argument, nor is it analogous to the situation <em>sub judice. Bomer </em>did not address a state constitutional challenge, which is what is presented in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Thus, while, to be sure, the court in that case stated that \u201c[t]he challenged Texas statutes encourage voting by providing Texas voters with more opportunities to vote,\u201d 199 F.3d at 777, and \u201cfurther the important federal objective of reducing the burden on citizens to exercise their right to vote by allowing them to vote at a time convenient to them, without thwarting other federal concerns,\u201d <em>id., </em>it did so in the context of a challenge based on preemption as opposed to a state constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\"><em>Millsaps </em>is similarly unhelpful. There, a challenge similar to that in <em>Bomer </em>was brought against Tennessee\u2019s Early Voting Statutes (\u201cTEVS\u201d). Again, the plaintiffs in the case argued that the early voting system conflicted with federal statutes that established the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years as election day for federal office holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">TEVS allows a voter wishing to vote early to go to the county election commission office within posted hours \u201cnot more than twenty (20) days nor less than five (5) days <em>before the day of the election. </em>A voter desiring to vote in the early voting period shall sign an application for a ballot.\u201d 259 F.3d at 537, <em>citing </em>Tenn.Code. Ann. \u00a7 2-6-102(a) (emphasis added). Unlike absentee balloting, which required the identification of one of a few specifically enumerated reasons for voting absentee, TEVS established a separate method of early voting that did not require the voter to give any reason for wanting to vote early. 259 F.3d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Bomer </em>had done, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the holdings in <em>Foster, </em>that \u201cif an election does take place, it may not be consummated prior to federal election day,\u201d 259 F.3d at 544, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>citing Foster, </em>522 U.S. at 72 n. 4, 118 S.Ct. at 468 n. 4, 139 L.Ed.2d at 375 n. 4, and that an \u201celection\u201d is \u201cthe combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder ...\u201d 259 F.3d at 547, <em>citing Foster, </em>522 U.S. at 71, 118 S.Ct. at 467, 139 L.Ed.2d at 374. Using this rationale, the court concluded that the TEVS did not violate federal law. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cSo long as no combined action occurs any day other than federal election day, or so long as any such combined action is not intended to make a final selection of a federal officeholder, a State has complied with the federal elections statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">259 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Moreover, like <em>Bomer, </em>the <em>Millsaps </em>court was influenced by the adverse effect that an adverse ruling would have on absentee voting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">\u201c[W]e see no principled distinction between the [TEVS] at issue in this ease and the mechanics of absentee voting .... the plaintiffs\u2019 argument would apply with equal force to absentee voting and result in a declaration that federal law preempts a widely accepted and long-standing electoral practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">259 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals finally held that no Congressional purpose was frustrated, noting that \u201cthere is no reason to think that simply because Congress established a federal election day it displaced all State regulation of the times for holding federal elections.\u201d 259 F.3d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\"><em>Millsaps </em>does not support the appellants\u2019 position any more than did <em>Bomer. Millsaps </em>also did not deal with a state constitutional challenge to the Tennessee early voting scheme.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A determination that a state statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>conflict with an existing federal law does not insulate that state\u2019s statute from state constitutionality analysis. In sum, <em>Bomer </em>and <em>Millsaps </em>do not support the appellants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Voting, as the Circuit Court held, must mean the casting of ballots. Indeed, that is the focus of the Constitutional provisions. Article I, \u00a7 1, for example, states simply who can vote and where voting may occur. By contrast, there is no constitutional provision that prescribes who may canvass the votes or when or how the votes are to be canvassed; for that matter, no constitutional provision expressly authorizes canvassing or any of the ministerial actions that election officials must perform in conjunction with elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Article XV, \u00a7 7 and the other constitutional provisions prescribing the date of election are clear: the election \u201cshall be held <em>on </em>the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November, in the year in which they shall occur.\u201d (Emphasis added). There is no constitutional provision that states that voting shall begin on one date and end on another; it merely provides that the election shall be held <em>on </em>a specific day. Read in conjunction with Article I, \u00a7 1, this provision indicates that, apart from absentee voting, in-person ballot casting must begin and end on the same day. Thus, any statute that allows for a ballot to be cast before the prescribed day must be in derogation of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The appellants, continuing to rely on the meaning <em>Foster </em>ascribed to \u201celection,\u201d argue that an \u201celection\u201d cannot mean the mere casting of votes. This is so, they say, because an election has not been \u201cheld\u201d until the canvassing of the votes has begun, since a voter has not \u201cvoted\u201d until and unless his or her ballot has been \u201ccounted.\u201d They further ask whether an election has been truly \u201cheld\u201d if some emergency prevents the cast-ballots from being counted? We are not persuaded. The Constitution contemplates an election in terms of the voter, not in terms of the election process. Moreover, while we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>understand that the appellants would prefer us to center our focus on when an election has been \u201cheld,\u201d there is no dispute that the \u201ccombined actions\u201d must occur, that voting must end, on federal election day. The true issue, then, is deciding when voting can begin. Article XV, \u00a7 7 makes clear that ballot casting must begin and end on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Incidentally, this reading is not inconsistent with <em>Foster\u2019s </em>definition of the word \u201celection,\u201d as expressed by the appellants\u2014\u201cthe combined actions of voters and officials meant to make a final selection of an officeholder.\u201d These combined actions then, absentee balloting aside, must occur on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November. This Court is not convinced that it is constitutionally permitted for voting to merely \u201cend\u201d on federal election day, and to begin at any arbitrary prior date.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">It is clear from Article I, \u00a7 1, that a voter can only vote in the election ward or district in which he resides. Section 10-301.1 of the Election Law Article, however, allows for early voting to occur outside of a person\u2019s residential ward, providing for three different early voting polling places in some counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">As noted already, this Court, to ascertain the actual intent of the framers, interprets constitutional provisions using the same rules of interpretation that relate to the interpretation of a statute, and gives the language of the provision its ordinary, plain meaning. <em>See Bienkowski v. Brooks, </em>386 Md. at 536-537, 873 A.2d at 1133, <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 277-278, 412 A.2d 396, 398 (1980) (holding that the Court generally applies the same principles in construing constitutional provisions as it does in construing statutory language), <em>Buchholtz v. Hill, </em>178 Md. at 286, 13 A.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The appellants contend that Article I, \u00a7 1 was enacted to prevent election officials from preventing voters from voting in their own election wards. Accordingly, they maintain, it merely states that a voter \u201cshall be entitled\u201d to vote in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ward or election district in which he or she resides, and does not <em>exclude </em>voters from voting in other wards. Article I, \u00a7 1, however, is not ambiguous, and as such, this Court will not look past its plain language. The phrase, \u201cshall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which he resides,\u201d modifies the preceding phrase, \u201c[ejvery citizen of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election ...\u201d The phrase, as a whole, designates who is allowed to vote, if they so choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The location at which a citizen can vote also is a requirement. Even under the strained interpretation that the appellants\u2019 give the phrase, \u201cshall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which he resides,\u201d the subsequent language of Article I, \u00a7 1 bars voting in an election district or ward that a person does not live in. Article I, \u00a7 1 states that a person shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district where he resides <em>until </em>he acquires residence in another election district or ward. Therefore, once a voter who resides and votes in a particular ward acquires residence in another election district or ward, that voter\u2019s right, his or her entitlement, to vote in the ward where he or she once resided is extinguished. If he or she has the right to vote it is in the newly acquired district or ward.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The appellants state that it is \u201caxiomatic that a person may waive a constitutional right.\u201d While this is true of some constitutional rights, e.g., one may waive the right to a trial by jury, <em>Smith v. State, </em>375 Md. 365, 379-81, 825 A.2d 1055, 1064 (2003), a citizen cannot waive a <em>requirement </em>of the Constitution. We view the language in Article I, \u00a7 1, as a mandatory requirement, and not as a mere \u201centitlement,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>capable of being waived. Therefore, we reject the appellants\u2019 argument. <em>See also </em>Article 7 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">This reading of Article I, \u00a7 1 is not new in Maryland. In <em>Kemp v. Owens, </em>76 Md. at 238, 24 A. at 607, this Court stated that \u201c[one] cannot lawfully vote in a ward or election district in which he does not reside, even though that ward or election district be within the legislative district or county where he has residence.\u201d The appellants claim that this case in inapplicable, because it merely stands for the proposition that one cannot lawfully vote where he is not registered to vote. This reading, however, ignores the context of the case, in which this Court held that where one cannot lawfully vote, based on Article I, \u00a7 1, one cannot lawfully register or <em>remain registered to vote. </em>76 Md. at 238, 24 A. at 607. Further, <em>Kemp </em>highlights exactly the scenario described above, where one\u2019s voter entitlement extinguishes upon moving from his election ward and establishing residence elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cOwens, having removed from the first precinct of the Twenty-Second ward to the ninth precinct of the Seventh ward, ceased to be entitled to vote in the Twenty-Second ward, but was entitled to vote in the Seventh; both wards being in the same legislative district. In other words, by moving from one ward to another in the same legislative district, he did not lose his right to vote in that legislative district, but he was no longer authorized to vote in the ward from which he had moved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">76 Md. at 238, 24 A. at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In <em>Smith v. Hackett, </em>129 Md. 73, 76-77, 98 A. 140, 141 (1916), voters went to the election ward polling place designat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ed for them and to which they were directed to cast then-votes, but later learned that the polling room\u2019s physical location was slightly beyond the lines of the election district. This Court held that the votes they cast were rendered not invalid simply because they were cast outside the district lines. Acknowledging that \u201c[t]he only condition imposed by the Constitution as to the <em>place </em>where the right to vote shall be exercised is that it must be in the election district of which the voter is a resident,\u201d (emphasis in original), but concluding that the election officials, not the voters, had erred, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">\u201cThe act of the supervisors in locating the polling room in this instance beyond the precinct division line was contrary to the purpose of the law, but the act of the voters of the Second precinct in voting at the only place thus provided for them in the district of their residence was wholly within the right conferred upon them by the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">129 Md. at 77, 98 A. at 141-142. Thus, because the voters had voted, so far as they knew, where they were supposed to, within the district in which they resided, their votes were required to be counted. 129 Md. at 77-78, 98 A. at 142. Nothing in <em>Hackett </em>supports that voters in the instant case can knowingly and actively do what the Constitution does not allow\u2014vote outside of one\u2019s residential election district or ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Moreover, Article I, \u00a7 5 of the Maryland Constitution provides that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the General Assembly to pass Laws to punish, with f\u00edne and imprisonment, any person ... who shall vote in any election district, or ward, in which he does not reside....\u201d MD. CONST, art. I, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> By requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the General Assembly to legislate fines and punishments for persons voting outside their election district or ward, it plainly was the intent of the framers that voting outside of one\u2019s residential election district or ward is forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">That EL \u00a7 10-301.1 does not <em>force </em>voters from traveling outside their ward, but rather provides an \u201coption\u201d of an additional polling place, is irrelevant\u2014by providing an ability to vote outside one\u2019s election district or ward, the General Assembly has provided an option that is in derogation of Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The appellants argue that Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution does not apply to the primary elections in Maryland. They do so based on two decisions of this Court\u2014 <em>Hill v. Mayor and Town Council of Colmar Manor, </em>210 Md. 46, 122 A.2d 462 (1956), and <em>Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Blunt, </em>200 Md. 120, 88 A.2d 474 (1952), which they cite for the proposition that \u201cthe Legislature has plenary powers which are not restricted by the provisions of Article I of the Constitution of Maryland with regard to both primary and municipal elections ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Neither case supports their argument, however. <em>Blunt </em>dealt with the State\u2019s decision, having switched to voting machines, to limit, by law, voters at a primary election to a choice among the candidates for nomination listed on the official ballot and not permit write-in votes. This Court found that such an action was not unreasonable and did not violate any provision of the state or federal Constitution. 200 Md. at 128, 88 A.2d at 478. Specifically, the Court recognized that the General Assembly had the power to regulate by statute the process of primary elections; this, however, is very different than stating that \u201cArticle I, \u00a7 1 is inapposite to primaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In <em>Hill, </em>the question posed was whether primary elections for town Councilman pursuant to a town charter were required to be treated the same as general elections; specifically, the issue was whether the holding in <em>Blunt </em>prevented write-in votes from being accepted at a general election. 210 Md. at 53, 122 A.2d at 466. The Court in <em>Hill </em>noted that the town \u201cwas incorporated by Chapter 178 of the Acts of 1927, and its charter, as amended, constitutes Sections 373 to 415, inclusive, of the Code of Public Local Laws of Prince George\u2019s County (Everstine, 1953 Edition),\u201d 210 Md. at 48, 122 A.2d at 463, and that, in determining whether write-in votes were allowable under the town charter, \u201c[t]he question is one of legislative intent, not of constitutional right nor yet of legislative power.\u201d 210 Md. at 57, 122 A.2d at 468. Again, the issue was whether the local town charter had the intention of preventing write-in ballots from being accepted at a general election; <em>Hill </em>does not state that Article I, \u00a7 1 is inapposite to primary elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">We adopt the analysis offered by the Circuit Court in holding that primary elections are included within the meaning of \u201cat all elections to be held in this State\u201d in Article I, \u00a7 1: if Article I, \u00a7 1 were read to exclude primary elections, \u201csuch a reading could lead to an absurd result, as it would eliminate <em>all </em>Constitutional qualifications for primary elections. Thus, a 12 year-old, non-U.S. citizen, residing in Virginia, would not be barred by the [Maryland] Constitution from voting in the Maryland primary election.\u201d Such a reading simply cannot be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Having established that early voting is not authorized under Article I, \u00a7 1, the constitutional provision that authorizes in-person balloting, we also hold that early voting is not a form of absentee voting, authorized by Article I, \u00a7 3 of the Maryland Constitution. Article I, \u00a7 3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cThe General Assembly of Maryland shall have power to provide by suitable enactment for voting by qualified voters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of the State of Maryland who <em>are absent at the time of any election in which they are entitled to vote </em>and for voting by other qualified voters <em>who are unable to vote personally </em>and for the manner in which and the time and place at which such absent voters may vote, and for the canvass and return of their votes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Article I, \u00a7 3 plainly provides that the General Assembly shall have the power to provide for voters who are \u201cabsent\u201d and for voters who are unable to vote \u201cpersonally.\u201d Absentee balloting is the only other alternative to in-person day-of voting. This process includes a number of rules and regulations to ensure validity and fairness.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">To be sure, the reasons that permitted a voter to vote absentee no longer apply, having been removed from \u00a7 9-304 by Chapter 6, \u00a7 1, Maryland Laws 2006. The appellants rely upon, and take solace from, that fact. The appellants acknowledge that Article I, \u00a7 3 authorizes only \u201cabsent\u201d voters or those \u201cunable to vote personally\u201d to vote absentee, but claim that the phrase \u201cunable to vote personally\u201d is subject to interpretation. They claim that anyone who finds the voting time to be \u201cinconvenient\u201d may be \u201cunable to vote personally,\u201d due to work hours, family obligations, and other similar reasons. Therefore, the appellants assert, early voting, as it allows those inconvenienced individuals who are \u201cunable to vote personally\u201d to vote earlier at a more convenient time, is authorized by Article I, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We, however, are not convinced that the amendment of the absentee statute to delete the need for \u201creasons\u201d suffices to equate absentee voting with early voting. We reject the appellants\u2019 argument and hold that Article I, \u00a7 3 clearly indicates that the inability to vote personally applies to \u201cab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>sent\u201d voters, not those who find the voting day to be inconvenient. If the inconvenience is so great as to render them \u201cabsent\u201d and prevent them from voting on the election day, these individuals can vote using an absentee ballot.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Moreover, and more to the point, it matters little that the \u201cexcuse\u201d qualifications that previously were in EL \u00a7 9-304 and EL \u00a7 9-305<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> have been removed. People who are voting early under Md.Code \u00a7 10-301.1 are not absent nor are they unable to vote personally; instead, they are voters casting ballots in person, early. EL \u00a7 9\u2014101(a) makes clear that they are not absentee voters; they are voting by a ballot used in a polling place. Early voting is not absentee voting and, thus, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>not authorized by Article I, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the appellants\u2019 additional argument, that renaming the \u201cearly voting\u201d acts as \u201cno excuse absentee balloting\u201d eliminates the Article I, \u00a7 3 problem. Putting aside, for a moment, that Article I, \u00a7 3 does not authorize this form of voting, however titled, had the General Assembly wished for the early voting acts to be truly considered as \u201cno excuse absentee balloting,\u201d such intent would, and should, have at least been expressed in the title of the acts. Article III, \u00a7 29 of the Maryland Constitution provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201c... every Law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title; and no Law, nor section of Law, shall be revived, or amended by reference to its title, or section only; nor shall any Law be construed by reason of its title, to grant powers, or confer rights which are not expressly contained in the body of the Act.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">MD CONST, art. Ill, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">This Court has stated that, in order to convey to the public what the chapter means, the title of an enactment must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cshed[ ] substantial light on what the General Assembly had in mind,\u201d when it enacted the legislation. <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 395, 408 A.2d 1017, 1022 (1979). <em>See also Migdal v. State, </em>358 Md. 308, 323, 747 A.2d 1225, 1233 (2000) (noting that the purpose of constitutional single-subject rule is to avoid the necessity for a legislator to acquiesce in a bill he or she opposes in order to secure useful and necessary legislation and to prevent the engrafting of foreign matter on a bill, which foreign matter might not be supported if offered independently); <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. 217, 225, 378 A.2d 1326, 1330 (1977) (noting that the purpose of the title requirement is to inform the members of the legislature and the public of the nature of the proposed legislation), <em>City of Bowie v. County Commissioners, </em>258 Md. 454, 467, 267 A.2d 172, 179 (1970) (noting that the title must fairly describe the real nature of the statute). Moreover, <em>Bell v. Board of Comm\u2019rs, </em>195 Md. 21, 32-33, 72 A.2d 746, 751-752 (1950) dictates that any change in the laws must be marked, and clear, from the titles of the new enactments. If early voting were a form of \u201cno excuse\u201d absentee voting, the General Assembly should have noted such intent in the title of the enactment.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Because the acts authorizing EL \u00a7 10-301.1 are inconsistent with and in derogation of certain provisions of the Maryland Constitution, in particular, Article XV, \u00a7 7, and Article I, \u00a7 1, and are not constitutionally supported by Article I, \u00a7 3, we find these acts to be unconstitutional, and thus void.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\">.
