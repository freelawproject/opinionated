On May 7, 2004, Eastside Vend Distributors, Inc. (\u201cEastside\u201d), petitioner, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Coca Cola Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cCCE\u201d), The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (\u201cPBG\u201d), and Mars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Super Markets, Inc. (\u201cMars\u201d). As relevant to this particular action before the Court, the complaint alleged violation of the Maryland Antitrust Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cthe Act\u201d) via price discrimination on the part of the two bottling companies, CCE and PBG. It also alleged that Mars, as a supermarket, was complicit by knowingly receiving and inducing the alleged discriminatory prices in violation of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 30, 2005, Eastside filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to prohibit PBG, respondent, from denying Eastside rebates on the Pepsi products that Eastside purchases from PBG.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Circuit Court held a hearing on May 19 and 20, 2005. The Circuit Court denied the motion and issued an order to that effect on May 23, 2005. On May 26, 2005, Eastside timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On March 20, 2006, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Eastside\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. On May 3, 2006, Eastside filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. We granted certiorari on June 14, 2006. <em>Eastside Vend v. Pepsi, </em>393 Md. 245, 900 A.2d 751 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Eastside presents in its brief two questions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>1. \u201cDoes undisputed evidence that a manufacturer or distributor is selling its products to a purchaser at substantially higher prices than the seller charges the purchaser\u2019s competitors for the same products satisfy the likelihood of success on the merits factor in a preliminary injunction action under the Maryland Antitrust Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">2. \u201cCan a plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief establish that it has suffered irreparable harm by showing that the defendant\u2019s actions have caused a loss of customers and goodwill, or must the plaintiff demonstrate that its business will be destroyed unless an injunction is issued?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Our review of this case is predicated upon our determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Eastside\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. As part of this review, we analyze the standards for granting interlocutory injunctions. As a preliminary matter, we hold that generally injunctive relief is aimed at protecting a party, in a preventative manner, from future acts. In doing so, such injunctions are to maintain the status quo between parties until the issues in contention are fully litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>as discussed below, are not sufficient, at this preliminary stage, to support the granting of a preliminary injunction. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Eastside\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Eastside operates a business in Baltimore City, Maryland, that sells beverages and snack food items to vending machine owners and operators<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and other wholesale customers. East-side has been in business for over 30 years. The company first started out as a vending machine owner and operator and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>then transitioned into a niche \u201cone-stop shop\u201d distributor to vending machine owners and operators.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In recent years, however, Eastside has also begun to sell to other wholesale customers, known in the industry as \u201ccash and carry\u201d businesses. The cash and carry businesses that Eastside now sells to act as wholesalers to small \u201cmom and pop\u201d stores. As presently constituted, Eastside is essentially composed of a full-line distribution center, or warehouse. It offers its customers a comprehensive selection of items to stock their vending machines. This includes soft drinks, coffee, cocoa mixes, water, and snack foods, such as potato chips, pretzels, and candy bars. Customers can pick up their products directly from Eastside, or Eastside will deliver them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">PBG is a licensed bottler of Pepsi-Cola (\u201cPepsi\u201d) products, bottling and selling beverage products made under trademark licenses from PepsiCo, Inc. and other companies. The licenses govern how PBG may sell the products that it bottles and how it may license others to sell the products. For example, PBG is authorized to sell only for ultimate resale to end users (i.e., the public retail customer) when those end users are within a specific geographic boundary that composes PBG\u2019s territory. The trademark licenses that PBG operates under prohibit PBG from selling to customers that cause its products to be resold to customers outside of PBG\u2019s territory. When product from a bottler is shipped and sold to a wholesaler, there is a risk that product may be \u201ctranshipped\u201d by that wholesaler into another bottler\u2019s territory, thereby causing a bottler to be in breach of its exclusive licensing agreements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Eastside, under various agreements, has purchased Pepsi products from PBG for almost 30 years. Eastside\u2019s CEO, Theodore DeWald, Jr., testified that the sale of Pepsi products accounts for approximately 40 percent of Eastside\u2019s revenues. According to his testimony, in all probability, these sales are also attributable to an even greater net portion of revenue because customers who purchase Pepsi products also end up purchasing other non-Pepsi products. Eastside and PBG\u2019s business relationship has traditionally been governed by annual rebate contracts. Depending upon the terms of a particular year\u2019s contract, Eastside would receive various rebates based upon the volume of Pepsi product purchased in relation to the volume it had purchased the previous year. PBG asserts that these contracts and the resulting rebate programs associated with them, however, are designed for and offered to PBG\u2019s vending customers only. Initially, this did not cause any conflict because from the early 1980\u2019s through late 2003, Eastside\u2019s customers were only vending machine operators.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Beginning in October 2003, however, Eastside also began selling to cash and carry wholesale customers in addition to vending machine operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>On May 7, 2004, as discussed above, Eastside filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against several parties, including PBG, alleging, in part, that PBG was violating the Maryland Antitrust Act by engaging in unlawful price discrimination. In particular, Eastside alleged that PBG charged Eastside higher prices for Pepsi products than PBG charged other customers such as club stores (Sam\u2019s Club)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and supermarkets (Giant and Mars). During May 2004, East-side was receiving rebates under a 2004 vending operator agreement. Eastside contended that, notwithstanding the rebates it was receiving, PBG was providing Pepsi products to Eastside\u2019s competitors at lower cost than Eastside could purchase the products from PBG.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The 2004 vending operator agreement provided several different base rebates, all of which were based upon Eastside meeting or exceeding the volume of product that it had purchased for the corresponding 2003 Term. Eastside would receive quarterly base rebates of $0.95 for each case of 12-ounce cans and $2.30 for each case of 20-ounce bottles that it purchased. In addition to the base rebates, the 2004 agreement provided for two tiered growth rebate schedules, one for carbonated soft drinks (\u201cCSD\u201d) and one for non-carbonated soft drinks (\u201cnon-CSD\u201d). For example, the CSD growth rebate schedule provided that a 1 to 5 percent increase in volume of CSD purchased would generate a $0.50 rebate for each case purchased that exceeded the 2003 volume. From 5 to 10 percent provided a $1.00 per case rebate and above 10 percent was a $1.50 rebate. The record indicates that 2004 was a banner year in sales for Eastside. Mr. DeWald testified that total sales for the company were \u201ca little over $16 million\u201d and volume almost doubled from 2003. Therefore, Eastside was paying, with the base rebates, $6.05 per case of cans (base price of $7.00 per case minus $0.95 base rebate) and $11.50 per case of 20-ounce bottles (base price of $13.80 per case minus $2.30 base rebate). Additionally, for all cases purchased above its 2003 volume, Eastside was receiving from $0.50 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>$1.50 per case in additional growth rebates. PBG honored the agreement throughout the course of 2004, paying Eastside all of the rebates it qualified for. The price rebates for 2004 \u201camounted] to well in excess of $1 million\u201d for the year. The 2004 vending operator agreement terminated\u2014per its terms\u2014 on December 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Early in 2005, Joe Kreft, a Senior Key Account Manager with PBG, met with Mr. DeWald to discuss a proposed 2005 vending operator agreement. This agreement, like the previous years\u2019 agreements, was uniform for that segment of PBG\u2019s client base. In other words, this was the same agreement offered to all vending operators<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and was the only rebate program in existence for 2005 for that segment of customers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>It offered rebates of $0.95 per case of cans and $2.40 per case of 20-ounce bottles. The growth rebate was pared down to a flat $0.50 per case rebate for any case purchased in excess of the prior year\u2019s purchases. The agreement also provided specifically that \u201c[t]he Customer agrees that it shall <em>not </em>resell the Products to other <em>resellers/distributors,\u201d </em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark>[emphasis added] and included new provisions requiring that the customer purchase Gatorade from PBG rather than from other sources, and requiring that at least 25 percent of the total products purchased from PBG must be non-carbonated beverages in order for the customer to receive an additional $0.25 per case rebate on all products.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Following this meeting, negotiations ensued concerning the 2005 agreement. On February 9, 2005, Eastside rejected the proposed agreement, counter-proposing with several changes. In particular, Eastside crossed out the language which prohibited resale of products purchased from PBG to other resellers/distributors, i.e., \u201ccash and carry customers.\u201d Additionally, Eastside crossed out the provision requiring that it purchase Gatorade from PBG and modified the percentage of non-carbonated beverages that must be purchased to receive the $0.25 rebate from 25 percent to 12 percent. According to Mr. DeWald\u2019s testimony, Eastside based these changes on several factors. In regard to the provision relating to the prohibition of resale to other resellers/distributors, Mr. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Wald stated that all of Eastside\u2019s customers\u2014vending machine operators\u2014ostensibly could be considered resellers. They purchase Pepsi products from Eastside and then resell the products to end-users via vending machines. If he were to sign the agreement, Eastside would be in immediate breach. Additionally, Eastside supposedly had a separate contract with a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. to purchase Gatorade and thus, could not commit to purchase that particular product only from PBG. As for the percentage of non-carbonated beverages, Mr. DeWald testified that non-carbonated beverages were essentially Pepsi\u2019s bottled water, Aquafina, and such products had only comprised eight percent of Eastside\u2019s purchases for the prior year\u20142004. Therefore, he thought that it was not reasonable to increase Eastside\u2019s purchases (and consequent sales) of that product to 25 percent of East-side\u2019s total purchases, but that 12 percent would be attainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In mid-February, Mr. Kreft and another representative from PBG, Doug Aitken, visited Eastside again. The parties went through the agreement \u201cline-by-line\u201d and Mr. DeWald explained his reasoning for objecting to the terms discussed <em>swprn. </em>The meeting concluded with no agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On March 9, 2005, representatives from PBG, namely, Mr. Kreft, Mr. Aitken, and Michael Schwartz, then-Viee President for Food Services, again visited Eastside. Mr. DeWald testified as to his account of the meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cQ [Pjlease tell the Court what happened at this meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">A The beginning of the meeting, this was the first time I had ever met Mr. Schwartz and I wanted him to understand a brief history of what Eastside was, how Eastside came to be, where the business had led through the years, and where it was right now. I explained to him as to how the business operates and how we do our day to day business. We talked on several subjects of general competition in the business between Eastside and he was very interested in other competitors that we have outside the beverage world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Q Did you talk about Sam\u2019s Club?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">A Yes, we talked about the club stores and grocery stores, how they conduct business, as well as how the cash and carries and C store operators conduct their business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Q What are C stores?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">A Convenience stores, convenience and gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">Q Are they customers of yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">A They are customers of the cash and carries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Q And did he\u2014was there any discussion about whether you should or shouldn\u2019t be selling to cash and carries in this meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">A No, we had discussed who the cash and carries were in the area, how we dealt with them, how we sold them. PBG also sells them two liters and other products that we don\u2019t carry. We discussed different aspects as to how the general business worked with us selling to cash and carries and also the vending companies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">Q Okay. Did the subject of rebates come up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">A Yes, we talked about\u2014we again went through the contract and pretty much line by line again discussing different aspects of the items, such as Gatorade and stuff like that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">Q Did the subject of transhipping come up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-15\">A Yes, we talked thoroughly on the subject, [wjhat transhipping is and how it effects the bottlers, how it effects their territories and their relationship with the parent company. We went through pretty much all aspects of transhipping and what effects it has on pretty much on the consumer right on all the way back to the bottler and what it has to do with the economics of the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\">Q Did Mr. Schwartz at this meeting make any suggestion or accusation that Eastside was in fact participating in transhipping?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU6\">Q At all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APL\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Q Did the meeting produce any resolution of the issues that you were concerned about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">A No it did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Q Did there come a time when you discussed with Mr. Schwartz what the consequences to your business would be if [PBG] persisted in the course that it had taken regarding rebates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">A We had gone through the contract again line by line. When we got to the clause about the end user/consumer, I wanted Mr. Schwartz to understand that this did not apply to us. And the previous history that I had given him of the company it was pretty obvious that we did not sell to the end user. Mr. Schwartz was pretty definite that he was not paying us no matter whether I signed the contract or I didn\u2019t sign the contract, Eastside wasn\u2019t getting paid for the first three months of the first period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">Q What did that do in terms of the meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">A The meeting then, it was kind of ending on a sour note. Mr. Schwartz really wasn\u2019t there, he was only there to debate the (inaudible) information about the company, he really didn\u2019t want to iron out any of our issues about the contract and/or the term at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">Q Well what, if any, discussion was there about whether you might have alternative sources to purchase Pepsi products?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">A Mr. Schwartz, when we came to the end user/consumer clause, he said that wouldn\u2019t be paid. So Eastside would then operate off of our invoice price. He said that was correct, that was the prices that he was offering me. I said; well then I just won\u2019t buy it from you. He asked where I would purchase, I said the club stores, specifically Sam\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Club was offering a cheaper price than what I was paying on invoice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">Q In other words, at that point Sam\u2019s Club was offering to the public Pepsi products at a lower price than you were able to buy them from PBG?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Q And you said that to Mr. Schwartz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">Q And what did he say in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">A He said that he doubted whether Sam\u2019s Club or any club store or any legitimate customer of PBG would sell [to] Eastside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">It is evident that the parties again reviewed the agreement and Mr. DeWald again explained his reasons for disputing the particular provisions. Mr. Schwartz discussed the threat of transhipping with Mr. DeWald and the impact that it could have upon PBG\u2019s licensing agreements. The was no evidence in the record, however, that Mr. Schwartz actually accused Eastside of transhipping. It is apparent, however, that Mr. Schwartz and PBG believed that Eastside\u2019s business composition engendered the possibility and threat of transhipping PBG\u2019s product outside of its territory. In his sworn affidavit, Mr. Schwartz stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">\u201cEastside\u2019s assertion that it is operating a business that sells beverages and snack food items to vending machine operators is misleading. In reality, it operates a business that sells much of its volume to retail outlets and wholesalers [i.e., cash and cariy customers] supplying retail stores, including stores outside PBG\u2019s territory. Although East-side may still maintain the ability to supply vending machine operators, that business has been eclipsed by the business of supplying retail stores and wholesalers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The meeting ended without any decisions being made one way or the other. The record indicates that the parties concluded their discussion on less than cordial terms, with the PBG representatives being escorted out of Eastside\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Correspondence was exchanged between the parties\u2019 counsel and, with no amicable resolution forthcoming, on March 30, 2005, Eastside filed a motion for a prehminary injunction prohibiting PBG from denying Eastside rebates on the Pepsi products that Eastside purchases from PBG.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On May 19 and 20, 2005, the Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The court denied the motion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cThe Court has reviewed the DMF Leasing case[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] as well as other cases cited by both parties. And the Court is charged with balancing the four factors; likelihood that the Plaintiff will succeed on the merits, the balance of convenience, irreparable harm, and the public interest. The Court is charged with balancing these four factors to determine the appropriateness of which is to maintain the status quo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cWith respect to likelihood of success and irreparable harm, which are commonly regarded as the most significant factors, the Court will say the most about. However, I assure you that I have balanced all of the factors in making my determination. The issue[ ] is whether the Plaintiff has shown likelihood of success on a claim of price discrimination and the evidence is, at this preliminary stage, thin at best. The evidence is that Eastside is now and has for several years been in a category that can be characterized as a hybrid, it sells to vending machine operators and with great success in the past several years has moved into what\u2019s categorized as a cash and carry category. The Plaintiffs have argued that price discrimination is evidenced by PBGs sales of Pepsi products to Sam\u2019s Club at prices lower than sales to Eastside. The evidence of that is, I\u2019ve said, scant. But even if true, under the circumstances of this case, the Court can not say that PBG has engaged in price discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cThe Defendant\u2019s evidence of the price of 20 ounce Pepsi bottles indicates that Sam\u2019s Club pays more than Eastside, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the invoices presented by Eastside of sales to third parties by Sam\u2019s Club suggests that the price must be less than the Defendants indicate. However, Mr. DeWald testified that Eastside is the major distributor of Pepsi products in the Baltimore area. He\u2019s also testified that Sam\u2019s Club has targeted his business. He has testified that he sells his products below cost to keep his client base and under the fact presented it is just as reasonable for this Court to conclude that Sam\u2019s Club is selling below cost as is Eastside in an effort to syphon <em>off </em>Eastside\u2019s business. Accordingly, this Court does not conclude on the scant evidence presented at this hearing that PEG is engaged in price discrimination because of the price at which Sam\u2019s Club sells Pepsi 20 ounce bottles. With respect to the 11.5 ounce cans, there\u2019s no evidence that Eastside purchased the same product as Sam\u2019s Club and therefore no finding of price discrimination can be gleaned from that evidence either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cMars and Giant are in a business so different from Eastside as to present no valid basis for comparison of PBGs pricing schedules. In summary, the Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden to show a likelihood of success at this very preliminary stage. With respect to irreparable harm, the testimony is that Pepsi products are important to Eastside, both directly, that is for the revenue produced from resale, and indirectly, that is as a magnet that attracts customers who then purchase other products offered by Eastside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cTestimony is that without rebates Eastside will be forced to raise its prices. A rise in prices will cause customers to look to other distributors who can offer a lower price. And eventually Eastside will be adversely impacted. Mr. DeWald testified however that customers are attracted to Eastside not only for Pepsi products at attractive prices, but also because Eastside offers the convenience of offering multiple vending machine products in one location. There has been no quantification or even an attempt at a quantification of the effect of a higher price for Pepsi products on overall sales. And this Court can not speculate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>harm would be substantial or irreparable, there are simply too many variables not addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cMoreover, in light of the fact that the uncontroverted evidence is that Eastside\u2019s business has significantly changed in the past few years and that PBGs pricing hasn\u2019t kept pace with that change, that is that PBG sold Eastside as a distributor to vending machine operators when in fact they added cash and carry stores to their customer base for the past years. It\u2019s added to its customer base for its best years it has ever had for the past several years. In light of these facts PBG is now in early 2005 just catching up with its pricing practices. It\u2019s catching those pricing packages up to the reality of Eastside\u2019s business. And given that fact the Court can\u2019t say that Eastside is harmed at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201cWith respect to the balance of convenience measured by whether there\u2019s greater harm would be inflicted upon the Defendant by granting the injunction then would result from a refusal, this factor weighs in Eastside\u2019s favor although there was no evidence of PBGs revenues. There was evidence of the scale of its operations and this Court has no doubt that PBG could absorb the cost of paying Eastside rebates during the course of this litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cWith respect to the public interest, it is in this case closely tied to the likelihood of success. If there is in fact price discrimination, then the public has an interest in preventing it. If not, the public has an interest in seeing that the parties reach their own contractual agreements and [not] have those imposed upon them by the Court. As I\u2019ve said, the Court has balanced all of these factors and concludes that the Plaintiff has not met its burden for issuance of a preliminary injunction and the motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">On May 23, 2005, pursuant to this ruling, the court issued an order denying Eastside\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">On May 26, 2005, Eastside appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. On July 6, 2005, the Circuit Court denied Eastside\u2019s motion for an injunction pending appeal to the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Special Appeals. And, on July 7, 2005, the Court of Special Appeals entered an order denying Eastside\u2019s additional motion for an injunction pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">On March 20, 2006, the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals, however, disagreed with some of the Circuit Court\u2019s application of the law. In particular, the intermediate appellate court found that the balance of convenience factor weighed in favor of PBG:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cWe cannot agree with the circuit court that the balance of convenience, or balancing of harms, depending upon the granting or denial of the injunction, favored Eastside. There is no doubt that Eastside will suffer losses as a result of the withholding of the rebates, and we are confident, as was the court, that [PBG], based upon \u2018the scale of its operations,\u2019 could easily \u2018absorb the cost of paying Eastside rebates.\u2019 The fact remains, however, that currently, these parties are not bound by any contractual agreement, and if this injunction were to issue, [PBG] would have to 1) revive a rebate system it discontinued for one, specific customer, and 2) be obligated on a contract to which it would not enter on its own terms. As such, we hold the balance of convenience in this case favors [PBG].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">After finding that the balance of convenience factor weighed in favor of PBG, the court focused its attention on Eastside\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the Circuit Court that, \u201cat this stage and, under this standard, Eastside\u2019s evidence did not show a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim against [PBG].\u201d The court then conducted an extensive review of law pertaining to the issuance of preliminary injunctions. In sum, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cFirst, we review the issuance of a preliminary injunction on an abuse of discretion standard. As noted, ... failure of the party seeking the preliminary injunction to establish the existence of even one of the four factors will preclude the grant of preliminary relief. With respect to injunctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sought to prevent termination of a contractual relationship, courts disfavor granting injunctive relief in the absence of an issue regarding the legality of the termination of an agreement or a statutory basis. Further, no relief will be granted where the harm claimed is not caused by the wrong alleged in the underlying action, even though there is a substantial show of likelihood of success at a trial on the merits, particularly where there exists an adequate remedy at law. Finally, in an appropriate case, the <em>status quo </em>is the last, actual, peaceable, non-contested status of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cAt the hearing on the motion and on appeal, [PBG\u2019s] position has been\u2014and continues to be\u2014that \u2018the central issue on the merits is not price discrimination, but rather failed contract negotiations.\u2019 Whether this statement of [PBG\u2019s] position is accurate, for our purposes, we have before us on this appeal two parties, who were formerly bound by a contractual arrangement which no longer has any force or effect.... In calculating the potential loss, we look to the last actual, peaceable, non-contested status of the parties and freeze in time the obligations and benefits flowing from the relationship at that time. The date of the expiration of the original Agreement was December 25, 2004 and Eastside submitted to [PBG] a contract which the latter had proposed, with substantial revisions, constituting a counteroffer on February 9, 2005. In their face-to-face meeting on March 9, 2005, all negotiations collapsed. East-side filed its motion for preliminary injunction on March 30, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cThus, the last peaceable, non-contested status of the parties occurred after the expiration of the Agreement at issue. Eastside therefore claims irreparable harm as a result of the termination of rebate payments provided under an Agreement that had expired by its own terms. Moreover, Eastside\u2019s claim of price discrimination has no nexus to the circumstances underlying the termination of the Agreement. The expiration date of the Agreement was established long before the anti-trust violations were alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to have taken place and was in no way causally related. The net result is that, notwithstanding Eastside\u2019s claim that loss of the rebate revenue will result in destruction of its business, [Eastside\u2019s] motion for a preliminary injunction must fail by reason of the inability to demonstrate irreparable harm based on a necessity to maintain the <em>status quo. </em>Stated otherwise, the <em>status quo, </em>at best, relegates [East-side] to the position of an offeree to a proposed new Agreement, who made a counteroffer which was rejected. The benefit Eastside seeks to preserve in maintaining the <em>status quo, i.e., </em>the rebate program, lapsed when the original Agreement expired by its own terms. Continuing the parties in their present circumstance\u2014in which they continue in an <em>ad hoc </em>business relationship without the rebate program\u2014in effect, constitutes the <em>status quo. </em>Accordingly, we are satisfied that Eastside has an adequate remedy at law and its motion for preliminary injunction, therefore, should be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Our scope of review in this case is limited to determining whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying Eastside\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. <em>El Bey v.

[A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what the court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, is included within the notion of \u2018untenable grounds,\u2019 \u2018violative of fact and logic,\u2019 and \u2018against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">384 Md. at 628, 865 A.2d at 616 (some quotations omitted) (quoting <em>North v.

D-150, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 373, 375 (2d Cir.1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Eastside argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in its interpretation of two factors under <em>Armacost, </em>i.e., the likelihood of success on the merits and whether the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>will suffer irreparable harm unless an injunction is granted. Thus, Eastside asserts that \u201c[preliminary injunctive relief is warranted because [PBG] has violated the Maryland Antitrust Act by charging Eastside significantly higher prices than [PBG] charges Eastside\u2019s competitors for the same products.\u201d In opposition, PBG argues that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its interpretation because granting the preliminary injunction would alter, rather than maintain, the status quo and, in addition, based upon the \u201cscant\u201d evidence presented, Eastside \u201cfailed to carry its burden to establish all four factors required under\u201d <em>Armacost. </em>As a result, PBG asserts that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Denial of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Our review of the case <em>sub judice </em>is based upon whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying Eastside\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. While we disagree with some of the Circuit Court\u2019s application of the law to its ruling, it did not commit an abuse of discretion. In this case, the ruling\u2014denial of the motion for preliminary injunction\u2014logically follows from the findings upon which it rests. <em>See Dehn, </em>384 Md. at 628, 865 A.2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">First and foremost, it must be reiterated that injunctive relief is \u201ca preventative and protective remedy, <em>aimed at future acts, </em>and is not intended to redress past wrongs.\u201d <em>El Bey, </em>362 Md. at 353, 765 A.2d at 139 (citations omitted) (quotations omitted). For this reason alone, the Circuit Court was correct in denying the motion. Eastside contends that it seeks through a preliminary injunction to ameliorate the effect of PBG\u2019s alleged price discrimination. The relief requested by Eastside\u2019s motion, however, does not serve to alleviate the alleged price discrimination asserted by Eastside in its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Eastside filed its complaint on May 7, 2004, while it was still receiving rebates pursuant to its 2004 vending operator agreement. It continued to receive rebates throughout 2004 until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>December 25 of that year, when the agreement terminated of its own accord. It was only when negotiations broke down concerning the 2005 agreement, in March 2005, that Eastside filed this motion for a preliminary injunction. In its memorandum in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction Eastside specifically asked for relief in the form of \u201ca preliminary injunction prohibiting [PBG] from excluding Eastside from any and all rebate programs and requiring [PBG] to pay Eastside the same rebates that [PBG] previously offered Eastside and is continuing to offer Eastside\u2019s competitors.\u201d In addition, Eastside\u2019s proposed order stated that \u201c[PBG] shall pay rebates to Eastside for all rebate periods ... according to the same terms and conditions as Eastside received such rebates during the period of September 5, 2004 through December 25, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Eastside contends that \u201crestoration of the rebates was not the ultimate or only objective of Eastside\u2019s request for injunctive relief.\u201d And that \u201c[rjeinstating the rebates was simply one of several ways to accomplish\u201d an abatement of PBG\u2019s alleged unlawful price discrimination. This assertion, however, is contrary to the overall tenor of Eastside\u2019s argument. Eastside\u2019s entire argument is driven by the discussion of rebates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">A contractual agreement pertaining to rebates ceased to exist on December 25, 2004. Requiring PBG to pay Eastside rebates when they had neither been doing so, nor were required to do so for almost three months, is not a preventative and protective remedy. This injunction, were it to be granted, would not be protecting Eastside from some future act of PBG. Rather, it would be forcing PBG to reinstate a contract that both parties agreed would terminate on December 25, 2004. This goes to the balance of hardships equation, as well as to whether an injunction would serve to maintain the status quo. We shall later address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Additionally, PBG argues that Eastside\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction is entirely about rebate checks and the terminated contractual relationship under which rebates were paid\u2014not about price discrimination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree. PBG stated that the loss of rebates as a result of the collapse of contractual negotiations \u201ccannot be remedied under a theory of price discrimination, and accordingly there is no likelihood that Eastside will prevail on its claim,\u201d citing two cases in support. <em>See Omega World Travel, Inc. v. Trans World Airlines, </em>111 F.3d 14, 16 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A] preliminary injunction may never issue to prevent an injury or harm which not even the moving party contends was caused by the wrong claimed in the underlying action.\u201d); <em>Devose v. Herrington, 42 </em>F.3d 470, 471 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The first step in determining whether to grant or deny a motion for preliminary injunction is \u201cto balance the \u2018likelihood\u2019 of irreparable harm to the plaintiff against the \u2018likelihood\u2019 of harm to the defendant,\u201d i.e., the balance of hardships. <em>Blackwelder, </em>550 F.2d at 195. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Court of Special Appeals that the balance of hardships did not favor Eastside, it favored PBG: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cThe fact remains, however, that currently, these parties are not bound by any contractual agreement, and if this injunction were to issue, [PBG] would have to 1) revive a rebate system it discontinued for one, specific customer, and 2) be obligated on a contract to which it would not enter on its own terms. As such, we hold the balance of convenience in this case favors [PBG].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Eastside\u2019s inability to receive rebates during the period subsequent to the termination of the 2004 agreement may have been detrimental to its business, but any such detriment does not outweigh the hardship that would be imposed on PBG if it was forced to pay rebates for which it was not contractually obligated. Therefore, under our finding that the balance of hardships weighs in favor of PBG, \u201cinterim relief is more likely to require a clear showing of a likelihood of success.\u201d <em>Direx Israel, Ltd,., </em>952 F.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Additionally, it is important to discuss whether the granting of a preliminary injunction would maintain the status quo in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As stated <em>supra, </em>\u201cit is fundamental that a preliminary injunction does not issue as a matter of right, but only where it is necessary in order to preserve the <em>status quo.\u201d Harford Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>281 Md. at 585, 380 A.2d at 1048. In order to resolve this, we must first establish what the status quo was in this case. Ordinarily, the status quo is the last, actual, peaceable, non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy. <em>State Dep\u2019t v. Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. at 556 n. 9, 383 A.2d at 56 n. 9. The Court of Special Appeals found that \u201cthe last peaceable, non-contested status of the parties occurred after the expiration of the [2004 vending operator agreement].\u201d In the present posture of the case, the pending controversy is the denial by the trial court of Eastside\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Even if the pending controversy in this case is the underlying complaint concerning price discrimination, which was filed on May 7, 2004, Eastside entered into the 2004 vending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>operator agreement with PBG, effective, March 21, 2004\u2014 prior to filing the complaint and initiating the pending controversy. Therefore, the 2004 agreement was freely negotiated before the complaint was filed, at which time the status of the parties was peaceable and non-contested. It is uncontroverted that the 2004 agreement, and any rebates received thereunder, would terminate by its own freely negotiated terms on December 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The facts indicate that PBG fully complied with all of the terms of the 2004 agreement, throughout the course of the pending price discrimination controversy. At the time it was executed, there was no guarantee or requirement that PBG would continue to offer Eastside rebates following the termination of the 2004 agreement or that it would even agree to any further contracts. As such, the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that \u201cEastside\u2019s claim of price discrimination has no nexus to the circumstances underlying the termination of the Agreement. The expiration date of the Agreement was established long before the anti-trust violations were alleged to have taken place and was in no way causally related.\u201d The agreement was not terminated as a result of Eastside\u2019s price discrimination allegations and claims, but by the agreement\u2019s own predetermined date. We agree with the court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe benefit Eastside seeks to preserve in maintaining the <em>status quo, %.e., </em>the rebate program, lapsed when the original Agreement expired by its own terms. Continuing the parties in their present circumstance\u2014 in which they continue in an <em>ad hoc </em>business relationship without the rebate program\u2014in effect, constitutes the <em>status quo.\u201d </em>The status quo was that the 2004 agreement, which provided for rebates, would terminate on December 25, 2004. Forcing PBG to pay Eastside rebates via a preliminary injunction would have the effect of altering the status quo of the parties, which would be contrary to the purpose of preliminary injunctions. Therefore, the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

From the record, it is apparent that Eastside is somewhat of a unique entity. Its original business structure as a distributor only to vending machine owners and operators sets it apart from many of PBG\u2019s other customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. According to PBG, transhipping additionally threatens the business of a bottler for several reasons. Namely, the bottler is unable to control the quality of the transhipped products\u2014by ensuring that the product is fresh and meets \"Best if Used By\u201d guidelines. And, the returnable plastic trays in which the product is delivered are costly and are often not returned when product is transhipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>There are possible inferences that may be drawn by a fact-finder from some evidence in the record that some of the Pepsi products wholesaled by Eastside to its purchasers may then have been resold by those purchasers to retail outlets on the Eastern Shore of Maryland'\u2014an area outside of the area licensed to PBG by PepsiCo, Inc. and in fact, licensed to another distributor. If so, that might constitute a breach of PBG\u2019s contract with PepsiCo, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. The record is not entirely clear as to the composition of Eastside\u2019s customers. Vending machine operators are essentially businesses that own one or more vending machines or businesses that resell to other vending machine operators. They purchase the products needed to stock the machines from Eastside. End users then buy the products from the vending machines. Cash and carry businesses operate as wholesalers. They purchase products from Eastside for resale. Mom and pop stores, then, in turn, purchase the products from the cash and carry businesses. In that case, the end user is the customer that purchases products from the mom and pop store. The manner in which the product reaches the end user differs between vending machine operators and cash and carry businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. Sam's Club was never a party to these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\">. It appears that PBG\u2019s \"vending operator\u201d agreements were designed only to provide rebates to vending machine operators, as defined <em>supra. </em>Eastside had been receiving rebates from PBG throughout the years. However, as time passed, Eastside's business developed and transmogrified from being itself a vending machine operator, to becoming a distributor only to vending machine operators, to its present business composition, in which it also began to sell to cash and carry wholesale customers. This apparently is the source of the conflict. It is not entirely clear from the record in this case that the upper level management at PBG was aware that the growth rebates were being paid on the growth of the cash and carry business as well as the vending operator business or that upper level management was even aware that Eastside had built up a \"cash and carry business\u201d that moved products it had been licensed to sell to vending machine operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">While Eastside was itself a vending machine operator, its rebate agreements with PBG were in line with the purpose of the agreement, i.e., to encourage and promote vending sales of Pepsi products. Once Eastside transitioned its business to that of a distributor only to vending machine operators PBG continued to enter into rebate agreements, because Eastside's business still was limited to vending machine operators. While Eastside was no longer technically functioning as a vending machine operator itself, it was still furthering that segment of PBG\u2019s sales of Pepsi products. Once Eastside began selling to cash and carry wholesale customers in October of 2003\u2014the impact of which may not have been readily apparent until the end of 2004, or at least may not have been entirely apparent prior to the parties entering into the 2004 agreement\u2014Eastside\u2019s relationship as a customer changed with PBG. Eastside was no longer a vending machine operator, or in the business of selling only to vending machine operators. Therefore, the structure of the rebate agreements which it had always operated under was no longer directly applicable to its business relationship with PBG.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\">. It is apparent from the record that the language \"resellers/distributors,\u201d emphasized above, was meant to pertain to Eastside\u2019s cash and carry wholesale customers only. Eastside argues, as discussed <em>infra, </em>that this provision would prevent it from receiving rebates for Pepsi products sold to its vending machine operator customers. PBG, however, contends that sales to those vending operator customers would still qualify for rebates. This is supported by the business relationship of the parties over the years. Prior to 2005, PBG had always paid Eastside rebates on its sales of Pepsi products to vending machine operators. It was <em>not </em>until Eastside began also selling to cash and carry wholesalers and, as a result, in 2004, Eastside\u2019s overall sales increased significantly, that PBG added the reseller/distributors limiting language to the 2005 agreement. Additionally, this is consistent with PBG\u2019s argument that Eastside\u2019s sales to the cash and carry wholesalers created a threat of possible transhipping of Pepsi product, which could thereby violate PBG\u2019s exclusive licensing agreements with PepsiCo, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. <em>DMF Leasing, Inc. v. Budget Rent-A-Car of Maryland, Inc., </em>161 Md.App. 640, 871 A.2d 639 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">. Eastside argues that the court could impose other relief to abate the alleged price discrimination, i.e., PBG could lower Eastside\u2019s invoice price or raise the price that it charges Eastside\u2019s competitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">. PBG argues that the motion for preliminary injunction is not based on price discrimination, but rather on rebates\u2014in particular, those rebates provided for in the 2004 agreement. This argument lends itself to the underlying situation extant in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The rebates Eastside received through 2004 were premised on Eastside being a \"vending operator,\" as defined <em>supra, </em>or selling only to vending owners and operators, as discussed <em>supra. </em>The facts show that Eastside changed its business model in October of 2003. At that time, a large portion of its business began to encompass cash and carry wholesale businesses. Throughout 2004, Eastside was receiving vending rebates on its sales to these non-vending customers. This apparently operated greatly to Eastside\u2019s benefit as 2004 was its best sales year ever.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">PBG has the right to decide with whom it transacts business. To that effect, once the 2004 agreement terminated, PBG could have made the decision not to sell any Pepsi products to Eastside. PBG, however, offered Eastside a 2005 agreement which provided for rebates, subject to certain criteria. Eastside had the ability to negotiate that contract, but negotiations fell through. Eastside does not now have the right to force PBG to pay rebates based upon the terminated 2004 agreement, an agreement Eastside may have violated by selling to \"cash and carry customers\u201d and receiving rebates intended to apply only to its business of distributing to vending machine operators.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
