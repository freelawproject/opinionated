(People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d 139, 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Under this section, on a motion made prior to trial, or retrial after remittitur, the moving party is not required to affirmatively show that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>has been prejudiced by the delay; and, in the absence of a sufficient showing of good cause for the delay, a dismissal under the section is mandatory <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra, </em>p. 151).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We are compelled, reluctantly, to grant relief in this case. We are reluctant because it is apparent that the underlying cause for the failure to re-try petitioner within the prescribed period is a lack of provision for notifying counsel of the fact that the remittitur has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Subdivision (a) of rule 25 of the California Rules of Court provides: \u201cA remittitur shall issue after the final determination of any appeal, or of any original proceeding in review in which an alternative writ or order to show cause has been issued. Unless otherwise ordered, the clerk of the Supreme Court shall issue the remittitur when a judgment of that court becomes final, and the clerk of a Court of Appeal shall issue the remittitur upon the expiration of the period during which a hearing in the Supreme Court may be determined, including any extension of such period granted in the particular cause. The remittitur shall be deemed issued on the clerk\u2019s entry thereof in the register, and shall be transmitted immediately, with a certified copy of the opinion, to the lower court or tribunal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The problem presented in the case at bench would be obviated by simply adding the following sentence to subdivision (a) of rule 25: \u201cAt the same time, but in criminal cases only, copies of the remittitur shall be served upon all counsel of record.\u201d We suggest that such an amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Until such provision is made, however, we are confronted by the fact that the district attorney\u2014not the county clerk\u2014has the responsibility to prosecute. Therefore, at the present time under rule 25(a) it is incumbent upon the prosecutor\u2019s office to devise whatever procedures are necessary to ascertain when a remittitur has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">When the matter was before us originally there was no record or showing made as to what procedures were employed by the district attorney\u2019s office. However, at oral argument the Attorney General tendered a letter written by respondent\u2019s chief court clerk which we deem to be a part of the return to the alternative writ. That letter reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201cUpon receipt of a remittitur we make three copies; one for the case file, one for the District Attorney, one for Department Five, the Presiding Criminal Judge\u2019s department, and one for the trial judge. The clerk in Department Five, Mrs. Graves, arranges to have the action recalendared if it is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u201cI cannot explain why this procedure was not followed in the above entitled action unless an inexperienced deputy clerk unknowingly failed to do as required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Although such a procedure described above is certainly a reasonable and logical method to be employed, the risk of unexplained clerical error or neglect must rest with the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Without an explanation the court has no basis for determining whether the neglect was excusable, a determination essential to support a finding of good cause for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Under the mandate of <em>Wilson, supra, </em>the indictment against petitioner must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue commanding respondent court to dismiss the action against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Taylor, P. J., and Rouse, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 19, 1972, and the petition of the real party in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1972.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
