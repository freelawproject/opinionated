The trial court sustained the general demurrer with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>out leave to amend, its minute order noting plaintiffs\u2019 statement that the complaint could not be further amended and plaintiffs\u2019 request that, if sustained, the demurrer be sustained without leave to amend. Thereafter, the demurring defendants were ordered dismissed from the action. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of dismissal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 \u00a7 58Id, 904.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint contained four alleged causes of action and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The first cause of action alleged that the commissioners passed a resolution and the city thereafter adopted ordinance No. 140568, each providing, in essence, that \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity\u201d required the acquisition of properties, owned by the plaintiffs, among others, \u201cfor the extension and enlargement of the Los Angeles International Airport.\u201d The ordinance additionally authorized the city attorney to institute condemnation proceedings. Plaintiffs allege there is a controversy in that, they contend, their properties are not to be taken for \u201cphysical occupation\u201d and are being taken by defendants \u201cfor the sole purpose of evading any liability for the payment of inverse condemnation claims.\u201d They further allege \u201cexcessive\u201d land may not be taken by condemnation and that they are entitled to an adjudication as to whether the lands are being taken for a \u201cpublic use\u201d and that defendants should be enjoined from taking any action under the ordinance until that issue is decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The second cause of action incorporates most of the first, adding that, prior to passing its resolution, the airport commissioners authorized an \u201celection\u201d to be held among the owners of property within the pertinent area to ascertain the \u201copinions\u201d of such owners \u201cas to whether all of the property situated [there] . . . shall be taken by eminent domain.\u201d Plaintiffs alleged that the ascertainment of a consensus \u201cby the City Council\u201d was an attempt unlawfully to delegate legislative and judicial powers and was unfair and discriminatory; plaintiffs claimed entitlement to declaratory relief because \u201cthe right of these plaintiffs to receive a determination from the condemning authority has been prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Their third cause of action incorporates most of the clauses of the first cause of action and further alleges that Assembly Bill No. 2266, called the \u201cBeverly Bill,\u201d was adopted by the state Legislature before the city ordinance was adopted and that many property owners who voted in favor of condemning the subject land relied on the Beverly Bill, believing it to be constitutional and lawful, but that the Beverly Bill is unconstitutional and unlawful, for which reason the \u201celection\u201d (mentioned in the second cause of action) was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The fourth cause of action incorporates the same allegations from the first cause of action and alleges that section .1239.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the acquisition of airspace only if such is necessary to protect airport approaches \u201cfrom the encroachment of structures or vegetable life of such height or character as to interfere with or be hazardous to the use of such airport\u201d; that section 1239.4 specifies that, in such acquisition, the former land owner shall have reserved a free license to use and occupy the land for all purposes except erection or maintenance of the hazards specified. Plaintiffs allege a right to declaratory relief, in that their properties do not fit within the statutes for which reason condemnation of them would be unlawful. They seek a declaration to that effect, together with an order enjoining defendants from taking any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The ordinance mentioned in the first cause of action, of which we take judicial notice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 459; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 430, 431.5), states: \u201cSec. 1. The Council of the City of Los Angeles, finds and determines that the public interest, convenience and necessity require the acquisition, in fee simple, for airport purposes, for the expansion and enlargement of Los Angeles International Airport, of certain real properties . . . Sec. 2. . . . more particularly described as follows . . . .\u201d Thereafter described are 373 parcels of real property among which are the properties of plaintiffs. Section 3 authorizes and directs the city attorney to bring an action to condemn them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">By their first cause of action, plaintiffs asked the trial court to go behind the ordinance and determine that the city council\u2019s motive in taking their lands was to evade whatever damages might be imposed through the institution, by plaintiffs, of inverse condemnation actions. This the court was not authorized to do. Whether public necessity requires acquisition of property is strictly a legislative, not a judicial, question and legislative \u201cmotive\u201d is not a subject of inquiry under such circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The trial court\u2019s minute order, complying with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 472d, stated this rule in listing the grounds upon which the demurrer was sustained, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Chevalier </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 299, 304-305 [340 P.2d 598]. <em>Chevalier </em>was a condemnation action. Allegations in defendants\u2019 answer to the complaint, purporting to raise affirmative defenses, had been stricken on plaintiff\u2019s motion. These allegations had attacked a finding by the city council that condemnation of defendants\u2019 land was in the public interest; fraud, bad faith and abuse of discretion with respect to this finding were alleged. In sustaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the trial court\u2019s ruling our Supreme Court stated (pp. 304-305): \u201cThe stricken allegations in defendants\u2019 \u2018special defenses\u2019 sought judicial review of the findings that the respective takings were necessary and commensurate with the greatest public good and the least private injury. These legislative determinations are frequently termed the question of necessity. [Par.] The recitations in the city ordinance and Highway Commission\u2019s resolution of the \u2018public necessity\u2019 of the proposed improvements, that \u2018such property is necessary therefor,\u2019 and that the improvements were \u2018planned or located in the manner which will be most compatible with the greatest public good, and the least private injury,\u2019 are \u2018conclusive evidence\u2019 of those matters .... In upholding the constitutionality of this conclusive presumption, the United States Supreme Court said: \u2018That the necessity and expediency of taking property for public use is a legislative and not a judicial question is not open to discussion. . . . The question is purely political, does not require a hearing, and is not the subject of judicial inquiry.\u2019 <em>(Rindge Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>262 U.S. 700, 709 [67 L.Ed. 1186, 1193, 43 S.Ct. 689].)\u201d Our Supreme Court further stated (p. 307): \u201cWe are therefore in accord with the view that where the owner of land sought to be condemned for an established public use is accorded his constitutional right to just compensation for the taking, the condemning body\u2019s \u2018motives or reasons for declaring that it is necessary to take the land are no concern of his.\u2019 \u201d (And see: <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Keck </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 920, 924-925 [92 Cal.Rptr. 599]; <em>Miro </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 5 Cal App.3d 87, 95 [84 Cal.Rptr. 874]; <em>State of Cal. </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Water Resources </em>v. <em>Natomas Co. </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 547, 556-557 [49 Cal.Rptr. 64].)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">California Code of Civil Procedure section 1241 states a like rule, declaring, in part: \u201cBefore property can be taken, it must appear: . . . 2. That,the taking is necessary to such use; provided, when ... the legislative body of a . . . city . . . shall, by resolution or ordinance . . . have found and determined that the public interest and necessity require the acquisition . . . of . . . the property described in such resolution or ordinance . . . such resolution or ordinance shall be conclusive evidence; (a) of the public necessity of such proposed . . . public improvement; (b) that such property is necessary therefor, and (c) that such proposed . . . public improvement is planned or located in the manner which will be most compatible with the greatest public good, and the least private injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">As earlier noted, appellants\u2019 first amended complaint alleged that a controversy existed in that they contend, and respondents allegedly dispute, that \u201cexcessive land may not be lawfully taken in condemnation ... for a pretended purpose that such land is required to serve a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>use.\u201d Such claim of the existence of a controversy is laid to rest in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Lagiss </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 23 [35 Cal.Rptr. 554] wherein the court states (pp. 38-39): \u201c. . . most of defendant\u2019s evidence was directed towards the proof that plaintiff was seeking to acquire land in <em>excess </em>of that necessary for the designated purpose. It appears, therefore, that to a considerable degree the trial court and respective counsel confused \u2018necessity\u2019 with \u2018public use.\u2019 The character of the use, and not its extent, determines the question of public use. ... It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish between the amount of land and the necessity for its condemnation, as contrasted with the proposed purpose for which it is to be used. The necessity for the construction of a highway . . . together with the amount of land required therefor, are matters which were conclusively established by the adoption of the resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 allows a person to seek a declaration of his rights when \u201can actual controversy\u201d exists but the controversy must be of a type wherein the court can act; there must be a \u201cjusticiable controversy.\u201d  As stated in <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 252, 260 [13 Cal.Rptr. 491]: \u201c\u2018. . . not only must the controversy be a justiciable controversy, as distinguished from \u201ca difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot,\u201d but it must be \u201cdefinite and concrete, touching the legal relations of the parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d ... In short, the controversy must be of a character which admits of specific and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial determination, as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Appellants erroneously contend a \u201cjusticiable\u201d controversy is alleged. In <em>Chevalier, supra, </em>the first decision of <em>People </em>v. <em>Lagiss </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 28 [324 P.2d 926] was overruled, in effect, if not specifically. Thus, as noted in the second appellate decision of <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Lagiss, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.2d at page 31: \u201c. . . the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chevalier . . . </em>held that the question of \u2018necessity\u2019 is not justiciable and disapproved any language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lagiss </em>[first decision] and other cases implying a contrary rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Appellants rely upon <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 206 [65 Cal.Rptr. 342, 436 P.2d 342]. That case is readily distinguishable, the court there noting that defendants contended that the taking was not for a \u201cpublic use.\u201d \u201cPublic use\u201d and \u201cpublic necessity\u201d are different things and are to be distinguished and treated differently. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chevalier, supra, </em>at pp. 305-307.) Nowhere do plaintiffs allege that the lands involved will not be taken for a public use, namely, for airport purposes. Their sole claim, although using the term \u201cpublic use,\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>that the necessity is not that \u201cpublic necessity\u201d declared, but represents a different necessity or purpose, namely, to evade damages in possible condemnation actions to be filed by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs\u2019 terminology, by misnaming the nature of their claim, does not enable them to escape the rule that a \u201cjusticiable\u201d controversy must exist. No such controversy is alleged in the first purported cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">What has been said of plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action is equally applicable to the second, third and fourth causes of action, so far as they incorporate allegations from the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The second professed cause of action goes on to allege an illegal \u201celection\u201d to ascertain opinion. Nowhere does it allege that the city council, let alone the commissioners who ordered the election, rested their determination to condemn on the outcome of such canvass of opinion. Indeed, the complaint only alleges \u201c. . . the Board of Airport Commissioners adopted a resolution authorizing an election to take place by the owners of the property ... for the purpose of determining the opinions of said property owners . . . In a like vague and desultory manner, it further alleges \u201cThe decision by the City Council to ascertain in <em>\\sic\\ </em>consensus of opinion of the land owners ... for the purpose of assisting the City Council in arriving at a formal determination . . . was an attempt to unlawfully delegate legislative and judicial powers. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">First, there is no explanation pleaded showing how the action of the commissioners is to be attributed to the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Second, assuming that a solicitation of opinions in such manner constitutes an \u201celection\u201d (a matter we do not decide), there is no allegation that the determination to condemn hinged upon any consensus, or that such consensus was binding on the council. While a city\u2019s legislative power may not be delegated, no such abdication of power is alleged. It would be unrealistic to require that a legislator be insulated from the opinions of the affected populace. As stated in <em>Gray </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1930) 209 Cal. 502, 505 [288 P. 673]: \u201cWe know of no reason why a city council prior to taking action on legislative questions may not receive petitions and remonstrances from some or all citizens to be affected thereby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The third purported cause of action speaks of Assembly Bill number 2266, the \u201cBeverly Bill.\u201d The fact, if it be a fact, that some or all of the property owners favoring condemnation so voted in a mistaken reliance upon the bill\u2019s validity, is totally irrelevant, particularly in light of the nature and effect of the \u201celection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In other words, no councilman was allegedly bound by his constituents\u2019 viewpoints, whether such were well or poorly founded, nor was the adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>or defeat of the ordinance delegated to the voters. Furthermore, whether a councilman relied on or was influenced by the consensus is a matter brooking no judicial inquiry; his motives in voting to adopt or reject the ordinance may not be inquired into. <em>(Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 616 [147 P. 259]; <em>Plaza Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 414, 417-418 [54 P.2d 67].)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The fourth cause of action likewise is fatally deficient. It speaks of the authorization to acquire airspace (an air easement) contained in Code of Civil Procedure sections 1239.2 and 1239.4. However, the city ordinance involved makes no mention of an easement, but of the acquisition of all properties \u201cin fee simple.\u201d Thus, the properties will not be acquired solely to protect airport approaches from any \u201cencroachment of structures or vegetable life\u201d interfering with, or hazardous to the use of, the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The taking of a fee simple is authorized under Code of Civil Procedure section 1239, subdivision 1, when land is taken for \u201cPublic buildings or grounds.\u201d Properties may be acquired for the public uses specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1238, subdivision 20, reading in part as follows: \u201c. . . the right of eminent domain may be exercised in behalf of the following public uses: . . . 20. Airports for the landing and taking off of aircraft, and for the construction and maintenance of hangars . . . flying fields, signal lights and radio equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Since neither section 1239.2 nor section 1239.4 is involved in the condemning ordinance, their effect raises a false issue the determination of which is not here justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Jefferson, Acting P. J., and Kingsley, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 16, 1972.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">A certified copy of the ordinance was attached to defendants\u2019 demurrer, for the trial court\u2019s notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
