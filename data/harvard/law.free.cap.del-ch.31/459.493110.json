Section </em>16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">\u201cNo bill or joint resolution, except bills appropriating money for public purposes, shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">Two distinct subjects are included in the constitutional provisions; first, that no bill shall embrace more than one subject; the second, with which we are concerned, that the subject shall be expressed in the title. The question to be decided is whether or not the subject of the Act is expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>in the title, or, as applicable to the present case, does the title of the \u201cFair Trade Act\u201d adequately express the subject of the Act notwithstanding that by <em>Section </em>6 it purports to affect persons who are not parties to \u201cvoluntary contracts establishing minimum resale prices\u201d as well as parties to such contracts?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The appellant' argues that the first part of the title states that the purpose of the Act is to protect trademark owners, producers, distributors and the public; that under the next portion these persons are to be protected against injurious and uneconomic practices in the distribution of competitive commodities bearing a distinguishing trademark, brand or name; that it then concludes by stating how this protection is to be enforced; that is, \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts establishing minimum resale prices and providing for refusal to sell unless such minimum resale prices are observed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">It is urged that the inclusion in the title of the expression \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts establishing minimum resale prices and providing for refusal to sell unless such minimum resale prices are observed\u201d restricts the subject of the Act and implies that its provisions will be applicable only to retailers who voluntarily entered into such contracts, and not to retailers who refrained from so doing. Thus, it is urged, therefore, that that portion of <em>Section </em>6 which reads \u201cwhether the persons so advertising, offering for sale or selling is or is not a party to such contract\u201d is invalid, because there is nothing in the title of the Act, nor the subject thereof as expressed in the title, which would put the members of the Legislature or the public on notice that such a novel provision was contemplated or intended to be embraced within the body of the Act. It is also said that the portion as indicated cannot be regarded as germane to the subject of the Act as expressed in the title when consideration is given to the restriction placed on the subject of the Act by embracing within the title the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>clause reading \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts establishing minimum resale prices and providing for refusal to sell unless such minimum resale prices are observed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">With the foregoing observations in mind, the appellant says that the title is misleading, and that <em>Section </em>6 of the act, by reason thereof, is invalid as not being within the scope of the title under <em>Article II, Section </em>16 of the <em>Constitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The question is one of substantial interest. Legislative acts should not be disturbed except in clear cases, and then only upon weighty considerations. Each case dealing with the subject must of necessity be determined upon its own merits. Nevertheless, it should be said to those seeking to annul legislative acts on such grounds as here presented that it has consistently been the policy of this court to construe the provisions of <em>Article II, Section </em>16 of the <em>Constitution </em>most liberally, and whenever possible, to sustain rather than to destroy the legislation. Especially is this so in the light of the general rule that each legislative enactment is cloaked with the presumption of constitutionality and should not be invalidated unless the circumstances be shown beyond doubt to do violence to the provisions of the article and section aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In many instances our courts have quoted with approval the observations of Judge Cooley, <em>Const.Lim., (8th Ed.), Vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>296, that the purpose of the provision is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cFirst, to prevent hodgepodge or logrolling legislation; second, to prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature by means of provisions in bills of which the titles give no intimation * * *; third, to fairly apprise the people through publication of legislative proceedings as is usually made of the subjects of legislation that are being considered, in order that they may have opportunity of being heard thereon by petition or otherwise, if they shall so desire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">We have repeatedly said, in substance, that the principal object of the constitutional provision is that the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of the act when published shall be sufficiently comprehensive to give to the people, as well as to the members of the Legislature, fair and reasonable notice of the subject matter of the legislation proposed, thus preventing deception by the inclusion of provisions of which the title gives no intimation whatsoever. This statement, however, does not include within it the thought that a title of an act is intended to furnish a synopsis or index to the sections thereof. All that is required is that the language be of sufficient import to give reasonable intimation of the subject matter dealt with. In determining whether or not the subject of the act is expressed in the title, the whole language of the act should be considered as well as its manifest purpose and scope. <em>Monaghan v. Lewis, </em>5 <em>Pennewill </em>218, 59 <em>A. </em>948, 10 <em>Am.Cas. </em>1048; <em>Fouracre v. White, </em>7 <em>Boyce </em>25, 102 A. 186; <em>Wilmington Trust Co. v. Highfield, </em>4 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>394, 153 <em>A. </em>864; <em>State v. Emerson, </em>1 <em>Terry </em>328, 10 A.2d 515; <em>Clendaniel v. Conrad, </em>3 <em>Boyce </em>549, 83 A. 1036, <em>Ann. Cas. 1915B, </em>968; <em>State v. Grier, </em>4 <em>Boyce </em>322, 88 A. 579; <em>State v. Ferschke, </em>2 <em>Boyce </em>477, 81 A. 401; <em>In re Cypress Farms Ditch, </em>7 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>71, 180 A. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Upon a reading of the title of the present act the whole purpose thereof becomes apparent; that is, the protection of owners of trademarks and brand names, together with the public, from cut-throat and unfair competition respecting the retail sale of such commodities. The objection of the appellant that the words \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts\u201d are deceptive and misleading because no intimation whatsoever could be gathered therefrom that the act would apply to anyone offering for sale or selling any commodities who is not a party to such contract <em>(Sec. </em>6) cannot be sustained. It seems to us that such an objection is answered by the explanation that the words \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts\u201d merely describe the method by which the desired protection against price cutting is to be obtained, for without a voluntary contract no price restriction is binding upon anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We think the provisions of the act are sufficiently expressed in the title, and that that portion of the title relied on by the appellant, \u201cthrough the use of voluntary contracts\u201d, as being more restricted than the language employed under <em>Section </em>6, is reasonably capable of the construction that it is merely descriptive of the method by which retail prices are to be established and the general intent of the act carried out. <em>Goldsmith v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., </em>176 <em>Md. </em>682, 7 <em>A.2d </em>176, 125 <em>A.L.R. </em>1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In the light of our past decisions we cannot agree with the conclusion reached in the case of <em>Bristol-Meyers v. Webb\u2019s Cut-Rate Drug Co., </em>137 <em>Fla. </em>508, 188 <em>So. </em>91, wherein that court in dealing with a similar statute reached a different conclusion, nor do we think, as the appellant contends, that our conclusion as here expressed can be said to be inconsistent with that reached by this court in the case of <em>State v. Emerson, </em>1 <em>Terry, </em>(40 <em>Del.) </em>233, 8 A. <em>2d </em>154.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">For the reasons indicated, the decree as entered below is sustained and an order will be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
