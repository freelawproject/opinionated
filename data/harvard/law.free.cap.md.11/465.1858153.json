On the 8th of December 1841, Reardon and wife gave a mortgage to Scott upon this <em>same land </em>and <em>other land, </em>to secure $5000, also due by <em>Reardon. </em>This mortgage was <em>duly </em>executed , acknowledged and recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">A bill was filed in chancery by Johns, against Reardon <em>alone, </em>to foreclose his mortgage, and Reardon, in his answer thereto, states that the property belonged partly to himself and in part to his <em>wife, </em>and prays that she may be made a party to the bill. Scott then filed his bill against Reardon and wife, and Johns, to foreclose his mortgage, and claiming a priority for it over that to Johns. The causes were then consolidated by an agreement, in which it was also admitted that the land described in <em>both mortgages </em>belonged, at the time of their execution, one-half to Mrs. Reardon in fee, and the other half to Reardon in fee. The chancellor then, by his opinion and decree, gave Scott\u2019s mortgage the priority, because that to Johns had <em>not been </em>acknowledged before two justices of tire peace of the county where the land was situated, or the grantors lived, and decreed a sale of the mortgaged premises first to pay Scott\u2019s mortgage, and with the reservation of John\u2019s right against the surplus, after the defect of his bill, in not making the wife a party, was remedied by amendment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>agreement. (3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>57,65.) Johns appealed from this decree, and it was <em>affirmed </em>by this court, (5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>81,) and ithe cause remanded to the circuit court for Harford county for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">The <em>whole </em>mortgaged property was then sold by the trustee, and the net proceeds, amounting to $11,195.61, applied to pay Scott\u2019s mortgage of $8225, leaving a surplus of $2968.61, which was claimed by Mrs. Reardon, by her <em>petition </em>filed in the case, and also by Johns, in <em>exceptions </em>filed by him to the auditor\u2019s account, awarding it to Mrs. Reardon. The <em>second </em>of these exceptions insists, that as Scott\u2019s mortgage was valid against the <em>entire interest </em>both of Reardon and his <em>wife, </em>whilst the exceptant\u2019s is alleged to be only valid as to Reardon\u2019s interest, therefore Mrs. Reardon\u2019s part should have been applied <em>\u2019entire </em>to the payment, in part, of Scott\u2019s mortgage, and then -so 'much of Reardon\u2019s interest as was necessary to pay the balance thereof, and the residue of Reardon\u2019s portion to the payment, in part, of exceptant\u2019s mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">The court (Henry W. Archer, Special Judge,) by agreement, under which the right of appeal was reserved, passed a <em>pro forma </em>order overruling the exceptions and ratifying the account awarding the surplus to Mrs. Reardon, and from this order Johns appealed..</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C. JEcci.eston and Tuck, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-8\"><em>Chas. H. Pitts </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b475-9\">Though the mortgage from Boar-don and wife to Johns, was not valid as to Scott, a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser <em>without notice, </em>it is valid as between the parties thereto, including the <em>wife. </em>The only ground upon which Scott became a prior incumbrancer, was because he was <em>ignorant </em>of the mortgage to Johns; but Mrs. Reardon <em>did </em>have <em>actual notice of </em>this mortgage at the time she executed the <em>subsequent </em>mortgage to Scott. It is admitted that this mortgage did not pass her <em>dower interest </em>in the land, but that is not the question in this case; it is not as <em>wife </em>that she claims, but as <em>creditor, </em>and claiming as such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the assets must be <em>marshalled. </em>In other words, inasmuch as Scott\u2019s mortgage is valid against the entire interest of Reardon and wife, and Johns\u2019 mortgage is valid only against Reardon\u2019s interest, the whole of Mrs. Reardon\u2019s interest should have been applied to Scott\u2019s mortgage, and then so much of Rear-don\u2019s interest as was necessary to pay the balance of Scott\u2019s claim, leaving the residue of Reardon\u2019s interest to be applied to Johns\u2019 mortgage, after deducting Mrs. Reardon\u2019s dower, to be ascertained under the rule of court. 1 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 346, 353, <em>Union Bank vs. Edwards. 2 Bland, </em>166, <em>Winder vs. Diffenderffer. Ibid., </em>509, <em>Watkins vs. Worthington. </em>6 Gill, 337, 338, <em>Cornish vs. Wilson. </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>185, <em>Woollen vs. Hillen.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-5\"><em>Thos. S.. Alexander </em>for the appellee, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">1st. That as by the former decision of the chancellor, <em>affirmed </em>in this court, the right of Johns to come in on the surplus proceeds, was reserved until the defect in his bill was cured by making Mrs. Reardon a party, and as since the remanding of the case, he has never made her a party, and has never obtained any decree even against the husband, he is not entitled to make any claim to this surplus, especially not against-the wife, the sole owner thereof. 8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>1, <em>Eyler &amp; Matthews vs. Crabb\u2019s Exc'r. </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>333, <em>McClellan vs. Crook. </em>1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>189, <em>Gelston vs. Codwise. Jacob., </em>487.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-7\">2nd. That Johns is not entitled to claim any interest of Mrs. Reardon in the property or its proceeds, by virtue of his mortgage, because she was never made a party to his bill, and also, because even if she had been, the mortgage, not having been duly' acknowledged, was, as to her, a nullity. And as the payment of Scott\u2019s mortgage not only exhausted the whole of the husband\u2019s interest in the property, but also at least half that of the wife, the surplus unquestionably was of her interest in the estate, and Johns, therefore, could have no possible claim to it under his mortgage. 3 <em>Gill, </em>329, 334, <em>Chaney vs. Tipton. </em>6 <em>Wend., </em>1, 13. 5 <em>Madd. Ch. Rep., </em>414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>3rd. That as Johns never claimed the alleged equity of having the funds marshalled set up by his second exception, either in his answer to Scott\u2019s bill, or in any other manner than by filing that exception, and as Mrs. Reardon never was a party to his bill, nor even any decree obtained upon it, he could not then claim any such equity, and even if still open to him, not by <em>mere exception </em>to the audit. But. even if properly claimed and in proper time, Johns, as mortgagee only of the husband, has no such equity as against Scott, the mortgagee of both husband and wife, and especially not as against Mrs. Reardon, who, as mortgagor of her estate to Scott, <em>for her husband\u2019s debt, </em>instead of being liable in equity to have her estate primarily exhausted for the payment of that debt, has a counter equity to have the husband\u2019s estate first applied, or to be substituted to Scott\u2019s rights, to the extent to which her estate was exhausted in the payment. 4 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>17, <em>Dorr vs. Shaw. </em>1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., secs. </em>634, 642, 643. 71 <em>Law Lib., </em>192, 197, 198. 9 <em>Gill, </em>186, <em>Wollen vs. Hillen. 2 Sumner, </em>105, 125, <em>Dexter vs. Arnold. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>1373. 2 <em>Atk., </em>384, <em>Parteriche vs. Powlet. </em>3 <em>Paige, </em>615, <em>Neimcewicz vs. Gahn.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-5\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arf\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The property of Mrs. Reardon, conveyed to Johns, was not her separate estate, which she could bind in equity, but her estate at law, of which she could not be divested, except in the mode prescribed by our acts of Assembly, to pass the real estate of a <em>feme covert. Chaney vs. Tipton, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>327. As that deed was not acknowledged according to law, it was wholly inoperative as to her, and must be dealt with as if she had not been a party to it; and then the parties stand in this predicament, Johns held a mortgage of the property as if executed by James Reardon alone, and Scott a mortgage on the same property, executed in due form of law by Reardon and wife; this latter deed, according to the previous decision in this case, having priority over the other. In this aspect, Mrs. Reardon stands as surety to Scott, under a mortgage of her property, for a debt of her husband, but she never made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>valid deed binding her property for the payment of his debt to Johns. The proceeds of sale of both estates being in court, and Scott\u2019s priority acknowledged, the appellant claims payment of his claim out of the residue, as far as it will go, while Mrs. Reardon insists, that he has no right which a court of equity will sanction as against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The argument on the part of <em>the appellant, </em>that <em>Mrs. </em>Rear-don having executed the mortgage to Scott with knowledge of the deed to Johns for the same property, must be bound as a creditor or incumbrancer with notice <em>of a </em>prior equity, would, if allowed, defeat the object and policy of the law in relation to the estates of married women, by treating them <em>sui juris. </em>The Legislature has provided how they may dispose of their real estates, and the court has said they can be affected in no other mode. 3 <em>Gill, </em>327.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It is a familiar principle, that \u201cwhere there is a <em>lien on two </em>different parcels of land, and a junior lien on one of these parcels only, and the party holding the elder claim elects to have his whole demand out of the land bound by the lien of the junior creditor, the latter may either have the prior creditor thrown upon the other fund, or have the prior lien assigned to him, and receive all the aid it can afford him.\u201d <em>Watson vs. Bane, </em>7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>117. But that rule does not apply where there are two mortgagors of distinct estates \u2014 one being surety for the other \u2014 for the payment of the same debt, and a subsequent mortgagee has a lien only on the estate of the principal in the first debt. This was decided in <em>Woollen vs. Hillen, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>185, which case appears to be applicable to the present, if we consider Scott as the prior incumbrancer of both estates, and Johns as mortgagee of Reardon\u2019s property only. It was the equity of Mrs. Reardon, as of any other surety, to have her principal\u2019s estate applied, first to the payment of that debt for which her\u2019s stood as security, before the subsequent mortgagee of his estate could come upon the fund. To decide otherwise, would be making the appellee pay a debt of her husband, for which her property was never bound. If Rear-don had mortgaged two farms to Scott, and one of them, after-wards, to Johns, the principle invoked in behalf of the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>laut, would have been applicable; but, as this ease appears upon the record, he can derive no benefit from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">With our view of this point, it is unnecessary to decide the others presented on the part of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>Order </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
