The plaintiffs attempted to show, that this receipt was a <em>forgery, </em>or in other words, that the date had been changed from the' 5th to the 25th, and instead of being a separate payment as of the 25th, it was the <em>same payments </em>which were credited on the notes as of the 25th of April, and in order to make this out, they say the credits on the two notes as of the 25th of April, viz., $120, interest on eachy making $240, and $1121, principal, making in all $1361, are represented b}r the two receipts, one (being the one in controversy) for $1061, and the other for $300, dated the 19th of April. According to their own showing, therefore, conceding the $1061 to have been paid on the 5th, the $300 was <em>credited on the note fourteen days before it was paid. </em>The defendant, on the other hand insists, that this is a <em>separate payment </em>as of the 25th, and entirely <em>distinct </em>from the credits on the notes as of the 5th. in order to establish their theory of a <em>forgery, </em>they proved by Rockwell, that on the 1st of April 1850, when he made the calculation for the defendant, he, the defendant, \u201cdid not say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>any thing about a receipt from Thompson to him, being or <em>having been lost, </em>or being <em>mislaid.\u201d </em>The presumption arising from this testimony, the defendant proposed to <em>rebut, </em>by the declarations which he had made, long prior to the 1st of April 1850, to the witness Unkefer. In other words, he wished to show <em>why it was </em>that he was <em>silent </em>upon that occasion, and to <em>rebut </em>the inference arising from his apparent <em>acquiescence, </em>that no such receipt had ever been given. This, it is submitted, it was competent for him to do by the proposed testimony, without trenching upon the general rule, that a party\u2019s own declarations cannot be given in evidence in his own favor. See 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>14, <em>Milburn vs. The State. 7 Gill, </em>1, <em>Garner vs. Smith. </em>1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., sec. </em>197, <em>note 5. 5 Littell, 5. </em>6, <em>Thompson vs. Stewart. </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>239, <em>Alexander vs. Walter. </em>3 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 188, <em>Kolb vs. Whitely. </em>The credits on the notes and the receipts, clearly show that the defendant was correct in his view, and by no calculation of interest upon these notes, and crediting the payments conceded on both sides to have been made, can the verdict be verified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-5\"><em>Joseph M. Palmer </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\">It is an unbending rule of evidence, that a party to a suit cannot offer in evidence his own declarations, in relation to the subject in controversy. 1 <em>Gill, </em>140, <em>Whiteford vs. Burckmyer &amp; Adams. 7 Cowen, </em>459, <em>LaFarge vs. Kneeland. 5 Conn., </em>335, <em>Robbins vs. Harvey. </em>13 <em>Johns., </em>350, <em>Penfield vs. Carpender. </em>2 <em>Cowen, </em>436, <em>Tuttle vs. Hunt. </em>The writers on the law of evidence, have not thought it necessary as a general rule, to state that the admissions or declarations of a party shall not be received as evidence in his favor; as a general rule it is too plain tobe mentioned. <em>Archbold on Civil Pleading, </em>362, says: \u201cThe only instances in which a party\u2019s declarations are received in evidence for him or those claiming under him, are first, where they accompany an act done, in which case being part of the <em>res gestas, </em>they may be received in evidence for the purpose of explaining the act, and secondly in questions of pedigree.\u201d See also 3 <em>Phillip's Ev., </em>337, <em>note </em>213. And the only question presented by the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>in this case, is whether the <em>declarations </em>of the defendant are ad\u00bb missible in his <em>own </em>favor,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-5\">Ecclestox, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1C\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">This suit was instituted by John P. Thompson against Adam Nusbaum, (the appellant,,) upon a promissory note dated the 1st day of May 1848, for $2000, payable the 1st day of April 1850, given by Nusbaum to John Myers, and endorsed or transferred by him to Thompson. Subsequent to the institution of the suit, Thompson\u2019s death was suggested, And his executors James G. Hamner and MaryL. Thompson, were made parties,</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">It appears from the evidence, that besides the note in dis\u00bb pute, a promissory note dated the same day, for $2000, payable on the 1st of May 1850, was given by Nusbaum to John Myers, and endorsed or transferred by him to Thompson,</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The chief matter in controversy, at the trial, was, whether the defendant could rightfully claim as a credit upon the note in suit, a receipt for $10(51, purporting to bear date the 25th of April 1849.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">According to the testimony of E. H. Rockwell, the defendant called on him, about the 1st of April 1850, to make a calculation, from <em>data </em>then furnished by the defendant, for the purpose of ascertaining the balance due by him to Thompson upon the note <em>then due. </em>The witness thinks the defendant produced to him receipts of $1061, $300 and $500. The one for $1061, he thinks was dated the 5th of April 1849, and not according to its present date, the 25th of April. His opinion is, that the figure 2 before the figure 5 in the receipt, was evidently put in after the 5 was made. He calculated the payment of $1061, as of the 5th of April 1849. He thinks the defendant told him to make a calculation to the 6th of April 1850. The balance due on the calculation so made by the witness was over $400. In December 1850, he made a calculation for Thompson, on the same note from <em>data </em>furnished by him, and the balance amounted to $421.66. The witness supposes, that the <em>data </em>furnished him by the defendant, were identical with those furnished afterwards by plaintiff\u2019s testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Thompson. This the witness supposes, from the fact that the result of the calcula)\u00cdon made by him for the plaintiff\u2019s testator, in December 1850, corresponded with the amount ($421.66,) \u201cwhich the plaintiff\u2019s testator had endorsed as received on said note, due in May 1849, on the 6th of April 1850.\u201d The witness recollects distinctly, that the receipt for $300, was produced by defendant; but does not distinctly recollect any others. \u201cDoes not recollect from seeing <em>data </em>furnished by plaintiffs\u2019 testator to witness, in December 1850, what receipts or <em>data </em>were furnished to him by defendant, in April 1850. Only judges from concurrence of amount ascertained by witness on calculation for plaintiffs\u2019 testator, in December 1850, with that endorsed on said note by plaintiffs\u2019 testator, on the 6th April 1850, that the <em>data </em>furnished to witness by defendant, in April 1850, and by plaintiffs\u2019 testator, in December 1850, were the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Some time after the calculation was made for the defendant, he called on the witness and asked him to look for it. The witness having looked and not being able to find it, the defendant told him \u201cit was not material, he did not care whether he could find it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">This witness says, \u201cthe paper on which 1 made calculation as before stated for defendant, is lost. That when said calculation was made for defendant, defendant did not say anything about a receipt <em>from </em>plaintiffs\u2019 testator to defendant, being or having been lost, or being mislaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The defendant, in support of the issue on his part, offered to prove by Dr. Abdiel Unkefer, \u201cthat long before the 1st of April 1850, the defendant had complained, that he had lost or mislaid the said receipt of $1061, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 testator had, on being informed by defendant of the loss by him of said receipt, denied that he had given any such receipt, and that defendant had complained that he would be compelled to pay over again said amount of money, in consequence of said loss, and that afterwards, in the latter part of the summer of 1850, the defendant testified great joy, that he had recovered said receipt, which had been mislaid and as he supposed lost.\u201d To the admissibility of this offered evidence the plaintiffs ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>jeoted, and the court sustained the objection; to which decision the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Thus it will be seen, that the sole question presented by the bill of exceptions is, whether the court erroneously refused to admit the offered evidence, consisting, exclusively of the defend ant,\u2019s declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In <em>Whiteford vs. Burckmyer </em>Adams, 1 <em>Gill, </em>140, the court say: \u201cIt is an unbending rule of evidence, subject to very few and well defined exceptions, that a party cannot offer in evidence his own declarations in relation to the subject in controversy.\u201d And, in our opinion, none of the \u201cwell defined exceptions\u201d alluded to, will sanction the admission of the declarations which have been offered. They were not made in the presence of the plaintiffs, or of their testator, nor were they made at the time of any act being done, in- relation to the matters in controversy, and explanatory thereof, so that the declarations might be considered as coming within the rule in regard to <em>res gestai,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">' Whether the verdict is in accordance with the proof, is not a subject presented by the record for our consideration; and we have only stated so much of the evidence, as will show the nature of the question raised by the exception. The whole testimony given was submitted to the jury, and they have rendered their verdict upon it. The defendant made a motion for a new trial, and the court, overruled the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
