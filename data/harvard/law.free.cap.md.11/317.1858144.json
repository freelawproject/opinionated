The <em>pleas </em>were general performance, and a special plea that the plaintiff had filed his claim in the case of the insolvency of Sprigg, and claimed to participate in the disposition of his. asr sets, in the hands of the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\"><em>Exception. </em>The case was submitted to the court upon an agreed statement of facts, in which it was admitted, that Sprigg was arrested on the <em>ca. sa., </em>brought into' court on the 1st of December 1846, and on that day, by order of the court,, was finally committed to the custody and safe keeping of the sheriff, who, instead of confining him in the public jail of the county, without the consent and against the remonstrance of the plaintiff, appointed his (the sheriff\u2019s) room in a public tavern, as a place for the safe keeping of Sprigg, which room was not a part of the public jail or prison of the county, nor within prison walls and prison bounds; that Sprigg petitioned for the benefit of the insolvent laws, and obtained his personal discharge on the 2nd of December\u2019 1846, and after his commitment was never out of the company and presence of the sheriff or one of his deputies, while under said escape, until he obtained his personal discharge; that Sprigg at the time of issuing the <em>ca. sa., </em>owed $10,000 or $12,000, and his assets at the time of his application amounted to about $2000, which went into the hands of his trustee in insolvency; that Goddard became a party to the proceedings in insolvency, by filing a short copy of his said judgment, for the purpose of receiving such dividend as might be thereon awarded to him, but up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the present time has not received any thing by way of dividend, or otherwise, thereon, from the insolvent\u2019s estate or elsewhere.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6b\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">This case comes before us on a case stated. It is an action of debt on the official bond of Baden, formerly sheriff of Prince George\u2019s county. The facts may be thus briefly stated: In the year 1846, Charles Goddard, the <em>cestui que use, </em>sued out a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>against Osborn Sprigg, against whom a judgment had been previously recovered; that on the return of the writ, Sprigg was committed to the custody of Baden, the sheriff, who, instead of lodging him in the jail of the county, confined him in the private room of the sheriff; that on the next day Sprigg applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws of the State, and obtained his personal discharge. This action is brought, in the name of the State, against the sheriff and his sureties, for a voluntary escape. On this statement three questions are propounded to the court. The language of the agreement is as follows: \u201cThat if the court should be of opinion, upon the foregoing statement, that the omission and failure of the said Baden, sheriff as aforesaid, to confine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>lile said Sprigg in the county jai!, after he was finally committed under the <em>ca. sa. </em>on the prayer of the said <em>cestui que use, </em>is such a breach of hia official duty as to render his bond liable therefor, that then a judgment shall be entered by the court in favor of the plaintiff, for the penalty of the bond sued on, to be released on payment of the judgment and costs mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, with interest from the day therein stated in that behalf, <em>unless the court shall be of opinion that in this form of action, and on the above breach of duty, it is competent for the defendants to show, in mitigation of damages, the inability of the said Sprigg to pay all his debts due and owing at the time of his said commitment; </em>or unless the court shall bo of opinion that the fact of the said <em>cestui que use </em>filing his said judgment before the auditor in insolvency is a waiver, or merger, or operates as an extinguishment of the right of the said <em>cestui que use </em>to resort to the official bond of said defendant, for said breach of duty; and if the court should entertain either one, or both, of the last opinions, then a judgment is to be entered in favor of the defendants, for their costs of suit,\u201d dec.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In the view we have <em>of </em>this caso, we deem it only necessary to decide one of the questions, although we have carefully examined the authorities bearing on the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We are of opinion that it was competent, on the trial of the cause, to give in evidence, in mitigation of damages, the inability of Sprigg to pay all his debts at the time of his commitment. This, after full argument by counsel, and elaborate investigation by the court, was settled clearly in the case of <em>The State, use of Creecy, vs. Lawson, et al., </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>63. In that case, on <em>page </em>71, the learned judge, who delivered the opinion of the court, after stating the question, proceeds to show' what was the common law applicable to such a case as this, according to which, he holds, <em>\u201cit was competent for the defendant to offer such evidence for such </em>purposehe then adverts to the <em>Statutes qfldih Edward, </em>1 <em>ch. </em>11, and 1 <em>Richard, 2, ch. </em>12, which gave an action of debt against a jailor, or sheriff, for an escape, and then goes on to show that the remedy employed in that case (which was the same as the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u25a0in this) is not the one authorized by either of those statutes, but an action of debt on a bond, with a collateral condition, for the faithful discharge of official duties as sheriff,- remarking, that although \u201cthe bond, it is true, is a statutory bond, but the remedy on the bond is the common. <em>law remedy </em>of action of debt on a bond with a penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>, </em>That case, on the question to which it refers, we regard as conclusive of this one, and, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
