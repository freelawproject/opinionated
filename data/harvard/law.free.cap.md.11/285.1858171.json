He also reported that the defendants, Carr and wife, as administrators of Jesse Bell, had passed their final account, and distributed the net personal estate amounting to $440.09, to his widow and children, but that this distribution was made with full knowledge of the claim in this case, and after suit brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">The court then passed a decree for the sale of the land, to pay the balance so found by the auditor\u2019s account to be due, and from this decree the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-8\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

That the testimony excepted to is inadmissible under the <em>statute of frauds. </em>It goes to set up a secret trust, to wit, that the grantee should <em>support </em>the grantor <em>for life, </em>and is therefore within the 7th section of the statute. It is palpably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>an attempt to set up a <em>conventional trust, </em>on the foundation of a <em>special parol </em>agreement, which cannot be done. 2 <em>Md. Rep., 25, McElderry vs. Shipley. </em>9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>80, <em>Clagett vs. Hall. </em>4 <em>Russell, </em>423, <em>Leman vs. Whitley. 27 Penn. State Rep., </em>144, <em>Stafford vs. Stafford. </em>And as to part performance, the record furnishes no evidence of any <em>acts </em>done by the complainant, which bear the slightest reference to such a contract as he alleges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">2nd. That the testimony is inadmissible, under the <em>common law </em>rule of evidence: that parol testimony is inadmissible to vary, add to or contradict, the express terms of a written imstrument. A stronger case for the application of the rule could not be well presented, as the parol proof in this instance contrives both to <em>vary-, add to </em>and <em>contradict, </em>the deed at one and the same stroke. The apparent exceptions to this general rule, are Istj the cases where the <em>receipt </em>of the consideration, may be disproved or explained by parol, and these go upon the principle, that the acknowledgment of the receipt is no necessary or integral part of the deed, <em>but is </em>mere matter of recital, and not a <em>contract </em>or the <em>evidence of a contract. </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>84, <em>Wolfe vs. Hauver. </em>3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>411, <em>Spalding vs. Brent. </em>1 <em>J. J. Marshall, </em>390, <em>Gully vs. Grubbs. </em>But these cases so far from being authorities for admitting evidence <em>to vary the amount </em>of the consideration, distinctly say, that receipts are inserted in deeds mainly to show the <em>actual amount </em>of consideration j with which it is consistent to prove that the <em>specified amount </em>had been assumed by note or otherwise: 2nd. Where the object and only effect of the parol proof is simply to <em>rebut a presumption of fraud, </em>it has, in some few cases of peculiar nature, been admitted to explain qualify or enlarge the consideration clause. 9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>80, <em>Clagett vs. Hall. </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>412, <em>Cole vs. Albers &amp; Runge. 3 Md. Ch. Dec., </em>170, <em>Anderson vs. Tydings. </em>But even this liberty is allowed under stringent qualifications, as appears from the large number of instances where parol proof for that purpose has been rejected. <em>1 H. &amp; G., </em>175, <em>Betts vs. Union Bank. 2 Md. Ch. Dec., </em>447, <em>Sewell vs. Baxter &amp; wife, </em>affirmed in 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>334. 3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>349, <em>Glenn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>vs. </em>McNeal, affirmed in 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>87. 3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>468, <em>Notley Young\u2019s Estate. </em>3 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>99, <em>Bullett vs. Worthington, </em>affirmed in 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>172. 3rd. So also a <em>grantee </em>has been allowed to prove a different consideration <em>actually paid </em>in bar of the vendor\u2019s lien, simply to raise an <em>equitable estoppel </em>upon the grantor, and to preclude him from disproving the receipt of the purchase money. 1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., 392, Elysville Manufacturing Co., vs. Okisko Co., </em>affirmed in <em>5 Md. Rep., </em>158. 4th. When the controversy is between <em>strangers to the deed </em>and the consideration clause, is in question simply as a <em>recital </em>or <em>evidence of an independent fact, it </em>is to some extent open to explanation or even contradiction. 3 <em>Term Rep., </em>474, <em>Rex vs. Inhabitants of Scammonden.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-5\">Subject to these exceptions, (which prove and illustrate the rule,) the consideration clause of a deed is as fully under the protection of the rule as any part of any other written instrument. Especially in a case like the present, where the parol evidence is designed to have an <em>executory operation, </em>in other words, where the object is to reform the contract, contained in and evidenced by the consideration clause, for the purpose of claiming its execution as reformed, or its equivalent in damages, it has been in Maryland <em>invariably rejected, </em>except upon averment and proof of fraud, accident, surprise or mistake. In addition to the cases already cited, see 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>24, <em>Wesley vs. Thomas.

That the evidence excepted to was inadmissible, as tending <em>to repel and rebut the lien set </em>up by the complainant. A consideration, in the form of an <em>agreement, to </em>find <em>board and clothing, </em>is inconsistent with an application to enforce a <em>vendor\u2019s lien, </em>because such lien is only raised on a definite and liquidated <em>money consideration. </em>The authorities uniformly speak of <em>purchase money, </em>as the only consideration which can support the lien. 4 <em>Kent, </em>152. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., sec. </em>1217. <em>2 Wat. Eden. on Injunctions, </em>208, 209, <em>note. </em>1 <em>Hilliard on Mortgages, </em>463, 464. 1 <em>Hilliard on Real Property, </em>378, 474. This then is an attempt to expand and stretch the doctrine of the <em>vendor\u2019s lien </em>beyond all precedents, whereas, it should not be extended further than its present limits, because being a secret and invisible trust, it contravenes the policy and spirit of our registry laws. 7 <em>Wheat., </em>46, <em>Bayley vs. Greenleaf. </em>7 <em>Sergt. &amp; Rawle, </em>64, <em>Kauffelt vs. Bower. </em>3 <em>Ired. Eq., </em>182, <em>Womble vs. Battle. </em>3 <em>Leigh., </em>597, <em>Moore vs. </em>Holcombe, To enforce the <em>vendor's lien, </em>in favor of a collateral agreement or covenant, unliquidated and sounding in damages, would be to set a novel and dangerous precedent. If the special agreement is available at all it sounds in <em>damages, </em>and should be sued on <em>at law. </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>67, 80, <em>Stewart vs. Redditt. </em>More especially should it not be extended in favor of such a consideration as is here alleged, viz., <em>the support of the gt'antor for life. </em>The policy of our law is to discourage all impediments or restraints upon the <em>free alienation </em>of real property. Now it is obvious, that land incumbered with a charge or trust like this, is to that extent fettered and made virtually inalienable so long, at least, as the life or lives charged upon it continue in being. If land could be thus charged with the life support of the grantor, it could on the same principle be encumbered with the lives of his whole family, including infants even <em>in ventre. </em>If parties wish to make such an arrangement, let them reduce the terms of it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>writing, instead of trusting to <em>hearsay </em>and <em>loose declarations, </em>and then let them place it upon public record in the authentic form of a mortgage. To sustain our views in this particular we rely upon 8 <em>Leigh., 522, Brawley vs. Cairon. </em>13 <em>Grattan, </em>615, <em>McCandlish vs. Keen. </em>6 <em>Conn., </em>458, <em>Meigs vs. Dimock. </em>8 <em>Barb., 552, McKillip vs. </em>McKillip; 29 <em>Miss.

That the evidence excepted to, tended to prove a <em>different consideration </em>from that set <em>forth in the bill of complaint, </em>and was therefore inadmissible. 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>459, <em>Mundorff vs. Kilbourn. </em>This case is altogether different from <em>Drury vs. Conner, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 288. The question here is not simply as to the <em>extent of the relief. </em>It might be very material to consider, whether the consideration to be proved by parol, was of the same nature and simply <em>additional </em>to that in the deed, or whether it is not in fact offered as a <em>substitute for, </em>and therefore in <em>contradiction of, </em>the moneyed consideration expressed in the deed, (the case made out by the proof.) 1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>186, <em>Betts vs. The Union Bank.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">5th. But whether this testimony was admissible or not, the whole fabric of the complainant\u2019s case is demolished by the positive testimony of <em>Isaac Bell, </em>who proves that the consideration slated in the deed, was, <em>in point of fact, </em>fully paid and satisfied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>Alexander H.

The consideration of one thousand dollars is acknowledged, in the deed, to have been paid; and there is endorsed thereon a receipt to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">It is alleged, in the bill, that the real consideration was eighteen hundred dollars, as it was estimated, that is to say, one thousand thereof to be paid in money, and the balance by boarding and maintaining the grantor; but there is no reason shown why this part of the consideration was not mentioned in the deed. This statement in the bill is not sustained by evidence; but the complainant\u2019s witnesses prove that Jesse Beil admitted to them that the true consideration was six hundred dollars in money, and that he was to support his father during the residue of his life. Evidence was also offered that the consideration, with exception of the maintenance, had been paid. The court below adopted the admissions of Jesse Bell, as to the consideration, and decreed payment accordingly, after allowing the defendants credit for the use and occupation of the land, which was in possession of the grantor from a short time after the deed until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The acknowledgment and receipt for the purchase money being only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of payment, <em>(Higdon vs. </em>Thomas, <em>1 H. &amp; G., </em>139,) the appellee seeks to rebut the presumption, by showing the pecuniary condition of Jesse Bell, his inability to have paid so large a sum of money, and admissions made by him, that he had not paid for the land. We consider the evidence sufficient, laying out of view the testimony of Isaac Bell, on which very little, if any, reliance can be placed. We do not intimate that this witness stands impeached, but we think he must have been in error as to the matters of which he speaks, touching this alleged payment. There is confusion in his testimony which cannot be reconciled with the idea that Jesse Bell ever paid this money, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>he admitted, to the other witnesses, that he had not paid it. This view of.the case is supported by other circumstances proved in the record. If he had paid for the land, we do not suppose he would have left it, and remained away until the time of his death, allowing the grantor to remain in possession, while he was toiling elsewhere for the support of his family. On the contrary, he said he had left the place, that he and his father could not live together, and that he wished him to pay the expense of the deeds, and take the land back.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The purchase money being due, we are to consider what it was, and how its payment can be enforced. Bills of this kind are of the nature of those for specific performance of contracts. <em>Elysville Co. vs. Okisko Co., 5 Md. Rep., 152. </em>There ought to be certainty.in the agreement, and it should be proved as alleged in pleading. 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>480, <em>Canal Co., vs. Young. </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>459, <em>Mundorff vs. Kilbourn. 5 Md. Rep., </em>18, <em>Stoddert vs. Bowie's Exc'r. </em>Here the bill relies upon one consideration, the proof shows another, while the deed states one different from both these. We have only the declarations of the grantor, as made in the bill, and those of the grantee, as proved by witnesses. If the statement in the bill were thus established, we should merely have to decide whether admissions by the parties of the same consideration, should prevail over the deed; but here they do not agree. Solemn instruments are not to be lightly dealt with. They are supposed to furnish the best evidence of the mind of the parlies, though, in some cases, they will be allowed to have effect against their literal meaning; or rather, a different agreement will be enforced, as where fraud or mistake is alleged and proved, which is not the predicament of these parties. The deed, for aught that appears, was drawn as it was designed to be, but the allegation is, that something beyond the sum stated was intended as an additional consideration. If the bill states the transaction correctly, then the parties did not assent to the same thing. Probably board and maintenance of the grantor was part of the agreement; but the question is, whether it was additional to, or part of, the money consideration ? This latter idea, perhaps, Jesse Bell meant to convey when he conversed with his brothers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>But, independently of the want of certainty as to the consideration, if we look to the grantor\u2019s statement in the bill, contradicted as it is by Jesse Bell\u2019s, relief could not be decreed on the proof of the grantee\u2019s admissions, because the bill is not framed upon that state of case, and the admissibility of these admissions has been excepted to, whilst there is n\u00f3 exception to the deed as evidence. Now, differing as the parties to the deed appear to have done, as to the parol consideration, and there being no evidence of either statement, even if such were admissible to control the deed, on which point we express no opinion, we think the written expression of the parties, about which there can be no mistake, should be accepted as the safest guide. By this standard of proof we shall avoid the risk of violating the policy of the law as to written and parol evidence, and, probably, reach the justice of the case as nearly as if either the view of the grantor or grantee were adopted as to the consideration. It thus becomes unnecessary to determine whether the board and maintenance claimed, can be recovered as additional to the consideration contained in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Next, as to the claim itself, that is, whether it be a lien or not. The record shows that Jesse Beil\u2019s personal estate has been administered, and that the balance in the hands of the administratrix, after paying the others, was not sufficient to \u2022 pay this claim. As that balance was distributed to the widow and children, we may suppose there are no other creditors except this complainant. We are, therefore, relieved from considering the preference of such a claim, for unpaid purchase money, over creditors becoming such after the deed is placed upon record. That it is a lien as against the vendee and those claiming under her, has been affirmed in England, and recognized by the Court of Appeals, in <em>Schnebly vs. Ragan, 7 G. &amp; J., </em>120, where it is said: <em>\u201cA </em>vendor parting with the legal title, still retains-his lien as a security for the payment of the purchase money, and the vendee holds the land as trustee for the vendor. <em>Prima facie </em>the equitable lien exists, and it lies upon the vendee to show a waiver of it. 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>308. So, on the other hand, if the purchaser of an estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>prematurely pays the purchase money, before the estate is convejred to him, the money will be considered as a lien on the estate in the hands of the vendor, for the vendee, or, in case of his death, for his personal representatives. 2 <em>Madd. Ch., </em>104, 105.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We dissent from the decree, in so far as it affirms the correctness of the auditor\u2019s account, as to the amount allowed the complainants, which, as we have said, should have been charged against the defendants at one thousand dollars, with interest, crediting them with the annual valuation of the premises while in possession of the grantor, upon which, as allowed by the auditor, no point was made at the hearing, and we take it to be according to the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As the personal estate appears to have been settled, this claim may be paid out of the proceeds of the land, without remarshalling the assets, thereby saving expense without affecting the ultimate result. Generally, the lien could not be enforced until the remedy against the personalty had been exhausted, but here the interests of the defendants will be consulted by looking at once to the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Without reversing the decree, the cause will be remanded, in order that another account may be taken as to the amount due, and for further proceedings under the decree. <em>Act of </em>1832, <em>ch. </em>302, <em>sec. </em>6. Each party to pay his own costs on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>Cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
