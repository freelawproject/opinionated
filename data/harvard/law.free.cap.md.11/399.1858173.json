There is no dispute as to title, the controversy being whether the land in question is embraced in the <em>tim'd </em>exception, contained in a deed to Carroll from the Union Bank of Maryland, dated the 30th of October 1844. This deed conveys to Carroll part of a tract of land called '\u201cWest Ilchester,\u201d by metes and bounds, which include the land in dispute, but from the operation of that deed three parcels are <em>excepted, </em>the third <em>exception </em>being as follows: \u201cThirdly, saving and excepting a small part of the said piece or parcel of land hereinbefore firstly conveyed, upon which, the rolling mill improvements now in part stand.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">The defendant pleaded <em>non </em>cul, on which issue was joined, and took defence according to pretensions, as they shall appear to be laid down on the return of the warrant of resurvey. At the trial the plaintiff stated his pretensions, and the defendant took defence. The question thus raised was, whether the plaintiff had truly located this <em>third exception </em>in the deed, or whether its true location is not the land for which the defendant took defence ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\"><em>1st </em>and 3rd <em>Exceptions. </em>The plaintiff proved by William Dawson and George Ellicott, that they knew the lines which separated the land of the granite company from that of the plaintiff, and that when the workmen were digging the foundations of the granite factory, they informed the workmen and Mr. Lansdale, the company\u2019s agent, that they were over their lines and on Carroll\u2019s land, both said witnesses having previously stated that they were not at the time of this conversation, the agents of Carroll, nor authorised by him to make such statements. To the admissibility of which evidence, as to what was said by these witnesses, to the workmen and agent, the defendant objected, which objections the court (Price, J.) sustained, and to these rulings the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>The plaintiff, for the purpose of proving the position and character of the <em>coke oven, </em>asked of Evan T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Ellicott, whether he was not well acquainted with the lands described on the plats, and had not been sworn on the survey and examined as a witness to the <em>run-out furnace, </em>and whether he did not know from his knowledge of the grounds and the improvements thereon, and their relation to said furnace, where the said <em>coke oven </em>stood, and what was its character and condition? The defendant objected to the witness being examined in relation to said <em>oven, </em>on the ground that he had not been examined on the survey, as to the spot where it had stood, nor had his attention been called thereto. This objection the court sustained and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\"><em>4\u00a1th Exception. </em>(The evidence given in this exception is sufficiently stated in the opinion of this court.) Upon this evidence the plaintiff asked the court to instruct the jury, that if they find from the evidence, that the outer boundaries of the. deed from the Union Bank, are truly located in the plaintiff\u2019s first location, and that the rolling mill house is truly located, and that it stands in part upon the small piece of 1 and described in the plats and explanations as, &amp;c., then the plaintiff is entitled to recover according to his pretensions, and in conformity with the true construction of said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">The defendant also asked an instruction, that if the jury find that <em>the improvements </em>offered in evidence were made by the owners of the rolling mill, and were used in connection therewith, and that at the date of the deed from the Union Bank to Carroll, the said improvements stood upon the land for which the defendant has taken defence, then, by the true construction of said deed, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-7\">The court rejected the plaintiffs prayer, and granted that of the defendant, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\"><em>5th Exception. </em>The plaintiff then, upon the evidence contained in the fourth exception, asked the following instructions to.the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">2nd. If the jury find, from the evidence, the facts stated in the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer, and also that the filling up and wharfing of the ground between the .margin of the stream and Carroll\u2019s eastern line, was made for the purpose of protecting the dam of the owners of mills below from injury, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>washing of ashes and cinders into the mill-pool, and when the bank was thus made, it was occasionally used by the owners of the rolling mills as a place of deposit for scrap iron and other refuse, when the mills were in operation, and that, at the date of the deed to Carroll, the use of the rolling mill was, and had been from the year 1841, abandoned, and the establishment as a rolling mill entirely broken up as stated in the evidence, then they are at liberty to find that the plaintiff\u2019s location of the third exception in said deed is the only true one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-5\">3rd. If the jury believe tile testimony of George Ellicott, and find therefrom that there were three mills, two of which were near to, and the other in part stood upon, a small piece of land embraced in the lines of the deed to the plaintiff, and that the upper or northern mill, alone, was called and known by the name of the rolling mill, in contradistinction to the others, and was separated from them upwards of thirty feet, and not under the same roof, and find from the evidence, that it was this rolling mill which in part stood within the lines of said deed, then, according to the true construction of the terms, \u201crolling mill improvements\u201d therein used, they refer only to the improvements connected with that mill, and cannot be referred to those connected with the other two mills; that there is a distinction between one and three; and that only one rolling mill improvements are mentioned in the third exception of said deed, and that the improvements of the three mills cannot be embraced in these terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">4th. That it was the province of the jury, in considering the facts referred to in the defendant\u2019s prayer, and if they believe from the evidence, that at the date of said deed, the logs on the wharf had rotted away, and that the coking furnace had become a mere ruin, so as to encumber the ground with a heap of rubbish, which was not removed because it would not pay the expense thereof, and that all use of the coke furnace had ceased, because of its worthlessness and decay, ten years before said deed, and all use of the wharf had also ceased several years before said deed, then it is for the jury to say, whether they were existing improvements or not at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>date of said deed, and if they find that they did not exist as improvements at the date, then the jury are not bound to find for the defendants, though they may find from the evidence that said wharf and coke oven were, in long years past, originally put there by the owners of the rolling mills, and used in connection therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">The court rejected each and all of these prayers, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-6\"><em>6th Exception. </em>While the case was under argument before the jury, the counsel for the defendant offered the following \u2022prayer, tobe added as a qualification of his first prayer: That any structure made by the expenditure of labor or money, by the owners of the rolling mills, on the property in controversy, intended to make the same more useful or valuable, and actually used in connection therewith, and visible to the eye, at the date of the deed from the Union Bank to Qarroll, are improvements within the true construction of said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-7\">This prayer the court granted, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted, and the verdict and judgment being in favor of the defendant, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

The principles governing its interpretation, are \u2022 1st. That every word in it should be so construed as to have its full meaning and application, and no more. <em>Wigram\u2019s </em>Maxims, 10, in <em>2 Lib. of Law &amp; Eq. </em>4 <em>Barn. &amp; Adol., </em>799, <em>Richardson vs. Watson. 2nd. </em>That <em>if </em>the <em>language of </em>the exception be doubtful, it ought to be construed most strongly against the grantor, and most favorably to the grantee. Even to the extent of permitting the grantee to elect under which construction he will claim. 12 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>383, <em>Bullen vs. Denning. 2 H. &amp; J., </em>112, <em>Hall vs. Gittings. </em>3 <em>Johns., </em>375, <em>Jackson vs. Hudson. </em>With these principles in view it is insisted, that this exception is confined to that small triangular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>piece of land within the outlines of Carroll\u2019s deed, on which the stone walls and building of the rolling mill stand now, and stood at the date of the deed. The words are, \u201csaving and excepting a small part,\u201d that is <em>one, </em>not <em>two </em>or <em>three </em>small <em>parts. </em>Again, \u201con which the <em>roiling </em>mill\u201d (in the <em>singular) </em>\u201cimprovements\u201d stand. There were <em>three separate </em>structures, one called the <em>\u201crolling mill,\u201d </em>another the slitting mill, and a third the puddling mill, and the whole were collectively known as the <em>\u201crolling </em>mills,\u201d <em>(in the,plural.) </em>When, therefore, the term <em>\u201crolling mill,\u201d </em>is used in this deed in the <em>singular, </em>if must mean the <em>separate building </em>which was known by that name, and not the <em>three </em>which were known as the <em>\u201crolling mills.\u201d </em>This is also more clear from the fact, that in another part of this same deed the <em>\u201cslitting mill\u201d </em>is spoken of, thus recognising a distinction between that mill and the \u201crolling mill,\u201d and showing that the grantor knew the difference between the two. Again, \u201con which the rolling mill improvements in part <em>stand. </em>\u201d An improvement, therefore, to come within this description must be <em>standing, </em>that is, <em>erected, elevated, </em>existing, and used at the date of the deed. If these views are correct, it follows, that the prayers on the part of the plaintiff should have been granted, and those of the defendant rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-5\">2nd. The witness, Ellicott, who was sworn and examined on the survey, though not then examined as to the <em>coke oven, </em>was competent to prove its location, or was, <em>at least, </em>competent to prove its <em>character </em>and <em>condition. </em>5 <em>Md.

Rep., </em>582, <em>Pegg vs. Warford.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-7\">3rd. It is also insisted, that the evidence offered in the <em>first </em>and <em>third </em>exceptions ought to have been admitted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-8\"><em>John Prentiss Poe </em>and <em>Geo. W. Dobbin, </em>for the.appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-9\">1st. This action is to recover a small piece of land, of no great importance to the plaintiff but of vast moment to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>fendant; for if the plaintiff\u2019s construction of the exception in this deed is sustained, it will compel the company to takedown the wall of a large stone factory, which they have recently built, and cripple, if not entirely break up their establishment. What then is the meaning of this exception ? The <em>intent </em>of parties is the cardinal rule in the construction of this, as of all other written instruments. This reservation was undoubtedly made <em>for the benefit </em>of the Granite Manufacturing Company. It excepts from the grant previously made \u201ca small <em>part.\u201d </em>\u201cA <em>part\u201d </em>means <em>less than the whole, </em>and does not always imply <em>singularity. </em>As for instance: \u201cI give my son <em>a part </em>of my estate,\u201d which may consist of <em>several parcels, </em>and such a gift of <em>\u201ca </em>part\u201d can mean nothing more than <em>less than the whole, </em>and would be <em>a part </em>of each of the several parcels of which the estate consisted. But again, this <em>part </em>is to contain <em>\u201cimprovements,\u201d </em>more than <em>one </em>of course. The several mills all constituted <em>one establishment, </em>known as the \u201croiling <em>mills,\u201d </em>and the exception is of that part on which the \u201crolling mill <em>improvements,\u2019\u2019 </em>that is, the <em>improvements used </em>in connection with the entire establishment. The word, <em>\u201cimprovements,\u201d </em>must be stricken out, if the construction on the other side is to prevail. By the conveyance of a <em>\u201cmill,\u201d </em>not only the land on which the building stands, but that <em>adjacent thereto, </em>so far as necessary to its use, and commonly used with it, will pass by implication, and the same rule prevails in construing an exception in a grant. 13 <em>Metcalf, </em>114, <em>Forbush vs. Lombard. </em>See also 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise, </em>265, and <em>note. </em>1 <em>Sumner, </em>500, <em>United States vs. Appleton. </em>15 <em>Maine, </em>218, <em>Maddox vs. Goddard. </em>16 <em>Maine, </em>63, <em>Moore vs. Fletcher. </em>We insist, therefore, that the true construction of this exception is that embodied in the prayers which were granted by the court below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-5\">2nd. The testimony of Dawson and Ellicott, set out in the <em>first </em>and <em>third </em>exceptions, was clearly inadmissible, because it was <em>irrelevant. </em>The fact that these witnesses made such statements to the workmen, could not alter the rights of the parties as they stood, upon the true construction of this deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-6\">3rd. The testimony of Ellicott in the <em>second </em>exception, as to the <em>location </em>of the <em>coke oven, </em>was properly excluded, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>was not examined, nor had his attention been drawn to it on the ground, and its precise location constituted one of the main points in controversy. 8 Gill, 98, <em>Mitchell vs. Mitchell. </em>1 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>444, <em>Wall vs. Forbes.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-5\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The record in this case presents for our consideration two questions of evidence; these form the subject of the first, second, and third bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In the first and third exceptions, the plaintiff offered to prove by William Dawson and by George Ellicott, that when the foundations of the granite factory were being dug, they informed Lansdale, the agent of the manufacturing company, and the workmen engaged in digging, that they were over their lines and on Mr. Carroll\u2019s land; both the witnesses stated that they were not Carroll\u2019s agents, nor authorised by him to make such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In our opinion this evidence was properly rejected by the court. It was the declarations of third parties, strangers to the matter, and mere volunteers; and the evidence, if admitted, could not in any manner properly affect the issues in the cause, and was therefore properly rejected as irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The second exception is taken to the ruling of the circuit court, in sustaining the defendants\u2019 objection to a question propounded by the plaintiff to the witness, Evan T. Ellicott. The witness was called upon to state \u201cwhere the coke oven stood, and what was its character and condition ?\u201d He was clearly imcompelent to prove the <em>location </em>of the \u201ccoke oven,\u201d because it does not appear from the plats and explanations, that he had pointed out to the surveyor the object located, as to which he was called to testify.\u201d <em>Mitchell vs. Mitchell, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>102. See <em>Dorsey on Ejectment, </em>62.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">But it is contended by the appellant, that it was competent for the witness to testify as to the character and condition of the coke oven, and that a part of the question being legal, it was error to sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">In <em>Whiteford vs. Burckmyer &amp; Adams, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>140, the court say: \u201cNor do we think, where a question is proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>to be asked of a witness, which involves several distinct members, the courtis bound to select from it such members as might be admissible, if unaccompanied by others with which it is . connected, and say that such particular portions of the testimony are proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We concur in that opinion, and think that the court, when called on to determine the legality of a question propounded to a witness under oral examination, must decide upon it in its entirety. The obligation rests upon the counsel propounding the question, to show that it is free from legal objection, and the <em>onus </em>does not rest either upon the court or the party objecting, to separate that part of it which may be legal from that which is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">After evidence has been admitted, and an application is made to the court to exclude it, then the <em>onus </em>rests upon the party making the application, to confine his objection to that portion of the evidence which is illegal. And the same rule applies when an offer is made of a mass of evidence, complex in its character, and the whole of it is objected to. In such case, if any part of it be admissible, it is error to exclude the whole. This principle is established by the case of <em>Budd vs. Brooke, 3 Gill, 220. See Waters vs. Dashiell, </em>1 <em>Md. </em>Rep., 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Without expressing any opinion, therefore, as to the legality of any part of the question propounded to the witness, it is sufficient for the purposes of the exception to say, that a part of it being illegal, it was properly overruled by tire circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">This brings us to the questions raised by the prayers, and presented in the 4th, 5th and 6th bills of exceptions. These involve the construction of the <em>third exception, or reservation </em>in \u25a0 the deed under which the plaintiff claims, which is in these words: <em>\u201c Thirdly,, saving and excepting a small part of the said piece or parcel of land hereinbefore firstly conveyed, upon which the rolling mill improvements now in part stand.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">It is a concession in the cause, and the proof shows, that the piece of land in dispute is embraced within the\u2019 lines of the property conveyed to the plaintiff, and unless it is covered by the exception, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>'The land excepted is \u201ca small part\u201d (of the piece or parcel firstly conveyed,) \u201cupon which the rolling mill improvements now in part stand.\u201d There is evidence in the cause that there were three mills, which, were separate structures standing several feet apart, the most northern of these was the rolling mill proper, in which alone the rolling of iron was performed, the others were the puddling mill and the slitting mill, and the whole together were commonly called <em>The Rolling Mills.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The rolling mill proper, stood in part upon the land covered by the plaintiff\u2019s deed, on the small triangular piece designated on the plat by the letters ABC. This piece of ground is conceded by the plaintiff to be within the exception, and on ilia part it is contended, that by the true construction of the clause, its intent is thereby fully gratified, and that the defendant cannot claim any other piece as within the exception; Fust, because only one piece is excepted; and secondly, because the exception is confined to the part, whereon the building itself, called the rolling mill was erected. Neither of these positions is sound. The exception is not of one piece of ground, but it is of a part of what had before been conveyed; and if it be shown by the evidence, that the rolling mill improvements in fact, stood in part on several distinct and separate pieces of the land firstly conveyed, then each piece would be fairly within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The term, <em>\u201ca part,''\u2019\u2019 </em>has reference to quantity, as loss than the whole, and properly construed, is not to be taken as meaning necessarily that the part excepted is in one piece or parcel. This is the usual and ordinary signification of the word; as when we say a part of Maryland is sandy, we are not to be understood as meaning that the sandy portion is to be found in one integral piece or parcel of the State\u2019s surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Nor is the exception to be confined to the ground actually occupied by the building, which was the roiling mill proper. The words are, <em>\u201crolling mill </em>improvementsthough the three mills were separate structures, there is evidence showing that they were all under the same management, had the same payroll, and were used in performing different parts of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>process. The slitting mill and puddling mill prepared the iron for the rolling mill. \u201cThe iron went into one end of the establishment crude, and was carried through the various stages of manufacture through the others, before it was turned out as the completed article,\u201d and the whole was commonly known as \u201cThe Rolling Mills.\u201d Nor do we think that the true construction of the clause in question, confines its limits to the ground actually occupied or covered by the buildings called the Rolling Mills. It is more extensive, and embraces all the ground covered by any improvement connected with the rolling mills, and necessary or convenient for. their use, and actually used in connexion therewith. This might embrace not only the three mills, but also the coke furnace and wharf, with the intervening ground, if the evidence showed them to be rolling mill improvements in the sense in which we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It seems to us, that no more correct exposition of the law governing the construction of the clause in the deed could be given, than is found in the instructions given to the jury by the circuit court, and stated in the fourth and sixth bills of exceptions, they were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u201cIf the jury find the facts stat\u00e9d in the agreement of counsel, and that the improvements offered in evidence were made by the owners of The Rolling Mills, and were used in connection therewith, and that at the date of the deed from the Union Bank to Carroll, the said improvements stood upon the land for which the defendant has taken defence, then, by the true construction of said deed, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d \u201cAnd that any structure made by the expenditure of . labor or money by the owners of The Rolling Mills, on the property in controversy, intended to make the same more useful or valuable, and actually used in connection therewith, and visible to the eye at the date of the deed from the Union Bank to Carroll, are improvements within the true construction of said deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The principle announced in these instructions is sustained by an unbroken current of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">See <em>Whitney vs. Olney others, </em>3 <em>Mason, </em>280. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>13 <em>Metcalf, </em>114, the court say: \u201cThe rule of construction is well established, that by ihe grant of a mill, the land under the mill and adjacent thereto, so far as necessary to its use and commonly used with it, will pass by implication. And the same rule of construction applies to an exception in a grant.\u201d See also 15 <em>Maine, </em>218. 16 <em>Ibid, </em>63. 3 <em>New Hamp., </em>190.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The views we have expressed are not in conflict with the rule of law, that, in the construction of deeds, they must be taken most strongly against the grantor, and in favor of the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">This principle has been invoked by the appellant in support of bis construction, and there is certainly no one better established. But that rule is only to be resorted to, when the words of the deed are doubtful in their meaning, or susceptible of more than one construction. In this case, we consider the words of the exception in the deed are free from uncertainty, and admit of but one interpretation. One more objection urged by the appellant in the argument remains to be considered. It is contended, that no improvements are meant by the deed, except such as were erected or elevated, and that it does not refer to such as had been abandoned, and were fallen into dilapidation and decay, or which were merely spread upon tire surface for the purpose of filling up the wharf, or making the yard and ground, adjacent to the mills, more fit for the use and convenience of their occupiers. This argument is based upon the use of the words, <em>\u201cnow stand, </em>\u201d in the deed. To our minds the argument appears more ingenious than solid. The word <em>standing, </em>often signifies placed or situated; thus we say London stands on the Thames. And, in the clause before us, such we consider to be its true meaning. Of the land conveyed, that part is within the exception, whereon any of the rolling mill improvements then were situated, or placed, or remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">What has been said, dispenses with the necessity of a more particular notice of the several prayers offered by the plaintiff below. We concur in the propriety of their rejection by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-11\">Ecclbston, <em>J., </em>dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
