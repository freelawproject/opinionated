It has been objected that the <em>wife </em>was <em>not a party to </em>the <em>first </em>deed, and that there is no evidence of her acceptance in writing of the <em>second. </em>To this we reply that it is not necessary the wife should be a party; if she accepted the second deed it was binding both upon her and her husband, and that she did <em>accept </em>it is established by the facts that it was <em>acknowledged </em>and <em>recorded, </em>which formalties are <em>prima facie </em>evidence of every thing necessary <em>to its validity; </em>they import <em>delivery </em>and <em>acceptance. </em>Again, it has been objected to this <em>second </em>deed that it does not provide a <em>trustee </em>to hold the legal title and continue the trust. The reply to this is, that a <em>feme covert </em>may have a separate estate in <em>personalty, </em>(which is the kind of property here in dispute,) without the intervention of a trustee; the <em>husband </em>will in Such cases be treated in equity as trustee for the wife. 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., secs. </em>976, 1380. 3 <em>Md.

That the husband, James Hooper, after the execution of the second deed of February 1837, had no power or control whatever over this estate, and that the deed to Weems and wife, of November 1843, executed by him alone, cannot operate upon -this estate in any way, and need not be considered by this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-8\"><em>N.

Now in regard to these deeds we insist: 1st. That the deed to Bowen, of February 1837, executed by the <em>husband alone, </em>to which the wife was <em>not a parly </em>is a mere <em>voluntary conveyance, </em>without mutuality, and with no <em>valuable consideration </em>passing from the wife to the husband therefor, <em>(Lewin on trust, </em>22, 489, 499,) and the husband is only bound by it to the <em>extent </em>of the interest he thereby parted with.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">2nd. That this deed gives the wife entire control of the personal property in question, <em>during </em>coverture, and the power on certain conditions of disposing of it by last will and testament in case of her surviving her husband, but clearly makes <em>no provision </em>'in reference thereto, in the event of the <em>husband surviving her, </em>which has occurred. 4 <em>Yerger, </em>435, <em>Morgan vs. Elam.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7r\">3rd. That a married woman has no power over her separate estate, but what is expressly given her by the settlement, and as this deed provides only for the dominion of the wife over the personalty during coverture, and conditionally in case of her surviving her husband, and makes no provision whatever for the event of the husband\u2019s surviving, upon the death of the wife the rights of the husband suspended during coverture are <em>revived, </em>and at his death the property goes to <em>his legal representatives. </em>2 <em>Kent's Com., </em>164, 166, <em>note (a.) </em>65 <em>Law </em>Lib., 370. 6 G. &amp; J., 349, <em>Ward vs. Thompson. </em>1 <em>Md.

That this deed is void, because the wife was not a party to it, and there is no <em>proof </em>of its <em>delivery, </em>nor is there any evidence of its acceptance. It does not come within that class of deeds which are presumed to be <em>accepted </em>because of <em>being beneficial </em>on their face. (12 <em>Johns., </em>421, <em>Jackson vs. Phipps. </em>2 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., sec. </em>297.) It is a deed coupled with <em>conditions, </em>that the property shall be responsible for the wife\u2019s debts, and that she will abandon her dower and thirds, and is, therefore, <em>prejudicial </em>to the interests of the wife upon its face; but we need not prove that it is so prejudicial, it is for the other side to prove that it was beneficial. 4 <em>Mason, </em>207, <em>Halsey vs. Whitney. </em>20 <em>Johns., </em>187, <em>Jackson vs. Bodle. </em>5 <em>Conn., </em>300, <em>Camp vs. Camp.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">5th. That the <em>second </em>deed of February 1837 cannot avail the complainants. It is clear from all the authorities before cited, that a <em>feme covert </em>can only dispose of her separate estate, in pursuance of the terms of the instrument settling it upon her. <em>(Lewin on Trusts, </em>498, 499.) Now this <em>first </em>deed, if valid, clothes the trustee with a trust and a <em>power to </em>convey, as the wife <em>shall direct, </em>during coverture; in other words, it creates a trust with a power in the wife annexed. This <em>second </em>deed contains no <em>direction </em>by the wife; she is not a party <em>grantor </em>in it, and did not assent to it <em>in writing; </em>nor is there any thing in the deed itself, or in the record, showing her <em>assent </em>to it in <em>any' manner; </em>whioh assent must be manifested in a <em>clear </em>and <em>distinct manner, </em>and without such assent neither she nor her husband can be bound by its provisions. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as a proper execution of the <em>power </em>vested in the trustee by the first deed. Again, it provides <em>no trustee </em>to hold the legal title, the <em>husband was no party to it, </em>and it cannot, therefore, bind him, and in fact it <em>destroys </em>and <em>extinguishes </em>the <em>trusts </em>created by the first deed. Finally, it only professes to convey the property subject to <em>all </em>the <em>provisions </em>and <em>conditions </em>contained in the first deed, and can, therefore, have no other or greater effect than that deed had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">6th. The complainants are, therefore, compelled to resort to the deed Of November 1843, to Weems and wife, which they have proved was executed with the <em>assent of the wife, </em>she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>being present and advising its execution, as in <em>pursuance of the trusts </em>of the <em>first deed, </em>and under this deed the complainants must rest their claim. If driven to this deed the cas\u00e9is at an end, for upon all the authorities, it gives to the wife <em>no such interest </em>as the appellants now set up. <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>424. 65 <em>Law Lib., </em>364, <em>(marg.) </em>66 <em>Do., </em>290, 297, 298, <em>(marg.,) </em>in addition to the cases already cited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-4\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The deed from Hooper to Bowen of the 10th of February 1837, shows a plain intent to restore to his wife the property she owned at the time of the marriage, \u201cso that the same might be for her exclusive use and benefit, as though she were a <em>ferns sole;\u201d </em>and this design is further indicated by the provision, that in the event mentioned in the deed it should pass to \u201cher legal heirs and representatives in the same manner as if they had never been married.\u201d Words better adapted to the purpose of divesting himself of the title could not have been employed; subject, however, to the conditions that the property should be answerable for her debts, and that she should not set up any claim to his estate if she survived her husband. \u201cTechnical words are not necessary to create a separate use, but adequate language must be employed in making a gift of this kind to manifest a decided intention to transfer a separate interest, to show that the husband was not to enjoy what the law would otherwise give him.\u201d And the effect may be produced \u201cwithout the interposing office of a trustee.\u201d <em>Carroll vs. </em>Lee, 3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>504.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This deed, however, did not make any provision for the event of her dying first, without disposing of the property as authorized by its terms; and if tire deed from Bowen to Mrs. Hooper, of the same date with the other, had not been executed, and Mrs. Hooper had died without exercising that power in any other manner, the title to the personal property would have been restored to James Hooper. This is very clear according to the adjudged cases. <em>Stewart vs. Stewart, </em>7 <em>John. Ch. Rep., </em>229. <em>Pickett vs. Chilton, </em>5 <em>Munf., </em>467. <em>Ward vs. Thompson, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>349. <em>Waters vs. Tazewell, </em>9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>291.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>But the wife having, as alleged by the appellants, made an appointment by \"requiring the trustee to execute the second deed, the appeal must be determined by the construction and effect of that instrument, because as James Hooper gave authority to dispose of the property, her acts in that regal'd must bind those claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In the case of <em>Marshall vs. </em>Beall, 6 <em>Howard, </em>70, the court decided in favor of the wife\u2019s title, because it appeared by the deeds under consideration, \u201cthat the intention of the parties was, to carry the title of the fund beyond the period of the wife\u2019s death, and to exclude the husband.\u201d And this principle was recognized as a test in the cases of <em>Waters vs. Tazewell, </em>9 <em>Md. Rep., </em>291; and <em>Townshend vs. Matthews, </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., 251. </em>It is true, that in those cases, and in <em>Ward vs. Thompson, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>349, the use or separate estate was created for the wife, her executors, administrators and assigns, free from the control of the husband, whereas in the deed from James Hooper it is not so conveyed. But as we are dealing with the intention of the parties, and this is to be gathered from the whole language employed, and not by resorting merely to technical terms, we are not to narrow the construction on account of the absence of words of limitation, but must give such effect to others, if they manifest a design to extend the title beyond the wife\u2019s death. And this we think appears, not only from the words already quoted from the recital in the deed, but also from the trustee\u2019s power to dispose of the property in any manner she might direct during the coverture, the power to make a testamentary disposition; and if she survived the husband the limitation to her heirs and representatives, in the same manner as if the parties had never been married. The wife, in neither of the cases referred to, could have exercised much greater power over the property than was conferred upon Mrs. Hooper by the deed of her husband. If, therefore, the second deed passed the title beyond the period of Mrs. Hooper\u2019s death, the effect must be to exclude the marital rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">By this conveyance Mrs; Hooper took the property \u201cfor her sole use and benefit during her natural life, and after her death, (in c\u00e1se she should not dispose of the same by last will and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>testament,) to her heirs and legal representatives,\u201d subject to the conditions mentioned in the first deed. We think this instrument also shows an intention on the part of the wife, who alone had the power to direct the disposal of the property, that her title should extend beyond her death, to the exclusion of the husband. She might have so directed by her will, which, we need scarcely remark, could not have operated before that period, and in default of a will the ultimate enjoyment of the properly was provided for in such a manner, that the husband could not have participated therein under either of the designations employed. If there had been no limitation after her death the property would have gone to the husband by virtue of the marriage, because his rights are not to be defeated, unless there be an intent to that effect, and when the words, \u00bf\u00ednext of kin, heirs, representatives\u201d are used in settlements of this kind, to designate the persons who are to take at the wife\u2019s death, they are generally construed as having been so employed for the purpose of barring the husband. <em>Stewart vs. Stewart, </em>7 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>and this construction was adopted in <em>Waters vs. Tazewell, </em>as to the deeds then under consideration. We cannot doubt that such was the object of this second deed. James Hooper manifestly intended by his deed to restore to his wife the property which he had acquired by the marriage, and she, in execution of the power conferred by him, itad it conveyed to herself by what, in equity, is deemed a separate estate, to be enjoyed by herself during life, and after-wards by a designated class, which, as we have said, does not include the husband. This must have been done for the purpose of defeating the title of the husband and of any persons claiming under him. The first deed looks to the husband\u2019s interest only to the extent of protecting him against the wife\u2019s debts, and any claim by her against his estate, as his widow; and the second deed secures to him the same interest and no greater. The appellee\u2019s construction would defeat, not only the purpose we have imputed to Mrs. Hooper, but the very object of James Hooper himself, as expressed in his own deed, by vesting in her the same title that she had before the marriage, and thereby subjecting the property to all the incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u25a0of the coverture, in the same manner as if the deeds had not been executed, whereas the design was that she should hold it in the same manner as if they had never been married.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In the case of <em>Ward vs. Thompson, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>349, the \u2022court allude to the clause of the marriage settlement by which the husband agreed that the wife should hold the property \u201cwithout the interference, in any manner, of the husband,\u201d but we do not consider that the case was decided on that clause alone, for the court had previously spoken of the effect of such deeds where \u201cthe ultimate disposition of the property in case \u2022of the wife\u2019s death without disposing thereof, in her lifetime, by last will and testament, or otherwise,\u201d is not provided for. In such cases, the court say, the property would go to the husband. It is fair to assume the court also meant, that where the ultimate enjoyment was provided for, as in this case,- the husband would not be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We place no reliance upon the circumstance that James Hooper afterwards attempted to dispose of the property by the deed of the 3rd of November 1843, as casting any light on the question of intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The deeds must interpret themselves without reference to the acts of the parties. <em>\u201cA </em>court cannot be aided in the construction of any agreement by the acts which the parties may have done under it, nor is a party bound by any construction which he may have put upon the instrument.\" <em>Ringgold\u2019s Case, 1 H. &amp; G., </em>74. He parted with his title by the first deed, and we do not perceive he acquired any interest after-wards on which his subsequent deed could operate.-</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">It was suggested in argument, that the second deed does not provide a trustee to hold the legal title. This assumes that the deed destroyed the trusts created by the first, which point we need not decide. But if this be the effect, it is clear, that a <em>feme covert </em>may have a separate estate in personalty, which is the kind of property in controversy here, without a trustee, in which case equity will treat the husband as trustee for her benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The objection that Mrs. Hooper did not assent in writing to this deed, and that neither she nor James Hooper were bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>by its provisions, carmot avail the appellee. The better practice in such cases is to make the wife a party by her written assent, but this is not. indispensable. If she accepted this deed that act would bind her as well as James Hooper. We must treat the deed as having been delivered to and accepted by her. It was acknowledged and recorded, and is, therefore, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of all circumstances necessary to give it validity. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>234. <em>Warner vs. Hardy, </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., 525. </em>In <em>Stewart vs. Redditt, </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>67, it was decided, that these formalities import delivery to the grantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The result of these views is, that the estate of James Hooper docs not embrace the property in question, and that the decree must be reversed and the cause remanded, under the act of 1832, ch. 302, sec. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
