The petition was submitted to the county superintendent of schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">On July 26, 1967, in compliance with a writ of mandamus issued by the. Court of Common Pleas for Jackson County, the county superintendent of schools delivered the petition to the county board of elections for the purpose of having the sufficiency of the signatures to said petition determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">On July 28, 1967, the board of elections returned the transfer petition to the county superintendent, with a certificate finding the signatures thereon to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">On August 10, 1967, the county superintendent presented the petition to the county board of education, which board refused to certify the petition to the board of elections to be placed on the ballot at the nest general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">On March 19, 1968, in compliance with a writ of mandamus issued by the Court of Appeals on March 4, 1968, the county board of education certified the transfer proposal to the board of elections to be placed on the ballot at the general election to be held on November 5, 1968. Prior to said election the respondents appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">While the cause was pending upon appeal, the election was held. The proposal was submitted only to the electors residing in what had formerly been the territory known as the Bloomfield Local School District, who voted to approve the transfer of that territory to the Jackson Citv district. The electors of the remaining portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>territory in the newly created district were not permitted to vote upon this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The electors of the Bloomfield district could have properly petitioned for the referendum against the proposed creation of the new district. Under the law, all the electors residing in the proposed new district would have been eligible to vote on that question. Under the petition, which proposed to transfer only that portion of the territory of the proposed new district which was the territory of the old Bloomfield district, the relators contend that only the electors residing in the territory of the old Bloomfield district were eligible to vote on the transfer under the provisions of Section 3311.231, Revised Code, and the Court of Appeals agreed with their position. Thus, only such electors were permitted to vote upon the issue when it was submitted at the election held November 5, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The relators contend that the effect of a favorable vote of only those electors of the territory, which was formerly the Bloomfield district, on the proposed transfer of territory overrides the county board\u2019s proposal for the creation of a new district which, under the provisions of Section 3311.26, could be overriden only by a referendum against that proposal, in which referendum all the electors residing in the new district are eligible to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The argument of the relators, that they ought to have the right to determine their own destiny, is not persuasive, because it is undisputed that these electors had the right, and ample time, to file their petition to transfer the territory of the Bloomfield district prior to the time the county board took its action creating a new district, and thus to have controlled their own destiny. In fact, they were encouraged to take such action as they might desire to take to control their own destiny. They chose to take no action. Their remedy, after the county board adopted its resolution creating the new district, was by referendum as provided for in Section 3311.26, Revised Code, or by a petition to transfer, which transfer proposal must be submitted to all. the electors of the territory in the newly created district.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">A proper interpretation of Sections 3311.26 and 3311.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>231, Revised Code, as applied to the facts in this case, is: (1) After the date upon which a proposal for the creation of a new district has been properly adopted by a county board of education, a referendum may be filed, pursuant to the provisions of Section 3311.26, against the proposed new district within 30 days, and all the electors of the proposed new district are eligible to vote upon such referendum; (2) where a petition for the transfer of a portion of the territory in such proposed new district is filed after the date upon which the resolution proposing to create the new district is adopted by the county board, and where no referendum against such proposed new district is filed within the required time, as provided in Section 3311.26, then all the electors of the newly created district are eligible to vote upon the petition for transfer according to the provisions of Section 3311.231.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed. The election which was held pursuant to the judgment and order of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-6\">Taft, C.
