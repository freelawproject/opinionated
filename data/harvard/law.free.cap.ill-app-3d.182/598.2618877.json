In these consolidated appeals defendant and codefendant contend that their joint representation was improper due to their counsel\u2019s conflict of interest; that counsel was incompetent; and that improper hearsay evidence was presented at trial. Codefendant raises an additional argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain her conviction.</p> <p id=\"b621-12\" pgmap=\"621\">The complainant was 13 years old in 1982 when she was adopted by defendant and codefendant. In 1984 she was living with them and several other children in a Chicago house. Complainant slept in an upstairs bedroom while defendant and codefendant had a bedroom on the first floor of the residence.</p> <p id=\"b621-13\" pgmap=\"621(105) 622(36)\">Complainant testified that about 9 p.m. on a date in April 1984 complainant was in her bedroom when codefendant called her and asked her to come downstairs. When complainant did, codefendant asked complainant to do her a favor as they both went into the first-floor bedroom. There complainant saw defendant lying naked on the bed. Codefendant then obstructed complainant\u2019s exit from the bedroom, removed complainant\u2019s clothes and forced complainant onto the bed, where defendant began to sexually molest complainant as codefendant disrobed. At one point complainant was lying on the bed between defendant and codefendant. Defendant eventually got on top of complainant and raped her as codefendant held one of complainant\u2019s hands telling complainant that she loved her. Codefendant then sexually molested complainant both in the bedroom and when complainant went into the bathroom shortly thereafter.</p> <p id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">Complainant told the accused\u2019s 19-year-old daughter of the occurrence but the latter did not believe her. Two weeks after the incident she addressed a letter, which was presented at trial, to her former foster mother explaining the occurrence, but she did not mail it. In June 1985 complainant left her adoptive parents\u2019 home after codefendant beat and tried to sexually molest her, and she returned to the home of her former foster mother, who notified police. She then gave police the letter.</p> <p id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">Chicago police officer Joseph Lux investigated the matter and on the evening of June 17, 1985, he arrested codefendant at her home upon serving her with a search warrant. After he advised codefendant of her Miranda rights, she waived those rights and told Officer Lux that she was present when defendant had consensual intercourse with complainant. Officer Lux then arrested defendant, and he too waived his Miranda rights. Defendant told Officer Lux that codefendant had brought complainant to their bedroom while he was lying naked on the bed. Codefendant instructed complainant to remove her clothes, then both held complainant down on the bed by her arms so defendant could have sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter both forcibly fondled complainant. The substance of this statement was reduced to writing and defendant signed it.</p> <p id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">The police then confronted codefendant with defendant\u2019s statement. Codefendant told the officer that those events must have occurred if defendant said that they did.</p> <p id=\"b622-8\" pgmap=\"622\">Codefendant testified. She denied that the events recounted by complainant occurred. She also denied making any oral incriminating admissions to police.</p> <p id=\"b622-9\" pgmap=\"622\">Defendant testified. He denied having sexual relations with complainant, and he denied that he knew the contents of the written statement he signed. First, he claimed that Officer Lux told him that codefendant made a written statement, that no one would believe him because he was a black man and that he would receive a substantial sentence. However, if he confessed, Lux told him that he could receive probation. Then an assistant State\u2019s Attorney presented him with a written account, which defendant did not read or know its content before he signed, although he told the latter that nothing had occurred with complainant.</p> <p id=\"b622-10\" pgmap=\"622(8) 623(131)\">Both defendant and codefendant contend that representation by the same counsel during their joint bench trial was improper because a conflict of interest existed. Codefendant claims that this conflict was manifested by the introduction of defendant\u2019s statement without restriction, which implicated her even though repudiated by defendant. She also maintains that because of their joint representation she was not able to fully cross-examine defendant without using information acquired in counsel\u2019s professional responsibility to defendant. Defendant claims that prior to trial the court could not have known that a conflict existed with codefendant. Defendant asserts, however, that when codefendant\u2019s statement implicating him in the offense was introduced, a conflict was evident, yet the trial court did not inquire into the conflict or admonish both accused that they had a right to be represented by counsel with undivided loyalties.</p> <p id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623(311) 624(42)\">In People v. Jones (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 21, 250 N.E.2d 325, the Illinois Supreme Court considered in consolidated appeals \u201cwhether joint representation of defendants establishes a sixth amendment claim of denial of the effective assistance of counsel when it is alleged that the admission of inculpatory and inconsistent pretrial statements from each defendant created a conflict of interest.\u201d (121 Ill. 2d at 24.) In neither consolidated case in Jones, as here, did defense counsel indicate to the trial court that any potential conflict might exist. One of the consolidated cases involved the appeal of defendant Harris who along with a codefendant Jones was jointly tried for armed robbery. Both defendant and codefendant made pretrial statements; Jones\u2019 statement implicated Harris and exculpated himself while Harris\u2019 statement exculpated both. At trial Jones denied making his pretrial statement and adopted Harris\u2019 version of events. The supreme court noted that Jones had repudiated his earlier inculpatory statement and asserted a claim consistent with Harris\u2019 position stating, \u201cCounsel for Harris had no reason to cross-examine Jones when he testified favorably to Harris.\u201d (121 Ill. 2d at 31.) Harris\u2019 conviction was thus affirmed. In the second consolidated case, defendants Mosley and Ross were jointly represented at trial and both had made pretrial statements inculpating both in murder and armed robbery. Mosley repudiated his statement at trial as coerced, but Ross did not testify. The supreme court found that no hostility existed between defendants because Mosley repudiated his confession and Ross did not have to impeach Mosley because no amount of impeachment could have produced a more favorable result. (121 Ill. 2d at 33.) However, since Ross did not testify and his pretrial confession implicated Mosley, the supreme court concluded that his confession went to the jury unrepu: diated and unimpeached, thereby violating Mosley\u2019s right to confrontation. \u201c[W]hen Ross declined to testify, there was no way that Mosley\u2019s attorney [who also represented Ross] could effectively deal with the implicating statement.\u201d (121 Ill. 2d at 34.) The supreme court then affirmed Ross\u2019 conviction but granted Mosley a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\"> We believe that Jones negates the claims in the present consolidated appeals that their counsel operated under a conflict of interest. Codefendant testified and denied making any incriminating statement, and defendant claimed that his written admission was not intelligently made or true. Consequently, we do not believe that defendant or codefendant can establish a meritorious claim that their joint representation was improper because each could not cross-examine the other as to the respective pretrial statements. There was no conflict of interest in the joint representation of which the trial court was required to sua sponte advise defendant and codefendant.</p> <p id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624\">Both defendant and codefendant advance claims that they were denied effective assistance of trial counsel. Defendant contends that his counsel was ineffective because counsel (1) failed to question the voluntariness of his confession; (2) failed to prepare adequately for trial by not reviewing the discovery materials tendered by the State, specifically, the letter written by complainant to her foster mother; (3) failed to object to the letter as hearsay; (4) failed to move for a severance when codefendant made a statement implicating him; and (5) failed to prepare adequately for trial by failing to interview witnesses who could describe complainant as an inveterate liar. Codefendant makes similar claims of ineffectiveness based on their counsel\u2019s failure to file pretrial motions to suppress statements, to seek a severance, to object to introduction of complainant\u2019s letter, to object to certain testimony elicited from the witnesses by the State, or to make any investigations of complainant\u2019s medical and school records or call into question her veracity.</p> <p id=\"b624-7\" pgmap=\"624(131) 625(27)\"> To establish ineffectiveness of trial counsel defendant must show that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that defendant was so prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance that he was denied a fair trial. (People v. Harris (1988), 123 Ill. 2d 113, 155, 526 N.E.2d 335.) In the present case we believe that many of the claimed deficiencies were merely questions of trial strategy. First, a severance could be granted upon a showing of antagonistic defenses. (People v. Harris (1988), 123 Ill. 2d 113, 155, 526 N.E.2d 335.) As we have previously noted, the defenses in this case were not antagonistic; both accused denied that the sexual incident ever occurred. Moreover, the questions of pretrial motions to suppress each accused\u2019s statements may well have been a question of trial strategy. See authorities set forth in People v. Fernandez (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 981, 987-88, 516 N.E.2d 366.</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\"> There is nothing in Officer Lux\u2019 trial testimony to suggest any basis to suppress the statements of defendant or codefendant, and the only question which could have been raised was the credibility of the witnesses. Counsel may well have thought such motions would have been futile. (People v. Hall (1986), 114 Ill. 2d 376, 408, 499 N.E.2d 1335; People v. Hancock (1983), 113 Ill. App. 3d 564, 574, 447 N.E.2d 994.) Moreover, there was the possibility that had defendant and codefendant testified in a pretrial setting something might have occurred that would have been used to impeach them at trial (see People v. Sturgis (1974), 58 Ill. 2d 211, 317 N.E.2d 545) particularly in the case of codefendant who denied making any such statement.</p> <p id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">Moreover, we fail to discern any lack of trial preparation by defense counsel that prejudiced defendant and codefendant. The case was quite simple and direct. The case involved complainant\u2019s testimony and Officer Lux\u2019 testimony about codefendant\u2019s oral statements and defendant\u2019s oral and written statements as opposed to the denials of defendant and codefendant at trial of these matters. We do not believe that any conduct by defense counsel which is not called into question on appeal affected the outcome of their trial. Consequently, we do not believe that ineffective assistance of counsel has been established.</p> <p id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\"> Defendant and codefendant argue that reversible error occurred when complainant\u2019s undelivered letter was allowed into evidence detailing the crimes with which they were charged. This letter was merely cumulative in nature to complainant\u2019s testimony. That testimony was corroborated as to defendant by his oral and written admissions and corroborated in significant part as to codefendant by the latter\u2019s oral admissions to police. Thus, even if the admission of the letter can be questioned, defendant and codefendant cannot claim prejudice. See People v. Silvertri (1986), 148 Ill. App. 3d 980, 987, 500 N.E.2d 456.</p> <p id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625\"> Codefendant urges that she was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence does not compel a contrary result. People v. Bedony (1988), 173 Ill. App. 3d 613, 618, 527 N.E.2d 916.</p> <p id=\"b625-9\" pgmap=\"625(46) 626(11)\">In a footnote contained in her brief codefendant makes an abridged reference to the length of her sentence and notes that this court can modify an inappropriate sentence. However, we do not believe that an adequate ground exists for this type of action. People v. La Pointe (1981), 88 Ill. 2d 482, 492-93, 431 N.E.2d 334.</p> <p id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">Accordingly, the judgments of the circuit court are affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">Judgments affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b626-7\" pgmap=\"626\">COCCIA, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b626-8\" pgmap=\"626\">PINCHAM, J.,</author> <p id=\"ALA\" pgmap=\"626\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b626-9\" pgmap=\"626\">I dissent. However insatiable the urge may be to distort or ignore fundamental constitutional rights and legal principles in order to convict one who is accused of committing a despicable crime, this urge, whenever present, must be completely suppressed and the rules of law must always prevail. A mere cursory examination of the record in the case at bar clearly reveals that the defendants, Emmaline Williams and Roy Williams, were each denied their Federal and State constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel by their attorney\u2019s simultaneous disloyal representation of the two defendants, who had adverse, antagonistic, inconsistent, discordant and conflicting rights, interests and concerns, and also by their attorney\u2019s grossly incompetent and blatantly inadequate performance, before and during the defendants\u2019 joint trial.</p> <p id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\">A</p> <p id=\"b626-11\" pgmap=\"626\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p> <p id=\"AXM\" pgmap=\"626\">The sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, made binding upon the States by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment (Gideon v. Wainwright (1961), 372 U.S. 335, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799, 83 S. Ct. 792), provides that, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *** to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d (U.S. Const., amend. VI.) Article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois similarly provides that, \u201cIn criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel ***.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a78.</p> <p id=\"b626-12\" pgmap=\"626\">The Supreme Court held in Kimmelman v. Morrison (1986), 477 U.S. 365, 374, 91 L. Ed. 2d 305, 318, 106 S. Ct. 2574, 2583:</p> <blockquote id=\"b626-13\" pgmap=\"626\">\u201cThe right to counsel is a fundamental right of criminal defendants; it assures the fairness, and thus the legitimacy, of our adversary process.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b626-14\" pgmap=\"626\">The Kimmelman court further held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b626-15\" pgmap=\"626(21) 627(157)\">\u201cThe right of an accused to counsel is beyond question a fundamental right. [Citations.] (\u2018The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours\u2019). Without counsel the right to a fair trial itself would be of little consequence [citations], for it is through counsel that the accused secures his other rights. [Citations] (\u2018Of all the rights that an accused person has, the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive, for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have\u2019). The constitutional guarantee of counsel, however, \u2018cannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment,\u2019 [citation]. \u2018An accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney, whether retained or appointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.\u2019 [Citation.] In other words, the right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d 477 U.S. at 377, 91 L. Ed. 2d at 320-21,106 S. Ct. at 2584.</blockquote> <p id=\"b627-5\" pgmap=\"627\">The precious constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel is not governed or influenced by the gravamen of the offense with which the accused stands charged. Nor is this invaluable constitutional guarantee in any way dependent upon the innocence or guilt of the accused, the quantity or quality of the State\u2019s evidence against the accused, the evidence of the accused\u2019s innocence, or the potential success or failure of the accused\u2019s defense. In Kimmelman, the Supreme Court additionally held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627\">\u201cWhile we have recognized that the \u2018premise of our adversary system of criminal justice *** that partisan advocacy *** will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free\u2019 [citations] underlies and gives meaning to the right to effective assistance [citation], we have never intimated that the right to counsel is conditioned upon actual innocence. The constitutional rights of criminal defendants are granted to the innocent and the guilty alike. Consequently, we decline to hold either that the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel belongs solely to the innocent or that it attaches only to matters affecting the determination of actual guilt.\u201d 477 U.S. at 379-80, 91 L. Ed. 2d at 322, 106 S. Ct. at 2585-86.</blockquote> <p id=\"b627-7\" pgmap=\"627\">Moreover, under the criminally accused\u2019s constitutional guarantee to the effective assistance of counsel, no distinction is permitted between an accused\u2019s court-appointed counsel and an accused\u2019s privately retained counsel. Mr. Justice Stevens recently stated for the Supreme Court in McCoy v. Court of Appeals (1988), 486 U.S. 429, 444, 100 L. Ed. 2d 440, 457, 108 S. Ct. 1895,1905;</p> <blockquote id=\"b627-8\" pgmap=\"627(20) 628(41)\">\u201cEvery advocate has essentially the same professional responsibility whether he or she accepted a retainer from a paying client or as appointment from a court. *** In preparing and evaluating the case, and in advising the client as to the prospects for success, counsel must consistently serve the client\u2019s intent to the best of his or her ability.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b628-5\" pgmap=\"628\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b628-6\" pgmap=\"628\">*** The attorney must still provide his or her client precisely the services that an affluent defendant could obtain from paid counsel \u2014 a thorough review of the record and a discussion of the strongest arguments revealed by that review.

Civilization\u2019s most sacred, learned, dedicated and staunchest advocate of all times, centuries ago, admonished:</p> <blockquote id=\"b628-8\" pgmap=\"628\">\u201cNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other.\u201d (Matthew 6:24.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b628-9\" pgmap=\"628\">The advocate was the Christ Jesus; the admonition was to his disciples and the multitude during His Sermon on the Mount; the admonition is cited in the most dynamic, accurate and prestigious of all law books, The Holy Bible, at Matthew, the 6th chapter and the 24th verse.</p> <p id=\"b628-10\" pgmap=\"628\">Canon 5 of The Model Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association demands:</p> <blockquote id=\"b628-11\" pgmap=\"628\">\u201c5 \u2014 1 The professional judgment of a lawyer should be exercised, within the bounds of the law, solely for the benefit of his client and free of compromising influences and loyalties.

He should resolve all doubts against the propriety of the representation. A lawyer should never represent in litigation multiple clients with differing interests; and there are few situations in which he would be justified in representing in litigation multiple clients with potentially differing interests. If a lawyer accepted such employment and the interests did become actually differing, he would have to withdraw from employment with likelihood of resulting hardship on the clients; and for this reason it is preferable that he refuse the employment initially. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b629-7\" pgmap=\"629\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b629-8\" pgmap=\"629\">5 \u2014 17 Typically recurring situations involving potentially differing interests are those in which a lawyer is asked to represent co-defendants in a criminal case ***.

Ct. 2052, 2067, the Supreme Court stated that its holding in Cuyler v. Sullivan (1980), 446 U.S. 335, 340-50, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333, 341-48, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 1713-19, was that prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest from his joint representation of multiple defendants, that in those circumstances counsel breaches the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel\u2019s duties. Moreover, the Strickland court concluded that it is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation corrupted by conflicting interests, and that given the obligation of counsel to avoid conflicts of interest and the ability of trial courts to make early inquiry in certain situations likely to give rise to conflicts, it is reasonable for the criminal justice system to maintain a fairly rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of interests.</p> <p id=\"b629-10\" pgmap=\"629(39) 630(69)\">From the totality of the circumstances in the case at bar, application of these foregoing legal and constitutional principles and directives to the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s dual, simultaneous representation of them, with their adverse, hostile, inconsistent conflicting interests and concerns, and his patently incompetent performance before and during the defendants\u2019 joint trial, clearly establishes not only a presumption of prejudice, but indeed, positively and affirmatively establishes that the defendants were flagrantly denied their Federal and State constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel.

Count I of the indictment alleged that the defendants, Roy Williams and Emmaline Williams, on or about April 1, 1984, in Cook County, Illinois, committed the offense of rape, in that they, of the age of 17 years and upwards, \u201chad sexual intercourse with A.W., a child under the age of sixteen years.\u201d Count II alleged that said defendants on said date and at said place committed the offense of indecent liberties with a child, in that they, of the age of 17 years and upwards, \u201cperformed an act of sexual intercourse with A.W., a child under the age of 16 years.\u201d Count III charged that the defendants committed the offense of indecent liberties with a child, in that they, of the age of 17 years and upwards, \u201cwith the intent to arouse and satisfy their sexual desires, lewdly fondled and touched A.W., a child under the age of 16 years.\u201d Finally, count IV accused the defendants with committing the offense of unlawful restraint, in that they detained A.W. by holding her in a bedroom.</p> <p id=\"b631-5\" pgmap=\"631\">Thus, the defendants, Roy Williams and Emmaline Williams, were jointly charged in all four counts. They were husband and wife and obviously were known to be such by their attorney. The alleged victim in all four counts was A.W., the defendants\u2019 adopted daughter, and likewise was obviously known to be such by the defendants\u2019 attorney. Counts I, II and III jointly charged the defendants with the commission of sex offenses upon their adopted daughter, and count IV charged them with the commission of an offense upon her which was instrumental in the commission of the sex offenses alleged in counts I, II and III.</p> <p id=\"b631-6\" pgmap=\"631(146) 632(317)\">These sex accusations, in conjunction with the defendants\u2019 relationship to each other and to the alleged victim, should have forewarned counsel of the hazards of his joint representation of the husband and wife defendants, particularly where the alleged victim was their adopted minor daughter. Of course each defendant under the law was presumed innocent. That presumption does not control, however, in determining the proper alignment of defense counsel or the propriety of joint representation by a defense counsel in a multiple-defendant, multiple-count indictment. One defendant may in fact have committed the alleged offense, and the quantity and quality of the State\u2019s evidence against such defendant may vary from weak and meager to strong and overwhelming. Whereas, the other defendant may be in fact totally innocent and have absolutely no knowledge of the commission of the offenses. The glaringly apparent unique feature, on the facts, in the case at bar is that the defendants did not have but one defense available to them and that was that they did not commit the offenses. The defenses of mistaken identification, alibi and consent were realistically unavailable to them. Because of their restricted defense, the single attorney\u2019s dual representation of both defendants confronted him with the loyalty and conflict dilemmas in the confidential attorney-client communications and husband-wife confidential communication, as well as in his joint courtroom representation of them. Moreover, the relationship of the defendants to each other effectively inhibited possible plea negotiations by the single attorney on behalf of only one of the defendants. It would likewise appear that his joint representation of the husband-wife defendants could possibly warp their acceptance of his conflicting or synonymous advice to each of them on exercising their personal constitutional right to be tried by a jury. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination was curtailed and his fervor in the presentation of each defendant\u2019s defense was compromised by his dual representation of these defendants at their joint trial. In this unusual case, because of the charges, the only available defense thereto, the relationship of the defendants to each other and to the alleged victim and the unique facts upon which the State relied to prove the charges, the joint representation of the husband and wife defendants by the same attorney created counsel disloyalty and' client conflicts. It was impossible for one attorney to competently represent both defendants at their joint trial, and the attorney\u2019s attempt to do so in the case at bar is indicative of his incompetency and selfishness. \u201cPrivately retained lawyers are subject to economic pressures and consequently cannot be relied on to alert clients to conflicts of interest.\u201d Lowenthal, Joint Representation In Criminal Cases: A Critical Appraisal, 64 Va. L. Rev. 939, 985 (1978).</p> <p id=\"b632-5\" pgmap=\"632\">II</p> <p id=\"b632-6\" pgmap=\"632\">PRETRIAL</p> <p id=\"b632-7\" pgmap=\"632\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL SOUGHT NO PRETRIAL DISCOVERY.</p> <p id=\"b632-8\" pgmap=\"632(98) 633(45)\">The trial record shows that the defendants\u2019 counsel sought no pretrial discovery, to which he was entitled, under the provisions of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 412 (107 Ill. 2d R. 412). He was incompetent in not so doing. The record also clearly shows that he did not familiarize himself with and he did not properly utilize the pretrial discovery material which the State voluntarily furnished him. He was likewise incompetent in failing to do so. He did not file a pretrial motion for discovery. No such motion is contained in the record on appeal. The trial clerk\u2019s memorandum of orders in the appeal record, commonly referred to as the halfsheet, does not reflect that the defendants\u2019 counsel filed a pretrial discovery motion or that an order was entered directing the State to furnish defendants\u2019 counsel with pretrial discovery.</p> <p id=\"b633-5\" pgmap=\"633\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b633-6\" pgmap=\"633\">A</p> <p id=\"b633-7\" pgmap=\"633\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 ATTORNEY DID NOT MAKE A MERITORIOUS MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT ROY WILLIAMS\u2019 STATEMENT.</p> <p id=\"b633-8\" pgmap=\"633\">The State contended that defendant, Roy Williams, gave a pretrial written, signed statement to Chicago police officer Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Jerry Walsh, in which he admitted and related his and codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 participation in the commission of the alleged offenses. Before trial, the State furnished defendants\u2019 attorney with a copy of defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement, as pretrial discovery material. The defendants\u2019 attorney made no attempt to suppress this statement, although the trial testimony clearly established that there was a valid basis for making such a suppression motion. More importantly, on the basis of the record before us, the trial testimony also established that Roy Williams\u2019 statement should and would have been suppressed had a suppression motion been made. The defendants\u2019 attorney was incompetent in failing to make a motion to suppress defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b633-9\" pgmap=\"633\">The majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe questions of pretrial motions to suppress each accused\u2019s statements may well have been a question of trial strategy\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 602-03) is completely baseless. There is no valid trial strategy in not pursuing a meritorious motion to suppress a defendant\u2019s incriminating statement, and, if it was defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s trial strategy not to do so, he was manifestly incompetent.</p> <p id=\"b633-10\" pgmap=\"633\">Additionally, the majority\u2019s following conjectures:</p> <p id=\"b633-11\" pgmap=\"633\">(1) \u201c[tjhere is nothing in Officer Lux\u2019 trial testimony to suggest any basis to suppress the statements of defendant [Roy Williams]\u201d;</p> <p id=\"b633-12\" pgmap=\"633\">(2) \u201cthe only question which could have been raised was the credibility of the witnesses\u201d;</p> <p id=\"b633-13\" pgmap=\"633\">(3) \u201c[c]ounsel may well have thought such motions would have been futile\u201d;</p> <p id=\"b634-4\" pgmap=\"634\">(4) \u201cthere was the possibility that had defendant [Roy Williams] *** testified in a pretrial setting something might have occurred that would have been used to impeach [him] at trial\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 603)</p> <p id=\"b634-5\" pgmap=\"634\">are not valid justifications for defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to have sought suppression of defendant R\u00f3y Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b634-6\" pgmap=\"634\">First, as the majority correctly speculates, there is always the possibility that something might occur during a defendant\u2019s pretrial testimony that could be used to impeach him at trial. Trial impeachment is always a possibility from a defendant\u2019s pretrial testimony. But, certainly, such a speculative possibility is not an acceptable reason for defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to have made a meritorious motion to suppress Roy Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b634-7\" pgmap=\"634\">Second, every defense counsel recognizes that a motion to suppress a defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement may be \u201cfutile.\u201d But the possible futility of the effort is no justification for not making the effort.</p> <p id=\"b634-8\" pgmap=\"634\">Third, frequently, again as the majority correctly speculates, on the hearing of a motion to suppress a defendant\u2019s statement \u201cthe only question which could have been raised was the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 603.) A determination of the credibility of the witnesses is nothing unique. Most assuredly, this can be no vindication for defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to have made the suppression motion.</p> <p id=\"b634-9\" pgmap=\"634\">Fourth, the majority\u2019s aforestated and accepted supposition for the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s failure to have attempted to suppress Roy Williams\u2019 statement is obviously premised on the majority\u2019s assumption that on the question of the credibility of the witnesses on an evidentiary hearing of the defendant\u2019s suppression motion, the trial court would automatically believe the officer and disbelieve the defendant. But, again, such an assumption, warranted or unwarranted, is not. an acceptable reason for the defendants\u2019 attorney not to have sought suppression of Roy Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b634-10\" pgmap=\"634\">Fifth, the'majority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[t]here is nothing in Officer Lux\u2019 trial testimony to suggest any basis to suppress the statements of defendant [Roy Williams]\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 603) is no valid excuse for the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s neglect to have attempted to have the statement suppressed. Defense lawyers, prosecutors, and trial and appellate judges well realize that rarely, if ever, is there anything in a police officer\u2019s motion to suppress pretrial or trial testimony which \u201csuggests] any basis to suppress the statements of [a] defendant.\u201d 182 Ill. App. 3d at 603.</p> <p id=\"b635-4\" pgmap=\"635\">Sixth, there is a significant absence in Officer Lux\u2019 trial testimony which clearly establishes the basis, indeed the absolute necessity, for suppressing Roy Williams\u2019 statement. The majority accurately states that defendant Roy Williams testified \u201cthat Officer Lux told him that codefendant [Emmaline Williams] made a written statement.\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 600.) Although called as a rebuttal witness at trial, Officer Lux did not contradict or deny defendant Roy Williams\u2019 repeated trial testimony that Lux told him that his wife and codefendant, Emmaline Williams, had signed a written statement.</p> <p id=\"b635-5\" pgmap=\"635\">At trial, defendant Roy Williams testified on his own behalf, on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b635-6\" pgmap=\"635\">\u201cQ. Well, did they ask you to make a statement?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-7\" pgmap=\"635\">A. Yes. Officer Lux did.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-8\" pgmap=\"635\">Q. Before you made a statement what, if anything, did he say to you regarding the statement?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-9\" pgmap=\"635\">A. He said you got one strike on you. You a black man and when you go before the rich white judge from the suburbs you going up the road.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-10\" pgmap=\"635\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-11\" pgmap=\"635\">He said I got a signed statement from your wife *** and your daughter. You might as well sign this because if you don\u2019t you going up the road and he says if you sign this you\u2019ll probably get a year\u2019s probation. Then after I signed this he says you understand I am not for you. I\u2019m for A.[W.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b635-12\" pgmap=\"635\">Defendant Roy Williams again testified on direct examinaron:</p> <blockquote id=\"b635-13\" pgmap=\"635\">\u201cQ. Well when he [Officer Lux] first talked to you what did he say?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-14\" pgmap=\"635\">A. He told me, he says you better sign this. I got a signed statement from your wife, your daughter A.W. and if you don\u2019t sign it you going up the road. He said now if you sign this you will get probation. He said because you got a strike on you being a black man the judge is not going to believe you. He\u2019s going to believe that ch\u00fcd.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-15\" pgmap=\"635\">Q. Now what was said the second meeting between you and Officer Lux?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b635-16\" pgmap=\"635\">A. He repeated the same thing and then he had a paper.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b635-17\" pgmap=\"635\">On cross-examination, the defendant, Roy Williams, for the third time testified:</p> <blockquote id=\"b635-18\" pgmap=\"635(32) 636(10)\">\u201cHe [Officer Lux] says I have a written statement. Signed statement from your wife, your daughter and if you sign this you probably will get probation because he says the rich white judge from the suburbs is not going to believe you.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-5\" pgmap=\"636\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-6\" pgmap=\"636\">Being a black man you got a strike on you if you go before a rich white judge from the suburbs. He wrote this up and told me to sign it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b636-7\" pgmap=\"636\">Twice on direct examination and a third time on cross-examination, defendant Roy Williams testified that Officer Lux told him that he had a written, signed statement from his wife. Significantly, when Officer Lux was called by the prosecutor as a rebuttal witness, he did not deny this statement the defendant attributed to him. Officer Lux was asked by the prosecutor and he testified on rebuttal:</p> <blockquote id=\"b636-8\" pgmap=\"636\">\u201cQ. Officer Lux *** when you spoke with Roy Williams did you tell him that if he signed a paper he would get probation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-9\" pgmap=\"636\">A. No.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-10\" pgmap=\"636\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-11\" pgmap=\"636\">Q. Did you ever tell him that a white judge from the suburbs would not believe his story?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b636-12\" pgmap=\"636\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b636-13\" pgmap=\"636\">It is apparent from the trial testimony of Officer Lux and the co-defendant, Emmaline Williams, that Officer Lux did not have a written, signed statement from her, and that Officer Lux\u2019 contrary statements to the defendant Roy Williams were false. No such statement was established by the testimony of Officer Lux or the codefendant, Emmaline Williams, or from any other source. If such a written, signed statement by codefendant Emmaline Williams existed, it would be, but it is not, apparent from the record before us. It is clear, however, that based upon the foregoing segment of the record before us of Officer Lux\u2019 undenied representations to defendant Roy Williams that he had a written, signed statement from his wife, Emmaline Williams, the codefendant, there was a valid and meritorious basis for suppressing defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement; certainly there was a basis for at least attempting to do so. People v. Lee (1984), 128 Ill. App. 3d 774, 780-81, 471 N.E.2d 567.</p> <p id=\"b636-14\" pgmap=\"636\">In People v. Payton (1984), 122 Ill. App. 3d 1030, 462 N.E.2d 543, the detective falsely told the defendant that he had been identified by the victim of a burglary and that his fingerprints had been found at the scene of the crime and the defendant admitted to the detective that he had committed the burglary. The defendant was convicted of the burglary. The appellate court reversed, holding:</p> <blockquote id=\"b636-15\" pgmap=\"636(29) 637(45)\">\u201cOn appeal, defendant initially argues that the tactics used by Detective Strom were such as to render defendant\u2019s confession involuntary, and that the confession should have been suppressed. We agree. In determining whether a confession was voluntarily made, it must be ascertained whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne at the time he confessed or whether the confession was made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement of any sort. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-5\" pgmap=\"637\">*** It is undisputed that, prior to the time defendant made his confession, Detective Strom falsely told him that he had been identified by the victim of the crime, and that his fingerprints had been found at the scene. The United States Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that \u2018any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver [of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination] will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege.\u2019 (Miranda v. Arizona (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 476, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 725, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1629.) Moreover, the Illinois Supreme Court has long recognized that confessions or admissions acquired by trick are inadmissible. (People v. Stevens (1957), 11 Ill. 2d 21, 27, 141 N.E.2d 33.) *** It seems apparent that a suspect grossly and intentionally misled as to the amount and strength of the evidence against him may well be induced to confess as a direct result of those misrepresentations. Defendant here testified that he was trying to \u2018cut himself a deal\u2019 by admitting his involvement in the crime, and we think it ignores reality to presume that neither the reliability nor the voluntariness of a confession is tainted by police conduct calculated to falsely persuade the defendant that his prospects for avoiding conviction are nearly hopeless. *** Finally, it matters not that defendant\u2019s confession here may have been true, for the truth or falsity of the confession is irrelevant insofar as the inquiry into its voluntariness is concerned. (Jackson v. Denno (1964), 378 U.S. 368, 377, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908, 915-16, 84 S. Ct. 1774, 1781.) Given the nature and extent of the trickery employed by Detective Strom, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress.\u201d 122 Ill. App. 3d at 1033-34.</blockquote> <p id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637\">It is clear that defendant Roy Williams\u2019 counsel was incompetent in failing to make a motion to suppress his statement. People v. Odom (1966), 71 Ill. App. 2d 480, 218 N.E.2d 116.</p> <p id=\"b637-7\" pgmap=\"637(39) 638(166)\">On the state of the record in the case at bar as it appears before us, the statement of Roy Williams was obtained from him in violation of his fifth amendment right, which provides, \u201cNo person *** shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law ***\u201d (U.S. Const, amend V) (made binding upon the States by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment), and his similar rights under article I, sections 2 and 10, of the Illinois Constitution, which provide, respectively, \u201cNo person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law ***\u201d and \u201cNo person shall be compelled in a criminal case to give evidence against himself ***.\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7\u00a72, 10.) The defendant Roy Williams\u2019 attorney\u2019s failure to invoke said constitutional rights by a motion to suppress his statement denied defendant Roy Williams his right to the effective assistance of counsel and to loyal counsel guaranteed him under the sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">Defendant Roy Williams testified that the statement he signed was preprepared and predrafted by Officer Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh, that Officer Lux, and not he, supplied the contents of the statement, and that he did not read the statement when Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh presented it to him or before he signed it. Although this was denied by Officer Lux, it is significant that the State did not call Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Jerry Walsh, who Officer Lux stated took defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement, as a witness during the trial, and the State did not offer any explanation for its failure to have done so. Even more significant, the defendants\u2019 counsel did not raise or rely on the State\u2019s failure to have called Walsh as a witness.</p> <p id=\"b638-6\" pgmap=\"638\">Officer Lux and the defendant Roy Williams both testified that the defendant did not write his statement, that the statement was written by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh and that the defendant thereafter signed it. Neither Officer Lux nor Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh called a shorthand reporter to take the defendant\u2019s statement, and no explanation appears in the record for them not having done so.</p> <p id=\"b638-7\" pgmap=\"638(112) 639(195)\">A hearing on and a decision by the trial court on defendant Roy Williams' motion to suppress his statement would have placed the credibility of the defendant Roy Williams against the credibility of Officer Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh for the trial court\u2019s determination. A ruling by the trial court favorable to the defendant Roy Williams on his motion to suppress his statement would have been an obvious indication that the trial court had concluded that the defendant was the more credible witness. Conversely, a denial of his motion to suppress his statement would have been a clear indication that the trial court had found that Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh and Officer Lux were the more credible witnesses. Based upon this pretrial assessment by the trial court of the credibility of defendant Roy Williams, Officer Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh as witnesses, the defendants\u2019 attorney would have had a meaningful basis and barometer for advising the defendants on whether to exercise their constitutional right to be tried by a jury, determined by the trial court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion. Advice by a defendant\u2019s attorney to waive a jury trial when the trial court has already rejected a defendant as a credible witness on the hearing of his motion to suppress his pretrial statement would ordinarily be incompetent advice, and particularly so on the facts in the instant case. (People v. Chatman (1967), 36 Ill. 2d 305, 223 N.E.2d 110.) The defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s failure to have pursued and acquired this appropriate pretrial credibility determination by the trial court is another manifestation of the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s incompetence. No pretrial motion to suppress the defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement was made, and, thus, there was no judicial determination of the constitutional validity on the voluntariness or the authenticity of the statement.</p> <p id=\"b639-5\" pgmap=\"639\">I momentarily leave, but will later return to, defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b639-6\" pgmap=\"639\">B</p> <p id=\"b639-7\" pgmap=\"639\">It is noteworthy that codefendant Emmaline Williams at trial denied making any oral or written incriminating admission to Officer Lux. It would appear that had she made any voluntary incriminating admissions, they would have been reduced to writing. No reason appears for such admissions not having been reduced to writing, except perhaps, as she testified, such admissions were not made by her. But, here again, defendants\u2019 counsel did not raise the issue.</p> <p id=\"b639-8\" pgmap=\"639\">I am constrained to point out that the majority\u2019s statements\u2014 \u201cThe police then confronted codefendant [Emmaline Williams] with defendant\u2019s [Roy Williams\u2019] statement. Codefendant told the officer that those events must have occurred if defendant said that they did\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 600) \u2014 are not totally correct and are indeed misleading. More accurately, Officer Lux equivocally and vacillatingly testified on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b639-9\" pgmap=\"639\">\u201cQ. What did you say to her at that time?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-10\" pgmap=\"639\">A. *** And then confronted her [Emmaline Williams] with what Roy had just told us.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b639-11\" pgmap=\"639\">Q.

Something to that effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b640-4\" pgmap=\"640\">The true evidentiary worth of this irresolute testimony of Officer Lux need not be assessed.</p> <p id=\"b640-5\" pgmap=\"640\">IV</p> <p id=\"b640-6\" pgmap=\"640\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL MADE NO SEVERANCE MOTION ON BEHALF OF CODEFENDANT EMMALINE WILLIAMS AND HE THEREBY IGNORED AND DEFEATED HER BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN AND TO A SEPARATE TRIAL.</p> <p id=\"b640-7\" pgmap=\"640\">The statement of defendant Roy Williams inculpated him and his wife, codefendant Emmaline Williams, in the commission of the alleged offenses.

Yet, the defendants\u2019 counsel did not familiarize himself with or utilize defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement as a basis for a severance motion on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams. The defendants\u2019 counsel did not make a severance motion on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams. He was manifestly incompetent in failing to do so. He neglected to faithfully and loyally pursue and protect her interest in failing to do so.</p> <p id=\"b641-5\" pgmap=\"641\">Although the majority\u2019s statements, \u201ca severance could be granted upon a showing of antagonistic defenses,\u201d and \u201cthe defenses in this case were not antagonistic\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 602), the accuracy of which is indeed questionable, the court\u2019s statements nevertheless are unquestionably incomplete and deceptive. Antagonistic defenses are not the sole basis for a severance. We recently stated in People v. Schmitt (1988), 173 Ill. App. 3d 66, 87:</p> <blockquote id=\"b641-6\" pgmap=\"641\">\u201cWe have repeatedly held that when a motion for a separate trial is predicated on the premise that a codefendant\u2019s confession or admission implicates the moving defendant, a severance should be granted unless the prosecution declares that the admission or confession will not be offered in evidence at the time of trial, or if offered, that there will be eliminated therefrom any and all references to the party applying for the severance.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"AqE\" pgmap=\"641(200) 642(66)\">Although Richardson v. Marsh (1987), 481 U.S. 200, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176, 107 S. Ct. 1702, Nelson v. O\u2019Neil (1971), 402 U.S. 622, 29 L. Ed. 2d 222, 91 S. Ct. 1723, Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620, People v. Jones (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 21, People v. Hernandez (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 293, People v. Cruz (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 321, and People v. Duncan (1988), 124 Ill. 2d 400, involved whether a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment constitutional right of confrontation at a joint trial was violated by the State\u2019s use of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession, these authorities are also instructive on a codefendant\u2019s right to a severance where the State intends to rely on a defendant\u2019s confession which implicates the codefendant in the commission of the offense for which they are jointly charged. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not protect codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 interest and right to a separate trial. Instead, the defendants\u2019 attorney improperly refused to utilize defendant Roy Williams\u2019 pretrial statement as a basis for making a severance motion on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams, and her beneficial interest in and right to a separate trial went unenforced, unpursued and unprotected. As stated in Nealy v. Carbana (5th Cir. 1986), 782 F.2d 1362, 1365, quoting Turnquest v. Wainwright (5th Cir. 1981), 651 F.2d 331, 334, a defendant is \u201centitled to \u2018an attorney who [can] make a decision to use or not to use [testimony] unfettered by the effect of that decision on his other client\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p id=\"b642-5\" pgmap=\"642\">In the supreme court\u2019s recent decision in People v. Duncan (1988), 124 Ill. 2d 400, Duncan and Olinger were tried for murder, armed robbery, armed violence and conspiracy. Duncan contended for reversal of his conviction that his trial should have been severed from Olinger\u2019s trial because of the admission of Olinger\u2019s statement at their joint trial, at which Olinger did not testify. Duncan complained, as does codefendant Emmaline Williams in the case at bar, that the \u201cwitnesses\u2019 testimony regarding alleged out-of-court statements by Olinger [Roy Williams], though properly inculpatory of Olinger [Roy Williams], had the effect of inculpating defendant [Emmaline Williams] as well because the jury was likely to consider the testimony improperly against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (124 Ill. 2d at 403.) In Duncan, however, the trial court instructed the jury to consider Olinger\u2019s statement only in determining Olinger\u2019s guilt or innocence and not to consider Olinger\u2019s statement in determining Duncan\u2019s guilt or innocence. In the case at bar, however, the defendants\u2019 joint, incompetent attorney made no similar motion to the trial court to so restrict defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement. Relying only in part on Olinger\u2019s failure to testify and Duncan\u2019s attendant inability to cross-examine him on the statement, the supreme court initially held in its first opinion, (1) that Olinger\u2019s statement was so inculpatory of Duncan, its admission at Duncan\u2019s trial \u201cviolated defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation and (2) that fundamental fairness required a new trial.\u201d 124 Ill. 2d at 406.</p> <p id=\"b642-6\" pgmap=\"642(79) 643(14)\">Thereafter, Richardson v. Marsh (1987), 481 U.S. 200, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176, 107 S. Ct. 1702,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was decided, and under authority thereof, the United States Supreme Court: (1) granted the People\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in Duncan; (2) vacated the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court in Duncan reversing and remanding the cause for a new trial; and (3) remanded the cause to the Illinois Supreme Court for further consideration in light of Richardson. Illinois v. Duncan (1987), 484 U.S. 806, 98 L. Ed. 2d 18, 108 S. Ct. 53.</p> <p id=\"b643-3\" pgmap=\"643\">On remand in Duncan, the supreme court of Illinois again held that admission of Olinger\u2019s statement was reversible error as to Duncan and reversed and remanded for a new trial, stating, \u201c[T]he Illinois courts have long held that a choice must be made between severance, nonuse of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s admissions, or redaction to eliminate all reference to the implicated defendant (e.g., People v. Patris (1935), 360 Ill. 596, 601).\u201d Duncan, 124 Ill. 2d at 412.</p> <p id=\"b643-4\" pgmap=\"643\">The following language of the supreme court in Duncan is equally applicable to the facts and circumstances in the case at bar:</p> <blockquote id=\"b643-5\" pgmap=\"643\">\u201cThe very fact that, given the interwoven nature of the prosecution\u2019s case, it might be quite difficult adequately to impart proper limiting instructions supports our view that the trial court erred in failing to sever defendant\u2019s trial from Olinger\u2019s.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 124 Ill. 2d at 411.</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-6\" pgmap=\"643\">Given the interwoven nature of the defendants with each other and with the victim, and the nature of the prosecutor\u2019s case in the case at bar, it is obvious that the defendant\u2019s counsel erred and was incompetent in failing to present a severance motion on behalf of co-defendant Emmaline Williams. To her detriment, he did not loyally pursue her rights and best interest.</p> <p id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">Based on defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement and the law applicable thereto, the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s failure to have sought a separate trial for codefendant Emmaline Williams was inexcusable and clearly denied codefendant Emmaline Williams her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. He refused to protect or promote her best interest because of his improper joint, simultaneous representation of her husband.</p> <p id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643\">V</p> <p id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">A</p> <p id=\"b643-10\" pgmap=\"643\">ALTHOUGH INADMISSIBLE AGAINST HER, DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL FAILED TO OBJECT ON BEHALF OF CODEFENDANT EMMALINE WILLIAMS TO THE ADMISSION OF DEFENDANT ROY WILLIAMS\u2019 STATEMENT AS EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.</p> <p id=\"b643-12\" pgmap=\"643(56) 644(30)\">Defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement was inadmissible as evidence against the codefendant Emmaline Williams. Yet, their joint counsel failed to object on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams to its admission as to her. Nor did he move the trial court to restrict consideration of Roy Williams\u2019 statement only as to Roy Williams, and not to consider it as evidence against Emmaline Williams. The defendants\u2019 counsel was disloyal to codefendant Emmaline Williams and was also incompetent in not so objecting and in not making such motions.</p> <p id=\"b644-5\" pgmap=\"644\">During the State\u2019s case in chief, Officer Lux testified on direct examination that People\u2019s exhibit No. 2 was defendant Roy Williams\u2019 signed statement given to Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh, heretofore set forth herein. As previously pointed out, in said statement defendant Roy Williams implicated the codefendant, Emmaline Williams, with him in the commission of the alleged offenses and her name and her involvement in the offenses were not properly deleted from the statement. Their counsel made no such motion. Additionally, without any objection from defense counsel, not only was Roy Williams\u2019 statement admitted into evidence, but it was also published to the trial court during Lux\u2019 direct examination and before Lux was cross-examined by defendants\u2019 attorney:</p> <blockquote id=\"b644-6\" pgmap=\"644\">\u201c[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Judge, we would ask *** that this witness be allowed to publish this exhibit [People\u2019s exhibit No. 2].</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-7\" pgmap=\"644\">THE COURT: Any objections to have it so published? What you\u2019re asking for is to have it admitted into evidence, identification marks to be stricken and that the witness publish it. Do you have any objection to that?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-8\" pgmap=\"644\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-9\" pgmap=\"644\">THE COURT: Accordingly, all identification marks to be stricken on People\u2019s Exhibit Number 2 *** and the State may publish said document through the witness. Proceed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-11\" pgmap=\"644\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-12\" pgmap=\"644\">Q. Officer *** would you at this time read that statement from the top to the end?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b644-13\" pgmap=\"644\">Thereupon, Officer Lux read to the trial court the complete statement of defendant Roy Williams, which included his inculpation of codefendant Emmaline Williams in the commission of the offenses (as the statement previously appears herein). Defense counsel\u2019s conduct was not trial strategy. It was obvious incompetence, because of which co-defendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 interest was not only compromised and negated, but indeed her interest was ignored.</p> <p id=\"b644-14\" pgmap=\"644(62) 645(136)\">The only competent evidence against codefendant Emmaline Williams was the totally uncorroborated testimony of A.W., extremely belatedly given, under gravely suspicious circumstances. Emmaline denied commission of the offense. It was for the trial court to determine her innocence or guilt, influenced by and based solely on the admissible evidence against her, and uninfluenced by any improper or inadmissible evidence. Under the circumstances of this case, if the trial court believed defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement, which it obviously did, it became a physiological and mental impossibility for the trial court to have reached its determination of Emmaline\u2019s guilt completely uninfluenced by her husband\u2019s, the defendant Roy Williams\u2019, statement, in which he inculpates her in the commission of the offense and which was inadmissible against her. This is particularly so when the defendants\u2019 attorney did not request the trial court (1) to restrict its consideration of the statement to its maker, defendant Roy Williams, or (2) not to consider Roy\u2019s statement as evidence against codefendant Emmaline Williams; and more particularly so when the trial court gave absolutely no indication that it would or had so limited its reliance on Roy Williams\u2019 statement.</p> <p id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">The majority, in mistaken reliance on People v. Jones (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 21, concludes that because \u201c[c]odefendant [Emmaline Williams] testified and denied making any incriminating statement, and defendant [Roy Williams] claimed that his written admission was not intelligently made or true *** [t]here was no conflict of interest in the joint representation ***.\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 602.) Jones does not consider a claim of a denial of a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because of incompetent counsel.</p> <p id=\"b645-6\" pgmap=\"645\">I have previously noted herein the distinguishing characteristics of the relationship of the defendants to each other and to the alleged victim, the charges and the interwoven nature of the State\u2019s evidence in the case at bar, which need not be here reiterated. No such distinguishing characteristics were present in Jones. I hereafter discuss Jones in greater detail.</p> <p id=\"b645-7\" pgmap=\"645\">THE ADMISSION OF DEFENDANT ROY WILLIAMS\u2019 STATEMENT AS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE CODEFENDANT EMMALINE WILLIAMS VIOLATED THE LATTER\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.</p> <p id=\"b645-9\" pgmap=\"645(108) 646(63)\">When the State brings a criminal charge against a single defendant or against multiple defendants, due process requires the State to prove, by only competent and admissible evidence, each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in order for such defendant to be found guilty. (In re Winship (1970), 397 U.S. 358, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368, 90 S. Ct. 1068.) The Supreme Court stated in Jackson v. Virginia (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 315, 317-18, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, 571, 572-73, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2787, 2788, \u201cIn Winship, the Court held for the first time that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects a defendant in a criminal case against conviction \u2018except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime \u201ewith which he is charged,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cunder Winship, which established proof beyond a reasonable doubt as an essential of Fourteenth Amendment due process, it follows that when such conviction occurs in a state trial, it cannot constitutionally stand.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b646-5\" pgmap=\"646\">When the lines of the trial battle are drawn, when the die of the trial conflict is cast, when the attack is launched, it is the State against the defendant or defendants. The defendant is called upon and required to defend against and meet only the State\u2019s valid evidence and the testimony of witnesses the State calls to testify against him. The trial is the State against the defendant. The trial is not a contest by the State and a codefendant on trial against a defendant also on trial. A defendant is not required to, he should not be required to, and indeed due process prohibits him from being required to meet and defend against evidence and testimony presented by the State and simultaneously defend against evidence and testimony presented by his codefendant. A defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a codefendant may satisfy the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination, but it falls far short, indeed it utterly fails in my judgment, to comply with the due process prohibition against a defendant being required to defend against a codefendant\u2019s trial testimony or against a codefendant\u2019s pretrial statement admitted into evidence that inculpates the defendant in the commission of the charged offense. This is precisely what happened in the case at bar.</p> <p id=\"b646-6\" pgmap=\"646\">Defendant Roy Williams\u2019 pretrial statement, inculpating codefendant Emmaline Williams in the commission of the charged offenses was admitted into evidence. The prosecutor urged the trial court to rely on defendant Roy Williams\u2019 pretrial statement in finding both defendants guilty, and it is quite apparent from the record that the trial court did so. This was fundamentally unfair and denied codefendant Emmaline Williams constitutional due process.</p> <p id=\"b646-7\" pgmap=\"646(112) 647(19)\">A codefendant cannot dictate to a defendant to testify, not to testify, or what the defendant\u2019s testimony will be should the defendant elect to testify. There is not the slightest suggestion in the case at bar that codefendant Emmaline Williams in any way influenced defendant Roy Williams to testify or in what his testimony should be, and vice versa. Moreover, there is likewise no evidence that either of them directed the contents of either of their alleged pretrial statements. Yet, it is clear that codefendant Emmaline Williams was convicted on defendant Roy Williams\u2019 pretrial statement, which was certainly inadmissible against and nonbinding upon her. She was required to simultaneously defend against the dual evidence of the State and her codefendant-husband, in violation of constitutional due process.</p> <p id=\"b647-5\" pgmap=\"647\">It really was no meaningful or satisfactory vindication or solution to codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 due process violation, caused by the admission of defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement into evidence against her, that the defendants\u2019 joint counsel could have cross-examined defendant Roy Williams when he testified, pursuant to codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 sixth amendment right of confrontation. First, Richardson v. Marsh (1987), 481 U.S. 200, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176, 107 S. Ct. 1702, Nelson v. O\u2019Neil (1971), 402 U.S. 622, 29 L. Ed. 2d 222, 91 S. Ct. 1723, Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620, People v. Jones (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 21, People v. Hernandez (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 293, People v. Cruz (1988), 121 Ill. 2d 321, and People v. Duncan (1988), 124 Ill. 2d 400, do not address this due process claim.</p> <p id=\"b647-6\" pgmap=\"647\">Second, defendants\u2019 joint counsel\u2019s cross-examination of defendant Roy Williams on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams on his statement only would have aggravated the imbroglio. Their joint counsel called defendant Roy Williams as a witness on his behalf, not on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams. Defendant Roy Williams testified on direct examination. He was then cross-examined by the prosecutor. He stated in essence that he was persuaded by Officer Lux and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Walsh to sign the statement and that its contents were not true. For the defendants\u2019 counsel to thereafter cross-examine defendant Roy Williams under and on these circumstances would indeed be compromising and would assuredly adversely impact on the integrity and persuasiveness on his subsequent argument to the trial court to accept and rely on codefendant Roy Williams\u2019 credibility as a witness and acquit him. His disloyal role of cross-examining his own client, defendant Roy Williams, on behalf of his client, the codefendant Emmaline Williams, would have compromised his dedication to Roy. His failure to cross-examine him violated his loyalty to Emmaline.</p> <p id=\"b647-7\" pgmap=\"647(96) 648(49)\">Third, the right, the ability and even the actual cross-examination of a defendant, on behalf of a codefendant, on a defendant\u2019s pretrial statement or confession in which he inculpates the codefendant in the commission of the alleged offense and which is repudiated by the defendant at trial do not cancel the statement or confession\u2019s incriminations of the codefendant when admitted into evidence, even though the statement or confession is inadmissible against the codefendant. The result is that the State has used a defendant\u2019s prejudicial, inadmissible hearsay pretrial statement or confession as evidence to convict a codefendant, in violation of constitutional due process. This was more egregiously so in the case at bar because there was no pretrial determination of the constitutional validity of defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement, because the defendants\u2019 joint attorney neglected to make an appropriate motion to suppress it.</p> <p id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">VI</p> <p id=\"b648-6\" pgmap=\"648\">A</p> <p id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 ATTORNEY NEGLECTED TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH AND TO PROPERLY UTILIZE OTHER PRETRIAL DISCOVERY MATERIAL VOLUNTARILY FURNISHED HIM BY THE STATE.</p> <p id=\"b648-8\" pgmap=\"648\">The Supreme Court of the United States observed in Wheat v. United States (1988), 486 U.S. 153, 163, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140, 151, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 1699, that \u201c[a] few bits of unforeseen testimony or a single previously unknown or unnoticed document may significantly shift the relationship between the multiple defendants.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This is precisely what happened, or rather is precisely what should have happened, and properly would have happened but for the incompetence of the defendants\u2019 attorney.</p> <p id=\"b648-9\" pgmap=\"648\">The defendants\u2019 attorney did not familiarize himself with the adopted minor daughter-victim\u2019s handwritten, seven-page recording, purportedly of the defendants\u2019 commission of the offenses, voluntarily furnished the defendants\u2019 attorney by the State as pretrial discovery material. This written statement of the alleged victim is set forth in full as an appendix hereto. In this written statement, the alleged victim inculpated both defendant Roy Williams and codefendant Emma-line Williams in the commission of the alleged sex offenses upon her. Trial proceeding colloquy affirmatively establishes that, not only did the defendants\u2019 counsel fail to familiarize himself with the contents of the alleged victim\u2019s said statement, but more importantly, said colloquy, during the midst of the trial, establishes outrightly that the defendants\u2019 attorney did not even know that he had been furnished the alleged victim\u2019s statement or that he had it in his possession.</p> <p id=\"b648-10\" pgmap=\"648\">After testifying on direct examination to the defendants\u2019 commission of the sex offenses upon her, the prosecutor then asked the alleged victim, she testified, and the following colloquy occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b648-11\" pgmap=\"648\">\u201cQ.

He was totally unaware that it was in his possession. It is irrefutably apparent that the defendants\u2019 attorney before trial could not possibly have reviewed and analyzed the victim\u2019s statement and formulated the best trial strategy and most feasible and beneficial tactics to pursue regarding it and its contents for its minimum detriment to the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b650-19\" pgmap=\"650(160) 651(40)\">The preceding colloquy between the trial court and counsel, and A.W.\u2019s direct testimony regarding her letter to Mrs. Abernathy about \u201cthe sexual abuse that happened to me in April of 1984,\u201d concludes at page 33 of the trial transcript. Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Durkin thereafter further questioned A.W. on direct examination for only five additional pages of the transcript. A.W. was then tendered to the defendants\u2019 attorney for cross-examination. The defendants\u2019 attorney did not ask for a recess to read and familiarize himself with A.W.\u2019s statement, which he only moments previously discovered, for the first time, he had in his possession. Instead, upon conclusion of A.W.\u2019s direct examination, surprisingly, the-defendants' attorney proceeded immediately to cross-examine her. Defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s cross-examination of A.W. consists of a grand total of 10 pages. He did not ask A.W. a single question on cross-examination about the contents of or on what she wrote of the incident in her statement. Yet, even a hasty reading of her statement discloses many significant contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions between what A.W. testified on the witness stand occurred and what A.W. wrote in her statement occurred. I note but a few of these contradictions and omissions.</p> <p id=\"b651-5\" pgmap=\"651\">A.W. testified on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b651-6\" pgmap=\"651\">\u201cQ. When did your clothes come off after you went to the bedroom?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-7\" pgmap=\"651\">A. When she [codefendant Emmaline] was holding the doorknob she made me take \u2019em off.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b651-8\" pgmap=\"651\">Subsequently, A.W. conversely testified on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b651-9\" pgmap=\"651\">\u201cQ. How did she make you take your clothes off?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-10\" pgmap=\"651\">A. Because she took them off with her hands while she was holding the doorknob. She took them off with the other hand.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b651-11\" pgmap=\"651\">A.W. never stated in her statement, People\u2019s exhibit No. 1, that codefendant Emmaline took off her clothes.</p> <blockquote id=\"b651-12\" pgmap=\"651\">Next, A.W. testified on direct examination:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-13\" pgmap=\"651\">\u201cQ. What were her words to you \u2014 her exact words to you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-14\" pgmap=\"651\">A. She said that mama loves you and that the reason why she haven\u2019t been doing it because she got hurt trying to put the air conditioner into the window and she couldn\u2019t do it \u2014 do anything with him. That\u2019s why she had been asking me to do it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-15\" pgmap=\"651\">Q. Because she had hurt herself?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b651-16\" pgmap=\"651\">A. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b651-17\" pgmap=\"651\">Although it is not unequivocally clear from her testimony that A.W.\u2019s above statement referred to the alleged April 1984 sex acts for which the defendants were charged and on trial, it is evident from the prosecutor\u2019s following closing argument that he contended that this testimony related to the alleged April 1984 sex offenses for which the defendants were charged and on trial. The prosecutor initially argued in closing argument:</p> <blockquote id=\"b651-18\" pgmap=\"651\">\u201cThe evidence has shown through her that the mother or adopted mother, Emmaline Williams, did tell her she had a favor for her to do. In fact she told her that she couldn\u2019t have sex with her husband because she had a bad back.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b651-19\" pgmap=\"651\">The prosecutor subsequently stated to the trial court in closing argument:</p> <blockquote id=\"b651-20\" pgmap=\"651(43) 652(2)\">\u201cShe [A.W.] tells you defendant Roy Williams admits that his wife had back problems and she tells you who she [codefendant Emmaline] told [A.W.] that that was one of the reasons that she was having her [A.W.] have sex with her husband rather than herself.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b652-5\" pgmap=\"652\">In imposing sentence, the trial court relied on A.W.\u2019s testimony that the defendants told her that codefendant Emmaline could not have sexual relations with defendant Roy Williams because of some physical infirmity as a reason for the defendants\u2019 sexual involvement with A.W. The trial court stated in imposing sentence:</p> <blockquote id=\"b652-6\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that kind of nonsense. I know your wife was in a physical condition where she could not satisfy you. That was brought out in the trial of the ease.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b652-7\" pgmap=\"652\">There is not one word in A.W.\u2019s written statement, People\u2019s exhibit No. 1, about codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 physical condition or her physical condition\u2019s impact on her sexual powers. A.W. does not attribute in her statement any remark to either defendant about Emmaline\u2019s physical condition or her lack of sexual abilities as a reason, or otherwise, for codefendant Emmaline\u2019s request for A.W. to have sexual intercourse with her husband, defendant Roy Williams. Of far greater significance, and diametrically contrary to her foregoing trial testimony, A.W. stated in her statement that the codefendant Emmaline Williams and the defendant Roy Williams did have sexual intercourse that night. A.W. contradictorily stated in her statement:</p> <blockquote id=\"b652-8\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cThen she said A.W. you not doing it right. Then she made me move over. While him and her did it. Then they stop ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b652-9\" pgmap=\"652\">There was no cross-examination of A.W. by defendants\u2019 counsel on these glaring and vital contradictions with and omission from A.W.\u2019s trial testimony.</p> <p id=\"b652-10\" pgmap=\"652\">In the context in which A.W. testified and wrote in her statement, there can be no question that A.W. meant sexual intercourse when she used, and when she attributed to codefendant Emmaline Williams the use of the terms:</p> <blockquote id=\"b652-11\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cthe reason why she haven\u2019t been doing it\u201d;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b652-12\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cshe couldn\u2019t do it\u201d;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b652-13\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cdo anything with him\u201d;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b652-14\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cthat\u2019s why she had been asking me to do it\u201d;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b652-15\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cyou not doing it right\u201d;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b652-16\" pgmap=\"652\">\u201cwhile him and her did it. \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b652-17\" pgmap=\"652(47) 653(188)\">The prosecuting attorneys and the trial court construed and accepted A.W.\u2019s aforesaid terminology as meaning sexual intercourse. Any other construction would have been totally illogical. Meaning sexual intercourse, or whatever else A.W. might have meant by the foregoing expressions, A.W. testified at trial that codefendant Emmaline Williams told her that she couldn\u2019t \u201cdo it\u201d with her husband because of some physical infirmity and for that reason Emmaline requested A.W. to \u201cdo it\u201d with her husband, defendant Roy Williams, and that she did so. This trial testimony of A.W. is directly contradicted by A.W.\u2019s written statement, which she testified was prepared by her two weeks after the incident was supposed to have occurred. In A.W.\u2019s written statement she stated that codefendant Emmaline told her, \u201cA.W. you not doing it right\u201d and that codefendant Emmaline made her move over, \u201cwhile him and her did it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If \u201chim and her did it,\u201d as A.W. stated in her statement, then codefendant Emmaline could not have told A.W. that she could not \u201cdo it\u201d because of an injury and therefore wanted A.W. \u201cto do it\u201d with her husband, defendant Roy Williams, as A.W. testified, in direct contradiction to her statement. (Emphasis added.) The defendants\u2019 attorney neglected to, indeed the record discloses that he did not know to, cross-examine A.W. on these extremely pertinent contradictions between her statement and her trial testimony. He was incompetent.</p> <p id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">Next, A.W. testified, on six different occasions, at trial that after the defendants committed the sex acts on her in April 1984, she immediately told the defendants\u2019 19-year-old daughter, Tanya Bergen, what the defendants had just done to her. A.W. testified on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b653-6\" pgmap=\"653\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the next thing that happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-7\" pgmap=\"653\">A. I went to ***. I knocked on Tanya\u2019s door and told her to come in the bathroom and I told her what happened and she didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b653-8\" pgmap=\"653\">A.W. similarly testified later on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b653-9\" pgmap=\"653\">\u201cAfter you told Tanya what happened what\u2019s the next thing you did?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-10\" pgmap=\"653\">A. I went to bed.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b653-11\" pgmap=\"653\">A.W. further testified, on direct examination, when she got up that morning:</p> <blockquote id=\"b653-12\" pgmap=\"653\">\u201cQ. And when you got up what happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-13\" pgmap=\"653\">A. *** [Tjanya came upstairs and asked me what happened again and I told her again.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b653-14\" pgmap=\"653\">A.W. additionally testified on direct examination about that afternoon:</p> <blockquote id=\"A4J\" pgmap=\"653\">\u201cQ. When did you next see Tanya?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-15\" pgmap=\"653\">A. When I came from school.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-16\" pgmap=\"653\">Q. And what happened when you saw Tanya?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b653-17\" pgmap=\"653\">A. *** [S]he just kept saying that she couldn\u2019t believe that had happened.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b653-18\" pgmap=\"653\">A.W. again testified on cross examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b654-4\" pgmap=\"654\">\u201cQ. Did you ever tell any of them about it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-5\" pgmap=\"654\">A. I told her daughter the night it happened.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b654-6\" pgmap=\"654\">A.W. later, again, testified on cross-examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b654-7\" pgmap=\"654\">\"Q. Did you discuss this incident with anyone excepting the person on the hot line?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-8\" pgmap=\"654\">A. I told her daughter.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-9\" pgmap=\"654\">Q. *** [W]hen did you tell her daughter about it?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-10\" pgmap=\"654\">A. The night it happened.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-11\" pgmap=\"654\">THE COURT: How old is the daughter?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-12\" pgmap=\"654\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b654-13\" pgmap=\"654\">A. Nineteen.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b654-14\" pgmap=\"654\">Although, as set forth, A.W. six times repeatedly testified that she told Tanya what she contended the defendants had done to her, she never once mentioned in her written statement, People\u2019s exhibit No. 1, purportedly prepared by her shortly after the incident, that she had told Tanya about it. Defendants\u2019 counsel was incompetent in not cross-examining A.W. on these numerous contradictions and omissions between her statement and her trial testimony. People v. Jackson (1968), 96 Ill. App. 2d 99, 238 N.E.2d 234.</p> <p id=\"b654-15\" pgmap=\"654\">The prosecutor did not allow the trial court to overlook A.W.\u2019s testimony that she promptly told Tanya Bergen what the defendants had done to her. In his initial opening argument urging the trial court to find the defendants guilty, the prosecutor stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b654-16\" pgmap=\"654\">\u201cShe told you how there was prompt outcry made to Tanya Bergen, another daughter of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b654-17\" pgmap=\"654\">Although, from A.W.\u2019s statement, there was an extremely adequate and valid basis for defendants\u2019 counsel to successfully challenge the integrity and veracity of this vital aspect of the State\u2019s case, he failed to do so. The defendants\u2019 counsel was incompetent.</p> <p id=\"b654-18\" pgmap=\"654\">B</p> <p id=\"b654-19\" pgmap=\"654(122) 655(12)\">Defendants\u2019 counsel was incompetent in not calling Tanya Bergen as a defense witness. As previously set forth herein, A.W. testified on six occasions that immediately after the occurrences she told Tanya Bergen that the defendants had committed the sex acts upon her. A.W. did not state in her written statement, however, that she related this to Tanya. The prosecutor subpoenaed Tanya Bergen as a witness but he did not call her as a witness, apparently because she did not verify but instead contradicted, that A.W. had told her that the defendants committed the sex acts upon her. Tanya Bergen was therefore a favorable witness to the defendants to refute A.W.\u2019s 14-month belated assertion that A.W. told her about the defendants\u2019 misdeeds 14 months earlier, when it supposedly happened, or at any other time.</p> <p id=\"b655-5\" pgmap=\"655\">The trial commenced and A.W. testified on November 19, 1986. The trial was continued to December 4, 1986. When the trial resumed on that date, the defendants\u2019 attorney answered that he was ready and thereupon the following colloquy occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b655-6\" pgmap=\"655\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** [T]he state have you any witnesses to call?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b655-7\" pgmap=\"655\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Judge, we do. We have a police officer [Lux]. We also want to put on the record that one of the witnesses we had subpoenaed, this Tanya Bergen, is in court today, but after speaking to her it is our election not to call her as a witness. I don\u2019t know if defense wants her.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b655-8\" pgmap=\"655\">THE COURT: Do you want to call her?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b655-9\" pgmap=\"655\">[DEFENDANTS\u2019 ATTORNEY]: No, sir.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b655-10\" pgmap=\"655\">THE COURT: You have no need,for herl</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b655-11\" pgmap=\"655\">[DEFENDANTS\u2019 ATTORNEY]: No, sir.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b655-12\" pgmap=\"655\">The prosecutor stated that after speaking to Tanya Bergen, it was his election not to call her as a witness. The defendants\u2019 attorney before us convincingly argues that had Tanya Bergen confirmed to the prosecutor that A.W. told her of the defendants\u2019 commission of the sex acts upon her, the prosecutor would have called her as a witness to corroborate A.W.\u2019s trial testimony that she had done so. Conversely, the defendants\u2019 attorney just as convincingly argues that it is obvious that the prosecutor did not call Bergen as a witness because Bergen disputed and denied to him A.W.\u2019s assertion that A.W. had done so. Thus, the defendants\u2019 attorney further argues before us, with equal persuasion, that Bergen was a favorable witness for the defendants to refute A.W.\u2019s extremely untimely and belated trial assertion that she had told Bergen what the defendants had done to her. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 trial attorney\u2019s response to the trial court\u2019s inquiries that he had no need for and did not want to call Tanya Bergen as a witness, the defendants\u2019 trial attorney did have a need for and should have called Tanya Bergen as a defense witness. He was incompetent in failing to do so.</p> <p id=\"b655-13\" pgmap=\"655(76) 656(92)\">The supreme court recently held in People v. Caballero (1989), 126 Ill. 2d 248, 277, that a post-conviction petition which alleged that defense counsel did not call three named persons as mitigating witnesses on the defendant\u2019s death sentencing hearing simply because they were not unalterably opposed to the death penalty \u201craise[d] a serious question as to counsel\u2019s competence.\u201d The supreme court reversed the trial court\u2019s order which dismissed the petition and remanded the cause to the trial court \u201cfor an evidentiary hearing on that portion of defendant\u2019s petition which alleges that he was denied a fair sentencing hearing by counsel\u2019s alleged failure to present certain witnesses in mitigation.\u201d (126 Ill. 2d at 283.) The supreme court expressly emphasized that the question to be determined by the trial court upon remand was \u201cwhether the defendant was afforded the effective assistance of counsel\u201d (126 Ill. 2d at 282) by defense counsel\u2019s failure to call the three mitigating witnesses at the sentencing hearing.</p> <p id=\"b656-5\" pgmap=\"656\">VII</p> <p id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656\">ALTHOUGH THE ALLEGED VICTIM\u2019S, A.W.\u2019S, LETTER WAS CLEARLY INADMISSIBLE, PREJUDICIAL HEARSAY EVIDENCE, DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL NEVER OBJECTED TO ITS ADMISSION.</p> <p id=\"b656-7\" pgmap=\"656\">A.W. testified that she wrote People\u2019s exhibit No. 1, a letter to Mrs. Abernathy, her former foster mother, in which she set forth the defendants\u2019 commission in April 1984 of the sex acts upon her and to which she testified, a couple of weeks after the occurrence. She never delivered the letter to Mrs. Abernathy and no explanation was offered for her not having done so. According to A.W., she kept the letter secreted in her dresser drawer for over 14 months, and in June 1985, she turned the letter over to Officer Lux during his investigation in the instant case. The letter was classic prejudicial inadmissible hearsay.</p> <p id=\"b656-8\" pgmap=\"656\">Hearsay is an out-of-court oral or written declaration offered or relied on in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. Oral or written declarations are hearsay when the declaration (1) was made out of court; (2) is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein; and (3) the veracity of the declaration rests upon the credibility of the out-of-court declarant. People v. Hunter (1984), 124 Ill. App. 3d 516, 528, 464 N.E.2d 659; People v. Jones (1983), 114 Ill. App. 3d 576, 589, 449 N.E.2d 547; People v. Clark (1982), 108 Ill. App. 3d 1071,1079-81, 440 N.E.2d 387.</p> <p id=\"b656-9\" pgmap=\"656(82) 657(10)\">A.W.\u2019s trial testimony that she wrote the letter two weeks after the incident and kept it for 14 months in her dresser drawer was uncorroborated. It is certain that A.W.\u2019s letter was offered by the prosecution and admitted as evidence to corroborate A.W.\u2019s trial testimony. This tactic has been described as an attempt to lift a witness by his own bootstraps. A.W.\u2019s letter was hearsay in its purest form and was inadmissible as evidence against the defendants. People v. Fuelner (1982), 104 Ill. App. 3d 340, 349-52, 432 N.E.2d 986.</p> <p id=\"b657-5\" pgmap=\"657\">In People v. Clark (1972), 52 Ill. 2d 374, 389, the supreme court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b657-6\" pgmap=\"657\">\u201c[A] witness may not testify as to statements he made out of court for the purpose of corroborating his testimony given at the trial relative to the same subject.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b657-7\" pgmap=\"657\">In People v. Rogers (1980), 81 Ill. 2d 571, 577, 578, the supreme court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b657-8\" pgmap=\"657\">\u201cIt appears that no single facet of the law has been productive of as much confusion as has the application of the hearsay evidence rule. *** The definition of hearsay itself is deceptively simple and is generally accepted to be testimony of an out-of-court statement offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted therein, and resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter. ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-9\" pgmap=\"657\">In People v. Clark (1972), 52 Ill. 2d 374, 388-90, this court noted the general rule that ^although the witness may be present in court and subject to cross-examination, he may not testify as to statements he made out of court for the purpose of corroborating his testimony given at trial relative to the same subject ***.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b657-10\" pgmap=\"657\">In spite of its obvious inadmissibility, the defendants\u2019 attorney did not voice any objection to the admission into evidence of A.W.\u2019s prejudicial inadmissible hearsay statement. His failure to object was not an oversight. It is apparent that he did not know to object. (People v. DeSimone (1956), 9 Ill. 2d 522.) He was incompetent.</p> <blockquote id=\"b657-11\" pgmap=\"657\">\u201cMR. DURKIN: [assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Judge, at this time *** we would ask that the identification marks from People\u2019s Exhibit Number 1, for identification *** we would ask that it be admitted into evidence and the identification marks be stricken.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-12\" pgmap=\"657\">THE COURT: Any objections, Mr. [Defense Attorney]?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-13\" pgmap=\"657\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: No objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-14\" pgmap=\"657\">THE COURT: Accordingly, it will be *** admitted into evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b657-15\" pgmap=\"657\">The majority in the case at bar accurately observes, \u201cThe case was quite simple and direct. The case involved complainant\u2019s testimony and Officer Lux\u2019 testimony about codefendant\u2019s [Emmaline\u2019s] oral statements and defendant\u2019s [Roy\u2019s] oral and written statements as opposed to the denials of defendant and codefendant at trial ***.\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 603.) The majority immediately thereafter, however, conversely and fallaciously concludes:</p> <blockquote id=\"b658-4\" pgmap=\"658\">\u201cThis letter [People\u2019s exhibit No. 1] was merely cumulative in nature to complainant\u2019s testimony. *** Thus, even if the admission of the letter can be questioned, defendant and codefendant cannot claim prejudice.\u201d 182 Ill. App. 3d at 603.</blockquote> <p id=\"b658-5\" pgmap=\"658\">This erroneous conclusion by the majority, that the defendants were not prejudiced by the admission of A.W.\u2019s letter, simply ignores the record. The record discloses that the prosecutor adamantly urged the trial judge to rely on A.W.\u2019s inadmissible hearsay letter as evidence of the defendants\u2019 guilt. The record likewise discloses that the trial court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s urging and relied on A.W.\u2019s inadmissible hearsay letter in determining the defendants\u2019 guilt.</p> <p id=\"b658-6\" pgmap=\"658\">In his opening argument to the trial court, the prosecutor argued:</p> <blockquote id=\"AXK\" pgmap=\"658\">\u201cFurther Your Honor, she told you how shortly after the incident she wrote a letter and that would be People\u2019s Group Exhibit 1 which she said she was going to deliver to Mrs. \u25a0Abernathy. I would ask leave of court to approach the court with that so the court may have that.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b658-7\" pgmap=\"658\">THE COURT: You may do so.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b658-8\" pgmap=\"658\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I would also give the court People\u2019s Exhibit 2, which is in evidence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b658-9\" pgmap=\"658\">THE COURT: Thank you.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b658-10\" pgmap=\"658\">[ASSISTANT STATE'S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, she told you how she wrote that letter and the court can inspect it. It\u2019s a long letter and that she was going to deliver it to Edna Abernathy, her previous foster mother, but then Emmaline Williams had made threats to her about what happened if she told the police. *** Your Honor based upon the facts of the case and the evidence you heard we would ask that you find each defendant guilty of each charge in this indictment.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b658-11\" pgmap=\"658\">In the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s short three-page closing argument, he commented on the letter, adversely to the defendants\u2019 interest, as follows, a further manifestation of his incompetence:</p> <blockquote id=\"b658-12\" pgmap=\"658\">\u201cExhibit 1 is undated except for April of 1984. That\u2019s the exhibit which she wrote to someone about these things that had happened.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b658-13\" pgmap=\"658\">In the prosecutor\u2019s concise U/s-page final closing argument, the prosecutor devoted over one-half of it to the letter. He expounded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b658-14\" pgmap=\"658(51) 659(57)\">\u201cAnd lastly Judge, I think that great emphasis should be put on the letter that was written. Not fourteen months after the incident, but right after it happened where she memorializes the clothing that she was wearing,' what actually went down, about the radio and changing the radio station. Everything is contained in that letter so she wouldn\u2019t forget or not that she needed a letter to remind her of the horror that she went through in April of 1984. Judge, I think the evidence is clear. It\u2019s convincing and the defendants in fact are guilty of the charges of rape and indecent liberties. Thank you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b659-5\" pgmap=\"659\">Immediately upon the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s aforesaid final closing argument, the trial court recessed to read the letter. The trial court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b659-6\" pgmap=\"659\">\u201cFive minutes recess, gentlemen. I\u2019m going to read the letter. Five minutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b659-7\" pgmap=\"659\">The trial judge left the bench and there was a recess. When the trial judge returned to the bench, after having read and relied on the letter during the recess, he promptly found both defendants guilty.</p> <p id=\"b659-8\" pgmap=\"659\">Subsequently, on the hearing of the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, A.W.\u2019s prejudicial inadmissible hearsay letter again surfaced. Their attorney then argued to the trial court:</p> <blockquote id=\"b659-9\" pgmap=\"659\">\u201cNow fourteen months after April of 1984, there is a letter written by the alleged victim stating that certain things happened to her in April of 1984, things done to her by both defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b659-10\" pgmap=\"659\">The defendants\u2019 attorney repeated to the trial court in his argument for a new trial.</p> <blockquote id=\"b659-11\" pgmap=\"659\">\u201cWe had the complaining witness who made a statement.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b659-12\" pgmap=\"659\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b659-13\" pgmap=\"659(179) 660(33)\">Based on the foregoing, it cannot be seriously or convincingly contended that the prosecutor did not urge the trial court to consider and rely on A.W.\u2019s inadmissible hearsay letter. More importantly, from the foregoing it is positively certain that the trial court relied on the prejudicial inadmissible .hearsay letter in finding the defendants guilty. The majority\u2019s contrary conclusion is not only grossly inaccurate, it clearly contradicts the record. Of even greater significance, however, are: (1) A.W.\u2019s testimony about the inadmissible hearsay letter and its admission into evidence without objection from the defendants\u2019 counsel; (2) defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s unawareness that the letter had been furnished him doming pretrial discovery; (3) defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to familiarize himself with the letter\u2019s contents; (4) no cross-examination by defendants\u2019 counsel of A.W. on the letter; (5) defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments on the letter; and (6) the trial court\u2019s reliance on the letter in finding the defendants guilty, all of which positively establish the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s absolute incompetence. His errors were not trial tactics or strategy, or even misapprehensions of the law. It is apparent that he did not know the law fundamental to the basic issues in this case. People v. Wright (1986), 111 Ill. 2d 18.</p> <p id=\"b660-5\" pgmap=\"660\">VIII</p> <p id=\"b660-6\" pgmap=\"660\">A</p> <p id=\"b660-7\" pgmap=\"660\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 ATTORNEY FAILED TO PRESENT FAVORABLE EVIDENCE ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS.</p> <p id=\"b660-8\" pgmap=\"660\">I have previously expressed my agreement with the majority\u2019s assessment that, \u201cThe case was quite simple and direct. The case involved complainant\u2019s testimony and Officer Lux\u2019 testimony *** as opposed to the denials of defendant and codefendant at trial ***.\u201d (182 Ill. App. 3d at 603.) The defendants\u2019 attorney incompetently neglected to present to the trial court favorable evidence on behalf of the defendants which could have persuaded the trial court to resolve the credibility issue favorably to the defendants.</p> <p id=\"b660-9\" pgmap=\"660\">After the trial court found the defendants guilty and before sentencing, each defendant retained additional counsel, who presented evidence of A.W. and the defendants\u2019 characters and credibility on the defendants\u2019 sentencing hearing. This evidence was more appropriately presentable on behalf of the defendants on their trial.</p> <p id=\"b660-10\" pgmap=\"660\">A.W. claimed that on the day after the defendants had sex with her in April 1984, she was suspended from school for fighting. For 14 months thereafter, she made no mention of the defendants\u2019 sexual attack upon her, except, according to her, to 19-year-old Tanya Bergen. In June 1985, 14 months after the defendants\u2019 alleged sex attack upon her, A.W. was again suspended from school for fighting. Additionally, A.W. admitted that on this day of her suspension from school for fighting she improperly mopped the kitchen floor at her home, for which codefendant Emmaline Williams punished her and she ran away. Codefendant Emmaline Williams testified that she refused 13-year-old A.W.\u2019s repeated requests to promiscuously go out with boys and that she would not allow A.W. to stay out after reasonable hours.</p> <p id=\"b660-11\" pgmap=\"660\">A.W. went to a former foster mother\u2019s residence and claimed to her, for the first time, that the defendants had committed the sex acts upon her 14 months previously.</p> <p id=\"b660-12\" pgmap=\"660(30) 661(12)\">At trial, A.W.\u2019s credibility was not only an issue, A.W.\u2019s credibility was the issue. Although invaluable evidence adversely affecting A.W.\u2019s credibility was available at trial, the defendants\u2019 attorney did not present it. He was incompetent in failing to have done so.</p> <p id=\"b661-5\" pgmap=\"661\">At the defendants\u2019 sentencing hearing on December 30, 1985, the defendants\u2019 post-trial retained attorneys presented two letters from A.W.\u2019s grammar school teachers, both of which stated that A.W. was not worthy of belief. The defendants contend that these unbiased public servants, guardians of our youth, were in a far superior, exposed and unrestricted position to evaluate A.W.\u2019s credibility than the limited, restricted trial atmosphere of the trial judge. One letter stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b661-6\" pgmap=\"661\">\u201cTo Whom It May Concern:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b661-7\" pgmap=\"661\">I was [A.W.\u2019s] seventh grade teacher at O\u2019Toole Elementary School.

On numerous occasions, I found her to become an inveterate liar. It appeared to me that she was having a difficult time dealing with reality. This personality deficit was so severe that in layman\u2019s terms she would in a second become Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. These severe swings sincerely caused personal consternation. Her thwarted attempts to manipulate resulted in behavior difficult for me to describe.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b661-8\" pgmap=\"661\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b661-9\" pgmap=\"661\">[A.W.] is in need of pre-adolescent psychological counseling.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b661-10\" pgmap=\"661\">Respectfully submitted,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Akh\" pgmap=\"661\">/S/ Mrs. Arline D.

The defendants\u2019 counsel was incompetent in not presenting at defendant\u2019s trial this pertinent and favorable testimony of these teachers of A.W.\u2019s lack of credibility and veracity.</p> <p id=\"b662-5\" pgmap=\"662\">B</p> <p id=\"b662-6\" pgmap=\"662\">A.W. additionally testified on direct examination that in June 1985 she was taken to and examined at a hospital. The prosecutor did not present evidence of A.W.\u2019s hospital examination, and when the defendants\u2019 counsel inquired on cross-examination if her hospital examination revealed whether she \u201chad been penetrated,\u201d strangely, the prosecutor objected:</p> <blockquote id=\"b662-7\" pgmap=\"662\">\u201cQ. Now after Mr. Williams had the intercourse with you were you taken to a doctor or taken to a hospital for treatment or observation?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-8\" pgmap=\"662\">A. In June 1985 I was.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-9\" pgmap=\"662\">Q.

No. I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b662-13\" pgmap=\"662\">If defendants\u2019 counsel examination of the hospital records revealed that A.W. \u201chad not been penetrated,\u201d he had a valid basis for asking the question and he should have pursued the inquiry. Such records would have contradicted A.W.\u2019s testimony and defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement, the facts of which he contends were supplied by the police officer, that he had inserted his penis in A.W.\u2019s vagina for 10 minutes. On the other hand, if defendants\u2019 counsel had no basis for asking the question, he should not have asked it. Additionally, it would seem that the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the question indicated that the prosecutor was aware that the hospital records revealed that A.W. \u201chad not been penetrated,\u201d which, thus, contradicted A.W.\u2019s testimony and the content of defendant Roy Williams' statement that he had inserted his penis in her vagina for 10 minutes. It is reasonable to surmise that the prosecutor knew that the hospital examination revealed that A.W. \u201chad not been penetrated\u201d and therefore he did not offer the hospital records in evidence, and, for that reason he also objected to defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s inquiry in that area.</p> <p id=\"b662-14\" pgmap=\"662\">Defendants\u2019 counsel further pursued this inquiry, and oddly, the prosecutor further persisted in his objection:</p> <blockquote id=\"b662-15\" pgmap=\"662\">\u201cQ. Who was that that examined you?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-16\" pgmap=\"662\">A. A doctor.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b662-17\" pgmap=\"662\">Q. At what place?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b663-4\" pgmap=\"663\">A. In University of Chicago Hospital.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b663-5\" pgmap=\"663\">Q. So the University of Chicago found that you had not been penetrated, is that right\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b663-6\" pgmap=\"663\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b663-7\" pgmap=\"663\">THE COURT: Sustain the objection. The facts are not in evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b663-8\" pgmap=\"663\">Without passing on the validity of this ruling or the validity of the basis therefor by the trial court, it is apparent from the foregoing and the facts of the case that defendants\u2019 attorney should have persisted in further inquiry and presented the defendants\u2019 own evidence of the examining physician and hospital records on this subject area. He was incompetent in failing to do so.</p> <p id=\"b663-9\" pgmap=\"663\">C</p> <p id=\"b663-10\" pgmap=\"663\">Defendants\u2019 counsel neglected to present the favorable testimony of the other six residents who were in the house when A.W. stated the sex acts were committed. Defendants argue that A.W.\u2019s testimony of their commission of the sex acts upon her and A.W.\u2019s testimony of A.W. and codefendant Emmaline Williams parading nude in the house in which A.W. admitted that Tanya Bergen and A.W.\u2019s siblings, Karen Williams and Dwight Williams, were present and in which defendant Roy Williams testified, without contradiction, that nine people lived at the time, is unworthy of belief. Defendants contend that their trial counsel was incompetent in not presenting the testimony of Tanya Bergen, Karen Williams and Dwight Williams and the other residents in the house to substantiate and corroborate their denials of the commission of the criminal acts attributed to them.</p> <p id=\"b663-11\" pgmap=\"663\">D</p> <p id=\"b663-12\" pgmap=\"663(141) 664(69)\">The defendants\u2019 attorney failed to present at trial favorable evidence of the defendants\u2019 background. The defendants\u2019 attorney did not present at trial the following favorable evidence, which would have enhanced defendant Roy Williams\u2019 credibility as a trial witness, but which was belatedly presented by his new attorney at the sentencing hearing. Defendant Roy Williams was 57 years of age and had no prior criminal record. He had lived in Chicago since 1941. He served honorably in the United States military from 1951 to 1953 and was honorably discharged. He had an employment work history until a few years previously when he was placed on disability, and he was a diabetic. Throughout the years he had been repeatedly investigated, approved and licensed by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to provide, and that he had provided, foster homes for many children, three of whom he legally adopted. There had been no complaint regarding the children of any kind against him by the Department or by any other agency or person. The pastor of his church testified at his sentencing hearing that defendant Roy Williams was a good standing member and officer in the church and that his reputation for good character in the community was excellent.</p> <p id=\"b664-5\" pgmap=\"664\">The defendants\u2019 attorney failed to present at trial the following favorable evidence which would have enhanced codefendant Emmaline Williams\u2019 credibility as a trial witness. This evidence was tardily presented by her new attorney at her sentencing hearing. Codefendant Emmaline Williams was 45 years of age and had no prior criminal record. She had been steadily employed most of her adult life. She, too, and her home, had been investigated, approved and licensed by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services for the placement of 13 foster children in her home, several of whom were adopted by her under the auspices of the Department. She was a licensed foster parent. Her clergyman related that Mrs. Williams was president of her church choir, a church official, helped in Sunday school and that she regularly attended church. Her clergyman further related that Mrs. Williams\u2019 reputation in the community for good character was excellent.</p> <p id=\"b664-6\" pgmap=\"664\">The defendants\u2019 trial counsel was incompetent in not presenting at trial this favorable evidence of the defendants\u2019 background bearing upon their credibility as witnesses.</p> <p id=\"b664-7\" pgmap=\"664\">IX</p> <p id=\"b664-8\" pgmap=\"664\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 COUNSEL DID NOT OBJECT TO THE ADMISSION OF IRRELEVANT PREJUDICIAL TESTIMONY ABOUT THE COMPLAINT FOR A SEARCH WARRANT AND THE SEARCH WARRANT.</p> <p id=\"b664-9\" pgmap=\"664(115) 665(41)\">Predicated on his conversation with A.W., Officer Lux on June 17, 1985, subscribed, swore to and presented to a judge a complaint for the issuance of a search warrant to search the defendants\u2019 home. Practically every legal objection imaginable was available to prohibit admission of testimony about the complaint and search warrant as evidence against the defendants on trial for the commission of offenses allegedly committed in April 1984, 15 months previously. The complaint and search warrant were irrelevant as evidence. More importantly, the complaint for the search warrant contained rank, prejudicial, irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay of the defendants\u2019 commission of unrelated offenses for which the defendants were not on trial. Yet, the defendants\u2019 attorney neglected to object to this testimony. The complaint for the search warrant in pertinent part is set forth in the following appendix No. 2. The defendants contend that it reads more like fantasized fiction than possible realistic facts.</p> <p id=\"b665-5\" pgmap=\"665\">Codefendant Emmaline Williams testified on cross-examination, without any objection from defendants\u2019 counsel:</p> <blockquote id=\"b665-6\" pgmap=\"665\">\u201cQ.

He did not give me that.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b665-20\" pgmap=\"665\">Not being satisfied with having successfully elicited this foregoing irrelevant prejudicial testimony about the search warrant from codefendant Emmaline Williams, the prosecutor went further and elicited additional inadmissible testimony about the search warrant from Officer Lux on rebuttal, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b665-21\" pgmap=\"665\">\u201cQ. *** [Wjhen you went to arrest Emmaline Williams did you have a search warrant for the premises at that house?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b665-22\" pgmap=\"665\">A.

Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b666-6\" pgmap=\"666\">Q. And that was Emmaline Williams?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b666-7\" pgmap=\"666\">A. Yes, it was.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b666-8\" pgmap=\"666\">From the totality of the pretrial, the trial, and the post-trial proceedings in the case at bar, as previously herein set forth, it is clear, there can be no doubt, and it cannot be seriously or persuasively debated to the contrary that the defendants did not receive competent legal representation on their trial.</p> <p id=\"b666-9\" pgmap=\"666\">X</p> <p id=\"b666-10\" pgmap=\"666\">THE DEFENDANTS WERE DENIED THEIR FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL BY THEIR ATTORNEYS\u2019 INCOMPETENT AND INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE.</p> <p id=\"b666-11\" pgmap=\"666\">The majority mistakenly rely on People v. Harris (1988), 123 Ill. 2d 113, as authority for rejecting the defendants\u2019 valid and well-founded claim that their trial attorney was incompetent. I, too, rely on Harris as authority that their trial attorney was incompetent, and patently so.</p> <p id=\"b666-12\" pgmap=\"666\">In Harris, the multiple defendants were felony inmates of a State penal institution. They were also gang members and were convicted of murdering a felony, rival gang member inmate. Harris contended for reversal that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel (1) \u201cinadequately handled the situation regarding a juror,\u201d with whom a counselor in the penal institution had communicated about the case; (2) inadequately cross-examined key prosecution witnesses; and (3) presented an inadequate closing argument. The supreme court significantly noted, \u201cIn deciding this issue [of denial of the effective assistance of counsel], we note that each of these defendants was individually represented,\u201d (123 Ill. 2d at 150) unlike in the case at bar. (Emphasis added.) 123 Ill. 2d at 150.</p> <p id=\"b666-13\" pgmap=\"666(86) 667(105)\">The Harris court relied on the two-part test for adjudicating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which was pronounced in Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052, in rejecting Harris\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Harris court pointed out that to establish ineffective counsel under the Strickland test, a defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was so seriously deficient that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) the deficient performance so prejudiced the defense that it denied the defendant a fair trial. The Harris court additionally pointed out that the Strickland test requires a defendant to demonstrate that \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding, would have been different.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) (Harris, 123 Ill. 2d at 155, quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.) This requirement is counterfactual, which, by definition, defies proof. Obviously, the Strickland court recognized this impossibility, for the Strickland court immediately explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b667-5\" pgmap=\"667\">\u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</blockquote> <p id=\"b667-6\" pgmap=\"667\">Under the foregoing two-prong Strickland test, relied on in Harris, there can be no doubt, and there is no ratiorial doubt, that based upon the hereinbefore mentioned facts and circumstances, the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s performance in the case at bar was so seriously deficient that it falls below any objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. Likewise, there can be no doubt, and there is no valid doubt, that the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s deficient performance so prejudiced the defense as to deny the defendants a fair trial. Because of defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, there is indeed an abundant reasonable probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the case.</p> <p id=\"b667-7\" pgmap=\"667\">The Harris court further noted that, under Strickland, a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and that the challenged action might have been counsel\u2019s trial strategy. (Harris, 123 Ill. 2d at 155.) There is no rational process by which the defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s previously noted and complained-of conduct in the case at bar can be considered or construed as reasonable professional assistance or sound trial strategy.</p> <p id=\"b667-8\" pgmap=\"667(109) 668(72)\">The supreme court announced in Harris, [Defendant Harris has not shown that his trial counsel was incompetent. *** Defense counsel provided Harris with an adequate defense, and nothing he did resulted in prejudice to the defendant or would have changed the outcome of the trial.\u201d (123 Ill. 2d at 158.) Application of these tests in Harris compels reversal of the defendants\u2019 convictions in the case at bar and a new trial. These defendants have abundantly shown that their trial counsel was incompetent. He did not provide either defendant with any defense. The defendants have overwhelmingly demonstrated that their trial counsel\u2019s actions and inactions \u201cresulted in prejudice to the defendants.\u201d Perhaps the defendants have not shown, and perhaps they cannot ever show, that \u201cnothing he did *** would have changed the outcome of the trial,\u201d as stated in Harris. (Emphasis added.) (123 Ill. 2d at 158.) But the defendants have clearly shown that had their attorney properly done what their attorney did not do, it would, and most assuredly could, have changed the outcome of the trial.</p> <p id=\"b668-5\" pgmap=\"668\">In the case at bar, the defendants\u2019 counsel failed: (1) to file a pretrial discovery motion; (2) to familiarize himself with and utilize the pretrial discovery material voluntarily furnished him by the State; (3) to make a motion to suppress defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement; (4) to make a motion for severance on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams; (5) to object on behalf of codefendant Emmaline Williams to the admission of defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement into evidence; (6) to move the trial court to confine its consideration of defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement to him; (7) to move the trial court not to consider defendant Roy Williams\u2019 statement as evidence against codefendant Emmaline Williams;\" (8) to learn of the existence, in his own file, of A.W.\u2019s prejudicial, inadmissible hearsay statement, People\u2019s exhibit No. 1; (9) to object to the admission of A.W.\u2019s prejudicial, inadmissible hearsay statement into evidence; (10) (he did not know and he could not have known) to cross-examine A.W. on the flagrant inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions between her trial testimony and her statement; (11) to present evidence which would have adversely affected A.W.\u2019s credibility as a witness; (12) to present evidence which would have enhanced the defendants\u2019 credibility as witnesses; (13) to present hospital records, the testimony of Tanya Bergen and other favorable evidence on behalf of defendants; (14) to object to the admissions of search warrant testimony and other prejudicial inadmissible evidence admitted against the defendants; (15) to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper arguments; and (16) to make proper argument. During the entire pretrial, trial and post-trial proceedings, the defendants\u2019 attorney objected only five times, one of which he apologized for making, one was sustained and three were overruled. The incompetent performance of the defendants\u2019 counsel in the case at bar was far more egregious than was the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s incompetent performance in Kimmelman v. Morrison (1986), 447 U.S. 365, 90 L. Ed. 2d 305, 106 S. Ct. 2574, in which, for that reason, the defendants\u2019 conviction for the rape of a 15-year-old girl acquaintance was invalidated. For the same reason, the defendants\u2019 convictions in the case at bar should be likewise invalidated.</p> <p id=\"b668-6\" pgmap=\"668(10) 669(207)\">In Kimmelman, the victim testified that the defendant, her employer, took her to his apartment, where he forced her into his bed and raped her. Upon returning home the victim told her mother what had happened. The police were summoned, and the victim accompanied them to the defendant\u2019s apartment, into which they were admitted by another tenant in the building. The officers seized the sheet from the defendant\u2019s bed. The defendant\u2019s attorney failed to file a pretrial discovery motion, and he also failed to file a motion to suppress the sheet as evidence because he did not know of its seizure or of the State\u2019s intent to use it as evidence. The sheet was admitted as evidence against the defendant. The defendant was convicted. The defendant contested the constitutional validity of his conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding in the Federal court on the ground that his trial attorney\u2019s failure to have filed a pretrial discovery motion, and particularly his failure to have filed a motion to suppress the sheet, on the ground that it was seized in violation of his fourth amendment constitutional right to be secure in his home against unreasonable search and seizure, denied him his sixth amendment constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b669-5\" pgmap=\"669\">\u201cWhere a State obtains a criminal conviction in a trial in which the accused is deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, the \u2018State *** unconstitutionally deprives the defendant of his liberty.\u2019 [Citation.] The defendant is thus \u2018in custody in violation of the Constitution\u2019 ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b669-6\" pgmap=\"669\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b669-7\" pgmap=\"669\">*** \u2018Counsel *** has a duty to bring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.\u2019 [Citation.] *** Because that testing process generally will not function properly unless defense counsel has done some investigation into the prosecution\u2019s case and into various defense strategies, we noted that \u2018counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations ***.\u2019 [Citation.] ***</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b669-8\" pgmap=\"669\">The trial record in this case clearly reveals that Morrison\u2019s attorney failed to file a timely suppression motion, not due to strategic considerations, but because, until the first day of trial, he was unaware of the search and of the State\u2019s intention to introduce the bedsheet into evidence.

In the case at bar, just as the Supreme Court concluded in Kimmelman v. Morrison, \u201cAt the time Morrison\u2019s attorney decided not to request any discovery, he did not \u2014 and, because he did not ask, could not \u2014 know what the State\u2019s case would be. *** We therefore agree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the assistance rendered respondent by his trial counsel was constitutionally deficient.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 477 U.S. at 387, 91 L.

(State v. Sneed (1974), 284 N.C. 606, 610, 201 S.E.2d 867, 869-70.) The defendants\u2019 said constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel were violated by their single attorney\u2019s representation of both defendants in their joint trial where the defendants had conflicting, inconsistent, antagonistic or adverse concerns, rights or interests. A review in chronological sequence of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and the supreme court of Illinois defines and proclaims this constitutional principle.</p> <p id=\"b671-5\" pgmap=\"671\">In Glasser v. United States (1941), 315 U.S. 60, 86 L. Ed. 680, 62 S. Ct. 457, a multiple-defendant trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court appointed his attorney to also represent a codefendant, in spite of notice to the trial court that their interests may be conflicting or inconsistent. Both were convicted. On appeal, the defendant contended for reversal that his attorney\u2019s simultaneous representation of him and a codefendant during their joint trial embarrassed and inhibited his attorney\u2019s conduct of his defense and prevented him from adequately safeguarding the defendant\u2019s right to have incompetent evidence excluded and from fully cross-examining the witnesses for the prosecution. The Supreme Court agreed and held, \u201c[T]he \u2018assistance of counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment contemplates that such assistance be untrammeled and unimpaired by a court order requiring that one lawyer shall simultaneously represent conflicting interests. If the right to the assistance of counsel means less than this, a valued constitutional safeguard is substantially impaired.\u201d (315 U.S. at 70, 86 L. Ed. at 699, 62 S. Ct. at 465.) The Glasser court further held that, \u201cTo preserve the protection of the Bill of Rights for hard-pressed defendants, we indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental rights\u201d (315 U.S. at 70, 86 L. Ed. at 699, 62 S. Ct. at 465), and that, \u201c[u]pon the trial judge rests the duty of seeing that the trial is conducted with solicitude for the essential rights of the accused ***. *** The trial court should protect the right of an accused to have the assistance of counsel\u201d (315 U.S. at 71, 86 L. Ed. at 699, 62 S. Ct. at 465).</p> <p id=\"b671-6\" pgmap=\"671(142) 672(51)\">In Glasser, similar to the case at bar, the defendant argued that certain testimony, inadmissible as to him, was allowed into evidence without objection by his attorney on his behalf because his attorney desired to avoid prejudice to the codefendant. The Supreme Court pointed out that the single attorney \u201cstruggle[d] to serve two masters\u201d (315 U.S. at 75, 86 L. Ed. at 702, 62 S. Ct. at 467) during the defendant and codefendant\u2019s joint trial and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction because the attorney\u2019s dual representation denied the defendant\u2019s right to have the effective assistance of counsel, guaranteed by the sixth amendment. The court concluded that it was unnecessary to determine if the defendant was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s joint representation of the codefendant because \u201c[t]he right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial,\" and that \u201cit is especially important that [defendant] be given the benefit of the undivided assistance of his counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 315 U.S. at 76, 86 L. Ed. at 702, 62 S. Ct. at 467-68.</p> <p id=\"b672-5\" pgmap=\"672\">Although in Glasser, the attorney represented the codefendant by court appointment, whereas in the case at bar the attorney apparently was retained by the defendant and codefendant, the hereinafter discussed authorities decided subsequent to Glasser point out that such distinction is without merit.</p> <p id=\"b672-6\" pgmap=\"672\">The three defendants were convicted of rape and robbery in Holloway v. Arkansas (1978), 435 U.S. 475, 55 L. Ed. 2d 426, 98 S. Ct. 1173. Harold Hall, a public defender, was appointed to represent all three defendants. The defendants\u2019 several and repeated motions, presented by Hall, for appointment of separate counsel for each defendant, because of \u201ca possibility of a conflict of interest in each of their cases,\u201d were denied. (435 U.S. at 477, 55 L. Ed. 2d at 430, 98 S. Ct. at 1175.) The Supreme Court pointed out in Holloway its holding of \u201c[m]ore than 35 years ago in Glasser\u201d (435 U.S. at 481, 55 L. Ed. 2d at 432, 98 S. Ct. at 1177) that the multiple defendants\u2019 single attorney \u201cfocused explicitly on the probable risk of a conflict of interests. The trial judge then failed either to appoint separate counsel or to take adequate steps to ascertain whether the risk was too remote to warrant separate counsel. We hold that the failure *** deprived petitioners of the guarantee of \u2018assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d (435 U.S. at 484, 55 L. Ed. 2d at 434, 98 S. Ct. at 1178-79.) The Supreme Court additionally held in Holloway:</p> <blockquote id=\"b672-7\" pgmap=\"672\"> [Djefense attorneys have the obligation, upon discovering a conflict of interests, to advise the courts at once of the problem.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b672-9\" pgmap=\"672\"> *** Glasser requires reversal, even in the absence of a showing of specific prejudice to the complaining codefendant, whenever a trial court improperly permits or requires joint representation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b672-11\" pgmap=\"672\"> *** [T]he assistance of counsel is among those \u2018constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u2019</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b672-14\" pgmap=\"672(22) 673(34)\"> *** [A] rule requiring a defendant to show that a conflict of interests *** prejudiced him in some specific fashion would not be susceptible of intelligent, even handed application.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 435 U.S. at 485, 487, 489, 490, 55 L.

For example, in this case it may well have precluded defense counsel for Campbell from exploring possible plea negotiations and the possibility of an agreement to testify for the prosecution, provided a lesser charge or a favorable sentencing recommendation would be acceptable. Generally speaking, a conflict may also prevent an attorney from challenging the admission of evidence prejudicial to one client but perhaps favorable to another, or from arguing at the sentencing hearing the relative involvement and culpability of his clients in order to minimize the culpability of one by emphasizing that of another. Examples can be readily multiplied. The mere physical presence of an attorney does not fulfill the Sixth Amendment guarantee when the advocate\u2019s conflicting obligations have effectively sealed his lips on crucial matters. *** [I]n a case \u2022 of joint representation of conflicting interests the evil \u2014 it bears repeating \u2014 is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to refrain from doing, not only at trial but also as to possible pretrial plea negotiations and in the sentencing process.\u201d' (Emphasis in original.) 435 U.S. at 489-90, 55 L. Ed. 2d at 438, 98 S. Ct. at 1181-82.</p> <p id=\"b673-6\" pgmap=\"673\">That the multiple-defendants\u2019 attorney was appointed by the court and requested appointment of separate counsel in Holloway, unlike in the case at bar, is no valid distinction for not applying Holloway to the case at bar.</p> <p id=\"b673-7\" pgmap=\"673\">Following Holloway, the supreme court of Illinois decided People v. Franklin (1979), 75 Ill. 2d 173, 179, which the court noted did \u201cnot involve the Holloway issue of joint representation of codefendants,\u201d but rather, a defense attorney\u2019s representation of a defendant who he had some years previously prosecuted as an assistant State\u2019s Attorney in an unrelated case. The court held however, \u201cThis court has repeatedly stated that a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel entitles the person represented to the undivided loyalty of counsel and prohibits a defense attorney from representing conflicting interests or undertaking the discharge of inconsistent obligations. [Citations.] In furtherance of this fundamental right, this court has adopted a per se rule which provides essentially that where defense counsel is involved in an actual or potential conflict of interest, it is unnecessary for the defendant to establish actual prejudice, as prejudice is presumed by law.\u201d 75 Ill. 2d at 176.</p> <p id=\"b674-4\" pgmap=\"674\">After Franklin, the supreme court decided Cuyler v. Sullivan (1980), 446 U.S. 335, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333, 100 S. Ct. 1708, which involved the sixth amendment constitutional validity of multiple-defendant representation at their separate State murder trials by their same two privately retained attorneys, without objection, raised in a collateral habeas corpus proceeding in the Federal court. The court of appeals held that \u201ca criminal defendant is entitled to reversal of his conviction whenever he makes \u2018some showing of a possible conflict of interest or prejudice, however remote ***.\u2019 \u201d (446 U.S. at 340, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 341, 100 S. Ct. at 1714.) The supreme court stated the issue before it was \u201cwhether the mere possibility of a conflict of interest warrants the conclusion that the defendant was deprived of his right to counsel.\u201d (446 U.S. at 345, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 344, 100 S. Ct. at 1716.) The court noted that \u201c[djefense counsel have an ethical obligation to avoid conflicting representations and to advise the court promptly when a conflict of interest arises during the course of trial.\u201d (446 U.S. at 346, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 345, 100 S. Ct. at 1717.) Such conflicts obviously existed in the case at bar, but defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s incompetent performance clearly demonstrates that he was too incompetent to recognize them. The Cuyler Court observed that, under Holloway, multiple-defendant representation violates the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel if \u201cit gives rise to a conflict of interest,\u201d and that a defendant, even though he may not have voiced any objection during the trial to the multiple representation, need only \u201cdemonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d (446 U.S. at 348, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 346-47, 100 S. Ct. at 1718.) The Supreme Court concluded in Cuyler:</p> <blockquote id=\"b674-5\" pgmap=\"674\">\u201cGlasser established that unconstitutional multiple representation is never harmless error. Once the Court concluded that Glasser\u2019s lawyer had an actual conflict of interest, it refused \u2018to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice\u2019 attributable to the conflict. The conflict itself demonstrated a denial of the \u2018right to have the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 315 U.S. at 76, 86 L. Ed. at 680, 62 S. Ct. at 457. Thus, a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need not demonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 446 U.S, at 349-50, 64 L. Ed. 2d at 347,100 S. Ct. at 1719.</blockquote> <p id=\"b674-6\" pgmap=\"674(33) 675(37)\">Because the court of appeals in Cuyler improperly held that the defendant was entitled to relief because he had shown that the multiple representation involved only a possible conflict of interest, rather than an actual conflict of interest, adversely affecting his lawyer\u2019s performance, and did not weigh these conflicting contentions under the proper legal standard, the Supreme Court remanded the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b675-5\" pgmap=\"675\">Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052, previously discussed herein, followed Cuyler. Strickland, however, did not involve the conflicts of multiple representation under the sixth amendment right to counsel. Rather, Strickland involved the competency of counsel during a guilty plea proceeding with regard to the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, Strickland need not be here discussed on the impact of a single attorney\u2019s representation of multiple defendants with conflicting interests on the defendants\u2019 sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p> <p id=\"b675-6\" pgmap=\"675\">After Cuyler, the supreme court of Illinois decided People v. Washington (1984), 101 Ill. 2d 104, in which the defendant claimed a violation of his sixth amendment right to loyal counsel because he was represented in his Chicago murder trial, with his knowledge and approval, by an attorney who was also a prosecutor in Chicago Heights, whose police officers testified adversely to his interest at his pretrial motion to suppress which challenged the validity of his arrest by them. Although Washington did not involve conflicts arising out of multiple representation by the same attorney, as did Cuyler, nevertheless the supreme court relied upon, cited and extremely quoted from Cuyler in upholding the defendant\u2019s contention. The court held that it would \u201cindulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of a constitutional right,\u201d (101 Ill. 2d at 114) and concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b675-7\" pgmap=\"675\">\u201cThe assistance of counsel means assistance which entitles an accused to the undivided loyalty of his counsel and which prohibits the attorney from representing conflicting interests or undertaking the discharge of inconsistent obligations. (People v. Franklin (1979), 75 Ill. 2d 173; People v. Kester (1977), 66 Ill. 2d 162; People v. Stoval (1968), 40 Ill. 2d 109.) In order to assure and protect these rights, the defendant need not show prejudice in order to justify a reversal of his conviction if the attorney representing him has an actual or possible conflict of professional interests. Glasser v. United States (1942), 315 U.S. 60, 86 L. Ed. 680, 62 S. Ct. 457 ***.\u201d 101 Ill. 2d at 110.</blockquote> <p id=\"b675-8\" pgmap=\"675(44) 676(114)\">The Washington court noted that in People v. Stoval (1968), 40 Ill. 2d 109, the defendants\u2019 court-appointed lawyer, individually and as a member of a law firm, had previously represented the corporation which owned, and the operator of, the jewelry store that the defendant was alleged to have burglarized. In reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction the court stated that it was concerned by the subliminal effects of the conflict on counsel and held that sound public policy prohibits representation by an attorney with such a possible conflict of interests. The Washington court further observed that in Stoval the court cited Glasser and stated that in such a case \u201cthere is no necessity for the defendant to show prejudice\u201d (Washington, 101 Ill. 2d at 110) and that Stoval was referred to as establishing a per se rule in People v. Coslet (1977), 67 Ill. 2d 127. Then quoting from Cuyler, the court concluded in Washington:</p> <blockquote id=\"b676-5\" pgmap=\"676\">\u201cThe State contends that we should not apply our per se rule on attorney conflicts of interest in light of Cuyler ***. The State, in urging us not to apply the so-called per se test, but to adopt the \u2018actual conflict\u2019 test in Cuyler overlooks the fact that Cuyler involved multiple representation of defendants. *** In cases where codefendants are jointly represented by one attorney, a defendant must demonstrate \u2018an actual conflict of interest manifested at trial\u2019 in order to claim a denial of effective assistance of counsel. [Citations.] When an actual conflict has been shown, it is unnecessary to demonstrate prejudice in order to sustain a claim of violation of the right to the assistance of counsel. (Holloway v. Arkansas (1978), 435 U.S. 475, 55 L. Ed. 2d 426, 98 S. Ct. 1173; Glasser v. United States (1942), 315 U.S. 60, 86 L. Ed. 680, 62 S. Ct. 457; People v.

(Illinois v. Washington (1984), 469 U.S. 1022, 83 L. Ed. 2d 367, 105 S. Ct. 422.) Justice White dissented from the denial of certiorari in a written opinion, in which Chief Justice Berger and Justice Rehnquist joined. Justice White\u2019s dissenting opinion significantly observed that \u201c[i]n Cuyler v. Sullivan (1980), 446 U.S. 335, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333, 100 S.

In the present case, [People v. Washington (1984), 101 Ill. 2d 104,] the Illinois Supreme Court held that Cuyler\u2019s actual conflict-of-interest standard was limited to multiple-representation situations. [Citation.] Because that holding is contrary to the results reached by at least six other courts, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.\u201d (469 U.S. at 1022, 83 L. Ed. 2d at 367, 105 S. Ct. at 442 (White, J., dissenting).) After further noting in his dissenting opinion that the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts had held in Washington that the defendant was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel because of his attorney\u2019s conflicting interest, Justice White stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b677-5\" pgmap=\"677\">\u201cThe Illinois Supreme Court adhered to the longstanding view that as a matter of federal constitutional law even a potential conflict of interest required a reversal, rejecting the State\u2019s contention that Cuyler v.

The trial court noted the inconsistencies in the two statements and called them to the attention of their joint attorney, who responded that he had not recognized the gravity of the conflicts in the two statements. Thereupon the prosecutor asked defense counsel to explain the precise nature of the conflict. The defendants\u2019 counsel was unable to clearly do so. In affirming the defendants\u2019 convictions, the supreme court significantly pointed out:</p> <blockquote id=\"b678-7\" pgmap=\"678(132) 679(36)\">\u201c[T]he issue of a conflict was first raised sua sponte by the trial court after Jones\u2019 statement was read into evidence by an assistant State\u2019s Attorney.

As the trial proceeded only Jones testified, and he repudiated his earlier statement inculpating Harris and gave testimony corroborating Harris\u2019 exculpatory post-arrest statement. At the close of the People\u2019s case, the court invited defense counsel to move for mistrial if they thought a conflict was present. When proceedings resumed the next day, defense counsel moved for mistrial, but based the motion largely on certain surprise testimony of the victim. While the conflict issue was obliquely referred to, counsel failed to articulate the nature of the conflict, and the motion for mistrial was denied.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b679-5\" pgmap=\"679\">Based upon this record, we find that the actions and comments of defense counsel were insufficient assertions of a conflict of interest to merit reversal under Holloway ***.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b679-6\" pgmap=\"679\">*** [D]efense counsel did not seek severance or appointment of separate counsel.

Ross and People v. Mosely were consolidated before the supreme court in Jones. Ross and Mosely were charged with the robbery-murder of a pizza deliveryman. In their separate pretrial statements each admitted his involvement as a lookout but attributed the actual murder to the other. At trial Ross and Mosely were represented by the same attorney. No severance motion was made. Defense counsel, in his opening statement, briefly commented that the defendants\u2019 statements were merely \u201cinconsistent.\u201d During his presentation of the defense, defense counsel urged that both defendants\u2019 statements were coerced and that neither defendant had been involved in the shooting. Mosely so testified. Ross did not testify. Both were convicted. The appellate court reversed. The supreme court concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b679-11\" pgmap=\"679\">\u201c[W]e find that a conflict existed which was apparently resolved to Mosley\u2019s detriment.

It is enough to say that that decision did not operate to Mosley\u2019s benefit, and that counsel with no conflict, perhaps at separate trials, would surely have proceeded differently. If Ross\u2019 statement was not to be repudiated, counsel with no conflict would have at least sought to impeach it. We therefore find that a conflict of interest arose which manifested itself at trial to Mosley\u2019s detriment. The presence in evidence of Ross\u2019 statement implicating Mosley violated Mosley\u2019s right to confrontation. (See Bruton v. United States (1968), 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S.

After a jury found Van Cleve and his codefendant guilty of rape and unlawful restraint, the trial court set aside the verdicts and entered judgments of acquittal notwithstanding the verdicts.

Justice Clark further stated, \u201cI believe the majority\u2019s stance on this issue is dangerous because it limits our power to interpret our own State Constitution in the future. *** Under the majority\u2019s analysis, this court would be precluded from protecting the civil liberties of Illinois citizens should the United States Supreme Court decide to consistently favor police efficiency over the rights of the accused,\u201d (103 Ill. 2d at 259 (Clark, J., concurring)) and concluded:</p> <blockquote id=\"b684-6\" pgmap=\"684\">\u201cToday, the United States Supreme Court has been cutting back on the individual liberties *** while State supreme courts have attempted to protect civil liberties in State constitutions.

Stat. 1987, ch. 38, par. 115 \u2014 1), in effect conferred upon the State the right to a jury trial in certain alleged narcotics violation cases. Article I, section 13, of the 1970 Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a713) provides that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury as heretofore enjoyed shall remain inviolate.\u201d The trial judge, the Honorable Donald S. Joyce, denied the State a jury trial under section 115 \u2014 1 on the ground that said section violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial and his concomitant right to waive his right to trial by jury. The State requested the supreme court to compel Judge Joyce to grant its request for a jury trial. The supreme court denied the State\u2019s request and noted that the right to trial by jury is guaranteed by similar provisions of the Federal Constitution, the sixth amendment, and the State Constitution, article I, section 13. The supreme court noted further that Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, similar to section 115 \u2014 1 of the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure, also in effect conferred upon the government in criminal cases the right to a trial by jury and that Federal Rule 23(a) was held by the United States Supreme Court to be nonviolative of a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment jury trial right in Singer v. United States (1965), 380 U.S. 24, 13 L. Ed. 2d 630, 85 S. Ct. 783. The State in Joyce urged the same interpretation of the similar Illinois Constitution provision by the Illinois Supreme Court. The court rejected the State\u2019s argument, declined to do so, and in holding that section 115 \u2014 1, conferring on the State a jury trial right, violated a defendant\u2019s Illinois constitutional right to a jury trial and his right to waive such right, stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b687-5\" pgmap=\"687\">\u201cThis court\u2019s analysis, however, is not limited to Federal constitutional principles.

The Supreme Court of the United States successfully delayed the implementation of these rights by a prolonged and outright hostility in interpreting the fourteenth amendment. Nevertheless, there is presently no valid doubt that the fourteenth amendment now confers the cherished Federal constitutional Bill of Rights on those persons who were previously denied them and it prohibits the States from transgressing these rights. Because of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretations and procrastinations, however, it has taken over 100 years for the fourteenth amendment to accomplish this intended and desired result. For State courts by their own interpretation of their own State constitutional provisions to now restrict State constitutional rights to an interpretation of a more limited right by the United States Supreme Court of a similar Federal constitutional provision would be a most undesired and ill-conceived aberration.</p> <p id=\"b689-5\" pgmap=\"689\">Under the foregoing authorities of Glasser, Holloway, Franklin, Cuyler, Strickland, Stoval, Washington, Jones, Van Cleve, Gates, Ex-line, Tisler, Duncan and Joyce, it is clear that Illinois courts may interpret and construe, and I do interpret and construe the rights of the defendants in the case at bar to counsel, guaranteed by article I, section 8, of the Illinois Constitution (and the sixth amendment to the United States Constitution), to have been violated by their attorney\u2019s multiple representation of them, because his performance on behalf of each of them was adversely affected by an actual conflict of interests between the defendants, and between the defendants and him, and that the defendants need not have shown prejudice therefrom, although they have abundantly done so.</p> <p id=\"b689-6\" pgmap=\"689\">It is also clear from the various trial inadequacies and deficiencies of defendants\u2019 attorney, as previously set forth herein, that he did not give, and indeed he was absolutely prevented from giving, his total commitment, his unswerving loyalty, and his unyielding dedication to protecting, pursuing and enforcing the rights and interests of each defendant during their joint trial. Predicated on the foregoing authorities, the defendants\u2019 right to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, made binding on the States by the fourteenth amendment, and the defendants\u2019 right to counsel provided in article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois were violated. The defendants\u2019 convictions should therefore be reversed and they are entitled to a new trial. Accordingly, I dissent.</p> <p id=\"b690-4\" pgmap=\"690\">APPENDIX</p> <p id=\"b690-5\" pgmap=\"690\">THE VICTIM, A.W.\u2019S STATEMENT PEOPLE\u2019S EXHIBIT NO. 1</p> <p id=\"b690-6\" pgmap=\"690\">\u201cApril of 1984 \u2014 that night \u2014 blue pants, with a light green top \u2014 exactly 12:15 \u2014 when I left the room 3:15.</p> <p id=\"b690-7\" pgmap=\"690\">Wednesday \u2014 The day before I was suspended from school.

Please A.W. she said. Then said, \u2018Moma love you.\u2019 I was at the age of 13 in the 8th grade. She said will you do it. But she didn\u2019t tell me what. I said o.k. I\u2019ll do it.

Then she said don\u2019t be so hard on her. Just play with her. And I still wouldn\u2019t act right. Then he asked me didn\u2019t it feel good. I said no. He said we\u2019re going to be nice to you. Then she said over the weekend I will let you sleep longer. I didn\u2019t say anything. Then he said me and your moma we love you. We\u2019re still going to buy a typewriter for you. Then she said when we move to Martin, Arkansas we\u2019re going to have our own barbeque place and we\u2019ll pay you for working there. I didn\u2019t say nothing. A.W. if I die would you take care of daddy for me.</p> <p id=\"b691-5\" pgmap=\"691\">I said yes. But I knew I won\u2019t. I was just scared. Then she said A.W. you not doing it right. Then she made me move over. While him and her did it. Then they stop and he said some of those boys out on the street are not going to be nice as I am. Then she said daddy can\u2019t get you pregnant. He had an operation. I still didn\u2019t say anything. Then they said again A.W. we love you. Then she said are you ready to go to bed. I said yes I am. Then she told me to put on my clothes and I went to the bathroom. She came with me. Then she said A.W. thank you. She hugged me. Me and her were both naked. She said A.W. you have a beautiful shape for your age. She started to feel on me and I moved from her. She said you don\u2019t think I am a freak do you. I said no.

I had on an abundance of clothes. I knew I would get them that time. I had on a short set connected with a top, pajamas bottom, my night gown and a robe.
