They have been consolidated for our review by remand from the Louisiana Supreme Court. <em>Arnold v. Dona, </em>01-3073 (La.3/15/02), 812 So.2d 623; <em>Perritt v. Dona, </em>01-3175 (La.3/15/02), 812 So.2d 624; and <em>Richmond v. Brown, </em>2002-0241 (La.3/15/02), 812 So.2d 624. Two of the three cases involve the defendants\u2019 use of written interrogatories for discovery which this court, in its initial supervisory rulings, found improper. We reaffirm those rulings and our initial supervisory ruling in the third case for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">\n<em>Facts and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">The three separate actions in this consolidated appeal were all instituted as proceedings in the district court incidental to pending medical review panel inquiries under the Medical Malpractice Act (\u201cMMA\u201d). La. R.S. 40:1299.41, <em>et seq. </em>The procedural contexts of the actions as instituted by the defendant/health care providers were not uniform; the rulings by the separate district judges conflicted; and separate panels of this court initially reviewed those rulings upon the parties\u2019 applications for supervisory review. Nevertheless, the issue which was common in all actions concerns the sufficiency of the statement of the material facts of plaintiffs demand which is necessary for the presentation of a claim to the medical review panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-13\">| gIn <em>Harold Ross Perritt, et ux. v. Grant Dona, M.D. </em>(hereinafter Perritt), the health care provider filed a pleading entitled \u201cMotion to Compel\u201d to require the plaintiffs to provide a more detailed description of the alleged malpractice by amendment of plaintiffs letter to the Patients\u2019 Compensation Fund (\u201cPCF\u201d) and the Commissioner of Administration. Such a letter commences the procedure for the formation of the medical review panel. La. R.S. 40:1299.47(A); <em>Holmes v. Lee, </em>35,021 (La.App.2d Cir.9/28/01), 795 So.2d 1232. The PCF letter was filed in the record and its caption and description of plaintiffs\u2019 claim provide, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-14\">RE: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-15\">Defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-16\">Grant Dona, M.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-17\">Dates of Treatment: February 29, 2000 through March 15, 2000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-18\">Dates of Malpractice: Beginning February 29, 2000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-19\">Rowland A.

Based upon the medical information provided to date, claimants allege that the defendants deviated from the applicable standard of appropriate 13medical care regarding the care and treatment which they provided to Harold Ross Perritt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-14\">Following a contradictory hearing, the trial court in <em>Perritt </em>ruled that the PCF letter \u201cdoes not contain a recitation of facts or allegations (surrounding the alleged malpractice) sufficient enough to afford defendants proper \u2018notice.\u2019 \u201c The court ordered plaintiffs to amend the PCF letter. Thereafter, the plaintiffs\u2019 application to this court for supervisory review of the ruling was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-15\">In <em>Roger Arnold, M.D., et ux. v. Grant A. Dona, M.D. </em>(hereinafter Arnold), the health care provider instituted the action with a \u201cPetition to Compel Discovery Responses.\u201d The petition alleged that the plaintiffs had instituted a medical review panel proceeding which remains pending. The petition sought to compel a response to the following interrogatory (hereinafter \u201cInterrogatory No. 1\u201d), which had previously been propounded to plaintiffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-18\">Please state each and every respect in which you contend Dr. Grant Dona breached the standards of care applicable to him in connection with your care, being specific as to what it is you claim he did that she (sic) should have done, or did not do that she (sic) should have done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-19\">The Arnolds had given a limited answer to the interrogatory, stating that Dr. Arnold \u201csuffers from osteomyelitis which plaintiff believes was caused, or substantially contributed to, by substandard care on the part of Dr. Dona.\u201d The Arnolds responded to Dr. Dona\u2019s action with a motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-20\">|4A contradictory hearing was held in <em>Arnold. </em>The Arnolds\u2019 letter to the PCF instituting the medical review panel proceeding was not introduced into evidence. The trial court later issued a written opinion denying Dr. Dona\u2019s petition and issuing the protective order requested by the Ar-nolds. Dr. Dona\u2019s application for supervisory review to this court was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-21\">In <em>Ella Richmond v. Douglas C. Brown, M.D. </em>(hereinafter Richmond), the opposing parties were represented by the same counsel as in <em>Arnold, </em>and the proceedings in district court conducted in a like manner. The same interrogatory as quoted above (Interrogatory No. 1) was posed to Ms. Richmond concerning Dr. Brown\u2019s negligent actions. She answered that she is not an expert regarding the applicable medical standard and that \u201call that plaintiff knows is that she suffered harm or complications which she simply did not feel should have occurred under the circumstances .... \u201d In addition, Ms. Richmond refused to answer the following interrogatory (Interrogatory No. 2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>Please state, with respect to each of the allegations of substandard care made in your answers to Interrogatory No. 1, what it is that you claim the standard of care applicable to Dr. Brown requires, and your basis for so defining the standard of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Finally, Ms. Richmond refused to answer another interrogatory (Interrogatory No. 4) requesting her to identify the physical harm she suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Following a contradictory hearing, where no evidence of the plaintiffs PCF letter was introduced, the trial court granted Dr. Brown\u2019s petition to compel and ordered Ms. Richmond to \u201callege all ... grounds of | \u00a1^malpractice.\u201d The trial court\u2019s oral ruling did not specifically address Interrogatory No. 2 or Interrogatory No. 4, and no written judgment was rendered. Upon Ms. Richmond\u2019s application for supervisory review, we granted her relief reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The three parties aggrieved by our supervisory review rulings then sought supervisory review from the Louisiana Supreme Court. The court effectively consolidated the separate cases into a single appeal, granted the aggrieved parties\u2019 writ applications, and rendered a per curiam opinion directing this court to address in an opinion, \u201cthe common question of whether a defendant in a case pending in the medical review panel may compel the plaintiff to respond to interrogatories requesting information on the standard of care allegedly breached by the defendant.\u201d <em>Perritt v. Dona, supra. </em>The court also directed this court to address the ruling in <em>Solomon v. Medical Ctr. of Louisiana at New Orleans, </em>97-0783 (La.App. 4th Cir.5/14/97), 694 So.2d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">Significantly, the <em>Perritt </em>case does not involve a discovery dispute concerning unanswered interrogatories like the other two cases consolidated herein and the <em>Solomon </em>decision of the Fourth Circuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, the trial court ruling in <em>Perritt </em>did not order the plaintiffs to set forth the \u201cstandard of care allegedly breached by the defendant.\u201d The health care providers in <em>Perritt </em>instituted their district court action seeking a more specific statement Lof the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. They asserted that the claim was vague and did not give sufficient notice of the medical malpractice cause of action. The same type of information is requested by the interrogatories in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Richmond. </em>Therefore, the common issue of these three cases which have been consolidated by our highest court for our review concerns the sufficiency of the statement of material facts of the plaintiffs claim as presented to the medical review panel. Additionally, as indicated by our initial rulings in these cases, which we now reaffirm, the procedural posture in which this issue is raised at the district court is significant under the MMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">No medical malpractice action against a health care provider covered by the MMA \u201cmay be commenced in any court before a claimant\u2019s proposed complaint has been presented to a medical review panel.\u201d La. R.S. 40:1299.47(B)(l)(a)(i). Rejecting claims of unconstitutionality of the medical review panel process in <em>Everett v. Goldman, </em>359 So.2d 1256 (La.1978), the supreme court discussed the proceeding, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-11\">Likewise, the requirement that malpractice claims be filtered through a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>review panel is not unreasonable and seems to be a rational effort to accomplish a plausible goal. A panel determination adverse to a malpractice claimant\u2019s interest does not preclude his filing a lawsuit. Such a determination would seem to exert subtle pressure on the claimant in a case of little worth to abandon or to settle his claim reasonably, thereby saving the defendant and his insurer the time, expense and worry of apparently needless litigation. And a favorable panel decision will probably aid the claimant in exerting pressure on a defendant to settle the case reasonably, thus treating the malpractice victim to savings in time and expense and to avoidance of possibly risky litigation. In those cases, which do go to trial, a plaintiff successful before the panel will benefit from the evidentiary support of the panel\u2019s finding and the testimony of the panel members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">^Reaffirming <em>Everett </em>in <em>Derouen v. Kolb, </em>397 So.2d 791 (La.1981), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-6\">... [T]he medical review panel is not a judge nor a jury, but merely a body of experts assembled to evaluate the plaintiffs claim and to provide the courts and the parties with an expert opinion. Absent any evidence to rebut the legislative goals of encouraging the prompt settlement of good claims, the abandonment of poor claims and, most importantly, the fostering of prompt, professional medical services to the people of Louisiana, we see the continued use of the medical review panel as proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">Various provisions within Section 1299.47 of the MMA make reference to the \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201cproposed complaint\u201d which the plaintiff files with the PCF. Additionally, plaintiffs notification to the PCF is referred to under that section as a \u201crequest for review\u201d and a \u201cclaim.\u201d In Section 1299.47(A)(2)(b), all of these terms appear to be used interchangeably, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-9\">The request for review of the claim under this Section shall be deemed filed on the date of receipt of the complaint stamped and certified by the board or on the date of mailing of the complaint if mailed to the board by certified or registered mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">A civil action in a Louisiana court \u201cis commenced by the filing of a pleading presenting the demand to a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d La. C.C.P. art. 421. The petition is the Louisiana pleading for institution of a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. La. C.C.P. art. 891. The Code of Civil Procedure articles regarding the form and content of the petition provide, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-11\">La. C.C.P. art. 853. Every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the court, the title and number of the action, and a designation of the pleading....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-12\">| \u00a1\u00a1La. C.C.P. art. 891.... It shall set forth the name, surname, and domicile of the parties; shall contain a short, clear, and concise statement of all causes of action arising out of, and of the material facts of, the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the litigation; shall designate an address, not a post office box, for receipt of service of all items involving the litigation; and shall conclude with a prayer for judgment for the relief sought....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">From a review of the above authorities, the medical review panel screens or filters potential medical malpractice claims without any adjudicatory power. Petition is not the term utilized under Section 1299.47 for the institution of the medical review proceeding, and not all of the above criteria listed in Articles 853 and 891 would appear to have application. Therefore, we conclude as an initial matter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>the claim presentation or \u201crequest for review\u201d for the institution of the proceeding in the non-judicial setting need not precisely fit within the formal pleading requirements for a petition under the Code of Civil Procedure. Nevertheless, the notice given to the PCF must set forth basic material facts upon which the claim for medical malpractice can be screened. That notice is then forwarded to the health care provider covered by the MMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">What then are those material facts that must be set forth in the claim? Moreover, in view of the issue framed by the Supreme Court in this consolidated appeal, must the applicable standard of care be alleged by the plaintiffs?</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">The standard of care under general tort theory or duty/risk analysis coincides with the defendant\u2019s duty. \u201cA defendant\u2019s duty ... should be determined by the standard of care which the defendant owes to all potential plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Murray v. Ramada Inns, Inc., </em>521 So.2d 1123, 1136 (La.1988). |fl Under La. C.C. art. 2315, fault or negligence in \u00e1 tort action has been said to stem from \u201cconduct which violates the standard of reasonableness in the community, an act that a careful and prudent person would not undertake.\u201d <em>Clark v. I.H. Rubenstein, Inc., </em>326 So.2d 497, 500 (La.1976). Although a particular statute may impose a duty, the duty may be expressed in a negligence action generally as that standard of care expected from an ordinary prudent person under the same or similar circumstances. In the duty/risk analysis, the duty is an issue of law which is determined by the court. <em>Meany v. Meany, </em>94-0251 (La.7/5/94), 639 So.2d 229. The court then charges the jury with that duty or standard of care. <em>See, e.g., </em>H. Alston Johnson, III, 18 <em>Louisiana Civil Law Treatise, </em>Civil Jury Instructions, \u00a7 3.01 (2d ed.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Nevertheless, in a medical malpractice case, the determination of the standard of care may become dependent at trial upon medical expertise due to the highly technical and scientific nature of the physician\u2019s duty. To establish a medical malpractice claim in the judicial trial setting, the plaintiff must prove the following elements set forth in La. R.S. 9:2794(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtqP\">(1) The degree of knowledge or skill possessed or the degree of care ordinarily exercised by physicians, dentists, optometrists, or chiropractic physicians licensed to practice in the state of Louisiana and actively practicing in a similar community or locale and under similar circumstances; and where the defendant practices in a particular specialty and where the alleged acts of medical negligence raise issues peculiar to the particular medical specialty involved, then the plaintiff has the burden of proving the degree of care ordinarily practiced by physicians, dentists, optometrists, or chiropractic physicians within the involved medical specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-8\">Im(2) That the defendant either lacked this degree of knowledge or skill or failed to use reasonable care and diligence, along with his best judgment in the application of that skill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-9\">(3) That as a proximate result of this lack of knowledge or skill or the failure to exercise this degree of care the plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have been incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Thus, the plaintiff must establish the standard of care applicable to the charged physician, a violation by the physician of that standard of care, and a causal connection between the physician\u2019s alleged negligence and the plaintiffs injuries resulting therefrom. <em>Pfiffner v. Correa, </em>94-0924, 94-0963, 94-0992 (La.10/17/94), 643 So.2d 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">The defendant/health care providers argue that the plaintiffs must make allegations in these panel proceedings which mirror the burden of proof require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>ments under La. R.S. 9:2794(A). In particular, they claim that the plaintiffs must allege the applicable standard of care. In support of this position, defendants cite Section 1299.47(G) which makes reference to the plaintiffs \u201ccomplaint\u201d while describing two of the conclusions which may be reached by the medical review panel. That section provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-4\">G. The panel shall have the sole duty to express its expert opinion as to whether or not the evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant or defendants acted or failed to act within the appropriate standards of care. After reviewing all evidence and after any examination of the panel by counsel representing either party, the panel shall, within thirty days but in all events within one hundred eighty days after the selection of the last panel member, render one or more of the following expert opinions, which shall be in writing and signed by the panelists, together with written reasons for their conclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-5\">(1) The evidence supports the conclusion that the defendant or defendants failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care as charged in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-6\">|n(2) The evidence does not support the conclusion that the defendant or defendants failed to meet the applicable standard of care as charged in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA2EG\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">At trial in the judicial setting, the plaintiff must prove the applicable standard of care through expert medical testimony unless \u201cthe physician does an obviously careless act ... from which a lay person can infer negligence.\u201d <em>Pfiffner, supra </em>at 1233. The trier-of-fact, who can be expected in the ordinary tort action to understand and apply the reasonably prudent person standard of care, has no medical expertise regarding the standard of care in a complicated medical malpractice action. In contrast, the medical professionals comprising the medical review panel fully understand and are charged effectively to apply the standard of care by rendering their \u201cexpert opinions\u201d in accordance with Section 1299.47(G). By analogy, the standard of care or the physician\u2019s duty presents to the expert panel what the duty element of the duty-risk analysis presents to the trial judge in the ordinary tort action. From the expertise of the panel or the trial judge, as the ease may be, the duty or standard of care is pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">Under our fact pleading system in Louisiana,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a requirement to plead such legal duty or standard of care is unnecessary. <em>Spell v. Executive Officers, Directors and/or Shareholders of P &amp; W Indus., Inc., </em>316 So.2d 474 (La.App. 1st Cir.1975), <em>writ denied </em>320 So.2d 911 (La.1975). A cause of action cannot be set forth by stating merely the plaintiffs conclusions of law, but the facts must be stated from which such conclusions of law are drawn. <em>Succession of Stafford, </em>191 La. 855, 186 So. 360 (1939); <em>Montalvo v. Sondes, </em>93-2813 (La.5/23/94), 637 So.2d 127. Likewise, the expert panel may draw their conclusions regarding the applicable standard of care and whether a breach of that standard occurred from the plaintiffs allegation of the facts of the health care provider\u2019s action or inaction and allegations of the injury that would not otherwise have been incurred. These are the material fact allegations necessary for the malpractice claim or \u201ccomplaint\u201d for the commencement of the medical review panel proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>Section 1299.47(G) as directing the panel to conclude whether the factual charges presented by the plaintiffs complaint and the evidence demonstrate that the standard of care was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">As a final matter, we must review the MMA\u2019s procedure for challenges to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint to the PCF. In the <em>Perritt </em>case, the defendants employed a \u201cmotion to compel\u201d in the district court challenging the plaintiffs letter to the PCF quoted above. The claim letter was filed in evidence in the district court proceeding. The caption of the defendants\u2019 pleading does not govern over its substance. La. C.C.P. art. 865; <em>Metro Riverboat Ass\u2019n. v. Louisiana Gaming Control Bd., </em>01-0185 (La.10/6/01), 797 So.2d 656. We therefore consider the defendants\u2019 |13pleading as an exception of no cause of action, or alternatively, an exception of vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Perritt </em>argue, nevertheless, that such exceptions are impermissible. Section 1299.47(B)(2)(a) specifically provides for the health care provider\u2019s right to a judicial challenge of the claim pending before the medical review panel, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-6\">A health care provider, against whom a claim has been filed under the provisions of this Part, may raise any exception or defenses available pursuant to R.S. 9:5628 in a court of competent jurisdiction and proper venue at any time without need for completion of the review process by the medical review panel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Sp\">The <em>Perritt </em>plaintiffs insist that this provision only allows for the exception of prescription \u201cpursuant to R.S. 9:5628.\u201d La. R.S. 9:5628 is the statute pertaining to the prescription of claims for medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Despite the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory view, we do not find from the legislative history of Section 1299.47(B)(2)(a) that the allowance for \u201cany exception or defenses\u201d in the district court should be limited by such interpretation. This provision allowing action in the district court by the health care provider was first added to the MMA through amendment in 1982 by Act 674. Act 674 of 1982 provided for the filing of only \u201cthe preemptory exception of prescription in court at anytime, without need for completion of the review process.\u201d Later, by Act 435 of 1984, the provision was amended to the existing language, quoted above, allowing for \u201cany exception or defenses pursuant to R.S. 9:5628.\u201d This change in the legislation indicates to us that the single exception or defense of prescription pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5628 can no longer be construed as the Jj^narrow intention of the legislature after the broader terms, \u201cdefenses\u201d and \u201cany exception,\u201d were employed in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">Moreover, when the language of the law is susceptible of different meanings, it must be interpreted as having the meaning that best conforms to the purpose of the law. La. C.C. art. 10. Louisiana requires fact pleading as initial notice of a civil action. As the <em>Perritt </em>case demonstrates, a plaintiffs \u201ccomplaint\u201d as required by the MMA can be so vague and deficient in its statement of the claim to warrant the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>of an exception in the district court to obtain clarification of the particular actions of malpractice and the resulting injury to the plaintiff. We recognize that the health care provider and panel members are also afforded the right to an evidentiary deposition of the plaintiff under Section 1299.47(D), discussed below, to thereby obtain more specific information regarding the plaintiffs injury and his understanding of the cause of that injury. Nevertheless, the fundamental procedural concept of notice of the claim at the commencement of a civil action supports our interpretation that the defendant\u2019s exception in the district court was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">We therefore interpret this procedural provision of the MMA as allowing for the exceptions of vagueness and no cause of action in those cases, such as the present actions, where the health care providers seek a more sufficient statement of the claim. The exceptions can be raised at any time before the completion of the review process. Nevertheless, upon the plaintiffs submission of written evidence of the claim to the medical review panel pursuant to Section 1299.47(D)(1), the sufficiency of the statement of hBthe material facts of the claim should be judged from that evidence in addition to the initial complaint to the PCF. La. C.C.P. art. 1154; <em>Rogers v. Ash Grove Cement Co., </em>34,934 (La.App.2d Cir.11/2/01), 799 So.2d 841, writ denied 01-3187 (La.2/8/02), 808 So.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">Regarding the exception of no cause of action, liberal rules of pleading prevail, and each pleading should be so construed as to do substantial justice. La. C.C.P. art. 865; <em>Williams v. State, </em>34,691 (La.App.2d Cir.5/9/01), 786 So.2d 927, 930. In considering a petition against which an exception of no cause of action has been raised, this court has held that every reasonable interpretation must be accorded its language in favor of maintaining the sufficiency of the petition and affording the litigant an opportunity to present his evidence. <em>Walker v. Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>334 So.2d 714 (La.App. 2d Cir.1976); <em>Haskins v. Clary, </em>346 So.2d 193 (La.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-10\">The <em>Perritt </em>claim as revealed in the PCF letter indicates that the four health care providers performed at separate times unspecific acts of health care. The claim does not list the particular injury or injuries suffered by the plaintiff or allege facts of causation linking those injuries to the various unidentified actions of the defendants. As such, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim does not properly set forth a statement of the material facts of the malpractice cause of action. The trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Perritt </em>is therefore interpreted by this court as a grant of defendants\u2019 exception with the corresponding order to amend the pending claim pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 934.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the 11frPerritts\u2019 initial PCF claim letter provided some notice or presentation of a demand, it was subject to the defendants\u2019 exception and the requirement to amend the claim. <em>Cf. Batson v. Cherokee Beach and Campgrounds, Inc., </em>530 So.2d 1128 (La.1988) and <em>In re Medical Review Panel of Wempren v. UHS of New Orleans, Inc., </em>98-636 (La.App. 5th Cir.1/26/99), 726 So.2d 477, <em>writ denied </em>99-0545 (La.4/9/99), 740 So.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-11\">The defendants in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Richmond </em>did not challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 claims by the filing of exceptions. Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>they served the plaintiffs with Interrogatory No. 1 requesting the specifics of each doctor\u2019s actions or inaction. Additionally, in <em>Richmond, </em>the defendant propounded Interrogatories Nos. 2 and 4 requesting a statement of the applicable standard of care and the harm suffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">The process employed by the defendants in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Richmond </em>is faulty. First, there was no showing in the district court regarding any insufficiency in the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to the PCF. Without evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 PCF letters or claims instituting the medical review panel proceedings, the trial court could presume that the information requested in the disputed interrogatories is contained in the initial claims. If not, an exception to the claim and proof of the insufficiency of the statement of the claim may yet be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">117Second, we do not agree with the ruling in <em>Solomon.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Discovery in the present non-judicial proceeding is not in keeping with the intended nature of the proceeding as described by our Supreme Court nor is discovery through written interrogatories expressly provided in the MMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">The MMA grants immunities and advantages to special classes in derogation of the general rights available to tort victims and therefore must be strictly construed. <em>Vernon v. E.A. Conway Hosp., </em>33,105 (La.App.2d Cir.4/5/00), 756 So.2d 1249, <em>writ denied </em>00-1302 (La.6/16/00), 765 So.2d 342; <em>Pendleton v. Batrett, </em>95-2066 (La.5/31/96), 675 So.2d 720. Section 1299.47(D) of the MMA provides for the form of evidence to be considered by the medical review panel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The section allows for the taking of depositions by the parties or at the request of any two panel members. La. R.S. 40:1299.47(D)(3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">The text of the law as a whole must be considered when the language of the law is susceptible of different meanings. La. C.C. art. 12. Section 1299.47(D), when considered as a whole, addresses the written evidence |1Rwhich may be obtained for submission to the panel. Its aim is not for a broad discovery process by the parties, but for the submission of evidence to the panel. It does not allow for written interrogatories to be exchanged between the parties. The discovery process for interrogatories in a judicial proceeding can broadly seek otherwise inadmissible evidence \u201cif the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d La. C.C.P. art. 1422. Such a broad discovery right is not expressed within the language of Section 1299.47(D), which must be strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>construed. Moreover, the general purpose of an efficient non-judicial screening for a medical malpractice claim as set forth in the above jurisprudence would be defeated by an open-ended discovery process and its attendant motion practice for enforcement at the district court level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The material facts for a medical malpractice claim having not been sufficiently set forth by the Perritts in their PCF letter, the ruling of the district court is hereby affirmed. The trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Arnold </em>issuing plaintiffs a protective order and refusing to order answers to defendants\u2019 written interrogatory is affirmed. The trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Richmond </em>ordering plaintiffs to respond to defendant\u2019s written interrogatories is reversed. Costs of the appeal in <em>Perritt </em>are assessed to the Perritts. Costs of appeal in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Richmond </em>are assessed to the defendants in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">AFFIRMED IN CASE NOS. 35,628-CW AND 35,724-CW; REVERSED IN CASE NO. 35,841-CW.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">PEATROSS, J., concurs with written reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">BROWN, C.J., concurs/dissents in part with reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">WILLIAMS, J., concurs and dissents in part for the reasons assigned by C.J.

The disputed interrogatory in <em>Solomon, supra </em>parallels the interrogatory which is now the focus in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Richmond. </em>The <em>Solomon </em>interrogatory requested \u201cdetailed information concerning 'each and every act of medical malpractice.' \" <em>Id.

Although the issue is not directly before us, the statement of a cause of action for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>malpractice in the district court after the conclusion of the panel process would require the same allegations of material facts. By alleging in the petition what a particular tortfeasor did or did not do that resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s injury, the applicable standard of care is indirectly asserted. Through allegations of malfeasance, the plaintiff effectively asserts that the degree of ordinary care of other physicians or health care providers was not followed because the particular act of the physician should not have occurred. In making a claim based upon nonfeasance, the causation allegations necessarily must assert that a particular course of action (the standard of care) which was omitted by the physician or health care provider would have prevented plaintiff's injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">. La. C.C.P. art. 934 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-8\">When the grounds of the objection pleaded by the peremptory exception may be removed by amendment of the petition, the judgment sustaining the exception shall order such amendment within the delay allowed by the court.

The <em>Solomon </em>ruling interpreted La. R.S. 40:1299.39.1(D). The language of Section 1299.47(D) of the MMA, which we now interpret, is identical with the language of La. R.S. 40:1299.39.1(D) which applies to medical review panel proceedings for malpractice claims against the State and its agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1294-8\">.

See La. R.S. 40:1299.47(D). Since the MMA is in derogation of the general rights available to tort victims, its provisions must be strictly construed. Nowhere in the MMA is there a provision permitting written interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-16\">As noted by the writer, the supreme court also instructed this court to address the case of <em>Solomon v. Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans, </em>97-0783 (La.App. 4th Cir.5/14/97), 694 So.2d 1229. In light of the above conclusion, I agree with the position that the .fourth circuit erred in its decision in <em>Solomon, </em>which held that a plaintiff could be compelled to answer interrogatories. These findings, in my opinion, fully answer the limited inquiry mandated by the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-17\">I note, however, that any discussion of the above issues does not involve the issued) raised in the <em>Perritt </em>case because, as the writer points out, that case <em>did not involve interrogatories. </em>As such, any discussion of the issue(s) raised in <em>Perritt </em>is irrelevant to the inquiry of the supreme court and is, therefore, superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">|2In summary, I concur with the portions of the opinion that conclude that interrogatories are not permissible discovery under the MMA and that disagree with the decision in <em>Solomon, supra. </em>I believe the further discussion in the opinion regarding the <em>Perritt </em>case, however, to be superfluous to the inquiry mandated by the supreme court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1295-19\">LBROWN, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYo7l\">Concurring and Dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-20\">These cases were consolidated and remanded by the supreme court for this court to address a common question of whether, in a case pending before a medical review panel, a plaintiff can be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>pelled to state \u201cthe standard of care allegedly breached by the defendant.\u201d This court is in agreement that a plaintiff does not have to articulate the standard of care as that is a question within the expertise of the panel members. We also agree that at this stage interrogatories are not allowed under the Medical Malpractice Act; however, we disagree on whether exceptions, other than one of prescription, are permitted under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Because of the cost, in both time and money, associated with medical malpractice lawsuits, screening panels were mandated as a precondition to traditional litigation. These panels do not replace the litigation process but provide a quick and inexpensive way to separate valid from frivolous claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">A medical review panel is assembled to provide expert opinions with the goal of encouraging prompt settlement of good claims and abandonment of bad ones. The panel consists of experts who consider only evidence submitted in written form. This evidence consists primarily of medical charts, lab tests, x-rays, affidavits and other evidence including in some cases depositions. This evidence is usually in the possession of the physicians and other health care providers. Each party is allowed to see the evidence sent to the review panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">The panel meets informally with the parties and their attorneys. The parties may question the panel. It is the panel\u2019s duty to decide the | gapplicable standard of care and whether that standard was breached. All information is submitted in <em>written </em>form to the panel and is provided in advance of the meeting to all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">When a plaintiffs claimed injury is one caused by medical harm, his or her proof usually requires expert testimony. This is particularly true in determining the standard of care. Plaintiff may well look to the review panel for that expert opinion. To compel a plaintiff to articulate the standard of care at the screening stage necessarily requires him to search out and hire experts. This court agrees that this is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">Under the majority opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while the claim is pending before the review panel, exceptions of vagueness and/or no cause of action could be filed in the trial court to compel plaintiff to state the particular injury or injuries suffered and allege facts of causation linking these injuries to the defendant\u2019s actions. With this I disagree. The Medical Malpractice Act allows only exceptions of prescription at the screening stage. Otherwise, the process would become costly, burdensome and dilatory. The particulars of the injury and causation will become clear in the written evidence submitted to the panel. If the panel members cannot discern any injuries suffered or any causal connection, they have the expertise to say so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1296-8\">.
