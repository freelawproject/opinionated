We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-18\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b662-19\">Ms. Daisy Bellanger suffered an injury while working at LaSalle Community Action. On March 23, 2001, the morning of trial, the parties agreed to a lump sum settlement, of $17,500.00, in addition to payment and/or reimbursement of her medicals and expenses, for a total of $17,987.18. Counsel read the settlement amount into the record, after which the WCJ questioned Ms. Bellanger concerning her understanding of the settlement terms and whether she believed the settlement to be in her best interest. Apparently, satisfied with Ms. Bellanger\u2019s response, the WCJ ordered counsel to submit the necessary documents <em>to the court within fifteen days.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-20\">On April 3, 2001, Ms. Bellanger\u2019s counsel verified the amount of the medicals and expenses. On that same date, the insurer provided defense counsel with the check. Then, on April 10, 2001, three days after the expiration of the fifteen day time period, LaSalle Community Action\u2019s counsel sent the settlement package to Ms. Bellan-ger for signing. Because she was out of the state, her signature could not be obtained, immediately. Her counsel returned the signed documents to defense counsel on April 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">On May 8, 2001, defense counsel forwarded the documents to the court for the WCJ\u2019s signature, which was not obtained until May 17, 2001. However, three days before, on May 14, 2001, Ms. Bellanger filed a motion to enforce the settlement and requested that the WCJ award penalties because of the delays in obtaining the executed documents from defense counsel. Once it received notice of the WCJ\u2019s signature on the judgment, LaSalle Community Action\u2019s counsel disbursed the proceeds on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>May 24, 2001, nearly two months after it had received them from the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The WCJ heard the motion to enforce on July 27, 2001, ruled in Ms. Bellanger\u2019s favor, and awarded statutory penalties and attorney\u2019s fees. LaSalle | {.Community Action appeals, claiming that the time period for statutory penalties and attorney\u2019s fees did not begin to run until the WCJ signed the judgment, reflecting the parties\u2019 settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Lump Sum Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"A6Z7\">The initial question, which we must address, is whether a settlement, recited on the record, constitutes a nonappealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">We begin with La.R.S. 23:1272(A), which provides the procedures for perfecting a settlement and obtaining the judge\u2019s approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">A lump sum or compromise settlement entered into by the parties under R.S. 23:1271 <em>shall </em>be presented to the workers\u2019 compensation judge <em>for approval </em>through a petition signed by all parties and verified by the employee or his dependent, <em>or by recitation of the terms of the settlement and acknowledgment by the parties in open court which is capable of being transcribed from the record of the proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Notwithstanding, Counsel for LaSalle Community Action urges that, based on our supreme court\u2019s 1984 holding in <em>Colbert v. Louisiana State University Dental </em>School,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unless the parties filed and complied with the statutorily requisite joint verified petition, an oral settlement in open court would not give either party the right to enforce a specific agreement to compromise. However, the 1999 amendment to La.R.S. 23:1272 supercedes Colbert\u2019s holding. That amendment added recitation of the terms of the settlement in open court as a sanctioned means for obtaining approval. Additionally, for obtaining approval, the amendment requires the parties\u2019 acknowledgment of the settlement\u2019s terms. Accordingly, the following exchange occurred between the WCJ and Ms. Bellan-ger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">The Court: And Ms. Bellanger, you\u2019ve heard the terms of the settlement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-14\">|gD. Bellanger: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">The Court: You\u2019re represented by Mr. Betts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-16\">D. Bellanger: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-17\">The Court: You\u2019ve discussed this matter with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-18\">D. Bellanger: Yes,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-19\">The Court: You feel it\u2019s in your best interest to accept this settlement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-20\">D. Bellanger: Yes, I am. [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-21\">The Court: You understand that it\u2019s a full and final settlement of your case? D. Bellanger: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-22\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">After this discussion, the WCJ ordered counsel to submit the documents, reflecting the recited settlement, to her within fifteen days for her signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-24\">Furthermore, in her reasons for judgment, concerning Ms. Bellanger\u2019s subsequent motion to enforce the settlement, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-25\">The terms of the settlement was [sic] recited and acknowledged by the parties in open court. The recitation was capable of transcription and this Court made the determination that the claimant understood the terms and conditions of the settlement. Following the recitation and the acknowledgment <em>and other as</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>sessments </em>made in open court, <em>the settlement was approved, </em>and it became a final and nonappealable judgment at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">If the Court were to find otherwise, i.e., that a written order was required before the settlement order became final, that would in fact render the open court settlement order worthless and without legal effect. To find that, it [sic] would be in a direct disregard for the 1999 amendment to Louisiana Revised Statute 28:1272. To find otherwise, would in effect void the intent of the legislature and their creation of an additional avenue for the approval of settlements. It would void the intent of the legislature and their creation of an avenue for the expedited consummation of settlement agreements and it would allow senseless delays between the settlement approval and the fruition of the settlement funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">|4(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s arguments appear to suggest that, because the WCJ did not expressly state \u201cI <em>approve </em>the settlement,\u201d or words to that effect, the settlement was not perfected and, therefore, final, until she signed the judgment, memorializing her approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">However, we find our previous case, <em>Cormier v. Ellender\u2019s Portable Building,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>particularly helpful. In that case, we held that a compromise has the same force and attributes of a court\u2019s judgment and that, although the WCJ did not specifically state that she found the settlement to be fair, equitable, and consistent with workers\u2019 compensation laws, it was clear from her actions, at the time, that she had considered the settlement, which was read into the record, and approved it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, once the terms of the settlement were recited in open court and approved by the WCJ, they were enforceable by the parties against each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Moreover, La.R.S. 23:1272(B) delineates the WCJ\u2019s requisites for approving a settlement when counsel petitions the court, in writing, for approval. There is no reason to believe that the same criteria would not apply for approving a settlement in open court when the claimant is present and represented by counsel, since the legislative intent appears to be to ensure the claimant\u2019s knowledge and approval of a settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">This provision mandates that the WCJ <em>shall </em>approve the settlement when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">(1) the attorney has explained the rights of the employee or dependent and the consequences of the settlement to him; and (2) that such employee or dependent understands his rights and the consequences of entering into the settlement[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The colloquy, which we recited above, between Ms. Bellanger and the WCJ in the instant case, reveals that the judge followed this procedure and ascertained all of the pertinent information, which required the judge\u2019s approval and rendered the matter to be legally final. Thus, we find that the subsequent written judgment was | Bsimply a formality, evidencing the already existing oral judgment, which the WCJ approved in open court after the settlement\u2019s recitation into the record. This oral judgment became final and non-appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Attorney\u2019s Fees and Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Awards of penalties and attorney\u2019s fees in workers\u2019 compensation cases are penal in nature and are imposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>discourage the employers\u2019 undesirable conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A worker\u2019s compensation claimant is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and penalties, unless the employer acts arbitrarily and capriciously in handling the employee\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The WCJ has great discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and penalties, and we will not disturb his or her decision, absent manifest error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In the instant case, we have already determined that, based upon the 1999 amendment to La.R.S. 23:1272, the oral settlement agreement, entered into the record on March 23, 2001, was binding and enforceable as a final nonappealable judgment. Therefore, the time to enforce the judgment began to run on March 23, 2001, expiring thirty days afterwards \u2014 April 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In the case at bar, La.R.S. 23:1201(G) is the applicable statute, concerning penalties and attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">If any award payable under the terms of a final, nonappealable judgment is not paid within thirty days <em>after it becomes due, </em>there shall be added to such award an amount equal to twenty-four percent thereof or one hundred dollars per day together with reasonable attorney fees, for each calendar day after thirty days it remains unpaid, whichever is greater, which shall be paid at the same time as, and in addition to, such award, unless such nonpayment results from conditions over which the employer had no control. No amount paid as a penalty under this Subsection shall be included in any formula utilized to establish premium rates for workers\u2019 compensation insurance. The total one hundred dollar per calendar day penalty provided for in this Subsection shall not exceed three thousand dollars in the aggregate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">[fiSince we have determined, above, that reciting the terms of the settlement into the record and following La.R.S. 23:1272\u2019s procedures constituted a final, nonap-pealable judgment, Ms. Bellanger\u2019s funds were <em>due </em>within 30 days from March 23, 2001. Because payment was not made to Ms. Bellanger within thirty days of the due date and, in fact, was made more than sixty days afterwards, we affirm, both, the statutory penalties of $4,316.92, as well as attorney\u2019s fees, totaling $1,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">Additional Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">Finally, Ms. Bellanger contends that we should award her additional attorney\u2019s fees for her counsel\u2019s appellate work. In light of our findings, this request is well founded. Thus, we award an additional $1,500.00 in attorney\u2019s fees for work done on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">Ms. Bellanger and LaSalle Community Action entered a stipulation, regarding settlement, into the record. The WCJ granted them fifteen days to send her the necessary documents. For numerous reasons, this did not occur, and LaSalle Community Action\u2019s counsel did not release the funds until more than sixty days after the rendering of a final, nonappealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">For the reasons we expressed, we affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees and penalties, award an additional $1,500.00 for attorney\u2019s fees for work completed on the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>peal, and cast the costs for this appeal against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-26\">. 446 So.2d 1204 (La.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">. 00-1595 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/28/01); 781 So.2d 776.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-16\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. <em>Sharbono v.
