For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On October 31, 2000, Sam, while in the course and scope of his employment as a groundsman for Asplundh, was pulling a limb to the chipper when he allegedly felt a pull or snap in his back. There were no \u25a0witnesses to the alleged accident. Sam claims to have reported his injury to his supervisor, Randy Cottongin. Cottongin denied any such report. He testified that had such a report been made, Sam would have been sent to a doctor and had a drug screen in accordance with company policy. Sam worked the remainder of the day. Sam testified that he did not tell 'his coworkers on the trip home'that he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The following morning, Sam claims to have told Marrell Watts, with whom he rode to work, that he wasn\u2019t coming to work because of his injury. However, Sam did not call Watts as a witness and objected to a request by Asplundh to hold the record open for his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">On November 2, 2000, Sam met Cotton-gin at an Exxon station to pick up his paycheck. Cottongin testified he did not report an accident at that time. Sam denies that this meeting ever took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">On November 10, 2000, Sam claims he reported his injury to Cottongin again and was denied permission to see a doctor. Cottongin denies this exchange occurred. Later that day, Sam sought treatment at the Iberia Medical Center emergency room, complaining of .back and neck pain. He claimed he hurt his back lifting logs and gave a history of a prior back injury three years previously. Medical records indicate that Sam was diagnosed with cervical and myofascial strain. Sam then saw Dr. Michel | gHeard, an orthopedic specialist, who found some tenderness and stiffness and put Sam on light-duty restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Finally, Sam offered as rebuttal the testimony of Lawrence Garrick, an ex-employee of Asplundh. Garrick testified that he had been injured on three occasions and Cottongin had not filed an accident report and did not order a drug screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge found that Sam had failed to establish a work-related injury and, therefore, dismissed his claim with prejudice. Sam lodged this appeal alleging that the workers\u2019 compensation judge erred in dismissing his claim and in failing to award penalties and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">An appellate court may not disturb a trial court\u2019s evaluation of credibility and factual determinations unless the record reveals that the trial court\u2019s decision is manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong. <em>Rosell v. ESCO, </em>549 So.2d 840 (La.1989). In workers\u2019 compensation cases, an injured worker must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his disability was caused by a work accident. <em>Burns v. Beauregard Nursing Ctr., </em>94-131 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/5/94); 643 So.2d 443. The injured employee\u2019s testimony alone may be enough to meet the burden of proof as long as 1) no other evidence contradicts the employee\u2019s version of the accident, and 2) the testimony is corroborated by circumstances following the alleged incident. <em>Bruno v. Harbert Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>593 So.2d 357 (La.1992). If the employee\u2019s testimony contains inconsistencies and discrepancies, then the injured employee\u2019s testimony alone will not be enough to prove his injury occurred on the job. <em>Harris v. General Motors, </em>577 So.2d 1160 (La.App. 2 Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">An injured worker\u2019s disability is presumed to have resulted from an acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>dent, if before the accident he was in good health, but commencing with the accident the lasymptoms of the disabling condition appear and continuously manifest themselves afterwards, providing either that there is sufficient medical evidence to show there to be a causal connection between the accident and disabling condition, or that the nature of the accident, when combined with the other facts of the case, raises a natural inference through human experience of such a causal connection. <em>Walton v. Normandy Village Homes </em>Assoc., <em>Inc., </em>475 So.2d 320 (La.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Sam alleges that the trial court erred in finding he failed to establish a work-related accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge found Sam\u2019s testimony corroborated only to the extent that he consistently reported a work-related accident to health care providers. However, the workers\u2019 compensation judge found numerous factors rebutting Sam\u2019s claim. Specifically, he noted that Sam waited ten days before seeking treatment, no spasm has been noted and there is no objective signs of injury. Moreover, according to Dr. Heard\u2019s records the neck pain is the most severe and there is no mention of a neck injury. We note further that Sam did not mention an accident to his coworkers on his way home from work the day of the accident and that his testimony was rebutted by his supervisors. Finally, the workers\u2019 compensation judge specifically found that Sam\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. In cases like this where the parties essentially contradict each others\u2019 statements, that credibility judgment by the workers\u2019 compensation judge is particularly important. Under these circumstances, we cannot say the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s finding that Sam failed to prove a work-related accident was manifestly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In addition, the record rebuts the presumption that an injury is work-related in at least two respects. His medical history given to the ER personnel indicated a previous work-related back injury and the testimony of his coworker, Travis LCottongin, indicated Sam complained of soreness in his back from an old injury the week prior to the alleged injury. Accordingly, we find, considering these factors together with Sam\u2019s behavior after the alleged accident and failure to seek treatment, that Sam was not entitled to the presumption that his injury occurred as a result of a job accident. Without that presumption, we cannot say that the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s determination that Sam failed to prove an injury caused by a job accident is manifestly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Sam\u2019s next assignment alleges the workers\u2019 compensation judge erred in failing to award penalties and attorney fees. Because Sam failed to establish an on the job injury, this assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the workers\u2019 compensation judge is affirmed. All costs of these proceedings are taxed to Johnny Sam.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
