On March 23, 1992, he filed an occupational disease claim with the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, alleging that he was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and burnout as a result of his duties in investigating the Kirtland cult killings. The district hearing officer disallowed his claim because it alleged a psychiatric condition without physical trauma. The regional board of review affirmed the disallowance, and the Industrial Commission refused appellant\u2019s appeal from the board of review. Appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal order, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s \u2018motion for judgment on the pleadings or motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim\u2019 where the motion depends on application of a law which violates the injured worker\u2019s right to equal protection of the laws by depriving the injured worker of the opportunity to receive industrial compensation for a psychiatric/stress claim, where other industrially injured workers are entitled to participate for psychiatric or stress-caused conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s \u2018motion for judgment on the pleadings or motion to dismiss for failure to. state a claim\u2019 where granting such motion depends on application of a law which violates the injured worker\u2019s rights to receive compensation for a work-related injury or occupational disease under the provisions of the Ohio Constitution creating the foundation for the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201c3. The trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion which results from a narrow definition excluding psychiatric/stress claims from compensation in violation of the R.C. 4123.95 requirement for liberal construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In the first assignment, appellant argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim because such decision was predicated on the application of law which violates appellant\u2019s right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Pursuant to Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme, compensation is sanctioned for a worker who is disabled by a mental condition resulting from a compensable work-related physical injury. R.C. 4123.01(C)(1); <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 166, 16 O.O.3d 199, 404 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>N.E.2d 153; <em>Rambaldo v. Accurate Die Casting </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 281, 603 N.E.2d 975. However, compensation is not available for workers suffering mental conditions caused solely by job-related stress. <em>Rambaldo, </em>syllabus. Appellant contends that this situation violates his right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">This argument has been advanced several times and has been rejected. <em>Connors v. Sterling Milk Co. </em>(1993), 98 Ohio App.3d 711, 649 N.E.2d 856; <em>Zaricki v. Laco Die Casting Co. </em>(July 8, 1982), Cuyahoga App. No. 44254, unreported, 1982 WL 2468; <em>Neil v. Mayfield </em>(July 22, 1988), Montgomery App. No. CA 10881, unreported, 1988 WL 76179; <em>Fields v. Youngstown </em>(May 30, 1989), Mahoning App. No. 88 C.A. 89, unreported, 1989 WL 59014.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that, *[i]n the area of economics and social welfare, a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zaricki </em>at 3, quoting <em>Dandridge v. Williams </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491; see, also, <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 714, 649 N.E.2d at 858-859. Provided a classification does not burden a suspect group, a statute should not be deemed violative of the Equal Protection Clause unless \u201cthe varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to achievement of any combination of legislative purposes that it can only be concluded that the legislature\u2019s actions were irrational.\u201d <em>Vance v. Bradley </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 942, 59 L.Ed.2d 171; <em>Zaricki </em>at 3; <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 714, 715, 649 N.E.2d at 859. Because appellant does not assert that he falls within a suspect or fundamental classification, the appropriate standard of review is the rational basis test; therefore, provided the statutory framework is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, it will be upheld. <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 715, 649 N.E.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Applying this test, we find that the exclusion for mental stress in the absence of a contemporaneous physical injury does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution or the Ohio Constitution because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201c(1) the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining the self-supporting nature of its Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund; (2) the state has a legitimate interest in distributing the available resources to the disabilities determined by the state to be covered rather than to cover all disabilities inadequately; and (3) the state has a legitimate interest in maintaining a contribution rate at a level that will not unduly burden participating employers.\u201d <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 715, 649 N.E.2d at 859; see, also, <em>Zaricki </em>at 4,1982 WL 2468; <em>Mayfield </em>at 5; <em>Fields </em>at 8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>This assignment is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In the second assignment, appellant contends that the legislature exceeded its authority under Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because, in defining \u201cinjury\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4123.01(C)(1), it excluded compensation for psychiatric injuries not resulting from a compensable work-related physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Section 35, Article II, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to work[ers] and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workers\u2019] employment, <em>laws may be passed </em>establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, <em>determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u201cThe purpose of Article II, Section 35 of the Ohio Constitution is to compensate workers and/or their dependents for injuries arising out of the course of employment. However, Section 35 does give the state the authority to determine what injuries are compensable.\u201d <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 715, 649 N.E.2d at 859. Therefore, the legislature did not exceed its authority by excluding psychiatric injury not resulting from physical injury from the class of compensable injuries. <em>Connors, </em>98 Ohio App.3d at 716, 649 N.E.2d at 859. This assignment is meritless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">In the third assignment, appellant maintains that the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint because R.C. 4123.95 mandates that workers\u2019 compensation statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of employees\u2019 receipt of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">R.C. 4123.01(C) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 includes any injury, whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in character and result, received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment. \u2018Injury\u2019 does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201c(1) Psychiatric conditions except where the conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease^]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has recently construed the foregoing statute and concluded \u201cthat by specifically excluding claims for mental conditions based solely on job-related stress from the definition of \u2018injury,\u2019 the General Assembly intended that this type of claim not be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>sation Act * * <em>Rambaldo, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 287, 603 N.E.2d at 979. Despite this, appellant argues that his claim is covered pursuant to R.C. 4123.95, which states, \u201c[sjections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees and the dependents of deceased employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">R.C. 1.51 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201cIf a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. <em>If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Clearly, R.C. 4123.01(C)(1) is the special provision and R.C. 4123.95 is the general provision. There can be no question that it was not the legislature\u2019s manifest intent to have the general provision prevail over the special provision. See <em>Rambaldo, </em>65 Ohio St. 3d at 287, 603 N.E.2d at 979. This assignment is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-10\">Cacioppo and Mahoney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b370-11\">Mary Cacioppo, J., retired, of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b370-12\">Edward J.
