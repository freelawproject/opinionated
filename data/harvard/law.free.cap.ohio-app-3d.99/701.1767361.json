Houts (\u201cappellant\u201d), appeals from the judgment of the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (\u201ctrial court\u201d), which ordered a reduction in the child support obligation of defendantappellee, Keith G. Houts.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">Appellant and appellee were married in August 1980, and had four children as a result of the marriage. In October 1991, appellant filed for divorce from appellee and sought custody and support of the parties\u2019 minor children. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>December 1992, the parties were granted a divorce. Therein, the trial court ordered that appellant be designated the residential parent and appellee be ordered to pay child support. The child support obligation imposed upon appellee was based upon the trial court\u2019s adoption of the referee\u2019s calculation of the child support worksheet (as required by R.C. 3113.215), wherein it stated appellee\u2019s gross income as child support for 1991 being $45,501, and recommended that appellee be ordered to pay $274.05 per month per child.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On February 18, 1993, appellee moved the trial court to modify his child support obligation as set forth in the December 1992 divorce decree. Appellee alleged therein that he had \u201cexperienced a substantial reduction in income, as evidenced by his [1992] tax return * * Appellant requested a hearing on his motion, and a hearing was held on June 29, 1993. Thereafter, in October 1993, the referee issued his report, finding appellee to have \u201can annual imputed income\u201d of $14,845. Finding the recalculated amount to be more than ten percent less than the amount being paid pursuant to the original child support order, the referee stated that a change of circumstances had occurred pursuant to R.C. 3113.215(B)(4). Moreover, the referee stated that the evidence presented had failed to establish that if it followed the requirements of R.C. 3113.215 an unjust result would occur or a result that was not in the best interest of the children would occur. In sum, the referee recommended that appellee\u2019s gross income be reduced to $14,845, a change of circumstances had occurred, and appellee\u2019s new monthly obligation be reduced to $121.27 per child.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Appellant filed objections to the referee\u2019s report, which mirror the assignments of error raised herein on appeal. On January 13, 1994, the trial court overruled the objections, and agreed that appellee\u2019s \u201cincome\u201d was $14,845. It therefore modified appellee\u2019s child support obligation as recommended by the referee. It is from this judgment entry that appellant submits the following five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred and abused its discretion when it found as a fact that the plaintiffs income was $14,845.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Assignment of Error No. Ill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred in failing to consider the distortion to defendant\u2019s income for the year 1992 by his willful and voluntary payment (on or about December 31,1992) of alleged expenses that were to be incurred during the 1993 growing season and which were not delivered during 1992 but were to be delivered in 1993.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Assignment of Error No. IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred as a matter of law when it concluded that there had been a change of circumstances that required the court to recalculate child support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As a preliminary matter, we must address a contention of the parties concerning which amendment to the child support calculation statute, R.C. 3113.215, is applicable to the motion to modify proceedings and judgment entry. The applicable amendment to R.C. 3113.215 is that statute in effect at the time appellee filed his motion to modify child support on February 18, 1993 (effective date of the statute being April 11, 1991, see 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 53, 183). Therefore, all references hereinafter to R.C. 3113.215 and other relevant portions of the Revised Code refer to those statutes, as amended, in effect as of February 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The general principle emphasized when a court calculates child support pursuant to R.C. 3113.215 is the best interest of the child. <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 141, 601 N.E.2d 496, 498. Moreover, when calculating child support, a court must strictly comply with the mandates of R.C. 3113.215. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Upon calculation of child support by a trial court pursuant to R.C. 3113.215, that court\u2019s calculation will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142; and, <em>Marker, supra. </em>\u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d refers to a decision which is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Based upon our review of the facts in the record and the law as enunciated in R.C. 3113.215 and 3109.05, we find that the trial court erred in the manner in which it determined that appellee was entitled to a modification of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">As noted above, the calculation of appellee\u2019s original child support obligation was based upon appellee\u2019s 1991 tax return. The basis for appellee\u2019s request for a modification was that his 1992 tax return reflected a significantly lower income for that year. At trial, appellant\u2019s counsel elicited from appellee that appellee had prepaid some farming expenses in 1992 for the 1993 calendar year. When appellee was asked why he had prepaid those expenses, appellee responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-11\">\u201cQ. [By appellant\u2019s counsel] And you made those payments basically as a tax-saving feature so that you could get a tax savings for the year 1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\">\u201cA. [By appellee] Well, yes. Not only that but we get a substantial quantity savings and cash savings for purchasing early.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201cQ. So in actuality you were distorting your 1992 expenses by including in it a substantial amount of 1993 expected expenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201cA. Well, that really wasn\u2019t our intent. We do that every year, and I think farmers across the nation do that every year on a cash basis accounting. That\u2019s permissible by the Internal Revenue Service, and it\u2019s just a fact of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cQ. You do that every year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cA. Yes. When needed, we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t do it in 1991, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201cA. We didn\u2019t need to in 1991. If you\u2019ll look, you\u2019ll see that our gross receipts were considerably higher in 1992 than they were in 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\u201cQ. So you basically needed a tax savings and so you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">\u201cA. We needed tax management, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">As noted above, the trial court determined appellee\u2019s gross income for 1991 to be $45,501 in its initial calculation of child support. Pursuant to appellee\u2019s request to modify child support, the trial court used appellee\u2019s tax return for 1992 and found his gross income reduced to $14,845.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">As previously stated, R.C. 3113.215 is the statute utilized by a court when calculating child support. Gross income is the starting point on the worksheet (R.C. 3113.215[D], line la) to determine an obligor\u2019s child support obligation. \u201cGross income\u201d is defined in R.C. 3113.215(A)(2) as \u201cthe total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year * * * and includes * * * self-generated income * * \u201cSelf-generated income,\u201d as used in the definition of \u201cgross income,\u201d is defined in R.C. 3113.215(A)(3) as \u201cgross receipts received by a parent from self-employment, proprietorship of a business * * * and rents minus ordinary and necessary expenses incurred by the parent in generating the gross receipts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">R.C. 3113.215(B)(1) provides that the calculation of any child support obligation be made in accordance with the schedule provided in division (D) of the statute and the worksheet in division (E) or (F) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">We agree with appellant that the trial court erred in its calculation of appellee\u2019s child support obligation. Foremost for this conclusion is that when calculating an obligor\u2019s \u201cgross income,\u201d R.C. 3113.215 requires only that income and expenses from <em>\u201ca </em>calendar year\u201d be included in that calculation. See R.C. 3113.215(A)(2). Herein, the trial court examined appellee\u2019s finances in 1992 to reach its conclusion as to appellee\u2019s \u201cgross income\u201d to determine if a modification in appellee\u2019s child support obligation was warranted. Because the trial court relied upon appellee\u2019s 1992 finances to calculate his child support obligation, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>erred by including in that calculation any expenses for the calendar year 1993. The trial court can include in an obligor\u2019s \u201cgross income\u201d calculation only the income and ordinary and necessary expenses for one calendar year. R.C. 3113.215(A)(2). Thus, in the instant matter, the trial court could use only appellee\u2019s income and ordinary and necessary expenses for 1992 in determining the amount of appellee\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Moreover, we find the trial court\u2019s reliance upon, for purposes of calculating appellee\u2019s \u201cgross income,\u201d primarily appellee\u2019s 1992 tax return not to be a proper method of calculating \u201cgross income\u201d pursuant to R.C. 3113.215. R.C. 3113.215(A) advances the formula to calculate a party\u2019s gross income for purposes of the worksheet. While a tax return is a proper reference point to aid in calculating a parent\u2019s gross income, it is not the sole determining factor of what constitutes a parent\u2019s \u201cgross income\u201d or \u201cordinary and necessary expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Thus, before the trial court proceeds to division (B)(4) of R.C. 3113.215, which provides for the procedure to determine if there has been a change of circumstances to modify the child support obligation, the trial court herein must recalculate appellee\u2019s child support obligation using only one calendar year to determine appellee\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">For the above stated reasons, appellant\u2019s first, third, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">Assignment of Error No. II</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred as a matter of law when it failed to consider the provisions of Section[s] 3113.215(A)(4)(a) and (B)(5(a) <em>[sic </em>] in not requiring the appellee (father) to verify his current income by showing receipts and expense vouchers, together will <em>[sic </em>] all supporting documentation and schedules for the tax returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">R.C. 3113.215(B)(5)(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">\u201c(5) When a court computes the amount of child support required to be paid under a child support order, all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">\u201c(a) The parents shall verify current and past income and personal earnings with suitable documents, including, but not limited to, paystubs, employer statements, receipts and expense vouchers related to self-generated income, tax returns, and all supporting documentation and schedules for the tax returns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Appellant argues that the trial court relied solely upon appellee\u2019s 1992 tax return, and that appellee failed to provide supporting documentation for the tax return. At the motion to modify hearing, the following colloquy occurred between appellant\u2019s counsel and appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201cQ. In that respect when you discussed this with [your accountant], your tax return, what documents did you show him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cA. I believe I showed him the same documents that I had given to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cQ. Did you show him canceled checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cA. Not unless he asked for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201cQ. Did you show him any receipts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201cA. There again, not unless he asked for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">\u201cQ. Did he ask for canceled checks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-11\"><em>a % </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-12\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">\u201cQ. Did he ask for any receipts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-15\">\u201cQ. So what did you show him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-16\">\u201cA. The same information that I made available to you \u2014 the computer run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-17\">\u201cQ. You showed him a computer run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-18\">\u201cA. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-19\">\u201cQ. Is this the computer run that has been marked as Exhibit No. 3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-20\">\u201cA. Looks like it is, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-21\">\u201cQ. Okay. That\u2019s what he used to base [your] tax return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-22\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-23\">As stated by the testimony of appellee, the only documentation his accountant used in preparing appellee\u2019s 1992 tax return was a computer printout from appellee\u2019s bank reflecting his deposits and withdrawals. This was the only documentation provided for in the record for appellee\u2019s 1992 tax return and the testimony at the June 29 hearing on the motion to modify indicates that this documentation does not adequately portray appellee\u2019s true income. We conclude that the documentation as set forth in the statute should have been provided at the hearing on the motion to modify for purposes of computing appellee\u2019s gross income. The issue is not what documentation is used to prepare his tax return, but, rather, what documentation is necessary to verify current and past income and personal earnings as required by R.C. 3113.215(B)(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-24\">Because appellee did not provide the documentation required by 3113.215(B)(5)(a) at the hearing on the motion to modify, this assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Assignment of Error No. V</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred by failing to find that appellee was \u2018voluntarily underemployed,\u2019 as defined in Section 3113.215(A)(5).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">R.C. 3113.215(A)(5) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">\u201c(5) \u2018Potential income\u2019 means both of the following for a parent that the court determines is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201c(a) The income that the court determines the parent would have earned if fully employed as determined from the parent\u2019s employment potential and probable earnings based on the parent\u2019s recent work history, the parent\u2019s occupational qualifications, and the prevailing job opportunities and salary levels in the community in which the parent resides;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201c(b) Imputed <em>income from </em>any nonincome-producing assets of a parent, as determined from the current rate of long-term treasury bills or another appropriate rate as determined by the court, if the income is significant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">In regard to the issue of whether a parent is \u201cvoluntarily underemployed,\u201d the Ohio Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">\u201cWhether a parent is \u2018voluntarily underemployed\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 3113.215(A)(5), and the amount of \u2018potential income\u2019 to be imputed to a child support obligor, are matters to be determined by the trial court based upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The determination will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 616 N.E.2d 218, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">In several places in the referee\u2019s report, the referee states that appellee\u2019s \u201cimputed income\u201d is $14,845. In the trial court\u2019s ruling on the objections to the referee\u2019s report and its order of modification of child support, it states that a review of the transcript finds no evidence of appellee\u2019s being voluntarily underemployed. We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing and the record and reach the same conclusion as the trial court on this matter. Therefore, despite the referee\u2019s reference to appellee\u2019s income being \u201cimputed,\u201d there is no evidence of such, and the finding of the trial court that there was no imputed income will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">Assignments of Error Nos. I, III, and IV are sustained. Assignments of Error Nos. II and V are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The judgment of the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b741-6\">Evans, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b741-7\">Bryant, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b741-8\">Thomas F. Bryant, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANa\">separately concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">For purposes of calculating child support, the pertinent sections of R.C. 3113.215 should be interpreted to require the determination of personal income derived from the profits of a proprietorship by application of sound accounting principles to relevant, admissible evidence, thus revealing actual profit, not taxable profit determined by the rules for taxation of income. I believe it advisable to sustain all of the first four assignments of error on the basis of that interpretation only and would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings in accord with that rule. I believe the fifth assignment of error is moot. Therefore, I concur in the judgment only insofar as it requires reversal and remand for determination of child support in accordance with the applicable statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
