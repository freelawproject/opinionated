For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the common pleas court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">On September 17, 1991, a jury convicted Ronald Tijerina (\u201cappellant\u201d) of one count of rape, an aggravated felony of the first degree, nine counts of sexual battery, felonies of the third degree, and nine counts of corruption of a minor, felonies of the third degree. The victim of these crimes, Daniel Mohr, is the appellant\u2019s brother-in-law. At trial, Mohr testified that the appellant forced him to engage in anal sex. The appellant is currently serving an indeterminate term of eight to twenty-five years on the rape count, the focus of the appellant\u2019s current appeal. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court in <em>State v. Tijerina </em>(Sept. 30, 1992), Defiance App. No. 4-91-27, unreported, 1992 WL 292407.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">During the appellant\u2019s September 1991 trial, Mohr testified that he and the appellant engaged in anal intercourse approximately thirty-seven times. Of those thirty-seven episodes, Mohr testified that only one involved force. During the appellant\u2019s trial, an expert witness who examined Mohr testified that Mohr exhibited physical symptoms of repeated anal intercourse. Other circumstantial evidence corroborated Mohr\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">On August 11, 1993, Mohr drafted a letter to his sister recanting his trial testimony that the appellant had raped him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 13, 1993, Mohr signed an affidavit, swearing that the appellant \u201cat no time * * * forced me to engage in sexual contact,\u201d and that the appellant \u201cnever engaged in anal intercourse with me.\u201d On August 23, 1993, Mohr audiotaped a discussion with the appellant\u2019s attorney, in which he explained his reasons for lying while testifying at the appellant\u2019s trial, and his decision to recant that testimony. In the taped exchange with the appellant\u2019s attorney, Mohr portrayed himself as a confused youth who labored under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the appellant\u2019s trial. Mohr described his trial testimony implicating the appellant as a means to repair the uneasy relationship between him and his parents, indicating that his parents did not care for the appellant. Mohr claims that he is currently in a drug treatment program, and his new testimony is unencumbered by the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>On September 7, 1993, the appellant, pursuant to Crim.R. 33(B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The trial court ruled that the appellant established by clear and convincing evidence that he was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the alleged victim\u2019s recantation of his trial testimony within the one-hundred-twenty-day window provided by Crim.R. 33. On December 17, 1993, the trial court conducted a hearing on the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. At the hearing, Mohr testified that the appellant did not rape him, that his prior trial testimony was untrue on the issue of force, and that he and the appellant never engaged in anal intercourse. By entry dated February 23, 1994, the trial court denied the appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In denying the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court scrutinized the differences between Mohr\u2019s August 11 letter recanting his trial testimony and his August 13 sworn affidavit recanting his trial testimony, and found the former more credible. In the letter, Mohr claimed that the appellant didn\u2019t \u201ctotally force me to\u201d engage in anal intercourse, while in the affidavit Mohr swore that \u201cRonald Tijerina at no time has forced me to engage in sexual contact * * The trial court concluded that Mohr\u2019s August 11 letter did not recant the issue of force, because Mohr indicated that the appellant did not \u201ctotally force me\u201d to engage in anal sex. The trial court found the distinction between the letter and the affidavit significant, because Mohr\u2019s August 13 affidavit was prepared by the appellant\u2019s attorney, who would grasp the importance of forced sex versus consensual sex in connection with a rape charge. Consequently, the trial court determined that Mohr\u2019s original recantation, as expressed in the August 11 letter, did not, in fact, retract his prior testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The trial court also found Mohr\u2019s original trial testimony more credible than his current testimony. The trial court observed that the motives Mohr expressed for his change in testimony shifted three times. First, in his letter to his sister, Mohr recanted his testimony because of the remorse he felt over the length of the appellant\u2019s incarceration. Then, in his affidavit, Mohr attributed his change in testimony to a \u201cmisguided sense of loyalty and love for my family.\u201d Finally, during the December 17 hearing, Mohr claimed he changed his testimony because he did not want people to think that he was \u201ca fag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Mohr testified at the December 17 hearing that on the eve of that hearing, he contacted the prosecutor and retracted his recantation, telling the prosecutor that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>his trial testimony was true and accurate. The trial court found that the retraction of the recantation raised an inference that Mohr changed his testimony for the benefit of his sister, not because of the falsity of his prior testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Based on these findings, the trial court denied the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. From this order the appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The appellant asserts one assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred to Appellant\u2019s prejudice in overruling Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Crim.R. 33 allows a trial court to entertain a motion for a new trial, and \u201c[t]he allowance of a motion for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence is within the competence and discretion of the trial judge; and in the absence of a clear showing of abuse such decision will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 333, 595 N.E.2d 884, 900, citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 88, 72 O.O.2d 49, 330 N.E.2d 891, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA motion for new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33[B] is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d). An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight v. Lancaster </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 191, 193, 22 OBR 275, 277, 489 N.E.2d 288, 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">With these standards in mind, we turn to the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s request for a new trial. In <em>State v. Petro </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 505, 36 O.O. 165, 76 N.E.2d 370, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that to grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, it must be shown that the new evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\">\u201c(1) discloses a strong possibility that it will change the result if a new trial is granted, (2) * * * has been discovered since the trial, (3) is such as could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the trial, (4) * * * is material to the issues, (5) is not merely cumulative to former evidence, and (6) does not merely impeach or contradict the former evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">The trial court found that the appellant failed to satisfy the first prong of the test enunciated in <em>Petro. </em>Specifically, the appellant failed to demonstrate that the newly discovered evidence discloses a strong possibility that it will change the result if a new trial is granted. The appellant contends that Mohr\u2019s alcohol and drug use during the time of the original trial detracts from the credibility of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>testimony, while his recent sobriety enhances the credibility of his current testimony. The record demonstrates that the trial court considered Mohr\u2019s history of drug and alcohol abuse in rendering its decision, and viewed Mohr\u2019s initial trial testimony as credible and true, and dismissed the recanting testimony as false. The trial court chose not to believe Mohr\u2019s letter and affidavit based upon his testimony at the hearing on the motion for a new trial. That hearing adduced full and complete testimony upon which the trial court reached its conclusion. From the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Mohr\u2019s recantation, alone, would not likely have affected the outcome of a new trial, should one be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-9\">Shaw, P.J., and Hadley, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\">.
