Prior to being heard, both appeals were placed upon this court\u2019s accelerated calendar docket and were consolidated for purposes of briefing and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">In the first appeal, App. No. 93-G-1804, appellant Neil R. Wilson seeks the reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of appellees, Sandra Davis (\u201cDavis\u201d), Edna Best and Robert Best (\u201cBests\u201d), Matthew Lynch (\u201cLynch\u201d), and Lynch <em>&amp; </em>Lynch Co., L.P.A</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">In the second, App. No. 93-G-1814, appellees seek review of the court\u2019s judgment denying their motion for attorney fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">Prior to accepting an appointment as a judge in February 1989, appellant was a practicing attorney in Lake County, Ohio. For approximately three of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>earlier years, appellant represented Sandra Davis and the Bests in certain matters pertaining to the administration of the estate of Walter Best. In November 1988, Davis and the Bests decided to hire a second attorney, Lynch, to assist appellant in bringing an action against the executor of the estate. Approximately one month later, in addition to entering into a contingent fee agreement with Davis and the Bests, Lynch entered into an agreement with appellant as to the splitting of any contingent fee which might result from any action to reduce the amount of attorney and executor fees previously paid to the current executor of the estate. The terms and enforceability of this latter agreement are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Upon receiving the judicial appointment, appellant terminated his representation of Davis and the Bests on February 3, 1989, and sent them a final bill for his hourly services. Davis and the Bests paid this bill. As a result, Lynch became sole counsel in the action against the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In November 1990, Lynch negotiated a settlement of that action, under the terms of which the Bests and Davis received the sum of $350,000. However, while Lynch informed appellant of the settlement, he refused to pay appellant one-fourth of the contingent fee which appellant believed was still owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">In July 1992, after voluntarily dismissing his first action against appellees, appellant filed the instant action in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In both his original and amended complaints, appellant asserted claims sounding in breach of contract and fraud. The former claim was predicated upon the following allegations: (1) in December 1988, appellant had entered into a fee agreement with appellees; (2) this agreement was designed to compensate him for past legal services and future legal services pertaining to the estate; and (3) appellees had refused to pay him his share in accordance with the agreement. After the action had been transferred to Geauga County, appellees moved for summary judgment as to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">As grounds for this motion, appellees primarily argued that any agreement between the parties concerning the payment of a contingent fee to appellant was unenforceable because appellant had not rendered any services subsequent to the date that he became a judge, <em>ie., </em>the agreement was unenforceable because of a lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>In his response to appellees\u2019 motion, appellant maintained that at the time Lynch was added as co-counsel, Davis and the Bests had agreed to pay appellant a part of any contingent fee which would be paid to Lynch from any recovery in the action against the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Appellant further argued that this arrangement had constituted a <em>novation </em>of his original fee agreement with Davis and the Bests. According to appellant, the original agreement had consisted of an \u201cunderstanding\u201d in which Davis and the Bests had agreed to pay him a \u201cfee\u201d for \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d from any recovery obtained by appellant from the executor. In making this argument, appellant did not allege any specifics as to the original \u201cfee,\u201d nor was this \u201cfee\u201d designated as a contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">After appellees had filed a reply brief to appellant\u2019s brief in opposition, the trial court issued its decision granting summary judgment in favor of appellees as to both the contract and fraud claims. Approximately two weeks later, appellees moved for attorney fees, arguing that appellant had engaged in frivolous conduct by bringing the action. As part of this motion, appellees requested that a hearing be held on the motion. Once appellant had responded, the trial court denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">In App. No. 93-G-1804, appellant has raised one assignment of error for review. Under this assignment, he contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to both the contract and fraud claims in his amended complaint because the evidentiary materials attached to his response were sufficient to raise a factual issue as to whether consideration existed for the alleged novation. This argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Prior to addressing the merits of this argument, this court would note that under the contract claim in his amended complaint, appellant specifically referred to only one agreement between the parties. Accordingly, in moving for summary judgment, appellees did not attempt to distinguish between any alleged agreement involving only appellant and Lynch, or, any alleged agreement involving only appellant, Davis, and the Bests. Instead, appellees essentially argued that appellant was not entitled to recover a fee from any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">However, in his brief in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion, appellant asserted that when Lynch was added as co-counsel, three separate agreements existed among the parties: (1) an agreement between Lynch, Davis, and the Bests as to the contingent fee Lynch would receive for bringing a successful action against the executor; (2) an agreement between Lynch and appellant concerning the splitting of the contingency fee; (3) an agreement between appellant, Davis, and the Bests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>providing that appellant would receive one fourth of any contingent fee paid to Lynch in consideration for the unbilled legal services which appellant had rendered in relation to the estate. Appellant further asserted in his brief that he was entitled to recovery under <em>both </em>the second and third agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Although appellant did not specifically refer to three separate agreements in his amended complaint, his allegations were still sufficient to place appellees on notice that his contract claim was predicated upon two different \u201ctheories\u201d of relief. As was noted above, appellant alleged under his contract claim that appellees had agreed to pay him a portion of the contingent fee to compensate him for both past legal services and future legal services. Thus, in deciding whether summary judgment should have been granted on the contract claim, this court will address both theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In moving for summary judgment as to the contract claim, appellees\u2019 position was that the basic fee-splitting arrangement had lacked consideration in two respects: (1) appellant did not render any subsequent legal services against the fiduciary; and (2) past services did not constitute consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Although appellees did not attempt to distinguish between the three separate agreements alleged by appellant, their first argument was relevant to the issue of whether the alleged agreement between Lynch and appellant was enforceable. In turn, their second argument was relevant to the issue of the validity of the alleged agreement between appellant, Davis, and the Bests.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Appellant argued in his response to the summary judgment motion that forgiveness of the unspecified fee for the past \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d constituted legally sufficient consideration for the novation which provided a payment of twenty-five percent of any contingent fee collected by Lynch. In support of this argument, he attached his own affidavit to his brief in opposition. This document set forth a chronological statement of the sequence of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201c2. Affiant had a long-standing attorney-client relationship with Defendants Edna Best, Robert Best and Sandra Best (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the Best family\u2019) in a wide range of legal matters including financial and legal advice, individual estate planning and the preparation of documents pertaining thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201c3. One of the legal matters for which the Best family consulted [appellant] pertained to their dissatisfaction with the handling of the Estate of Walter Best by the Estate\u2019s fiduciary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">\u201c4. An understanding existed between [appellant] and the Best family that when monies were recouped from or on behalf of the fiduciary of the Estate of Walter Best as a result of the fiduciary\u2019s misfeasance or malfeasance, [appellant] would be entitled to a fee from that specific recovery <em>for unbilled legal services provided to the Best family over a period of years pertaining to the estate;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201c7. The letters of 12-01-88 and 12-15-88 constitute a contract containing three separate and distinct agreements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\"><em>\u201c8. </em>One of the agreements was a <em>novation </em>of the oral contract [appellant] had with the Best Family <em>regarding payment of legal fees on a contingent fee basis for the recovery of funds wrongfully paid to the fiduciary of the Estate of Walter Best </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Considered as a whole, the averments in appellant\u2019s affidavit alleged that at some unspecified point prior to the date upon which Lynch was retained as co-counsel, he had reached \u201can understanding\u201d with Davis and the Bests that should actual litigation result over the issue of excess executor and attorney fees, he would be paid a fee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the recovery for \u201cunbilled legal services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Section four of appellant\u2019s affidavit makes it clear that the only source for fees for these \u201cunbilled services\u201d would be money recouped from the fiduciary in this regard. Further, it is evident that these past \u201cunbilled services\u201d were of a general nature in relation to the estate, rather than services or litigation specifically relating to the issue of a reduction of any excess executor and attorney fees charged by the fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Appellant\u2019s averments further alleged that after it became apparent that appellant might be appointed to the bench and thus would not be able to continue to represent Davis and the Bests in that action, that these same appellees had subsequently agreed, in the alleged unwritten novation, to pay appellant a <em>contingent </em>fee for these \u201cunbilled\u201d legal services from any recovery generated by Lynch against the fiduciary. Appellant described this as a novation of an earlier fee agreement, the consideration for which was the forgiveness of any fee due for the earlier \u201cunbilled legal services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">In relation to the issue of Lynch\u2019s individual liability, this court would first note that even if valid, any such contract or novation which appellant had with the Bests and Davis would not extend and be enforceable against Lynch solely on the basis of the above underlying debt. Appellant\u2019s debtors as to those earlier \u201cunpaid legal services\u201d were the Bests and Davis, not Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Any claim to be made directly against Lynch by appellant had to result from an agreement between Lynch and appellant which had to be supported by independent consideration of some kind. As to this particular prong of appellant\u2019s contract claim, appellee Lynch did not contest the existence of a fee-splitting agreement between himself and appellant; instead, he asserted that the consideration of appellant\u2019s future services as co-counsel was contemplated but never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>provided. Thus, this agreement was no longer enforceable because appellant did not render any compensable services as co-counsel with Lynch after this agreement was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In support of this argument, appellees emphasize that any \u201cservices\u201d actually performed by appellant were only those which any attorney would be legally bound to do upon withdrawal from a case, pursuant to DR 2 \u2014 110(A)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In response to this argument, appellant asserted that the agreement between himself and Lynch was still enforceable because, even though he did not perform any work on the action against the executor before he withdrew from the case, he had always been ready to assist or cooperate with Lynch in pursuing the action against the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">However, R.C. 4705.01 specifically states that a judge cannot engage in the practice of law during his tenure on the bench. Therefore, even if Lynch had sought appellant\u2019s assistance while negotiating the settlement to the action, appellant could not have provided such assistance beyond that contemplated under DR 2 \u2014 110(A)(2). Under such circumstances, appellant\u2019s assertion that he \u201cstood ready to help\u201d would not constitute sufficient consideration supporting the agreement between himself and Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In relation to the issue of Lynch\u2019s liability, this court would note that appellant did not advance any theory in reference to Lynch\u2019s status as holder of the money in question. His only claims against Lynch sounded in fraud and contract. If appellant had remained as co-counsel of record long enough to have rendered some legal services and to have maintained some responsibility for the case, there would be no real issue that appellant and Lynch would have had a valid and enforceable legal contract between them to split the fee. DR 2-107(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Case law in Ohio and elsewhere supports the proposition that because of its nature, a contingent fee arrangement need not have the same proportionate relationship to the work actually performed as would an hourly fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">That was not the case, as appellant <em>never </em>functioned as co-counsel and, in fact, voluntarily withdrew from the case long before any recovery was generated; therefore, no obligation existed on Lynch\u2019s part to share the contingent fee under appellant\u2019s theory of a fee-splitting agreement. We see a distinct difference between <em>no </em>work being done and <em>some </em>work being done. Thus, the portion of the summary judgment referencing Lynch\u2019s liability on the contract is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">As to the alleged agreement between appellant, Davis, and the Bests, appellees primarily maintained that appellant\u2019s evidentiary materials had not been sufficient to raise a factual issue as to the existence of the pre-novation \u201cunderstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ing\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d contract concerning the payment of a fee for unbilled legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Specifically, appellees contended that for the purpose of responding to a summary judgment motion, appellant\u2019s averments in his affidavit had not been sufficient to establish that the existence of the pre-novation \u201cunderstanding\u201d or \u201cagreement\u201d rose to the level of a contract. That was because the averments did not establish one of the basic requirements necessary for a contract \u2014 consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Based upon this, appellees further argued that although appellant\u2019s reference to past \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d might have raised a factual issue as to whether the services had been rendered, it did not raise an issue as to whether these services created a legal debt upon which a novation could be predicated,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to wit: it did not establish that these services had value.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">As a general proposition, this court would agree that the mere fact that appellant rendered \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d did not necessarily mean that Davis and the Bests were originally indebted to him, gratuitously rendered services cannot later be magically transformed into consideration for a new debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Like a general contract, a contract of novation must be supported by sufficient consideration to be enforceable. 18 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1980) 213, Contracts, Section 290. The courts of this state have consistently held that if one party is already indebted to the second party, the release or forgiveness of that <em>prior </em>debt constitutes sufficient consideration to support a novation. See, <em>e.g., McGlothin v. Huffman </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 240, 640 N.E.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Thus, if appellant\u2019s affidavit were sufficient to raise a factual issue as to whether Davis and the Bests had been indebted to him for these \u201cunbilled legal services,\u201d summary judgment would not have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">As was noted above, appellant averred in his affidavit that at some point prior to the addition of Lynch as co-counsel, an \u201cunderstanding\u201d had been reached between himself, Davis, and the Bests that they would pay him a fee for the \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d he had rendered through the years in.relation to the estate. When interpreted in a light most favorable to appellant, this averment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>was sufficient to raise a factual issue as to the existence of both offer and acceptance. Moreover, this court would agree that appellant\u2019s reference to \u201cunbilled services\u201d raised an issue as to whether such \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d were performed as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Nevertheless, our review of the relevant case law in this state indicates that in order to establish that the \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d constituted a debt, such that its forgiveness constituted consideration sufficient to support the novation, appellant also had to show that the \u201cfee\u201d contemplated in the <em>original </em>agreement was <em>reasonable </em>in light of the \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d rendered. In reviewing appellant\u2019s evidentiary materials, we conclude that appellant failed to carry his burden as to this factual issue in responding to appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In reaching this conclusion, it is important to remember that the <em>original </em>agreement did not specify a contingent fee. An attorney seeking the recovery of attorney fees in a noncontingent fee situation must demonstrate that the value of the services rendered bears some relationship to the resulting fee. Put another way, in order to carry his burden of proof, the attorney must present some evidence that these \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d had value sufficient to constitute consideration for the client\u2019s promise to pay. The attorney must establish the \u201cfairness and reasonableness\u201d of the fee. <em>Hermann, Cahn &amp; Schneider v. Viny </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 132, 537 N.E.2d 236; <em>Fox &amp; Assoc. Co., L.P.A. v. Purdon </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 69, 541 N.E.2d 448; DR 2-106, Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In relation to the issue of which party has the burden of establishing a fee\u2019s fairness and reasonableness, the Sixth Appellate District has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">\u201c1. Prior to employment and the formation of the fiduciary relationship between attorney and client, compensation for services rendered by the attorney may be fixed by contract; and, in the absence of fraud or overreaching, the contract will be enforced without the attorney showing it is fair and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">\u201c2. After the establishment of the fiduciary relationship between attorney and client, the attorney has the burden to establish the fairness and reasonableness of his fee.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Holston </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 55, 434 N.E.2d 738, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">In its determination that the burden of establishing the reasonableness of a fee switches to the attorney if a fiduciary relationship between the attorney and the client has already been established, the <em>Jacobs </em>court cited to both the common law and the Code of Professional Responsibility. In relation to the latter, the court stated that \u201ca court of law should not lend its support to the enforcement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>a contract which may violate a Supreme Court Disciplinary Rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio App.2d at 60, 434 N.E.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In <em>Jacobs, </em>the plaintiff-attorney was granted summary judgment on his claim for attorney fees. On appeal, the Sixth Appellate District held that summary judgment was warranted because the attorney had not submitted any materials showing the reasonableness of the fee. The court emphasized that a mere conclusory statement in the attorney\u2019s affidavit was not sufficient to raise a factual issue as to this point. See, also, <em>Franken v. Ungaro </em>(June 18, 1988), Mahoning App. No. 86 C.A. 181, unreported, 1988 WL 67522.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In interpreting Civ.R. 56, this court has held that in responding to a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must submit evidentiary material as to each factual issue upon which he will have the burden of proof at trial. <em>Pasqualone v. Strauss </em>(Dec. 17,1993), Lake App. No. 92-L-174, unreported, 1993 WL 548468, citing <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Given that an attorney must submit evidential material tending to show the reasonableness of his fee in order to be granted summary judgment, it follows under <em>Pasqualone </em>that an attorney must satisfy this same burden in responding to a defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In this case, appellant\u2019s evidentiary materials indicated that a fiduciary relationship existed between himself, Davis, and the Bests when the underlying prenovation fee agreement was reached. However, appellant failed to designate in his materials the value of a single specific instance of a legal service rendered or legal expertise provided under the original agreement. A general recitation of \u201c[pjhone conversations, research, file review, meetings, * * * \u201d without offering some corresponding claim as to value was simply inadequate to raise a factual issue as to whether such a fee in relation to such services was \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d thus constituting legal consideration which would establish a debt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">In any other type of noncontingent fee dispute, appellant would have had to put forth an itemized list of services rendered and time spent before the client would have been required to present evidence challenging the fairness and reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>ness of the fee claimed. No merchant suing on an account would survive a summary judgment exercise with the statement, \u201cI sold them some merchandise of unknown quantity and value for which they owe me some money. I know it was like the other merchandise I sell, but I can\u2019t specifically remember what it was.\u201d This ability to only <em>\u201cgenerally </em>\u201d recollect, rather than to <em>specifically </em>recollect even <em>one </em>instance, is insufficient to establish a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In summation, this court concludes that although appellant may have presented sufficient materials to raise a factual issue as to the existence of the prior \u201cunbilled legal services,\u201d he did not carry the simple burden on the issue of whether the <em>value </em>of such \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d was sufficient to create a debt, the forgiveness of which would constitute sufficient consideration for a subsequent novation. Under such circumstances, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Davis and the Bests as to the contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In addition to appellant\u2019s breach-of-contract claim, appellees also moved for summary judgment as to his claim of fraud. While appellant testified to his belief that Lynch had engaged in fraudulent behavior, he was unable to testify to or present any evidentiary material setting forth the elements of fraud. Thus, he failed to demonstrate that any of the appellees had engaged in fraudulent behavior. In fact, appellant\u2019s affidavit did not contain any averment as to this particular claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Despite appellant\u2019s protests to the contrary, we do not perceive the trial court\u2019s analysis to have been a \u201cweighing of the evidence.\u201d Rather we see it as a matter of determining the sufficiency of appellant\u2019s submissions, particularly in light of <em>Wing. </em>Did appellant establish that legal services were rendered in the original fee arrangement and that those services had value such that they created a debt, the forgiveness of which would have constituted consideration for the subsequent novation? We think not. Thus, we do not agree that the trial judge acted as a factfinder, but rather pursued his proper role here as a determiner of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Pursuant to the foregoing analysis, this court concludes that appellant\u2019s evidentiary material was insufficient to withstand summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claim, as well as the fraud claim. Thus, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">In App. No. 93-G-1814, appellees have raised one assignment of error for consideration. Under this assignment, appellees contend that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing prior to ruling upon their motion for attorney fees. Specifically, they maintain that under R.C. 2323.51(B), the trial court was required to hold an oral hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">R.C. 2323.51(B)(1) provides that a trial court may award reasonable attorney fees to any party that was adversely affected by frivolous conduct during the course of an action. Subsection (B)(2) of the statute then states that such an award can be made only if the court does all of the following: (a) sets a date for a hearing on the motion for attorney fees; (b) gives notice of the hearing date to the parties and counsel; and (c) conducts the hearing and allows the parties the opportunity to present evidence on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In interpreting these requirements, this court has emphasized that R.C. 2323.51(B)(1) does not state that a hearing must be held whenever a motion for fees has been timely filed; instead, the statute provides that an award \u201cmay be made\u201d if the procedural requirements have been met. Based upon this reasoning, we have held that a hearing is not required when the trial court denies the motion on its face. <em>Cregar v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(Jan. 11,1991), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4316, unreported, 1991 WL 1579. This holding was evidently predicated upon the proposition that if the motion is based solely upon facts which are already known by the trial court, a hearing is not needed if the court has determined that the facts do not support a finding of frivolous conduct, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">As grounds for their motion in this case, appellees maintained that the filing of the instant action constituted frivolous conduct because appellant\u2019s claims were not warranted under the existing law. This type of argument was clearly one which the trial court could fully review without benefit of a hearing. Thus, pursuant to the foregoing authority, appellees\u2019 sole assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Pursuant to the foregoing analysis, the judgments of the trial court in case Nos. 93-G-1804 and 93-G-1814 are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b803-11\">Joseph E.

Prior to rendering its final judgments in this case, the trial court ordered that the record in the first action between the parties be incorporated into the record of this case. Thus, not only were the various filings in the first action before the trial court when it granted summary judgment in favor of appellees in this case, but those filings are a part of the entire record before this court. Our review of these documents indicates that the first action, which was brought in Geauga County, was voluntarily dismissed by appellant approximately one month before the instant action was filed in Cuyahoga County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b797-12\">.

In replying to appellant\u2019s brief in opposition to the summary judgment motion, appellees did not contest the fact that appellant, Davis, and the Bests had entered into a fee agreement at the time that Lynch was added as co-counsel. In fact, appellees\u2019 evidentiary materials implicitly supported the existence of this particular agreement, in that Lynch did not deny that he had initially set aside one fourth of the contingent fee to give to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">However, appellees argued that the consideration for this agreement was to have been appellant\u2019s participation as co-counsel in the litigation, <em>i.e., </em>appellees denied that this agreement was a novation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. The only reference to the specifics of these unknown legal services is found in appellant's deposition of November 29, 1991 at pages 111-112:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\"Q. Okay.

Lansberry </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 570, 577-578, 629 N.E.2d 431, 437 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">I, too, believe that <em>\u201ceven </em>those who are most critical of lawyers and the legal profession would find [the policy adopted by the majority] to be patently unfair.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 578, 629 N.E.2d at 437. As such, I miist respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Initially, I will note that this matter arose from a summary judgment exercise, and the trial court is to construe the evidence <em>most strongly </em>in the favor of the nonmoving party, the appellant. Civ.R. 56(C). This court is not to weigh the evidence, but to determine if the nonmoving has produced evidence on any issue on which it bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The record herein contains sufficient evidence for the purposes of summary judgment that appellant performed services on the underlying matter. As delineated below, the testimony offered at the depositions is replete with material to substantiate appellant\u2019s claim that genuine issues of material fact remain. I emphasize again that the question before us is whether summary judgment was properly granted here, not who would ultimately prevail on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The majority places great emphasis on the phrase \u201cunbilled legal services,\u201d and expends a substantial amount of effort analyzing its relationship to appellant\u2019s entitlement to the fees under the theory of \u201cnovation.\u201d Such a discussion is unnecessary, as the record quite simply reveals that the \u201cunbilled legal services\u201d are those services rendered in connection with the matter from which this claim arose prior to the co-counsel affiliation between appellant and appellee Lynch. The majority rather summarily opines that \u201cthese past \u2018unbilled services\u2019 were of a general nature in relation to the estate, rather than services or litigation specifically relating to the issue of a reduction of any excess executor and attorney fees charged by the fiduciary.\u201d However, in reaching this conclusion, the majority fails to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the appellant. The record contains evidence that appellant performed work on the subject matter <em>prior </em>to the' referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">At deposition, the appellant, when questioned by appellee, Matthew J.D. Lynch, testified as follows concerning the fee agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>\u201cA. And again, I think it was also the intention of everybody that \u2014 that <em>one of the things that I provided as a basis for this agreement was an extensive amount of work on the file, and with the Dolan law </em>firm<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that had gone on prior to the agreement. I think, in part, the agreement was a recognition of the extensive work that I had \u2014 had already done on the matter.

That there would be an hourly billing on some of those matters, but that if the matter ever matured into something more, there was some indications that there would be a \u2014 there would, in fact, have to be some other fee arrangement that would be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">u # sfc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">\u201cA. The initial occasions in the representation were that I was to direct myself to just a couple of specific questions concerning the \u2014 the estate, very limited contract. But you know, as the representation continued, you know, there became more and more indications that there were more and more problems with the estate * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\"><em>U </em>\u00ed]\u00ed iji \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-10\">\u201cA. <em>Well again, the agreement was that </em>\u2014 that <em>there were substantial services that had already been performed </em>\u2014 that <em>had been performed prior to that time that there were uncompensated, and that would </em>\u2014 that <em>would be merged into this agreement, yeah.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The appellant further delineated his understanding of the basis for the fee splitting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\">\u201cA. But \u2014 but yeah, there \u2014 it did contemplate also that \u2014 the basis of the agreement was that, under any circumstances <em>[sic </em>], I wasn\u2019t going to perform a lot of services under this contract. I mean, even if I had not gotten the appointment to the bench, and even if I continued to practice law, I \u2014 I was not going to be deeply involved in this matter from that point on * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">\u201cA. * * * I think you were being brought in as a \u2014 as counsel in this to \u2014 to handle the litigation at that point. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Independently, the evidential table is replete with material to demonstrate that appellant performed work <em>after </em>the referral:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">\u201cA. It was a wide ranging discussion between you and [me] as to what had gone on in the file. I gave you, I think, a fairly thorough background and briefing of a fairly complex and involved legal matter, and I think you, you know, based on \u2014 on that briefing, I think had a very thorough understanding of \u2014 of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\"><em>U </em>* * \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\">\u201cA. * * * [Y]ou and I had several discussions and/or meetings in \u2014 in connection with this legal matter. We discussed the \u2014 the history of the matter, and the facts of the matter, and our \u2014 we shared our \u2014 our legal thoughts on the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Clearly, this colloquy provides an evidential table sufficient to overcome the summary judgment hurdle. Construing this evidence most favorably, one may conclude that the appellant had performed work on the underlying action, <em>both before and after the referral, </em>creating the entitlement to payment pursuant to the fee-splitting agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The majority also disputes appellant\u2019s contention that a contingent fee arrangement was entered into by the parties. However, reasonable minds could conclude that the parties had intended such a fee agreement. Specifically, the materials supplied in connection with appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, appellant\u2019s opposition to the motion, and appellees\u2019 reply, when viewed in a light most favorable to the appellant, support this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">Appellees submitted copies of two letters dated December 1, 1988 and December 15, 1988, in support of their motion for summary judgment. The December 1,1988 letter from appellee Lynch to the Bests and Davis, notes: \u201cI look forward to working with [appellant] to resolve this situation as soon as possible.\u201d The December 15, 1988 letter from appellant to appellee Lynch, apparently prepared subsequent to a telephonic communication between the two attorneys, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\">\u201cAn agreement has been reached between yourself, myself, and the Best family concerning your proposal, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\"><em>ii % </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-13\">\u201c3. Any fees paid by the Best family to you for this representation representing <em>the contigency [sic] fee portion will be split between you and [me] with you receiving seventy five percent (75%) of that fee and me receiving twenty five percent (25%) of that fee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Furthermore, appellant attached an affidavit to his opposition to the motion. In addition to the portion relied upon by the majority,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the affiant stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201c9. Affiant did provide all assistance requested of him by [appellee] Lynch[;] on no occasions <em>[sic </em>] did he refuse to cooperate with or assist [appellee] Lynch, and did provide legal services to the Best family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">\u201c11. [Appellee] Lynch repeatedly consulted with Affiant over the nearly two year period from December, 1988 through November, 1990 pertaining to matters surrounding the Estate of Walter Best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">\u201c12. [Appellee] Lynch represented to Affiant in December, 1990 that he had set aside Affiant\u2019s fee.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Finally, appended to appellees.\u2019 reply brief, are the affidavits of the Bests and Davis. All three contain the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\">\u201c[A]t no time did the undersigned enter into any understanding, agreement, oral contract, or written contract with [appellant] for the payment of legal fees on any other basis [other than hourly], including any contingent fees, until December of 1988 when [appellant], the undersigned, and [appellee] Matthew Lynch entered into the agreement contained in the letters of December 1 and December 15, 1988.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">By appellees\u2019 own admissions, these affidavits taken in conjunction with the letters and, in particular, the December 15, 1988 letter delineating the fee schedule, certainly support the conclusion that the parties had entered into a fee-splitting agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Not only do I disagree with the majority\u2019s analytical conclusions regarding the state of the evidence, I also disagree with the legal pronouncements espoused in its dicta. The majority rather summarily concludes that appellant \u201cvoluntarily withdrew from the case long before any recovery was generated; therefore, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>obligation existed on Lynch\u2019s part to share the contingent fee * * Again, without viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant, the majority dismisses his claim in a cursory fashion by concluding: \u201cAny claim to be made directly against Lynch by appellant had to result from an agreement between Lynch and appellant which had to be supported by independent consideration of some kind.\u201d However, in <em>King v. Housel </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 228, 556 N.E.2d 501, the court recognized the right of one attorney to directly pursue another: \u201c \u2018[W]here both attorneys have rendered services and one collects the entire fee, he is liable to the other in accordance with the terms of [a fee-sharing] agreement.\u2019 <em>Gugle v. Loeser </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 362, 28 O.O. 318, 55 N.E.2d 580, at paragraph two of the syllabus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 556 N.E.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The majority also declares that \u201cappellant could not have provided such assistance beyond that contemplated under DR 2-110(A)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While a judge is precluded from performing further legal work, he should be afforded a reasonable time in which to wind-up his practice. This is to safeguard the interests of soon-to-be former clients by allowing appellant and others similarly situated to inform new counsel of past events or by clarifying files. This type of \u201crepresentation\u201d should be permissible, and even encouraged, as long as the judge does not provide advice about the future conduct of the representation. To hold otherwise would be contra the underlying tenets of the legal profession, as the best interests of the client would not be served. Furthermore, nothing within R.C. 4705.01 or Canon 5(F) of the Code of Judicial Conduct precludes a judge from receiving compensation for work performed prior to donning a robe and assuming the bench, whether the fee is based upon hourly billings or a contingent fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">While I disagree with these conclusions for the reasons stated previously, I also take issue with the legal principle announced by the majority. Specifically, I take umbrage with the majority\u2019s conclusion that to be entitled to a split-fee arrangement, appellant had to \u201c[remain] as co-counsel of record long enough to have rendered some legal services and to have maintained some responsibility for the case * * Under this published rule, an attorney would be required to perform work on the matter <em>after </em>it has been referred to co-counsel. Merely rendering services before the referral would be insufficient to support a division of fees under the majority\u2019s application of the pertinent canon. However, no court in Ohio, to this writer\u2019s knowledge, has reached such a conclusion. The only requirement here appears to be that the referring attorney perform some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>measurable work on the matter. See, <em>e.g., Waterman v. Kitrick </em>(1990), 60 Ohio App.3d 7, 572 N.E.2d 250; R.C. 4705.08 and DR 2-107(A). Nothing requires that the work be undertaken subsequent to the transfer of the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Additionally, I part company with the majority, as its decision would invite attorneys to delay referring matters in a timely fashion. Rather than direct the matter to co-counsel with appropriate expertise with the two advocates sharing the proceeds based upon a prearranged percentage, the initial attorney may be more inclined to retain the file to ensure that he has \u201cjustified\u201d his fees should they be subsequently questioned by either the client or co-counsel. Such actions may not be in the best interest of the client, and they should be discouraged, not encouraged. Therefore, as long as the record demonstrates that an attorney who has entered into a fee-splitting arrangement on a contingent fee matter has rendered some measurable work on the matter, a court should not subject the attorney to the task of demonstrating the reasonableness of the resulting fee under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Finally, the majority concludes by returning its focus to the issue of \u201cnovation\u201d and embarks on an auxiliary discussion of \u201cthe sufficiency of the consideration,\u201d and whether appellant\u2019s \u201cservices had value.\u201d The majority, in undertaking this analysis, applies standards which are applicable to noncontingent fee matters.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For the reasons previously discussed, I do not venture into the \u201ctroubled waters\u201d of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Additionally, I find that the majority\u2019s conclusion is wholly inconsistent with the contingent fee practice which is based upon the concept that an attorney agrees to accept employment and receive payment conditioned upon resolution of the matter favorable to the client.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Regardless of the size of the award, the attorney is entitled to that agreed-upon percentage <em>irrespective </em>of the amount of time spent by that attorney on the file. The size of the fee is not subject to review as long as it is not unreasonable in proportion to the sum recovered by the client. In other words, as long as the percentage is reasonable, the size of the fee generated should not be questioned. This syllogism is also predicated on the notion that the parties have entered into an arm\u2019s-length agreement for the attorney\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>In <em>Williamson v. Belovich </em>(1993), 84 Ohio App.3d 628, 632-633, 617 N.E.2d 786, 789, the court upheld an attorney\u2019s entitlement under a contingent fee \u201ccontract to take fifty percent of all proceeds, including statutory attorney fees * * In obtaining the conclusion, the court cited <em>Wilmington v. J.I. Case Co. </em>(C.A.8, 1986), 793 F.2d 909, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">\u201cTo our minds, to limit attorney compensation in that manner would be an unwarranted interference with a private contract. As the Eleventh Circuit has observed, a contingent fee contract represents the client\u2019s and the attorney\u2019s notions of a reasonable fee * * <em>Id. </em>at 923.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Under the position espoused by the majority, the contingent fee would, in essence, be significantly gelded, if not abolished, under such facts. In every case, a client dissatisfied with the compensation the attorney receives would be able to petition the court to review the fee agreement in relation to the work provided.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I do not endorse, nor do I believe, that the Supreme Court of Ohio has sanctioned such strict scrutiny of fee-splitting arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In conclusion, the evidential table was sufficient to establish a question of fact that the appellant worked on the file, and that payment for these services was governed by a fee-splitting agreement accepted by the parties. Absent a patently unreasonable contingent fee arrangement, I would not require the appellant to \u201c[remain] as co-counsel of record long enough to have rendered some legal services and to have maintained some responsibility for the case * * * \u201d to earn his fee, thereby lessening the blow of the punch line from, as Justice Douglas stated: \u201cthe worst of the bad jokes about lawyers.\u201d <em>Lansberry, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 577, 629 N.E.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">For obvious reasons, the analysis is dispositive of appellees\u2019 assigned error regarding the court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, I concur with the result obtained by the majority in its treatment of appellees\u2019 assignment. Additionally, I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s fraud allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Therefore, I must respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b805-14\">. The Dolan law firm had been responsible for handling the estate and ultimately agreed to a reduction in attorney and executor fees. It is from this reduction that appellant is claiming his entitlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b807-13\">. The majority stresses the fact that appellant, in his affidavit uses the term \"fee\u201d rather than \"contingent fee\u201d to describe the compensation arrangement. However, I believe that this is a distinction without substance in a summary judgment exercise. Furthermore, the letter exchange of December 1, 1988 and December 15, 1988 clearly calls for a contingent fee contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b807-14\">. There is no dispute that Lynch had set aside $29,137.50. This amount represents one quarter of the $116,665.00 contingent fee received by Lynch. From this, one may reasonably infer that Lynch understood there to be a valid fee-sharing agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b807-15\">. The majority also suggests that appellant does not have a cause of action against Lynch. However, as noted previously, the record indicates that Lynch accepted the terms of the fee-splitting contract, and Lynch even put the appellant's share aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">. The majority suggests that the agreement is void as it may violate a Supreme Court of Ohio Disciplinary Rule. However, in <em>King </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \"A lawyer's failure to fully disclose a fee agreement to a client as required by DR 2-107(A)(l) may not be used by the noncomplying attorney to avoid enforcement by the other of an otherwise valid fee agreement.''</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. While the majority recognizes that \"a contingent fee agreement need not have the same proportionate relationship to the work actually performed as would an hourly fee,\u201d I do not share their general view that an attorney must demonstrate the reasonableness of the resulting fee generated in connection with a contingent fee contract under all circumstances, although I understand that some contingent fee situations might require such a showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. This, of course, assumes that the client recovers. Obviously, if not, the attorney is precluded from pursuing the client for the value of his services for the work performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">. I would envision the following scenario: An attorney is retained in a wrongful death matter. The extent of the coverage afforded under the insurance policy of the tortfeasor is substantially less than the damages suffered, and the insurance company, upon receipt of a letter of representation from the attorney, elects to tender the policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The majority would require the attorney to demonstrate the reasonableness of the standard one quarter or one third fee for drafting one letter to an insurer. Clearly, no attorney could justify an hourly billing which would generate such an entitlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
