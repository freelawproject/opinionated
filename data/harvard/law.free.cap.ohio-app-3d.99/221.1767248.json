(\u201cRoyal\u201d) appeals from an order of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cState Auto\u201d) in this commercial liability insurance coverage dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Royal filed a one-count complaint for declaratory judgment, damages and other relief against State Auto in the trial court on August 17, 1992. Royal\u2019s complaint alleged State Auto breached its duty to defend and indemnify Royal under a comprehensive general business liability insurance policy in connection with a lawsuit filed against Royal by Hercules Products, Inc. (\u201cHercules\u201d). The lawsuit filed against Royal by Hercules involved claims that water pump component parts manufactured by Royal and sold to Hercules were negligently made and failed to conform to the sales contract and various express and implied warranties (the \u201cHercules Litigation\u201d). Royal sought in the declaratory judgment action to recover from State Auto the amount it paid to Hercules to settle the component part litigation together with costs incurred by Royal in defending the Hercules Litigation. State Auto denied the substantive allegations of Royal\u2019s complaint and raised various affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">State Auto thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment in addition to a joint stipulation of facts with exhibits on July 30, 1993. State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment argued the Hercules Litigation did not fall within the scope of its commercial general liability insurance coverage for \u201coccurrences\u201d under the policy and was subject to four policy exclusions. Royal filed a brief in opposition to State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment with additional exhibits on August 23, 1993. State Auto subsequently filed a reply brief making additional legal arguments in support of its motion for summary judgment on September 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The trial court granted State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment in an order journalized September 15, 1993. Royal timely appeals raising the following three related assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cI. Trial court erred in granting defendant/appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cII. Trial court erred in failing to find that defendant was obligated to defend the suit filed against plaintiff by Hercules Products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\u201cHI. The trial court erred in failing to find that defendant was obligated to indemnify and reimburse plaintiff for the reasonable settlement plaintiff made in the suit filed against it by Hercules Products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">Royal\u2019s three assignments of error lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Royal generally argues the trial court improperly granted State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment since the claims in the Hercules Litigation arguably or potentially fell within the scope of the commercial general liability policy issued to Royal by State Auto and did not fall within any policy exclusion. Royal specifically argues the Hercules Complaint contained claims for \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of an \u201coccurrence\u201d which were not excluded by any provision within the policy, <em>ie., </em>any exception to the policy exclusionary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">However, it is well established that summary judgment is warranted pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C) when, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the record demonstrates the following, <em>viz.: </em>(1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion; and (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. Based on our review of the record in compliance with this standard, Royal has failed to demonstrate the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to State Auto in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">It is well settled in this context that the identical standards of construction apply to insurance contracts as apply in other written contracts. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 665, 597 N.E.2d 1096, 1102. The Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy coverage provision in dispute in the case <em>sub judice </em>provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\u201cCOVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c1. Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">\u201ca. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking these damages. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">\u201cb. This insurance applies to * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">\u201c(1) The * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an <em>\u2018occurrence </em>\u2019 that takes place in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019 * * * [emphasis added].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is thereafter defined in Section V of the insurance policy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">\u201c9. <em>\u2018Occurrence\u2019 means an accident, </em>including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>This court of appeals must review the allegations in the complaint filed by-Hercules against Royal to determine whether any of the claims potentially or arguably fell within the scope of the insurance policy coverage. <em>Zanco v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 114, 11 OBR 413, 464 N.E.2d 513. The Hercules Complaint in the case <em>sub judice </em>arose from allegedly defective component parts supplied by Royal to Hercules and contained the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201c14. Defendants had a duty to properly design and manufacture the pump component molds and pump component parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201c15. Defendants breached this duty because several problems arose with the pumps, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201ca) a lack of concentricity of the impeller due to poor tool design, tool maintenance, molding process, and component welding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cb) failure to use the material desired as a result of improper identification of sample plastic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cc) the use of material contaminated with machinery oil;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201cd) failure to inform Hercules of the vulnerability of the plastic used in the final product; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">\u201ce) failure to properly identify the characteristics of the seal needed to install the impeller, resulting in contamination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cThese problems caused or contributed to significant stress on a weakened material, thereby causing extensive cracking and breakage of the impeller, <em>as well as damaging other components of the completed pump product. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">\u201c16. The problems described in the preceding paragraph caused the pumps to fail and proximately caused significant damages to Hercules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">These claims in the Hercules Complaint allege \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of a breach of contract. However, the Hercules Complaint clearly does not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the scope of the general liability policy in the case <em>sub judice. Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., supra. </em>As noted above, the insurance policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d to mean \u201can accident.\u201d This language is \u201cclear and plain, something only a lawyer\u2019s ingenuity could make ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 664, 597 N.E.2d at 1101. It would take an exceptionally fertile mind to contort the meaning of the term \u201caccident\u201d to encompass the claims in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">The Hercules Complaint contains absolutely no allegation of \u201caccident\u201d and simply contains claims by a manufacturer against a component parts supplier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that improperly manufactured component parts. No customer ever sued Hercules or Royal for property damage based on an occurrence. It is well established that a general commercial liability policy does not cover claims of negligent manufacture as in the case <em>sub judice. Hamilton Die Cast, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(C.A.7 1975), 508 F.2d 417 (applying Ohio law). <em>Insurance coverage is limited to claims of negligent manufacture which, result in an occurrence. </em>Since the Hercules Complaint did not allege such an occurrence, the trial court properly granted summary judgment for State Auto in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">State Auto also argued in the trial court that it properly denied coverage for any of the claims in Hercules Litigation based on four separate business risk exclusions in Section I, Part 2 of the insurance policy. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., supra; Zanco v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., supra. </em>The four policy exclusions relied on by State Auto to exclude coverage for the claims in the Hercules Litigation follow, <em>viz.: </em>(1) the \u201cwork performed\u201d exclusion; (2) the \u201cimpaired property\u201d exclusion; (3) the \u201csistership\u201d exclusion; and (4) the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d These four exclusions generally deny coverage for damages resulting from defective work or products provided by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">A cursory examination of the specific claims for damages set forth in Paragraph 17 of the Hercules Complaint reveals many of the claims are excluded in whole or in part by one or more of these exclusions. However, since the record demonstrates the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d exclusion completely excludes coverage for the claims asserted in the Hercules Complaint, we shall not specifically address the remaining three exclusions, which are set forth in the Appendix. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Section I, Part 2 contains the exclusions from coverage under the commercial general liability policy and provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201c2. Exclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">U # \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">\u201c1. \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018your product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard\u2019. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Section V of the policy defines \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">\u201c11.a. \u2018Products-completed operations hazard\u2019 includes all \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201c(1) Products that are still in your physical possession; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">\u201c(2) Work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The court in <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Liberty Solvents &amp; Chemicals Co. </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 127, 17 OBR 225, 477 N.E.2d 1227, explained the effect of a similar products hazard insurance policy exclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\"><em>\u201cThe effect of a product hazard exclusion in a policy of liability insurance is to relieve the insurer of the duty to defend and indemnify its insureds in actions charging strict liability, negligence and breach of warranty. </em>Thus in accordance with established principles of products liability, there must be a defective condition in the product itself which proximately causes the damage before the product hazard exclusion will preclude coverage. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">\u201cThis defective condition may be a design defect in the product; a manufacturing defect in the product; or in the case of an inherently dangerous or unavoidably unsafe product, a failure to provide adequate warnings. [Citations omitted.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 135, 17 OBR at 234, 477 N.E.2d at 1236.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As noted above, the Hercules Complaint arose out of defective water pump component parts sold by Royal to Hercules and was based on claims of negligence, breach of contract and failure to conform to express and implied warranties. Since the Hercules Complaint did not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d to trigger coverage under the general commercial liability insurance policy and the policy issued by State Auto to Royal expressly excluded coverage for such claims alleged by Hercules in its complaint, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment for State Auto. <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd., supra; Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. Liberty Solvents &amp; Chemicals Co., supra. </em>It, therefore, follows the trial court did not err by concluding State Auto had neither a duty to defend nor indemnify Royal in the Hercules Litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Accordingly, Royal\u2019s three assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-11\">Dyke and Weaver, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">\n<em>Appendix</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">Section I, Subpart 2 of the policy contains the following three additional \u201cwork performed,\u201d \u201cimpaired property\u201d and \u201csistership\u201d exclusions from insurance coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">\u201ck. \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018your product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-16\"><em>It </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cm. \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018impaired property\u2019 or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201c(1) A defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201c(2) A delay or failure by you or anyone acting on your behalf to perform a contract or agreement in accordance with its terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cThis exclusion does not apply to the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical injury to \u2018your product\u2019 or \u2018your work\u2019 after it has been put to its intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201cn.
