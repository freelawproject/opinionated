Abele, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">This is an appeal from a judgment entered by the Pike County Common Pleas Court in favor of Mark E. Williams, plaintiff below and appellee herein, and against Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc., defendant below and appellant herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Appellant assigns the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that Williams\u2019 injury occurred in the course of and arising out of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">For the past several years, appellant has participated in Red Cross blood drives for its employees. The blood drives are conducted one to three times per year on the plant premises. Appellant did not reduce an employee\u2019s wages for the time spent donating blood if the employee gave blood during normal work hours. Appellant\u2019s public relations department advertises the drives, registers employees, prepares schedules of donors, and submits the schedules to the Red Cross. Appellant\u2019s employees assist the Red Cross staff during each drive by preparing the room and serving refreshments provided by appellant. Appellant\u2019s medical staff is on alert throughout the day of each drive in order to treat any medical complications that develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">On January 3, 1990, the Red Cross held a blood drive at the plant. Appellee, an employee of appellant, attended this drive. When a Red Cross staff member attempted to draw blood from appellee\u2019s arm, he suffered an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">On June 16, 1993, appellant and appellee filed a joint stipulation of facts which provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-14\">\u201c1.

Martin Marietta permitted any of its employees to participate in the Red Cross blood drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201c6. If a Martin Marietta employee contributed to the American Red Cross blood drive during normal working hours, there was no reduction in wages for the time that the employee participated in the activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\"><em>\u201c7. </em>Martin Marietta has an on-premises transportation system available for use by its employees which may be utilized by employees traveling to the blood donation site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201c8. Martin Marietta\u2019s Public Relations Department coordinated with the American Red Cross the dates and times which the Red Cross would conduct the blood drive on Martin Marietta premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c9. Pre-registration for the blood drive was coordinated by Martin Marietta\u2019s Public Relations staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201c10.

Martin Marietta Public Relations Department produced and posted flyers announcing the on premises Red Cross blood drive up to six weeks in advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201c12. Martin Marietta\u2019s Public Relations staff also distributed to Martin Marietta employees pamphlets and other announcements received from the Red Cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">\u201c13. Subsequent to the 1992 strike, Martin Marietta\u2019s Public Relations office issued a press release and photos to local newspapers regarding the Red Cross blood drive for the purpose of showing camaraderie between Martin Marietta and its employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-14\">\u201c14.

For any Red Cross blood drive on its premises, the Public Relations department will contact the Martin Marietta medical staff, either by letter or telephone, to ensure that the medical staff will be available if needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201c19. As part of its course of conduct in preparing for the Red Cross blood drive, the attached documents (Exhibits A-Y) were issued and/or disseminated by Martin Marietta personnel. Such documents are intended to be used as evidence in the disposition of this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The Exhibits A through Y attached to the stipulations of fact included internal correspondence from appellant to its employees concerning the blood drive. Exhibit A asked certain employees to \u201cwalk around your division\u201d and ask people if they have already signed up for the blood drive or ask \u201cif you can give them a form to sign up.\u201d Exhibit B told employees that the blood drive is very important and \u201cnot only does it provide free blood replacement for our employees and their immediate families,\u201d but it also helps others and \u201cproduces quality public relations.\u201d Exhibit D told \u201cbloodmobile team representatives\u201d that \u201cthe pressure is on to exceed our last blood drive total of 187 units\u201d and \u201cplease walk around your division and ask people if they have already signed up.\u201d Exhibit D told the representative employees that \u201ca gentle \u2018push\u2019 is needed, if we are to be successful.\u201d Exhibit M listed nearly one thousand employees of appellant\u2019s employees and indicated the number of blood units each employee has donated and the blood type of many of the employees on the list. Other exhibits documented the fact that appellant provided many services and other items to aid the Red Cross blood drive, including lunches, refreshments, loading and unloading services, janitorial services, typewriters, a telephone, backup medical services, and security services.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">After being injured at the January 3,1990 Red Cross blood drive on appellant\u2019s premises, appellee filed a claim with the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 12, 1992, the district hearing officer rejected appellee\u2019s claim. Appellee filed a notice of appeal from the district hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">On January 21, 1992, the Columbus Regional Board of Review disagreed with the district officer\u2019s decision and allowed appellee\u2019s claim. Appellant filed a notice of appeal from the board of review\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In a decision dated July 22, 1992, and mailed August 5, 1992, the Industrial Commission of Ohio found that appellee sustained injury in the course of and arising out of employment. On September 30, 1992, appellant filed a notice of appeal from the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision to the trial court in the instant case. On December 10, 1992, appellee filed a complaint in the instant case seeking a judgment holding that he is entitled to participate in the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On September 24, 1993, the trial court entered judgment ordering appellee\u2019s participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. The court found by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee\u2019s injuries occurred in the course of and arose out of his employment with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In its sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that because the Red Cross conducted the blood drive and because a Red Cross staff member injured appellee\u2019s arm while attempting to draw blood, appellee did not receive the injury in the course of and arising out of his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee counters that because the Red Cross held the blood drive on appellant\u2019s premises with appellant\u2019s cooperation and organizing assistance, and because appellant benefited from the positive publicity of the blood drive, appellee did receive the injury to his arm in the course of and arising out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In order for an injured employee to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the injury must have been \u201creceived in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). Traditionally, courts have bifurcated the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and the \u201carising out of\u2019 elements, but in <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274, the Ohio Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cWe now expressly recognize the conjunctive nature of the coverage formula of \u2018in the course of and arising out of the employment. Therefore, all elements of the formula must be met before compensation will be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">\u201c * * * The \u2018in the course of prong is construed to relate to the time, place and circumstances of the injury, while the \u2018arising out of prong is interpreted as referring to a causal connection between the employment and the injury. [1] Larson, [The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1984) ] at 3-3, Section 6.10. See, also, <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982), 133 Cal. App.3d 643, 652, 184 CaLRptr. 111, 116.\u201d See, also, <em>Elsass v. Commercial Carriers, Inc. </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 112, 596 N.E.2d 599; <em>Moffitt v. Ohio Bur. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1991), 78 Ohio App.3d 48, 603 N.E.2d 1110; <em>Fletcher v. Northwest Mechanical Contr., Inc. </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 466, 599 N.E.2d 822.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"> Generally, an employee acts in the course of employment while performing obligations of the employment contract. Fulton, Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1991) 148, Section 7.6, citing <em>Indus. Comm. v. Davison </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 180, 160 N.E. 693. However, \u201c[a]n injured employee need not be in the actual performance of his duties in order for his injury to be in the \u2018course of employment,\u2019 and thus compensable.\u201d <em>Kohlmayer v. Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 10, 11, 53 O.O.2d 6, 6, 263 N.E.2d 231, 232. An employee is within the course of his employment \u201cwhen he \u2018does such things as are usually and reasonably incidental to the work of the employer, including the taking of refreshments, rest and smoke, which are not forbidden by the employer * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lemming v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 194, 196, 534 N.E.2d 1226, 1228, quoting <em>Taylor v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1920), 13 Ohio App. 262, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In <em>Fisher, </em>the court not only recognized the conjunctive nature of the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and the \u201carising out of\u2019 prongs, but also restated the three-part test for determining whether a given injury \u201carose out of\u2019 the injured person\u2019s employment of <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E .2d 96. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201c * * * In <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96, we held at the syllabus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u201c \u2018Whether there is a sufficient \u201ccausal connection\u201d between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment to justify the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment; (2) <em>the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, </em>and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In <em>Fisher, </em>the court discussed, <em>inter alia, </em>the second <em>Lord </em>factor, which involves an examination of the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident. The court specified that courts must examine the employer\u2019s degree of control over the situs of the accident, not the employer\u2019s degree of control over the employee at the time of the accident. The court -wrote in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\u201cThe second factor involves the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident. Appellees argue that the school board had no control over the voluntary actions of appellant in going to Kaiser Elementary School. However, the appellees misconstrue the analysis. The proper scrutiny entails the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>amount of control the employer had over the situs of the injury, and not the degree of control the employer had regarding the actions of its employees. </em>* * * Clearly, it cannot be denied that the school board had complete control over the steps leading to and from one of its own schools, hence appellant has also satisfied the second factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 279, 551 N.E.2d at 1275.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In <em>Tamarkin Co. v. Wheeler </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 232, 610 N.E.2d 1042, the Ninth District likewise quoted and followed the <em>Lord </em>three-part test for determining whether a given injury \u201carose out of\u2019 the injured person\u2019s employment. In that case, Wheeler lacerated his right hand when inspecting or attempting to repair vandalism damage that had occurred to his Jeep in the employer's parking lot earlier in Wheeler\u2019s shift. When considering the second prong of three-part <em>Lord </em>test, the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, the Ninth District wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cTurning to the second prong, it is readily apparent that Tamarkin\u2019s degree of control over the accident was minimal. We are at a loss to understand what the employer could have reasonably done to prevent Wheeler from cutting himself during the impromptu repair job. * * * \u201d <em>Id., </em>81 Ohio App.3d at 235, 610 N.E.2d at 1044.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In conclusion, the Ninth District stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u201cAny relationship between Wheeler\u2019s injury and Tamarkin was purely fortuitous. Cutting one\u2019s hand on a broken rearview mirror is not a risk incident to the duties of a baker\u2019s apprentice. * * * The combined facts that (1) the vandal chose the Giant Eagle parking lot as the scene of the crime, and (2) Wheeler decided to attempt the hazardous repair during his working hours, are not sufficient to justify participation in the Workers\u2019] Compensation Fund.\u201d <em>Id., </em>81 Ohio App.3d at 236, 610 N.E.2d at 1044. See, also, <em>Lemming v. Univ. of Cincinnati </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 194, 534 N.E.2d 1226, where the First District hinged its decision in major part on the fact that the device which injured the employee during her morning break was under the employer\u2019s control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant asserts that it lacked control over the Red Cross employees and their attempted drawing of blood from appellee\u2019s arm. We agree. Although appellant provided the Red Cross with comprehensive cooperation and organizing assistance for the blood drive, appellant had no control over the attempted drawing of blood from appellee\u2019s arm. The record contains no evidence to the contrary. Hence, we find the injury to appellee\u2019s arm did not arise out of appellee\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We also find that the injury to appellee\u2019s arm did not occur during the course of appellee\u2019s employment. We agree with appellant that the blood drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>was not a usual and reasonable incidental activity to appellee\u2019s employment. Despite the evidence that appellee\u2019s supervisors told him \u201cit would be a good idea\u201d to donate blood, the record does not reveal any evidence that donating blood was a 'regular incident and condition of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1992) 5-418 to 5-419, Section 27.34(a), Larson wrote that nonemergency civic acts conducted on an employer\u2019s premises are not within the course of employment:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u201cApart from the emergency doctrine, which is dealt with in the next section, acts that are nothing more than the discharge of a person\u2019s duties as a good citizen or member of the community are not within the course of employment, even if they take place on the employment premises and may have been requested by the employer. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Larson- cited <em>Mauser v. Douglas &amp; Lomason Co. </em>(1974), 192 Neb. 421, 222 N.W.2d 119, where the employer permitted employees to donate blood to the Red Cross on company time. When denying the petition for benefits, the <em>Mauser </em>court noted that the employer had no control over the blood-donation activity. Larson also cited <em>Riggen v. Paris Printing Co. </em>(Mo.App.1977), 559 S.W.2d 625, where the employee suffered injury while on her way to a charity breakfast after she began working one day. The employer had given the employee a free ticket to the breakfast. The court denied compensation, noting that the breakfast was insufficiently related to the employment and noting that the employer did not compel the employee to go to the breakfast.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The year after Larson wrote the above article, an Oklahoma appellate court decided <em>Wright v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(Okla.App.1993), 848 P.2d 61, against an employee who sustained injury while giving blood at a Red Cross blood drive held during working hours on her employer\u2019s premises. The Oklahoma court wrote in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cThe Oklahoma appellate courts have not addressed the precise issue of an employer\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation for injury occurring in civic activities. However, they have addressed analogous situations in the context of recreational or social activities. * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201c \u2018Recreational and social activities are within the course of one\u2019s employment: (1) when they occur on the premises during a lunch or recreation period as a regular incident to the employment; or (2) when the employer <em>expressly or impliedly </em>induces participation, or makes the activity come within the orbit of employment duties; or (3) when the employer derives from the activity substantial direct benefit that extends beyond the intangible value of employees\u2019 health or moral improvement which is common to every kind or recreational social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>event.\u2019 [ (Emphasis <em>sic.) Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Williams </em>(Okla.1981), 639 P.2d 1222, 1223.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201cAn application of the [above] factors to the case at bar demonstrates that Claimant has failed to show that the activity of giving blood is within the course of her employment. With respect to factor one, it is clear that the alleged injury occurred on the premises during a \u2018civic\u2019 period carved out by the Employer. However, the record fails to establish that this activity (blood drive) occurred as a regular incident of employment. There is no testimony that establishes a causal connection between the act of giving blood and the requirements of employment at General Motors. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cThe second factor * * * deals with \u2018compulsory attendance.\u2019 One who is expressly required to participate is clearly furthering the master\u2019s business. <em>Williams, </em>639 P.2d at 1224. Employer made no direct order to Claimant to give blood. Moreover, Claimant failed to prove any managerial behavior pattern from which to imply compulsory participation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cFinally, Claimant failed to show that Employer derived a substantial direct benefit from the blood drive. * * * There must be a substantial direct benefit that extends beyond the intangible and speculative value of enhancing company goodwill. * * * \u201d 848 P.2d at 62-63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The <em>Wright </em>court quoted and followed the Nebraska Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mauser </em>decision where the court held that the employer \u201c \u2018received no benefit from the plaintiffs participation in the program except that which might flow from its willingness to cooperate with the program by offering employees time off with no loss of pay.\u2019 \u201d 848 P.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we similarly find that appellant received no benefit from appellee\u2019s participation in the blood drive except that which might flow from appellant\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the blood drive by permitting employees to donate blood without a loss of pay. Appellee did not present evidence that he was required to participate in the blood drive in order to maintain his position with appellant or to advance within the company. In his deposition, John E. Christian, one of appellant\u2019s public affairs employees, stated that the management does not coerce employees to participate and that the extent of management\u2019s encouragement of participation is to publicize the drive and \u201cnot [to] discourage it.\u201d In addition, Christian stated that out of 2,700 total employees, only one hundred eighty to two hundred twenty participate in any given blood drive. This less-than-ten-percent employee participation further emphasizes the fact that appellant did not consider the blood drive to be a regular incident and condition of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">In summary, we agree in general that acts that are nothing more than the discharge of a person\u2019s duties as good citizen or member of the community are</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>not within the course of employment, even if they take place on the employment premises and may have been requested by the employer.
