Nationwide was named as a defendant and the trial court was also asked to determine the rights and obligations of Nationwide with respect to the accident involving Daniel Fish.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The underlying facts and procedural history of the case are as follows. On March 21, 1991, Daniel Fish, then age fourteen, resided within the geographic boundaries of the West Carrollton City School District Board of Education (\u201cthe Board\u201d). Beginning on March 4, 1991, Daniel was placed in Youth Partial Hospitalization (\u201cYPH\u201d) pursuant to an Individualized Education Program. Daniel was referred to YPH because of a severe behavioral handicap. Daniel was transported to YPH by a Regional Transit Authority (\u201cRTA\u201d) bus. RTA bus tokens were purchased by West Carrollton and provided to Daniel\u2019s parents so that Daniel could obtain transportation to YPH. On March 21, 1991, Daniel was struck by an uninsured motorist as he exited an RTA bus on his way hom\u00e9 from YPH. On the date of the accident Westfield had in effect a policy of insurance with Daniel\u2019s father, Kenneth Fish. Daniel is an insured under the Westfield policy because he is a family member. The policy provides underinsured motorist bodily injury limits of $100,000 each accident. The policy further provides that \u201cany insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On the date of the accident Nationwide had in effect a policy of insurance with West Carrollton. The policy provides, in its coverage form, automobile liability limits of $1,000,000 only for \u201cspecifically described autos.\u201d The policy further provides that \u201cfor any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this coverage form is excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">On June 2, 1992, Westfield filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. Westfield sought a determination \u2022 of its rights and responsibilities with respect to the claims of Daniel. Nationwide answered and denied any responsibility for coverage of Daniel\u2019s potential claims arising from the auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Following discovery, both parties filed motions for summary judgment on February 24, 1993. The trial court issued its entry and final judgment on March 15, 1993. The trial court granted Westfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of Nationwide\u2019s obligation to provide coverage and accordingly denied Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment. However, the trial court overruled Westfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the extent that the motion sought to impose primary coverage upon Nationwide based upon the language of Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Nationwide filed its notice of appeal on April 14, 1993 and Westfield filed its notice of cross-appeal on April 23, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Nationwide advances the following assignments of error: \u201c(1) the trial court erred in deciding that an insured policyholder\u2019s express selection of certain vehicles for uninsured motorists coverage was not an express rejection of coverage for other vehicles; (2) the trial court erred in finding that a Regional Transit Authority bus was hired by the insured policyholder of the defendant-appellant through the purchase of tokens; (3) the trial court erred holding that the defendant-appellant\u2019s policy provides coverage for the alleged hiring of an RTA bus; and (4) the trial court erred in deciding that each party owes a pro rata share of the total loss where the defendant-appellant\u2019s policy provides excess coverage only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Westfield advances one assignment of error in its cross-appeal: \u201c(1) the trial court erred when it found that Westfield was obligated to provide coverage for the claims of Daniel Fish on a pro rata basis with Nationwide. Instead, the language of the Nationwide Policy imposes upon Nationwide the primary obligation to provide coverage for the claims of Daniel Fish. The language of the Westfield Policy imposes upon Westfield only the obligation of excess coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In its first assignment, Nationwide contends that the trial court erred by not determining that West Carrollton\u2019s selection of certain autos for uninsured motorist coverage constituted an express rejection of uninsured motorist coverage for hired and/or nonowned autos covered under its fleet insurance policy. Westfield, on the other hand, argues that West Carrollton never expressly rejected uninsured motorist coverage under its fleet insurance policy and, thus, uninsured motorist coverage is effective as a matter of law. Ohio requires automobile liability policies issued in Ohio to contain an uninsured motorist provision. R.C. 3937.18. Such provision can be eliminated \u201conly by the express rejection of that provision by the insured.\u201d <em>Abate v. Pioneer Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 161, 51 O.O.2d 229, 258 N.E.2d 429, at paragraph two of the syllabus. The express rejection rule applies to both personal and commercial policies of automobile insurance. <em>Atwood v. Internatl. Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 10, 1991), 1991 WL 268346, 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 6030, Franklin App. No. 91AP-521, unreported. Without an express rejection of uninsured motorist coverage by the insured, \u201ccoverage afforded by the \u2018uninsured motorist\u2019 provision is provided to the insured by operation of law.\u201d <em>Abate, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Nationwide argues that \u201cchoosing certain vehicles for coverage in writing and not choosing other vehicles for coverage is an \u2018express rejection\u2019 under R.C. 3937.18(C).\u201d We disagree. We think Westfield is correct that express acceptance of such coverage for certain vehicles is not relevant to the issue. A listing of certain vehicles for uninsured motorist coverage is merely an acceptance of uninsured motorist coverage for those particular vehicles, not an express rejection of such coverage for any other type of vehicle covered under West Carroll-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ton\u2019s fleet insurance policy. Instead, we believe Nationwide has the burden to show an express rejection of uninsured motorist coverage for any auto for which coverage was offered or described in the language of both the application and policy. See R.C. 3937.18(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The trial court specifically found that West Carrollton never expressly rejected uninsured motorist coverage for any auto covered under the fleet policy. In our careful review of the record we have found nothing to indicate otherwise. Thus, we agree with the trial court that no genuine issue fact exists as to whether there was an express rejection of uninsured motorist coverage by West Carroll-ton, and that such coverage is therefore provided by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Accordingly, Nationwide\u2019s first assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In its second assignment of error, Nationwide argues that the trial court erred when it found that the RTA bus in which Daniel was riding was \u201chired\u201d by West Carrollton through the purchase of bus tokens.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The trial court found that the term \u201chired auto\u201d contained in Nationwide\u2019s policy was unambiguous with respect to its application to the RTA bus. The court further found that even if the term was ambiguous, such ambiguity must be construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage. We believe the trial court was correct in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The Nationwide policy states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201cA. Description of Covered Auto Designation Symbols</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">\u201c1 = Any \u2018Auto.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201c8 = Hired \u2018Autos\u2019 Only. Only those \u2018autos\u2019 you lease, hire, rent, or borrow. This does not include any \u2018open auto\u2019 you lease, hire, rent or borrow from any of your employees or partners or members of their households.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Words and phrases used in an insurance policy must be given their natural and commonly accepted meaning. <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167-168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 275-276, 436 N.E.2d 1347, 1347-1348. The word \u201chire\u201d generally means \u201cto get the services of a person or the use of a thing in return for payment.\u201d Webster\u2019s World Dictionary (1986) 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">In the present case, West Carrollton engaged the services of RTA to transport Daniel to YPH through the issuance of purchase orders for RTA bus tokens which were given directly to Daniel\u2019s mother for Daniel\u2019s use. Accordingly, since West Carrollton obtained the use of the RTA bus for Daniel in return for payment, we agree that no genuine issue of fact remains as to whether Daniel occupied an auto \u201chired\u201d by the insured, West Carrollton.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Accordingly, 'Nationwide\u2019s second assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In its third assignment of error, Nationwide contends that even if the RTA bus was a \u201chired auto\u201d within the meaning of the policy language, the trial court erred in finding that Nationwide\u2019s policy provides coverage for the hiring of an RTA bus. Nationwide states that a determination of whether Daniel is an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Nationwide policy because he had been \u201coccupying\u201d an \u201cauto\u201d \u201chired\u201d by West Carrollton must necessarily derive from a finding that the purchase of the RTA bus tokens constituted a \u201ccontractual hiring\u201d of the bus rather than a mere reimbursement. Nationwide further argues that coverage under the policy would extend to Daniel only if the agreement between West Carrollton and the RTA was within the scope of the definition of \u201cinsured contract\u201d in the Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The language Nationwide refers to provides that an \u201cinsured contract\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201c * * * does not include that part of any contract or agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cb. That pertains to the loan, lease or rental of an \u2018auto\u2019 to you or any of your employees, if the \u2018auto\u2019 is loaned, leased or rented with a driver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">We think that the record amply supports the conclusion that coverage was available under the Nationwide policy if a contract existed between RTA and West Carrollton for Daniel\u2019s transportation and if West Carrollton paid for the transportation. Westfield argues that West Carrollton had a written contract with RTA to provide transportation for Daniel and other children through the purchase orders for the bulk purchase of bus tokens.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The purchase orders represented West Carrollton\u2019s agreement to purchase bus tokens from RTA for Daniel\u2019s transportation and West Carrollton in fact paid for the tokens. West Carrollton made the tokens available to Daniel specifically to fulfill its statutory obligation to provide him with transportation to YPH. R.C. 3323.01. We think that this is more than sufficient to support a finding that West Carrollton\u2019s purchase of the bus tokens constitutes a \u201ccontractual hiring\u201d and not a mere reimbursement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Nationwide argues that even if such an agreement existed between West Carrollton and the RTA, such agreement does not fall within the definition of an \u201cinsured contract\u201d since such definition does not include the hiring, rental or lease of a vehicle which is supplied with a driver. Westfield counters that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>language of the Nationwide policy\u2019s \u201cinsured contract\u201d section does not specifically and expressly exclude \u201chired\u201d autos which are supplied with a driver, but only expressly excludes those autos which are \u201cloaned, leased or rented with a driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">West Carrollton clearly did not \u201clease or rent\u201d the RTA bus to transport Daniel. Neither was the RTA bus \u201cloaned\u201d or borrowed. As we have already determined, the RTA bus was \u201chired\u201d by West Carrollton. Either purposely or by oversight, Nationwide did not choose to exclude \u201chired\u201d autos from the definition of \u201cinsured contract\u201d even though it must have realized that such vehicles were included in the descriptions of hired and/or nonowned autos in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The terms of a policy of insurance must be strictly construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage. See <em>Edmondson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 52, 2 O.O.3d 167, 356 N.E.2d 722. We conclude that Westfield is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that Nationwide\u2019s policy does cover the contractual hiring of an RTA bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Accordingly, Nationwide\u2019s third assignment is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Nationwide\u2019s final assignment of error presents the same issue as West-field\u2019s cross-appeal. Therefore, we will consider them together. Both Westfield and Nationwide argue that the trial court erred in deciding that each insurance company owes a pro rata share of Daniel\u2019s total loss where each insurance company\u2019s policy provides for excess coverage only.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The trial court found that both policies provide that they are excess over other coverage when the injury does not arise from the insured\u2019s own vehicle. Hence, the trial court concluded, because Daniel\u2019s injury did not arise from the insured\u2019s own vehicle, each insurance company owes a pro rata share of the total loss, not exceeding the higher policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u25a0 Westfield contends that the trial court failed to recognize an ambiguity present in the Nationwide excess clause which renders that clause inoperative. The Nationwide policy provides that its coverage is excess for \u201cany covered \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s policy defines nonowned vehicles as \u201conly those \u2018autos\u2019 you do not own, lease, hire, rent or borrow that are used in connection with your business.\u201d Westfield would have us interpret this clause to apply only to vehicles not owned, not leased, not hired or not borrowed by West Carrollton. Accordingly, Westfield contends, since West Carrollton \u201chired\u201d the RTA bus, such bus should be considered an \u201cowned\u201d vehicle which would be covered by the primary coverage of the Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Even in the face of the inartful drafting of Nationwide, we decline to give such an obviously absurd interpretation to the policy language. We recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>nize the general rule that ambiguities in insurance contracts must be construed strictly against the insurer. See <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380. We conclude, however, that the Nationwide policy language must be read so as to give it its obvious and intended meaning. We think it is clear that the intended definition of \u201cnonowned\u201d autos is only those autos which are not owned, and those autos which are leased, hired or borrowed by West Carrollton. This is the only interpretation which does not render the meaning of the policy language completely ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The only issue that remains is to determine how to resolve the conflicting \u201cexcess\u201d coverage clauses in both insurance policies. In spite of the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court was correct in observing that both policies appear to cancel each other out with respect to nonowned vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Westfield\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d provision is a \u201cpro rata\u201d excess provision in all respects except as to nonowned vehicles where it expressly states the policy is \u201cexcess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d provision is \u201cexcess\u201d in all respects, including with respect to nonowned vehicles. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in apportioning to both Westfield and Nationwide a pro rata share of the total loss, not exceeding the higher policy limit. See <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 213, 3 O.O.3d 330, 361 N.E.2d 1052 (liability will be prorated according to the respective policy amounts where there are conflicting excess coverage clauses), and <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Buckeye Union Cas. Co. </em>(C.P.1957), 75 Ohio Law Abs. 79, 91, 143 N.E.2d 169, 179-180 (since there can be primary insurance of the risk where there are conflicting excess clauses, the excess clauses a fortiori cannot be a valid means of establishing only secondary liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Accordingly, both Nationwide\u2019s final assignment and Westfield\u2019s sole assignment are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-10\">Wolff and Frederick N. Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">. We think reimbursement within the meaning of R.C. 3327.01 contemplates the school board paying money to a parent to purchase some type of transportation for the child. As the statute expressly states, this payment is \"in lieu of providing such transportation.\u201d Here, West Carrollton took it upon itself to provide bus tokens to Daniel\u2019s mother for his transportation to YPH. Accordingly, West Carrollton was responsible for \u201cproviding\u201d the transportation to Daniel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
