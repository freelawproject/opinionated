Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Defendant-appellant, Northern Assurance Company of America, appeals a decision by the Butler County Court of Common Pleas requiring it to indemnify plaintiff-appellee, Armco, Inc., for payments made by Armco into the Disabled Workers\u2019 Relief Fund (\u201cDWRF\u201d). In its January 10, 1994 decision, the trial court found that appellant was required to indemnify Armco under an insurance policy it had issued to Armco. The insurance policy in question provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cI. Application of Policy. This policy applies to loss sustained by the insured [Armco] on account of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cA. compensation <em>and other benefits </em>required of the insured [Armco] by the workmen\u2019s compensation law * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">a * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cas a result of injury (1) by accident occurring during the policy period * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\"><em>(( </em>* <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">\u201c(f) Loss. The word \u2018loss\u2019 shall mean only such amounts as are actually paid in cash by the insured [Armco] in payment of benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation law, in settlement of claims or in satisfaction of awards or judgment; but the word \u2018loss\u2019 shall not mean claim expenses, salaries paid to employees of the insured, nor [sic] annual retainers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">In its sole assignment of error, appellant argues that it is not liable to indemnify Armco for DWRF payments. Appellant argues that the policy requires it only to indemnify Armco for payments made as workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Appellant claims that \u201cDWRF payments\u201d have been defined by the Supreme Court of Ohio as relief welfare, not workers\u2019 compensation. Appellant relies on <em>Thompson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 244, 1 OBR 265, 438 N.E.2d 1167, for its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution authorizes the creation of the State Insurance Fund (\u201cSIF\u201d) with compulsory employer contributions for the purpose of providing workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DWRF was created as a subsidy for permanently and totally disabled workers because of inflation\u2019s effect on prior workers\u2019 compensation benefits. When DWRF was originally created in 1953, it was a separate and distinct fund from SIF. In 1975, the General Assembly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>allowed investment income from SIF to be transferred to DWRF. This created a constitutional dilemma faced by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Thompson, supra. </em>The legislature again modified the funding scheme in 1986 by making self-insured employers like Armco liable to the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for all past, present, and future DWRF payments made to qualified recipients on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The constitutionality of this new funding scheme was upheld in <em>Wean, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 266, 557 N.E.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">It was argued in <em>Thompson </em>that if DWRF payments were found not to be compensation, then DWRF violated Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because funds from SIF were being used for purposes other than workers\u2019 compensation. However, if DWRF payments were found to be compensation, then the legislature had retroactively increased the workers\u2019 compensation benefits in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The Supreme Court first held that transferring funds from SIF to DWRF was consistent with Section 35, Article II because \u201cDWRF is a supplement to the workers\u2019 compensation program, hence its location in [R.C.] Chapter 4123.\u201d <em>Thompson, supra, </em>1 Ohio St.3d at 246, 1 OBR at 267, 438 N.E.2d at 1169. Although it found that DWRF is so closely related to workers\u2019 compensation that funds can be indiscriminately transferred from SIF to DWRF, the Supreme Court then held that DWRF payments are not retroactive increases in workers\u2019 compensation because the \u201cframers of the DWRF statutes were keenly aware of the potential retroactivity problem and established the DWRF as a separate relief fund so as to avoid any collision with Section 28, Article II.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>1 Ohio St.3d at 251, 1 OBR at 271, 438 N.E.2d at 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Thus, DWRF payments are relief payments, not workers\u2019 compensation, even though the DWRF payments serve to meet \u201cthe purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment.\u201d Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution. It seems that this fiction was created by the court out of a fear that a ruling declaring the DWRF program unconstitutional would make \u201ca cruel mockery of the laudable purpose [of the constitutional provision allowing for a workers\u2019 compensation program].\u201d <em>Id., </em>1 Ohio St.3d at 249, 1 OBR at 269, 438 N.E.2d at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Obvious difficulties remain with this analysis. The Supreme Court\u2019s distinction between DWRF payments and workers\u2019 compensation payments is at best elusive. Certainly, from the point of view of a permanently and totally disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>worker there is no distinction whatsoever: he is simply receiving more money for his work-related disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In this case, language can be found in <em>Thompson </em>supporting both parties\u2019 arguments. However, we believe that, while Armco\u2019s DWRF payments are not workers\u2019 compensation, they are <em>\u201cother benefits </em>required of the insured [Armco] by the workmen\u2019s compensation law\u201d within the meaning of appellant\u2019s policy because DWRF was created by the legislature pursuant to Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and because the statute sections dealing with DWRF are integrated into the Revised Code chapter on workers\u2019 compensation. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-6\">Jones, P.J., and Kerns, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b580-7\">Joseph D.
