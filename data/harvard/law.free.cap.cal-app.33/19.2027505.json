By another provision it was agreed that the lessees \u201cwill pay to the lessor as a further consideration for this lease in addition to the rent hereinabove reserved the sum of seventy-two hundred dollars, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the lessor\u201d; and \u201cthat if the lessees shall pay the rent herein reserved when the same becomes due hereunder, and shall well and truly perform and observe all the covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be performed and observed, during the first nine years, seven months and twelve days of this lease, and this lease shall not be terminated by the re-entry of the lessor as hereinafter provided within said period of nine years, seven months and twelve days, he will credit the sum of seventy-two hundred dollars hereinafter provided to be paid to him by the lessees upon the last four months and eighteen days\u2019 rent under this lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">While appellants admit that they occupied the premises during the month of January and up to February 10th, the rent for which period under the terms of the lease was two thousand dollars, they insist their obligation to. pay the same was fully adjudicated in the action for unlawful detainer, wherein judgment was rendered for one thousand five hundred dollars, which judgment they claim constituted a bar to the maintenance of this action. At the trial it was in substance stipulated that in the unlawful detainer action no claim was made for any damages, nor for rent, other than one thousand five hundred dollars due for the month of December, for which and the restitution of the premises judgment was rendered, but not executed as to restitution until February 10th. The action did not involve the rent for the period extending from January 1st to February 10th, nor was there any judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>therefor rendered. Moreover, this judgment was not final, for the reason that an appeal was perfected therefrom, and hence, there being no final determination of the question as to plaintiff\u2019s right to forfeit the lease, the question was left as though it had never been tried, even though no stay was directed by the court as provided in section 1176 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Hence, so long as defendants continued to occupy the premises, pending the final determination of the action for unlawful detainer, the lease constituted the measure of their liability for such time as they remained in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Appellants\u2019 chief ground for a reversal, and upon which they devote much of their argument, is based upon the provision of the lease pursuant to which they paid plaintiff seven thousand two hundred dollars, claim to which is asserted in both the answer and cross-complaint. Notwithstanding the plain language in which the provision is couched, the meaning of which, to our minds, admits of no controversy, they insist that it should be construed as security for the payment of the rent reserved during the time ending with their eviction and any damages sustained by plaintiff; that when the landlord elected to evict defendants from the premises for nonpayment of rent he waived all claim to the seven thousand two hundred dollars, except in so far as it was necessary to apply it in payment of rent then due or accrued. As stated in <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>63 Wash. 373, [115 Pac. 857], where a similar question was involved: \u201cWe cannot agree with this contention without in effect writing a new contract for the parties.\u201d Clearly, the seven thousand two hundred dollars was paid for a ten-year lease of the premises, upon the conditions and terms specified therein. Defendants parted with the money, not as a penalty or as security, but as a payment the consideration for which was the execution of the lease on the part of plaintiff. The title thereto passed absolutely to the lessor, unaffected by the fact that he agreed, upon the performance of certain conditions by defendants, to give them credit therefor. The conditions were never performed by defendants, and hence they could have no claim to the fund. The authorities which appellants cite in support of their contention all appear to have been cases where the deposit was made with the lessor upon the execution of the lease as security for the payment of the rent, and in such cases, upon the lessor evicting the tenants, it is uniformly held that he cannot assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>claim to the amount so deposited, over and above rent due, with damages sustained. The cases cited by appellants involve deposits made as \u201ca guaranty,\u201d \u201cas indemnity,\u201d as \u201ca penalty,\u201d \u201cfor security,\u201d etc., and hence are readily distinguished from the case at bar. This view finds full support in the case of <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Christie, </em>63 Wash. 373, [115 Pac. 857].</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The provisions of the lease in question hereinbefore quoted should be interpreted in accordance with the plain import of the language used, and thus construed it is clear that the parties intended the seven thousand two hundred dollars to be in the nature of a bonus or additional consideration paid the lessor as an inducement to make the lease upon the terms and conditions therein contained; and, as stated, the fact that upon the performance of all the covenants and agreements contained in the lease to be performed by the lessees during the first nine years, seven months, and twelve days of the term thereof, he promised in effect to release them from the payment of rent at the rate of one thousand five hundred dollars per month for the last four months and eighteen days of the term so demised, furnishes no reason for appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on April 12, 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
