J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2bb\">The action originally was in partition and involved numerous different lots of land owned by many different persons. Bespondent, Ng Hon Kim, filed a complaint in intervention in the nature of an action to quiet title, alleging ownership in fee of certain three of the lots situated in the city of Bakersfield, Kern County. Intervener had judgment in his favor from which plaintiff and defendants appealed to the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">The judgment and order denying motion for a new trial in favor of intervener were reversed. (157 Cal. 289, [107 Pac. 113].) The complaint described the property as lots 1, 2, and 3, block 132, in the Baker Homestead Tract, according to the map of said tract filed in the office of the county recorder of Kern County, state of California, on the third day of April, 1889. Intervener claimed title under delinquent tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>sales. The complaint in intervention described the property as \u201cLots one, two, and three in block one hundred and thirty-two situate in the city of Bakersfield, county of Kern, state of California, \u2019 \u2019 but made no reference to any map. We quote from the opinion: \u201cNo map showing the location of any lots or blocks was introduced in evidence. Under the decisions of this court there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the assessment is <em>prima facie </em>invalid.\u201d The assessment-book was offered in evidence and, under the heading \u201cDescription of Property,\u201d showed entries as follows: \u201cIn the town of Bakersfield, lot 1, 2, 3,\u201d and under the heading \u201cBlock\u201d the figures \u2018 \u2018 132, \u2019 \u2019 appeared. The theory upon which the decision proceeded was \u201cthat a description of this kind is of such a nature as to indicate that the property can ordinarily be located only by reference to some map or plat, and no such map or plat being referred to as being in existence, the description is <em>prima facie </em>insufficient. There is no presumption, in the absence of such a reference, that there is such a map in existence.\u201d In remanding the case the court said: \u201cUpon a new trial it will, of course, be competent for the intervener to offer evidence for the purpose of showing that the description was sufficient. To this end he may show, if it be the fact, that there was of record at the time of the assessment a map by the aid of which the description of the lots in question would serve to fully and completely identify and locate them. \u2019 \u2019 At the second trial the evidence submitted at the former trial was introduced by stipulation, and is in the transcript on page 31 down to the middle of page 66, at which point the transcript shows as follows: \u201cThereupon the trial proceeded and the intervener offered in evidence a map entitled Map of the \u2018Baker Homestead Tract,\u2019 which was indorsed: \u2018Filed in the office of the County Recorder of Kern County, California, this 3rd day of April, 1889, N. R. Packard, County Recorder,\u2019 and the same was admitted in evidence.\u201d The plaintiff and defendants thereupon, \u201cwith a view of showing that there were two maps of block 132 in Bakersfield, and that the lots in the blocks were not described in the same manner, nor did they cover the same land, and with a view of showing that there existed an uncertainty in the description of the land that was carried into the assessment, offered in evidence two maps of Bakersfield. \u201d The transcript is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">\u25a0 \u201cThereupon the plaintiff and defendants offered in evidence a map entitled \u2018Map of Bakersfield, Kern County, Cal.\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>indorsed: \u2018Filed in the office of the Recorder of Kern County, Cal., August 17th, 1875, F. W. Craig, Recorder, \u2019 and the same was admitted in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cThe plaintiff and defendants also offered in evidence a map entitled \u2018Map of Bakersfield and Sumner, Kern County, California,\u2019 and indorsed \u2018Filed in the office of the County Recorder of Kern County, June 5th, A. D. 1888, N. R. Packard, County Recorder, \u2019 and the same was admitted in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">These maps were by stipulation omitted from the transcript with an understanding that either party might, if necessary, produce them for inspection by the reviewing court. Appellants have presented in their opening brief, at page 13, a diagram which shows without controversy the situation of the lots in question on the three different maps, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Block 132, Bakersfield, showing division into lots as delineated on map offered in evidence by the intervener, respondent herein, entitled \u201cMap of Baker Homestead Tract, Bakersfield,\u201d filed in the office of the County Recorder, Kern County, California, this 3d day of April, 1889, N.

Packard, County Becorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">An inspection of these maps will show that block 132 is the same size in all three of them\u2014264 feet square; that, on the map of Baker Homestead Tract block 132\" is divided into twelve lots fronting east and west on P and Q Streets with an alley between of 20 feet in width; that lots 1, 2, and 3 front on P Street with a depth of 122 feet and, with half of the alley, would make one-fourth of the block in the northwest corner. The other maps show that the block is surrounded by the same streets but that the lots front north and south on Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Streets, and the block is divided into eight lots. Lots 1, 2 and 3 on those maps have a uniform width frontage of 66 feet and a depth of <em>115\u00bd </em>feet, which would be three-eighths of the block, less half of an alley, and are in the northeast corner of the block and have a frontage of 198 feet on Twenty-fifth and <em>115\u00bd </em>on Q Street. On the face of the maps it would seem impossible to identify the lots in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>There was hut little oral testimony which we give in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\u201cMr. Sears: What is your name? A. J. M. Jameson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cQ. What office, if any, do yon hold in this county? A. County assessor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201cQ. How long have you been assessor of this county? A. Since 1899.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">\u201cQ. You have the supervision over the assessment of property in this county? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cQ. I will ask you if you know anything as to this map, August 17, 1875? A. Well, I have seen it before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u201cQ. Will you observe lot 132 upon this map? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">\u201cQ. Now I will show you another map here sought to be offered in evidence by the plaintiff which shows to have been filed in the recorder\u2019s office on the 5th day of June, 1888. Have you ever seen that map ? A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201cQ. Known as Bakersfield and Sumner? A. I think I ' have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">\u201cQ. Will you observe as to block 132 upon that map of Bakersfield ? Now, in making your assessments, do you know as to whether or not these maps are in use, or whether or not they have been abandoned in making the assessment of property in this city, and in this county? A. Well, it would take a comparison of a map I think to tell that. In making my assessment, I have always gone by the official map at the time the assessment was made, and I could not say as to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">\u201cQ. In making your assessments in this case, and involving the property involved in this ease, being lots 1, 2 and 3, block 132, the asssessment shows that the same was assessed at that time, at the time of the assessment as shown in this case, to the city of Bakersfield. I will ask you as to whether or not at the time of the date of those maps there, there was any city of Bakersfield? A. How is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">\u201cQ. Whether there was any city of Bakersfield, known as the city of Bakersfield. A. It was not incorporated\u2014that is, I don\u2019t know\u2014there was an old incorporation a good many years ago, I don\u2019t know anything about that, but my memory is that there was an old incorporation a good many years ago, which fell through with; but the later incorporation came later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-15\">\u201cMr. Houghton: Of which the record is the best evidence of when the city was incorporated, disincorporated and reincorporated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cThe Court: That is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201cMr. Sears: The maps themselves merely show \u2018Bakersfield\u2019 and \u2018Bakersfield and Sumner,\u2019 while the assessment says \u2018Lots 1, 2 and 3 in Block 132, in the City of Bakersfield. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cQ. Now, what has been your custom and procedure in making assessments in this city as to the descriptions as in this case, for instance, in property in the city of Bakersfield ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cMr. Houghton: We object to it as incompetent what the custom has been, the question is, what has been done in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cMr. Sears: I think I said \u2018in this case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201cMr. Houghton: The record speaks for itself as to what has been done in regard to the assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\u201cThe Court: He can tell how he made this assessment if you want him to. A man might have a custom and it might be wrong, and they would not be bound by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201cMr. Sears: The language in this ease is \u2018Evidence showing the system of assessment. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u201cThe Court: You can show that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\u201cMr. Sears: What has been the system of assessments of property in this city ? A. What do you mean, in descriptions, in describing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">\u201cQ. Yes, as in this case, the property is situated in the city of Bakersfield ? A. I describe it by lots and blocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-14\">\u201cQ. Have you found that that has been generally sufficient so that parties may identify the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-15\">\u201cMr. Houghton: Object to it as irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-16\">\u201cThe Court: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-17\">\u201cMr. Sears: Note an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-18\">\u201cQ. Now, in making .the assessments in this case, as \u2018Lots 1, 2 and 3, in Block 132,\u2019 if there were another map covering the same, what do you do? A. Another map covering the same property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-19\">\u201cQ. The same block for instance. A. You mean if there was a duplicate block 132 in the city of Bakersfield ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-20\">\u201cQ. Yes, sir. A. If there was a duplicate block in the city of Bakersfield, it would be necessary to designate it, in my opinion, as of a certain tract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-21\">\u201cQ. Now, in assessing the property here described as \u2018Lots 1, 2 and 3, in Block 132, \u2019 and it appeared that that was part of the Baker Homestead Tract, has it been the general system of assessing property then, as Lots 1, 2 and 3, in Block 132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of the Baker Homestead Tract ? A. No, because there is only-one 132 in the city of Bakersfield. I think a few instances where people took the pains to write in \u2018Baker Homestead Tract\u2019 in giving the statement in that that description would probably be carried into the roll from the statement, but in an instance where a person gave in lots 3 and 4 or any other lots in block 132, the description of \u2018Block 132\u2019 I considered sufficient for the description of the property, because there is only one block 132 in the city of Bakersfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\u201cQ. There is at this time only one block 132 in the city of Bakersfield, and that is in the Baker Homestead Tract? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cMr. Sears: Take the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cMr. Houghton: That is all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">The assessment-book of the property showed as follows: \u201cUnknown Owners\u2014In Town of Bakersfield\u2014Lots one, two, three, Block 132, Value $115.00. Total tax, $1.90. School tax, 29 cents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In all the instruments relating to the assessment, and in all subsequent conveyances, this description is followed and in none of them is there any reference to a map. It thus appears that there were, at the time these lots were assessed, three maps of record of the town of Bakersfield\u2014one entitled \u201cBaker Homestead Tract,\u201d one entitled \u201cMap of Bakersfield,\u201d and one entitled \u201cBakersfield and Sumner,\u201d both of the latter having been filed before the first one above mentioned. The most that can be said of the testimony of the assessor is that in the assessment he described the property by \u201clots and blocks\u201d; that it has not been the general system of assessing these lots as of the Baker Homestead Tract, \u201cbecause,\u201d as the assessor stated, \u201cthere is only one 132 in the city of Bakersfield.\u201d He testified: \u201cI think in a few instances where people took the pains to write in \u2018Baker Homestead Tract\u2019 in giving the statement,\u201d that description would probably be carried into the roll, but where a person gave in \u201clots in block 132 the description of \u2018block 132\u2019 I considered sufficient for the description of the property, because there is only one block 132 in the city of Bakersfield. Q. There is at this time only one block 132 in the city of Bakersfield, and that is the Baker Homestead Tract? A. Ves, sir.\u201d It is not disputed that these three maps relate to the same lots and block and the assessor expressed the opinion that \u201cif there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>duplicate Mock in the city of Bakersfield, it would be necessary to designate it as of a certain tract.\u201d The witness testified: \u201cIn making my assessment, I have always gone by the official map at the time the assessment was made,\u201d but he could not say whether the maps of 1875 and 1888 were in use when he made his assessment, and he did not state which map was the official map. When the case was remanded it went back with the statement that intervener \u201cmay show, if it be the fact, that there was of record at the time of the assessment [the assessment was made in 1896] a map by the aid of which the description of the lots in question would serve to fully and completely identify and locate them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In the case of <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>150 Cal. 560, [89 Pac. 352], a ease cited with approval by the court when the present case was decided, the question of the sufficiency of the description was involved where a party was claiming under a tax title. In discussing the use of a map for identification of the property, the court said: \u201cIt was, however, permissible to show, in aid of this description, that it was in fact sufficient to identify the land, and, in this behalf, to show the recorded map of such Pellissier tract, designating with certainty the property referred to in the assessment. If by such evidence it was made to appear that there was such a recorded map, and only one such map, or, if more than one, no difference therein so far as the assessed property was concerned, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conclusion that the assessment sufficiently identified the property. The trial court had the right to assume, in the absence of a showing to the contrary by the person assailing the description, that there was but one Pellissier tract in the county of Los Angeles, and that this tract and the extent of its boundaries were well known by that name. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leet, </em>23 Cal. 161.) \u201d The court then quoted from <em>Best </em>v. <em>Wohlford, </em>144 Cal. 733, [78 Pac. 293], as follows: \u201cParol evidence will not be admitted to help out a defective description, or to show the intention with which it was made, or to resolve an ambiguity in its terms. ... If reference is made to a map, the map thereby becomes a part of the description, and may be read in evidence to identify the land, by showing that it is delineated thereon according to the recital; and although it is not competent to show that any particular map was intended, if none is referred to, yet if it can be shown that there is only one map of a tract which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>includes the lot in controversy, upon which this lot is delineated or designated, and that that map is well known and generally accepted as authentic, it may he received in evidence as tending to identify the land before the court.\u201d (See <em>Furrey </em>v. <em>Lautz, </em>162 Cal. 397, [122 Pac. 1073] ; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>162 Cal. 206, 207, [121 Pac. 737] ; <em>McLauchlan </em>v. <em>Bonynge, </em>15 Cal. App. 239, 240, [114 Pac. 798].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">There was no evidence that these lots were assessed in accordance with any existing system of numbering lots and blocks as shown by but one map, nor is there evidence that the lots delineated on all the maps introduced are the same and embrace the same land. The maps, in our opinion, add to the uncertainty of the description in the assessment rather than \u201cto fully and completely identify and locate them.\u201d Bearing in mind that there is but one block 132 in the city of Bakersfield, and that all three of these maps refer to that and no other block, it is plain enough that lots 1, 2, and 3 as delineated on the 1889 map are in a different part of the block and do not embrace all the land referred to by lots 1, 2, and 3 in the other maps. \u2018 \u2018 The purposes to be subserved by the description,\u201d said the court, in <em>Best </em>v. <em>Wohlford, </em>144 Cal. 733, [78 Pac. 293], \u201care to enable the owner to discharge his land from the lien of the assessment by paying the same; and also, in case the land shall be sold to satisfy the lien, that bidders may know what land is offered for sale, and that the purchaser may receive a sufficient conveyance. The assessment becomes a lien only upon the land which is described in the assessment-book, and it is therefore essential that such description be sufficiently definite to inform the owner whether any of his land is burdened by the lien. The description must be such that the land claimed by virtue of the deed can be identified or located upon the ground by means thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The judgment rested upon the finding of the trial court\u2014 \u201cThat the said property was duly assessed by the county assessor of Kern County, in the year 1896, for the year 1896.\u201d This finding is challenged on the ground \u201cthat the description of the land in said assessment was not sufficient and on account of the want of such description the assessment was-void.\u201d We think that this finding is not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The judgment and order are, therefore, reversed. <em>\u00a1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
