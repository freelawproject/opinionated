On the morning of September 28, 1913, the deceased, Gabino Smith, who was at that time his employee, came up to his house to wash before breakfast. The defendant was in the act of taking a drink of whisky from a bottle which was sitting on the wash-sink, and offered the deceased a drink, which he indicated his willingness to accept. There was very little left in the bottle from which the defendant had been drinking, so he reached under the sink and got what he apparently supposed was another bottle of whisky, and handed it to the deceased, stating that he guessed it was whisky. The deceased drank from the bottle which was handed him, and immediately after doing so said to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>defendant, \u201cWhat kind of a trick did you play on me?\u201d and went presently into convulsions, and died within a few moments. The bottle from which he drank contained carbolic acid.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The foregoing facts were proven at the trial and formed the basis\u2019of the jury\u2019s verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The appellant contends that the inference of negligence does not arise from the foregoing facts, and that even if such inference does arise, the facts also establish contributory negligence on the part of the deceased sufficient to have defeated the plaintiff\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">We are unable to agree with either of these contentions. The defendant\u2019s conduct in keeping carbolic acid, a deadly poison, in a whisky bottle without any distinguishing mark or label showing its dangerous and deadly quality, and of intermingling such bottle with such a content with other similar bottles containing whisky or other drinkables; and the act of the defendant in \"tendering such bottle containing carbolic acid to the deceased under the circumstances which he himself detailed, were acts of gross negligence amply sufficient to justify the verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The acts of the deceased in accepting the defendant\u2019s proffered drink, and of assuming without question or investigation that the bottle from which he drank contained liquor similar to that which he had just seen his employer drink, and in believing it to be the whisky which he had just been invited to partake of, were in keeping with the ordinary and customary conduct of other individuals under like circumstances. It is to be noted that the liquid which he drank was not poured out in a glass, or other open receptacle, where its color or smell or other dissimilarity to whisky might reasonably attract his notice and arouse his suspicion, but that he was handed the bottle and was expected to and did drink directly from it. Under these circumstances we cannot say as a matter of law that his act in so doing was contributory n\u00e9gligenee.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In support of the appellant\u2019s contention that the verdict of the jury was excessive, he directs our attention to certain evidence tending to show that the deceased was a man of dissolute and unthrifty habits, and was not a very useful member of society or supporter of his family. These were matters properly submitted to the jury, and doubtless considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>them in arriving at the amount of their verdict. We are unable to say that a verdict in the sum of two thousand dollars for the death of a human being, through the negligence of another under the circumstances detailed in this case, was so excessive as to justify the conclusion that the jury were moved by undue passion or prejudice in its rendition or amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Beasly, J., <em>pro tem., </em>and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
