Finding 6 reads: \u201cThat all the facts set forth in defendant\u2019s answer herein contrary to these findings are untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Within due time, the defendant duly served and filed a notice of appeal to the supreme court from said judgment, \"and to stay the execution thereof gave a bond in the sum of one thousand six hundred dollars, to which no exception was taken, and which covers a sum which would accrue within a period of approximately three years, should the judgment be affirmed. <em>(Sharon </em>v. <em>Sharon, </em>67 Cal. 185, [7 Pac. 456, 635, 8 Pac. 709].)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Thereafter the plaintiff noticed and filed an application to the trial court for an order allowing her costs and attorney\u2019s fees to cover the expense, for transcribing the testimony taken at the trial, to be used on the motion of the defendant for a new trial and upon the appeal from the judgment, for the printing of briefs on the appeal, for compensation of her counsel in those proceedings, and further asked for an order requiring the defendant to pay to plaintiff a reasonable sum for the support and maintenance of the said child \u201cpending the determination of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and decision of defendant\u2019s proposed appeal to the supreme court herein. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Upon hearing the above-mentioned motion, the court made an order allowing the same, as follows, briefly: That the defendant immediately deposit with the clerk of the court the sum of $150, to be expended in the payment of such costs, charges, and disbursements \u201cas may be necessary for plaintiff\u2019s costs and expenses in preparing her amendments to defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions and all of her costs necessary to be expended by her in preparation on her part against de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>fendant\u2019s said motion for a new trial herein and defendant\u2019s appeal herein\u201d; that defendant pay to plaintiff the sum of $75 as and for her counsel fees on said motion for a new trial and defendant\u2019s appeal herein; that, pending the hearing of said motion for a new trial and appeal and the final determination of both, the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of $20 per month for the support and maintenance of said minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The defendant took an appeal from said order, and filed a bond to stay the execution thereof. It is the appeal from said order with which we are here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The bill of exceptions in the transcript does not contain the judgment-roll. It states, however, that, at the hearing of the application for the order from which this appeal is prosecuted, the defendant <em>offered </em>in evidence the judgment-roll. It is quite probable that the judgment-roll was, as a matter of fact, received in evidence, but that, under the decision in <em>Harron </em>v. <em>Harron, </em>128 Cal. 303, [60 Pac. 932], it was deemed unnecessary to incorporate it in the bill. The notice of the motion in this case stated that said motion \u201cwill be made upon this notice of motion and upon all of the pleadings and papers filed herein and on all of the proceedings had and taken herein, and upon such oral and documentary evidence as may be produced upon the hearing hereof.\u201d The order appealed from here was made by the judge who tried the case upon the merits and rendered the judgment thereon. The record in the case was judicially before the court upon the motion, and, in the hearing thereof, it took, as it had a right to do, judicial notice thereof. <em>(Harron </em>v. <em>Harron, </em>128 Cal. 303, [60 Pac. 932].)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The action purports to be based upon section 198a of the Civil Code, which reads: \u201cThe father as well as the mother, of an illegitimate child must give him support and education suitable to his circumstances. A civil suit to enforce such obligations may be maintained in behalf of a minor illegitimate child, by his mother or guardian, and in such action the court shall have power to order and enforce performance thereof, the same as under sections 138, 139 and 140 of the Civil Code, in a suit for divorce by a wife. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">It is vigorously argued by the defendant that the complaint does not state a cause of action under said section, and that the findings, which follow substantially the averments of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>complaint, do not support the judgment. It- is further claimed that the complaint on its face shows that the minor child therein referred to and not the plaintiff is the real party in interest in this action, and for this reason said pleading fails to state the existence of a right of action in the plaintiff upon the cause of action so stated. We recognize much merit in the first stated of these contentions. As to the second we intimate no opinion, since we do not find it necessary to consider it on this appeal. Indeed, we prefer not to consider either of said points, inasmuch as there is, it appears, an appeal from the judgment pending and supported by.some other record which is not here, and it is preferable tha't the questions suggested should be disposed of on said appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We think the court transcended its power in.making the order complained of here. To our minds, the whole question whether a trial court is legally authorized to make such an order after judgment in an action based upon section 196a of the Civil Code must be determined upon a consideration of statutory law, conceding that it is within the competence of the legislature to confer such power upon trial courts in a ease like this. In other words, the power of the court to make such an order is not inherent, but, if it exists and can exist at all, it must come from direct legislative authority.\" The soundness of this proposition cannot well be challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">It' is doubtless true that, in actions for divorce (and it will be understood that we are now referring to cases of that character wherein there is no contested issue of marriage\u2014that is, wherein the marriage is not denied), even in the absence of statutory regulation of the matter or express legislative authority therefor, the courts having cognizance of such causes have the power to make after judgment suitable and reasonable provision for temporary or permanent alimony or support and provision for the payment by the husband to the wife of such sums as may be found to be requisite to defray the expenses necessary to be incurred by her in prosecuting the action or defending against it at the trial or in prosecuting or resisting the appeal, if one be taken. This power naturally follows from the nature of the marriage relation and the rights and duties of the parties thereupon arising, and from the fact that an action for a divorce is for the purpose of dissolving that relation. The husband upon the marriage becomes the head of the family, and has exclusive con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>trol, under certain restrictions as to disposition, of the community property. As a rule, he alone holds the \u201cpurse strings,\u201d and this is true even where the principal sources of his income are the property or belongings of the community. But, even if there be no community property and the wife is without separate means, the authority of the court to compel the husband after judgment to pay to the wife such sum or sums as may reasonably be required to prosecute or resist an appeal and for the support of their minor children pending the appeal will be recognized.- \u201cNatural justice and the policy of the law,\u201d says Mr. Bishop, in his work on Marriage and Divorce, volume 2, section 976, \u201calike demand that in any litigation between husband and wife, they shall have equal facilities for presenting their case before the tribunal. This requires that they should have equal command of funds. So that if she is without means, the law having vested (given control of) the acquisitions of the two in (to) him, he should be compelled to furnish them to her, to an extent rendering her his equal in the suit. This doctrine is a part of the same whereon proceeds temporary alimony. And so the English courts have from the earliest times to the present held with-' out the aid of parliament, and nearly all of our own have , accepted the doctrine as of common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Of course, where the matter of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and temporary or permanent support is regulated by statute, then the rules so promulgated must govern, and, undoubtedly, where, in a divorce action, a trial court failed to follow the statute in the matter of awarding costs, etc., or transcended its authority under the statute in that regard, its action therein would be annulled or set at naught upon appeal as being void or beyond the jurisdiction of the court. In this state, as well as in most of the states at the present time, the matter of costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and alimony, in divorce actions or suits for maintenance and support, is entirely regulated and governed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">But there is no analogy between divorce suits or any other action between a husband and wife pertaining to or involving their marital relation and obligations and an action founded upon section 196a of the Civil Code. No more than in any other of the various classes of actions has a court the inherent power, if, indeed, it can have or be given any power in that respect at all, to require a litigant in a case of this char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>acter to provide Ms adversary with the means necessary to defray the costs and expenses incident to the prosecution or resisting of an appeal or for the support of such adversary, pending the disposition of the cause on appeal. This proposition necessarily follows from the fact that the essential issue to be determined in an action of this kind is contested. The gist or gravamen of this action is the paternity of the alleged illegitimate child. The defendant entered the court denying that he was the father of the child. His legal liability for its support can, therefore, only be fixed by proof that he is the father. There is not as to the defendant and the infant, as is true in divorce actions, wherein the marriage is admitted or not denied, a fixed and admitted status upon which the court is authorized to exercise a power whereby a decree affecting the rights of the parties may be made in advance of the trial of the issues of fact or in the absence of proof. Nor is it any less true in this ease than in any other action, except in suits for divorce and kindred actions, that a court, after judgment, has no right to require the defendant to provide the plaintiff with the financial means with which to defend the judgment on appeal and to pay a monthly sum for the support of the children pending the determination of the appeal. To recognize such power in the trial court would be to assume that, with the rendition and entry of the judgment, the questions at issue had been definitively determined and settled, a position in direct contradiction to the rule that \u201cAn action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until the time for appeal has passed, unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. <em>1049; Naftzger </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>99 Cal. 83, [37 Am. St. Rep. 23, 33 Pac. 757] ; <em>In re Blythe\u2019s Estate, </em>99 Cal. 472, [34 Pac. 108]; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Story &amp; I. Commercial Co., </em>100 Cal. 31, [34 Pac. 675] ; <em>Borges </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>29 Cal. App. 144, 150, [154 Pac. 1075].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Thus it is very clear that there is no inherent power or ' authority in a trial court to make, after judgment, such an order as the one here complained of, and, assuming without deciding, but questioning the constitutional right of the legislature to confer upon trial courts the power of making such an order as the one here after judgment in a case of this kind, we know of no statute investing such courts with such authority, unless, as counsel for the plaintiff contends, it is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>found in sections 138, 139, and 140 of the Civil Code, the provisions of which are by section 196a expressly made applicable to a limited extent to actions based upon the last-mentioned section.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The sections named read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201cSec. 138. In actions for divorce the court may,, dririhg the pendency of the action, or at the final hearing or at any time thereafter during the minority of any of the children of the marriage, make such order for the custody, care, education, maintenance and support of such minor children as may seem necessary or proper, and may at any time modify or vacate the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201cSec. 139. Where a divorce is granted for an offense of the husband, the court may compel him to provide for the maintenance of the children of the marriage, and to make such suitable allowance to the wife for her support, during her life, or for a shorter period, as the court may deem just, having regard to the circumstances of the parties respectively; and the court may, from time to time, modify its orders in these respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201c See. 140. The court may require the husband to give reasonable security for providing maintenance or making any payments required under the provisions of this chapter, and may enforce the same by the appointment of a receiver, or by any other remedy applicable to the case. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The only section of the above which appears to lend support to the contention of the plaintiff is 138. But when we examine the language of section 196a which refers to the above sections, it seems to us that the irresistible conclusion is that it was not thereby intended to create any additional <em>rights </em>in favor of the illegitimate child,- but that the sole purpose was thus to provide a full and complete <em>remedy </em>for the <em>enforcement </em>of the rights previously given in said section. The language, it will be noted, is that \u201cthe court shall have power to <em>order and enforce </em>performance\u201d\u2014of what? The <em>obligations </em>which, in the preceding part of the section, are established in favor of the child as against its parents, and this to be attained, as far as a court is authorized to go in a case of this character and no further, in the <em>manner </em>and <em>mode </em>pointed out by sections 138, 139, and 140 as applicable to actions for divorce. Of course, we are not to be understood as saying that, if the present, or a like case, is affirmed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>appeal and thus it is definitively determined and settled that the \u201cobligations\u201d created by section 196a rest upon the parent proceeded against, the trial court, in such ease, would not retain jurisdiction of the cause to the extent of requiring the parent, if deemed necessary, to give reasonable security for providing maintenance, etc., for the child and of modifying from time <em>to </em>time, if the circumstances appeared to call for it, the judgment in so far as is concerned the sum to be paid for the child\u2019s maintenance and support. This proposition we do not decide, however, it being unnecessary for the purposes of this decision to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">But, as declared, we are firmly of the opinion that, in making sections 138,139, and 140 a part of section 196a, the intention of the legislature was not to create in behalf of the illegitimate child rights additional to those established for it by the latter section, but merely to provide a remedy for the enforcement of the rights so established or created.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Our conclusion is that the trial court was without jurisdiction to make the order from which this appeal is prosecuted, and it is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on April 16, 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
