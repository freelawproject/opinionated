We think it very plain, therefore, without going further into the averments of the complaint, that the lessee and its assignee (plaintiffs herein) have no standing in a court either of law or equity, and that the demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
