We are of the opinion, however, that there is a conflict in the circumstantial evidence upon which this award is founded; and while we feel that the commission might with propriety have reached a conclusion diametrically opposed to the one arrived at by it, and probably would have found stronger reasons in support thereof in the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the petitioner, nevertheless having made its finding upon what we conceive to be a fairly substantial conflict in such evidence, we do not see how we can interfere with the award, and for that reason the writ is dismissed and the award affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
