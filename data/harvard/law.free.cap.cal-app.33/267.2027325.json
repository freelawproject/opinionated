Subsequently, according to the testimony given by plaintiff, a circumstance was called to his attention for the first time which made the prospect of securing title in the name of the defendant very doubtful; whereupon plaintiff told the defendant \u201cthat the situation did not look good to him,\u201d and refused to proceed under the contract. They then entered into an oral agreement whereby the plaintiff should proceed to render the agreed services, he to be paid a fair fee, without, however, there being any agreement as to its amount. The defendant denied that there had been a rescission and abandonment of the written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Oral evidence was admissible to prove that the parties entered into a new and distinct agreement as a substitute for the written one (1 G-reenleaf on Evidence, sec. 303, p. 4); and while perhaps such testimony under some circumstances should be viewed with distrust, nevertheless in this case the trial court who heard the testimony and saw the witnesses believed the testimony introduced by the plaintiff as to the oral agreement, and found accordingly. We are constrained, therefore, to hold that the judgment of the trial court cannot be disturbed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
