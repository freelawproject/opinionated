The appeal is presented on the judgment-roll. The facts as they may be gathered from the complaint are as follows : Prior to December 17, 1903, the plaintiff had rendered services to C. A. Canfield, since deceased, in and about the purchase of certain land. Canfield became the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the land and as evidence of the compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his services, wrote the plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALE\">\u201cDear Sir:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\u201cRelative to onr understanding at the time of the purchase of the N. E. \u00bc of See. 23-28-27, and in consideration of your services granted in connection thereof, it is my understanding and agreement that you are to have one-third (%) of the net profits arising from the operation or final sale of the above mentioned property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cYours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cC. A. Canfield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The total price paid by Canfield for the land, including taxes, was $6,765.79. Canfield sold the property on April 30, 1913, for eight thousand dollars; that amount being in excess of the purchase price by the sum of $1,234.21. The plaintiff duly presented his claim against the estate of Can-field for the sum of $411.40, being one-third of the apparent profit made by Canfield on his investment. The court found the facts as they were alleged by the plaintiff, but found that there was nothing due the plaintiff for the reason that by adding interest at the rate of seven per cent to the amount of Canfield\u2019s original investment, and charging that interest as a part of the investment, no profits- resulted by reason of the price obtained at the sale of the property. The one question is presented as to whether \"interest was properly chargeable under the contract made between Young and Canfield. On the part of respondent the cases of <em>Hentz </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Co., </em>134 Pa. St. 343, [19 Atl. 685], and <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Bernays, </em>162 Mo. App. 27, [141 S. W. 933], are cited. In the case first noted the court refers to a work on partnership, and the opinion contains this statement: \u201cThere are no profits in a land speculation which does not return to the investor his purchase money with interest upon it.\u201d This language is approved in <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Bernays, </em>162 Mo. App. 27, [141 S. W. 933]. As applied to the facts of this case, we are not in accord with the determination of the Pennsylvania and Missouri courts. There was no agreement expressed here for the payment of any interest upon Canfield\u2019s investment; the plaintiff had rendered certain services and his compensation was agreed upon in the manner declared in the letter written by Canfield to him. We are of the opinion that the term \u201cnet profits,\u201d as used in this letter, does not authorize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>charge of any interest amount, and that if such had been in contemplation it should have been expressed. Furthermore, Canfield, for aught that is shown by the pleadings or record presented,, might not have been able to have secured a seven per cent income on the money which he invested in the land, nor any per cent at all, for that matter. The general rule is that the matter of the payment of interest must be made the subject of an express agreement, otherwise it cannot be charged; excepting, of course, in the case of a loan of money which by our code is made subject to the payment of interest by presumption. (Civ. Code, sec. 1914.) The general rule which we have adverted to finds expression in <em>Tirrell </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>39 Cal. 655, and <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Lambard, </em>80 Cal. 426, 438, [22 Pac. 180],</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to the trial court' to enter judgment upon the findings of fact in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Conrey, P. J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
