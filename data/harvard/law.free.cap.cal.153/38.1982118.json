Consequently, prohibition will not <em>lie to </em>prevent the prosecution of such an action, notwithstanding the complaint therein <em>may be </em>defective for failure to state a cause of action.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">APPLICATION for a Writ of Prohibition directed to the Superior Court of Marin County.

If this be so, we cannot say that the superior court has no <em>jurisdiction </em>of the action. The objection made by petitioner really is that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. It may be that the complaint here does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, but that is a matter for the trial court to determine in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and prohibition will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
