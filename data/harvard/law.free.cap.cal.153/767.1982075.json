The judgment pronounced on said \u25a0conviction was affirm\u00e9d on appeal by the superior court of said county. Having been delivered into the custody of the sheriff of said county under such judgment, he sought to be discharged by this court on <em>habeas </em>corpus, and a writ having been issued he was released on bail pending a determination of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">It is contended that the complaint in the justice\u2019s court did not state facts constituting a public offense. We are of the opinion that this contention must be held to be well founded. The act of March 14, 1907, provides that \u201cAny person who shall practice or attempt to practice or advertise or hold himself out as practicing medicine or surgery, osteopathy, or any other system or mode of treating the sick or afflicted, in this state, without having, at the time of so doing, a valid, unrevoked certificate, as provided in this act, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The act nowhere states, as did the act of 1901 (Stats. 1901, p. 56), which was limited to a regulation of the practice of \u201cmedicine and surgery,\u201d what is meant by the term \u201cpractice\u201d as used therein. The act of 1901, after providing that \"Any person practicing medicine or surgery\u201d without a license shall be deemed guilty of a-misdemeanor, provided in section 16: \u201cThe following persons shall be deemed as practicing medicine or surgery within the meaning of this act: 1. Those who profess to be, or hold themselves out as being, engaged as doctors, physicians or surgeons in the treatment of disease, injury or deformity of human beings. 2. Those who, for pecuniary or valuable consideration, shall prescribe medicine, magnetism or electricity in the treatment of disease, injury or deformity of human beings. 3. Those who, for pecuniary or valuable consideration, shall employ surgical or medical means or appliances for the treatment of disease, injury or deformity of human beings. ... 4. Those who, for a pecuniary or valuable consideration, prescribe or use any drug or medicine, appliance, or medical or surgical treatment, or perform any operation for the relief or cure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>of any bodily injury or disease.\u201d There was thus given by that act to the term \u201cpracticing medicine or surgery\u201d a definite meaning, corresponding substantially with the popular understanding of the term. When we say that one is practicing medicine or surgery or osteopathy, we ordinarily mean that he is engaged in that line of work as a business, holding himself out as being so engaged, or for a consideration treating those who will accept his professional services, and we would not apply the term to one who incidentally and gratuitously suggests or puts into operation some method of treatment in the case of one who is \u201csick or afflicted.\u201d We are satisfied that the term \u201cpractice\u201d in the act of 1907 should not be given any broader meaning than it had in the act of 1901. One who within this meaning \u201cpractices\u201d medicine or surgery or osteopathy, or any other recognized mode of treatment of the sick, without a certificate, violates the provisions of the act. It might be sufficient in the complaint to charge simply that one had practiced medicine, or osteopathy, or chiropraetics, without such certificate. In such an allegation, the word \u201cpractice\u201d would, in view of the accepted meaning it is given when used in such connection, naturally and reasonably bear no other construction than the one we have described, and so construed would show an offense. But the pomplaint in -the case before us, as we read it, contains no such allegation. The allegation was simply that the defendant did willfully and unlawfully \u201ctreat the sick or afflicted\u201d without having at the time a valid unrevoked certificate as required by the act, the words \u201cby practicing the system or mode known as chiropractic\u201d being simply descriptive of the method by which he treated the sick. As thus used, the word \u201cpracticing\u201d cannot reasonably be given the meaning we have described, but is synonymous with the word \u201cusing.\u201d We are informed in the briefs that the word \u201cchiropractic\u201d means a treatment somewhat.analogous to that of osteopathy, the removal of the cause of disease without the use of drugs or any other means except the adjustment of the vertebra of the spine by manipulating them with the hand. If this be correct, the complaint simply charges that the defendant used this method in <em>\u201ctreating\u201d </em>the sick or afflicted, without having any certificate \"under the act, and the allegations of the complaint would be fully sustained by proof that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>had incidentally and gratuitously attempted to administer aid to one who was sick or afflicted by use of this method. It might as well be contended that a complaint simply charging that one treated a sick person by administering medicine, without having a certificate, would state a public offense under this act. To bring a person within the provisions, of the act, it must appear that he practices, or attempts to. practice medicine, etc., as a business or calling, or advertises, or holds himself out as so doing, and, as we have said above, an allegation that one \u201cpracticed medicine,\u201d or surgery, etc., might show this. As we read the act, the allegations of the complaint in the justice\u2019s court in this case are entirely consistent with the innocence of the defendant of any violation of its provisions. It therefore fails to show a public offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Counsel for respondent contends that if there is in this state such an offense or crime as that of which petitioner was convicted, the insufficiency of the complaint is immaterial on <em>habeas corpus, </em>citing <em>Ex parte Ruef, </em>150 Cal. 665, [89 Pac. 605]. The rule of the Ruef case has never been applied by this court to proceedings in courts of inferior, as distinguished from courts of general, jurisdiction. To the contrary, it has been the uniform practice to consider on <em>habeas corpus </em>the question of the sufficiency of the complaint in such inferior courts, and to discharge the prisoner where such complaint failed to show a public offense under the laws of the state. This matter was fully considered in <em>Ex parte Kearny, </em>55 Cal. 212, where the distinction between the two classes of courts was stated, and where the prisoner was discharged solely because of the insufficiency of the complaint in this regard. That decision has never been modified. In the Ruef case we were considering the question with relation to -a proceeding pending in a court of general jurisdiction, the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco, while here we have a proceeding in a court which has uniformly been treated as an inferior court, a justice\u2019s . court. <em>(Ex parte Kearny, </em>55 Cal. 212.) It may be that, a strong argument can be made in favor of the proposition that there is no logical basis for a distinction in this regard. between courts of general jurisdiction and those of inferior' jurisdiction, but the distinction has the support of no less an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>authority than Chief Justice Marshall in the celebrated case of Tobias Watkins, 3 Pet. (U. S.) 193, and has been constantly adhered to by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In view of our conclusion upon the question of the sufficiency of the complaint it is unnecessary to consider the contention of petitioner that the act of 1907 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">It is ordered that the petitioner be discharged, and his bail exonerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Henshaw, J., Lorigan, J., and Beatty, C. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
