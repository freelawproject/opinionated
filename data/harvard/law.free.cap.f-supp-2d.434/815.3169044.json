Scott H. Saham of Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman <em>&amp; </em>Robbins, LLP appeared for Plaintiffs. Laurie B. Smilan of Latham &amp; Watkins, LLP appeared for the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">Having carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, oral argument, and applicable law, the Court finds the Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d) does not meet the pleading requirements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4(b)(1) and (2), and therefore GRANTS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and DISMISSES the Amended Complaint WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Plaintiffs filed this action under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 783(b) and 78(t)(a), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. Plaintiffs allege violations of the statute and regulation on behalf of a class of investors who purchased Defendant Adecco S.A. (\u201cAdecco\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) stock between March 16, 2000 and January 9, 2004 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). (Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cAC\u201d) \u00b6 1.) Defendants are Adecco and four of its officers and directors. Defendant John P. Bowmer was Chairman of Adecco from February 2002 through the end of the Class Period and previously was CEO of the Adecco Group since its inception in 1996. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 47. Defendant Jerome Caille has been the CEO of Adecco since March 2002, and prior to that served as President of the Adecco Staffing division. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 48. Defendant Felix A. Weber was CFO of Adecco from 1998 until 2004. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 49. Defendant Klaus J. Jacobs is one of the Company\u2019s founders and currently co-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Adecco. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 50,160.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Adecco is a Swiss company primarily engaged in providing personnel services to companies and industry worldwide. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 46. Adecco provides these services by contract to businesses located throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 46. The Company\u2019s North American (\u201cAdecco North America\u201d) operations accounted for approximately 24% of total revenue at Adecco in 2003 with U.S. revenue over 3.8 billion Euros in 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 46. The Company\u2019s stock trades on the SWX Swiss Stock Exchange and is listed on Euronext Premier March\u00e9. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 29. Adecco\u2019s stock is also traded as American Depositary Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">In March 2000, Adecco acquired Olsten Corporation, a U.S. company, primarily for its more advanced technology. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 30, 61. After the Olsten takeover, Adecco North America converted its operating system to the legacy Olsten IT system. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b62, 52(i), 60. With the conversion, Defendants became aware of massive problems in the Company\u2019s North American receivables; not just with Olsten but also with Adecco\u2019s legacy accounts. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">During 2000 and 2001, Adecco had millions of dollars in bad debt it could not collect from customers who had gone bankrupt, become insolvent, or were otherwise unable to pay bills. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 71. In addition, Adecco North America did not have an automatic system in place to match payments to the proper invoice, and as a result, payments were often manually credited to the wrong invoice. <em>Id. </em>\u00b670. When this happened, many customers said they had already paid the outstanding amount and refused to pay the new invoice until Adecco \u201cgot its act together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, many of the inherited Olsten customers refused to pay because Adecco utilized a different process when billing customers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 72. The combination of millions of dollars in uncollectible debt and the amount that customers refused to pay resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding receivables on Adecco\u2019s books during 2000 and 2001. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">According to Plaintiffs, when faced with the problem of these uncollectible receivables, Defendants did not disclose them to the market and write them off. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 3. Instead, Defendants chose to cover up the uncollectible receivables and violate Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Defendants disseminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>press releases and filed year-end financial statements for 2000 and 2001 that understated the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts by over $100 million and therefore overstated earnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 10, 11, 134-36, 138, 140; <em>see id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 90-125. Plaintiffs maintain that during the Class Period, Defendants issued false and misleading financial statements that failed to disclose material internal control weaknesses and pervasive problems concerning Adecco\u2019s account receivables in Adecco North America. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Plaintiffs allege Defendants concealed the uncollectible receivables by, among other things, improperly applying current cash receipts that were intended to satisfy recent customer invoices to old outstanding receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 54, 65, 140, 145. Plaintiffs also aver that Adecco North America manipulated its financial statements and violated GAAP by billing customers at incorrect rates, improperly classifying its workers, engaging in State Unemployment Tax Act (\u201cSUTA\u201d) dumping, delaying its payments to vendors, and violating Regulation S-K 303. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 78-82, 88-89, 141-43, 145, 147-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On June 24, 2003, as part of its year-end financial statements, Adecco wrote off receivables that had been on its books for more than 90 days. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 11, 73. The amount written off was approximately $95 million Euros (approximately $100 million). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 11, 73. Prior to that time, some receivables had remained on Adecco\u2019s books more for two years. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 73. The disclosure accompanying this write off was incomplete, false, and misleading because it did not state that the true reason for the write-off, which was the result of material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal controls, had yet to be corrected. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5,11. Another 28 million Euros (approximately $35 million) were written off for year-end 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Adecco switched auditors from Arthur Andersen to Ernst <em>&amp; </em>Young, LLP (\u201cE <em>&amp; </em>Y\u201d) in late 2002. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 76. In early 2003, E <em>&amp; </em>Y warned Defendants they needed to correct the misalloeation of current cash receipts by year-end 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 54, 76. Toward the end of that year, because the Company had failed to correct its internal control problems, E <em>&amp; </em>Y informed Defendants it would not sign off on the Company\u2019s 2003 year-end financial statements. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 54, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">On January 12, 2004, Adecco issued a press release entitled \u201cAdecco S.A. Delays Announcement of FY 2003 Audited Results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 127. The press release stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">Adecco S.A. announced that it does not expect the audit of its consolidated financial statements for the 2003 fiscal year, ended on December 28, 2003, to be completed by Adecco\u2019s auditors, by the previously announced release date of February 4, 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-12\">The reasons for the delay in completion of the audit include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-13\">\u2014 The identification of <em>material weaknesses in internal controls in the Company\u2019s North American operations of Adecco Staffing</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-14\">\u2014 <em>The resolution of possible accounting, control and compliance issues </em>in the Company\u2019s operations in certain countries</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-15\">\u2014 The completion of the Company\u2019s efforts to address these matters and determine their effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>In this regard an independent Counsel has been appointed by the Audit &amp; Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to conduct an investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">The Company is not yet able to predict when the 2003 audit of its consolidated financial statements will be completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 17, 126. Following this news, Adec-co\u2019s stock dropped from almost $17 per share to as low as $10 per share. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 17, 20-21. The SWX Swiss Stock Exchange, SEC, and United States Department of Justice initiated investigations into possible violations of the law. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 32, 128, 130. The SEC subsequently concluded its investigation without taking action. (Horton Decl. Ex. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">On January 16, 2004, the Company issued a press release that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4W\"><em>Material weaknesses, related to Adecco Staffing North America, include IT system security; reconciliation of payroll bank accounts; application of accounts receivable; </em>and several issues affecting revenue recognition including lack of systematic documentation of agreed rates and hours; billing errors not timely identified and corrected; and lack of segregation of duties in the branches increasing the likelihood of undetected errors. Of the foregoing, some have already been corrected, and the balance are being actively addressed. The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board initiated certain measures to help to identify any further weaknesses and permanently resolve them. The chief focus of these measures is to investigate accounting, control and compliance issues in the U.S. and in certain other countries, as well as to investigate accusations made by \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d in the US. Outside of the US, these other countries together accounted for less than 10% of the group\u2019s reported 2002 net service revenues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">(AC \u00b6\u00b6 8, 18, 128). Following the announcements, E &amp; Y and the law firm of Paul Weiss conducted an investigation that cost Adecco over $120 million. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 59, 68. This investigation did not review the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 financial statements. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 59,144.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">Several plaintiffs filed securities fraud class actions against Adecco shortly after these announcements, contending the Company would have to restate its FY 2000-2003 results to eliminate millions in improperly-recorded revenues. The cases were filed in this district and in the Southern District of New York. The New York cases were transferred to this district, and all actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">In June 2004, Adecco released its 2003 Annual Report that included an additional write off of $35 million in bad receivables. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 59, 133; Parry Decl.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ex. H.) Adecco announced in this report that its \u201caccounts were signed by [the] auditors with no qualification, no restatement of prior year results and with no evidence of material irregularities.\u201d (Parry Decl. Ex. H at 599.) Plaintiffs allege Adecco\u2019s 2003 Annual Report conceded problems in controls had existed and that it had not just been overcautiousness on the part of the Board or the Company\u2019s outside officers. (AC \u00b6 133.) Defendant Bowmer hoped that the \u201cunfortunate episode\u201d was ending, and stated that Adecco had \u201ctaken a number of significant steps to reinforce our audit and control functions throughout the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the report, Defendant Caille stated that Adecco had \u201cused this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>opportunity to review [its] operations and systems in the U.S. and drive process efficiencies as well as strengthen! ] ... internal controls.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On September 13, 2004, Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Complaint. The Defendants who had been served moved to dismiss, and by order dated May 16, 2005, the Court granted Defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed the Consolidated Complaint without prejudice. <em>Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Adecco S.A., </em>371 F.Supp.2d 1203 (S.D.Cal.2005). Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d), alleging Defendants issued positive statements throughout the Class Period regarding the Company\u2019s financial status that were false and misleading as they failed to disclose: (1) the Company\u2019s material internal control weaknesses; (2) the Company\u2019s extremely large amount of uncollectible receivables; (3) the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 financial statements, which were operative until June 2003 were in fact false as they understated the Company\u2019s bad debt expense; and (4) the true reason for the write off in year-end 2002. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. This conduct caused Adec-co\u2019s stock to trade at inflated levels, which in turn allowed Adecco to complete a public offering of $533 million worth of convertible bonds on July 23, 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 12. The Defendants who have been served move to dismiss the Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\n<em>APPLICABLE LAW REGARDING MOTIONS TO DISMISS SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>Navarro v. Block, </em>250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir.2001). Dismissal of a claim under this rule is appropriate only where \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); <em>Navarro, </em>250 F.3d at 732. In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must assume the truth of all factual allegations and must construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Thompson v. Davis, </em>295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir.1996). However, legal conclusions need not be taken as true merely because they are cast in the form of factual allegations. <em>Roberts v. Corrothers, </em>812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Western Mining Council v. Watt, </em>643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes it unlawful to use in connection with the mails or facilities of interstate commerce any \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commissioner may prescribe.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j. SEC Rule 10b-5, promulgated under section 10(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-11\">(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. The elements of a Rule 10b-5 claim are: (1) a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact; (2) scienter; (3) causation; (4) reliance; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>(5) damages. <em>In re Daou Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>411 F.3d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1335, 164 L.Ed.2d 51 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Claims brought under Rule 10b-5 and \u00a7 10(b) must meet Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirement that \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b); <em>see Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1014; <em>Yourish v. Cal. Amplifier, </em>191 F.3d 983, 993 (9th Cir.1999). In addition, in 1995, Congress enacted the PSLRA and altered the pleading requirements in private securities fraud litigation by requiring a complaint \u201c \u2018plead with particularity both falsity and scienter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1014 (quoting <em>Gompper v. VISX, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 893, 895 (9th Cir. 2002)). As interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, a complaint alleging securities fraud \u201cmust now \u2018specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gompper, </em>298 F.3d at 895).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATIONS OF \u00a7 10(B) AND RULE 10B-5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">I. <em>Misleading Statements or Omissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Plaintiffs argue Defendants violated GAAP by causing the Company to recognize revenue improperly. (AC \u00b6 145.) In particular, Plaintiffs contend Defendants overstated Adecco\u2019s revenues in its year-end financial statements for 2000 and 2001 by failing to increase the Company\u2019s allowance for bad debt reserves. Plaintiffs further allege the Company should have written off the uncollectible receivables earlier than it did. Regarding the write-down, Plaintiffs maintain Adecco\u2019s year-end 2002 financial statement was materially false and misleading because it attributed the write-off to worsening economic conditions and failed to mentioned the material weaknesses in internal controls. The Amended Complaint alleges Defendants perpetuated this accounting fraud by: (1) applying new moneys received from customers to old outstanding invoices; (2) billing customers at incorrect rates; (3) engaging in SUTA dumping; (4) delaying payment of vendor invoices; and (5) violating Regulation S-K 303. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 54, 58, 65, 78-82, 88-89, 140-43,147-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Plaintiffs theory of malfeasance rests on accounting fraud. \u201cTo properly state a claim for accounting fraud, plaintiffs must plead facts sufficient to support a conclusion that defendant prepared the fraudulent financial statements and that the alleged financial fraud was material.\u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1016 (internal quotations and alterations omitted). \u201cWhen pleading irregularities in revenue recognition, plaintiffs should allege: (1) such basic details as the approximate amount by which revenues and earnings were overstated; (2) the products involved in the contingent transaction; (3) the dates of any of the transactions; or (4) the identities of any of the customers or [company] employees involved in the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted). Although plaintiffs need not allege each of those particular details, they must allege enough to allow a court to \u201c \u2018discern whether the alleged GAAP violations were minor or technical in nature, or whether they constituted widespread and significant inflation of revenue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1017 (quoting <em>In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>126 F.Supp.2d 1248, 1273 (N.D.Cal.2000)). Thus, to support a claim of fraud, a plaintiff must plead with particularity how the accounting manipulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>\u201caffected the company\u2019s financial statements and whether they were material in light of the company\u2019s overall financial position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">A. The Company\u2019s Reserves and Write Down of Uncollectible Receivables</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Plaintiffs allege the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 year-end financial statements understated Adecco\u2019s allowance for uncollectible receivables in the amount of $100 million, and that the Company should have written off that bad debt before year-end 2002. Understatements of bad debt reserves can support a securities fraud claim because \u201c[cjompanies are obliged to make reasonable predictions about the collectability of their accounts receivable. Underestimates of bad debt reserves lead to overstatement of income, and ultimately inflation of stock price.\u201d <em>Kane v. Madge Networks N.V., </em>No. C-96-20652-RMW, 2000 WL 33208116, at * 5 (ND.Cal. May 26, 2000). However, a bare allegation that bad debt reserves were inadequate is insufficient \u201cbecause even reasonable predictions turn out to be wrong. Instead, plaintiffs must allege with particularity facts that show the initial prediction was \u2018a falsehood.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>42 F.3d 1541, 1549 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc)). A company\u2019s reserve amounts can be \u201c \u2018fraudulent only if, when established, the responsible parties knew or should have known that they were derived in a manner inconsistent with reasonable accounting practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re GlenFed, </em>42 F.3d at 1549 n. 10 (quoting <em>Christidis v. First Penn. Mortgage Trust, </em>717 F.2d 96, 100 (3d Cir.1983)). Accordingly, a complaint alleging fraud based on understated reserves must \u201cinclude details about when and to what level the accounts receivable should have been written down, when and to what level the allowance should have been changed, why the allowance made by the corporation was unreasonable in light of the [bed debt] experienced, and how many accounts ultimately were uncollectible.\u201d <em>In re Loewen Group Inc.

Sec.

In particular, the Court found there were no factual allegations that Defendants knew when preparing the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 financial statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>that certain accounts at Adecco North America were uncollectible and should have been written off during that time frame. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. To the contrary, the Complaint suggested Adecco North America intended to collect the outstanding receivables, alleging that after the Olsten acquisition, \u201cAdecco North American corporate offices instructed every branch to begin making efforts to collect the outstanding receivables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There were no allegations explaining why the allegedly uncollectible receivables were outside of the range provided for by the Company\u2019s allowance for doubtful accounts, and by how much. <em>Id. </em>The Court also found the Consolidated Complaint did not contain factual allegations regarding the amount of Adecco North America\u2019s revenue inflation and quantifying the impact of Adecco North America\u2019s financials on Adecco\u2019s consolidated financial statements for its worldwide operations. <em>Id. </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Plaintiffs maintain the Amended Complaint addresses these issues and is based upon the testimony of confidential witnesses. CW1, a former Senior Vice President of Adecco North America who later held higher top executive positions, helped negotiate the Olsten-Adecco merger. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 52(a), 60.) CW1 reports that Olsten had done a poor job in keeping on top of its receivables and collections. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 60. Plaintiffs argue that part of the reason Adecco acquired Olsten was for its operating system, and according to CW14, a former business analyst for Adecco Staffing North America, following the merger Adecco converted from its legacy systems over to Olsten\u2019s system. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52(n), 61. CW14 and CW5 (a former Adecco technical sales manager) attest this process took over a year to complete. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52(e), 61. After the system changeover, Adecco discovered massive problems in Adecco\u2019s North American receivables as well as Ol-sten\u2019s receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">According to CW1, CW8, CW9, and CW11, after the acquisition and during 2000 and 2001, the Company discovered it would be unable to collect tens, if not hundreds of millions in receivables from Olsten\u2019s customers who had gone bankrupt or who had unresolved billing disputes. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 52(h), 52(i), 52(k), 56, 60, 62, 63-64. Plaintiffs\u2019 confidential witnesses report that because Adecco North America\u2019s operations did not have an automatic system in place to match payments to the proper invoice, payments were often manually credited to the wrong invoice. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52(i), 52(k), 69-70. When this happened, many customers contended they had already paid the outstanding amount and refused to pay the new invoice until Adecco North America determined the correct outstanding amount. <em>Id. </em>at 70. This issue compounded Adecco North America\u2019s problems with uncollectible receivables. <em>Id. </em>CW9 reports that many of the inherited Olsten customers refused to pay invoices because Adecco utilized a process different from Olsten when billing customers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 72. Plaintiffs also allege that as of May 2001, according to CW11, the aggregate \u201cunapplied payments\u201d figure was in the tens of millions of dollars, and estimated to be about $40 million by a former executive. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Plaintiffs maintain the understatement of doubtful accounts in North America was material to investors because Adecco\u2019s North American operations accounted for approximately 28% of Adecco\u2019s worldwide revenue in 2001 (27% in 2002 and 24% in 2003). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56, 63. Additionally, the North American operations\u2019 allowance for doubtful accounts was 28% in 2001, 26% in 2002, and 24% in 2003 of the entire Company. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Having reviewed the amended pleading in its entirety, the Court is not persuaded Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>derstatement of doubtful accounts, or that the Company committed fraud by failing to take a write-off earlier. The first deficiency is that the Amended Complaint does not plead sufficient facts to support its allegation the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 year-end financial statements overstated revenues and understated allowance of bad debt by approximately $100 million. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 11. To support that statement, the Amended Complaint must allege facts that support the inference Adecco should have increased its reserves in its 2000 and 2001 year-end financial statements by $100 million (or alternatively, written off that amount). Instead, the Amended Complaint reiterates the vague and conclusory assertion that the Company had \u201ctens if not hundreds of millions\u201d in uncollectible revenue. The only allegations that attempt to quantify the amount of uncollectible receivables come from two confidential witnesses. CW5 relates that in 2001, Deutsche Bank was 360 days past due on over $100,000 in accounts receivable, and Kodak was approximately 180 days past due on a $200,000 outstanding balance. <em>Id </em>\u00b6 52(e). CW17 states that St. Paul Insurance, AIG, CitiMortgage, and Excel Shipping &amp; Logistics had outstanding balances in the tens of thousands of dollars, and that MetLife and IBM were two other customer accounts that had even larger outstanding receivables in the very high tens of thousands of dollars to over $100,000. <em>Id </em>\u00b6 52(q). CW16 also reports that three legacy Olsten customers had outstanding receivables, one dating as far back as 1999, but notably that confidential witness does not state the amount of outstanding receivables. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 52(p). CW2 recalls \u201cthat her branch wrote off thousands in outstanding receivables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The total amount of outstanding receivables discussed by CW5 and CW17 is approximately $1 million. Although the Amended Complaint alleges the \u201coutstanding receivables from CW5\u2019s branch were indicative of receivables outstanding at Adecco\u2019s more than 1500 North American offices,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 52(e), that conclusion is not supported by allegations of any confidential witness who would be in a position to make that extrapolation or compute the total amount of uncollectible receivables that should have been reserved for to be $100 million. <em>Cf. Cal. Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. Chubb Corp., </em>394 F.3d 126, 155 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cPlaintiffs repeatedly attribute specific nationwide information and statistics regarding Chubb\u2019s performance to former employees who worked in local branch offices. These sources have not been described with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.\u201d). CW5, CW16, and CW 17 also appear to be low-level employees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations indicating how they would be privy to how delinquent accounts would be reserved for in the Company\u2019s worldwide financial statements. Further, the information provided by the confidential witnesses is incomplete. CW2 states thousands in outstanding receivables were written off, but does not state whether they had been reserved for. CW5, CW16, and CW17 indicate certain accounts were past due, but they do not state whether those outstanding receivables were reserved for, had to be written off, or were ultimately collected. Indeed, certain of the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations indicate the Company intended to collect its outstanding receivables. For example, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Amended Complaint indicates Adecco North America intended to collect the outstanding receivables, alleging that \u201cfollowing discovery of the Olsten accounts receivable problem and the Adecco accounts receivable problem, the Melville, New York, corporate office delegated to the hundreds of branch offices the actual collection function because the problems were so pervasive. Corporate put various incentives in place at the branch level to encourage collecting on old accounts receivable more quickly.\u201d (AC \u00b6 85.) These allegations therefore, do not adequately plead falsity regarding the Company\u2019s 2000 or 2001 year-end financial statements, or falsity in Adecco\u2019s 2002 year-end statement\u2019s discussion of the write-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">B. Application of Current Cash Receipts to Old Receivables</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">As with the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint alleges accountants in the Cash Application division of the Corporate Accounts Receivable Department in Melville, New York violated GAAP and manipulated the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 year-end financial statements by applying new receivables to old and uncollectible accounts. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 65-73, 140. The Amended Complaint attributes the misapplication of payments to different causes. Certain paragraphs of the Complaint suggest the misapplication was purposeful, and intended to allow Defendants to avoid writing off the uncollectible receivables and to understate Adecco\u2019s reserves and overstate earnings. Paragraph 3 alleges that \u201cAdecco was faced with either disclosing and writing off these [outstanding] receivables (and thereby reducing its net income) or trying to cover it up. <em>The defendants chose the latter course: they attempted to \u2018work off the receivables by, among other things, using current funds to pay old debts.\" Id. </em>\u00b6 3 (emphasis added). Similarly, paragraph 65 states, \u201c[a]ccording to CW1, <em>in order to address the massive uncollected receivables discussed above without having to write them off, </em>current cash receipts were applied to old accounts receivable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 65 (emphasis added); <em>see id. </em>\u00b6 50 (\u201cAt approximately the same time [as KJ Jacobs AG sold $196 million worth of Adecco stock], <em>the Company started concealing its uncollectible receivables by applying newly received moneys to old receivables.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 64 (\u201cRather than acknowledge the extensive problems and accurately reporting the financial results of the Company, <em>defendants chose to cover-up the problem with a variety of manipulations.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Other paragraphs of the Complaint, however, ascribe the misapplication of cash to \u201cmaterial weaknesses in internal controls.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 6 (stating that the Company had failed to correct its internal control problems <em>\u201cwhich continued to allow the application of new moneys to old receivables </em>\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 12 (\u201c[t]he <em>material weaknesses in internal controls referenced herein also allowed the company to apply new moneys to old receivables, </em>in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u2018GAAP\u2019)\u201d (emphasis added).) CW1, who in another paragraph indicated the improper application was directed by Defendants, <em>(see id. </em>\u00b6 65), alleges also that the Company\u2019s \u201cweaknesses in internal controls allowed the Company to violate GAAP by applying new moneys to old receivables in order to eliminate them from the Company\u2019s books.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(a). Similarly, paragraph 55 alleges \u201c[t]his lack of accounting controls resulted in the improper application of accounts receivable and a material understatement of the Company\u2019s uncollectible accounts, resulting in overstated earnings during the Class Period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 55; <em>see id. </em>\u00b6 68 (\u201cThese material weaknesses which are described, in part, above, allowed Adecco\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>financial statements to be materially misstated during the Class Period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Having reviewed the Amended Complaint in its entirety, the Court is not persuaded Plaintiffs properly alleged misrepresentations and omissions based on the application of current cash receipts to old receivables. This Court rejected the Consolidated Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding this issue in part because the pleading did not corroborate its assertions with any examples. <em>Adecco, </em>371 F.Supp.2d at 1214. This deficiency remains in the Amended Complaint. Although CW1 now is the source for certain allegations regarding misapplication of receivables, that witness does not provide any examples of the improper cash applications, nor are there any allegations quantifying the impact of the alleged misapplication on Adecco\u2019s 2000 and 2001 year-end financial statements. Further, the Amended Complaint contains a significant inconsistency. As discussed above, certain paragraphs allege a purposeful scheme by Defendants to apply new moneys to old receivables. Other testimonials, however, suggest the misapplication of current cash receipts was not intentional, but due to the Company\u2019s computer system. For example, CW11 attributes the difficulty in matching payments received to corresponding accounts receivable to the lack of \u201can automatic system in place at the corporate North American office\u201d that required matching to be done manually (AC \u00b6\u00b6 52(k), 69-70.) Similarly, CW9 recounts that Adecco was <em>unable </em>to apply customer payments to proper invoices. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(i). These allegations suggest at most poor management, not fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Further, the allegations regarding the confidential witnesses who Plaintiffs relied upon are deficient. There is an absence of allegations indicating how those witnesses possess the knowledge they purport to report. CW1 \u201cis a former Senior Vice President of Adecco North America who later held other higher top executive positions,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 52(a), but there are no averments regarding the nature of that witnesses\u2019 employment or explain how that witness would have obtained the information presented. Similarly, there are no allegations regarding how CW9 and CW11 learned of the information attributed to them. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint fails to properly plead falsity or omissions regarding the improper application of current cash receipts to old accounts receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">C. Violation of Regulation S-K 303</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">The Amended Complaint advances a new theory of liability. In particular, Plaintiffs allege Defendants violated Rule 10b-5 by failing to comply with Item 303 of Regulation S-K. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 147-52. \u201cSK 303 requires a company to include in its SEC filings a discussion of \u2018any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oran v. Stafford, </em>226 F.3d 275, 287 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303(a)(3)(ii)). According to Plaintiffs, Adecco violated SK 303 by failing to disclose: (1) the company had \u201cmaterial internal control weaknesses\u201d in 2000 and 2001; (2) the acquisition of Olsten had caused a pervasive problem with aging receivables in its North American segment; (3) the Company had failed to properly take allowances for doubtful accounts for at least 2000 and 2001 and that no write-off for these receivables was taken until year-end December 31, 2002; and (4) when the Company first announced it was taking a large write-off for its bad debts, the Company failed to disclose the true reason for the write-off. (AC \u00b6 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The Court is unpersuaded. \u201cThe standards for disclosure under section 10(b) differ from the standards for disclosure under 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303.\u201d <em>Wietschner v. Monterey Pasta Co., </em>294 F.Supp.2d 1102, 1118 (N.D.Cal.2003). Consequently, \u201cdemonstration of a violation of the disclosure requirements of Item 303 does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that such disclosure would be required under Rule 10b-5. Such a duty to disclose must be separately shown.\u201d <em>Alfus v. Pyramid Tech. Corp., </em>764 F.Supp. 598, 608 (N.D.Cal.1991); <em>In re Caere Corporate Sec. Litig., </em>837 F.Supp. 1054, 1061 n. 4 (N.D.Cal.1993) (\u201cThe fact that Defendants may or may not have violated Item 303 is irrelevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 10b-5 claims.\u201d); <em>Oran, </em>226 F.3d at 287-88 (quoting Alfus). Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations based on SEC Regulation S-K 303 are insufficient to state a Rule 10b-5 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">D. Remaining Accounting Improprieties</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The Consolidated Complaint alleged Defendants manipulated the Company\u2019s financial statements by: (1) billing customers at incorrect rates; (2) improperly classified its workers; (3) engaged in SUTA dumping; and (4) delayed its payments to vendors. The Court found these allegations deficient because there were no facts regarding what impact these accounting improprieties had on Adecco North America\u2019s revenues or more importantly, Adecco\u2019s consolidated worldwide financial results. <em>Adecco, </em>371 F.Supp.2d at 1215-16. The Amended Complaint reiterates these allegations. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 58, 78-82, 88-89, 141-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The Amended Complaint and Consolidated Complaint contain virtually identical allegations regarding Defendants\u2019 alleged practices of: improperly billing customers at high rates; improperly classifying its workers for compensation purposes and candidates\u2019 marital status and number of dependents; and delaying payment to vendors. <em>(Compare </em>Consolidated Complaint (\u201cCC\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 59-63, 69-70 <em>with </em>AC \u00b6\u00b6 78-82, 88-89.) The only difference is that the Amended Complaint attributes these aver-ments to CW1 and CW6. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 52(f), 78-82, 88-89.) This additional information does not address the deficiencies discussed in this Court\u2019s order dismissing the Consolidated Complaint. There is no information indicating how CW1 and CW6 would have learned about these facts. Further, these confidential witnesses do not provide any allegations quantifying the impact of these alleged improprieties on Adecco North America\u2019s revenues, or more importantly, Adecco\u2019s worldwide year-end financial results for 2000 and 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">The two pleadings are also almost indistinguishable regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 SUTA dumping claim. <em>(Compare </em>CC \u00b6 40 <em>with </em>AC \u00b6 58.) The Amended Complaint does not attribute the allegations to any confidential witnesses, and again fails to plead facts indicating what impact this accounting irregularity had on Adecco North America\u2019s finances or Adecco\u2019s worldwide year-end financial reports for 2000 and 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">In brief, the Amended Complaint does not plead sufficient facts to support a Rule 10b-5 claim based on these miscellaneous accounting improprieties. Like the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations do not allow a court to discern whether the accounting manipulations \u201c \u2018were minor or technical in nature, or whether they constituted widespread and significant inflation of revenue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1017 (quoting <em>McKesson, </em>126 F.Supp.2d at 1273).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">II. <em>Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The PSLRA requires federal securities complaints to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>dants acted with scienter. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). Scienter is defined as \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the PSLRA as requiring plaintiff to \u201cplead, in great detail, facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.\u201d <em>In re Silicon Graphics, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.1999). Recklessness satisfies the scienter requirement only insofar as it reflects some degree of conscious or deliberate misconduct; <em>ie., </em>\u201ca degree of recklessness that strongly suggests actual intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979. In determining whether plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter, courts must consider \u201c \u2018whether the total of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, even though individually lacking, are sufficient to create a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.\u2019 \u201d <em>No. 8U Employer-Teamster Jt. Council Pension Trust Fund v. Am. W. Holding Corp., </em>320 F.3d 920, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Lipton v. Pathogenesis Corp., </em>284 F.3d 1027, 1038 (9th Cir.2002)). When conducting this analysis, the court must consider all reasonable inferences, whether or not favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">A. Scienter Based on Defendants\u2019 Awareness of and Involvement in Accounting Manipulations</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Plaintiffs argue they have adequately pled scienter based on the Defendants\u2019 awareness of and involvement in the accounting manipulations alleged. Although violations of GAAP standards can provide evidence of scienter, <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1016, a failure to follow GAAP, without more, does not establish scienter. <em>DSAM Global Value Fund v. Altris Software, Inc., </em>288 F.3d 385, 390. Rather, plaintiffs must allege that the defendants \u201cknew or must have been aware of the improper revenue recognition\u201d or \u201cintentionally or knowingly falsified the financial statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">According to Plaintiffs, because Defendants were top-ranking officers of the Company, it strains credulity to believe they would not have been aware of the improper accounting alleged in the Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs contend the Ninth Circuit held that defendants\u2019 positions in a company can create a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the defendants would be aware of the falsity of some or all of the statements at issue. (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 13 (quoting <em>In re Read-Rite Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>335 F.3d 843, 848 (9th Cir.2003)). Acknowledging that a \u201creasonable inference\u201d is insufficient under the PSLRA, Plaintiffs maintain that the reasonable inference drawn from Defendants\u2019 positions, compiled with the allegations that Weber was aware of the accounts receivables issues being experienced at Adecco North America and expressed the issue was a major concern for Swiss headquarters, raises a strong inference of scienter. <em>Id. </em>The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">The allegations regarding Weber are virtually unchanged from the Consolidated Complaint that this Court found deficient. Like the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint avers that former Adecco North America CFO Mark Eaton, who regularly communicated with Adecco\u2019s Treasurer Patrick Dobler, who reported directly to Weber, was aware of the problem with Olsten\u2019s receivables at the time of the acquisition and with Adecco\u2019s receivables following the 2000-2001 system conversion. <em>(Compare </em>CC \u00b6 54 <em>with </em>AC \u00b6 66.) That paragraph also alleges Defendant Weber \u201cattended a meeting at the Company\u2019s Melville, New York, North America headquarters, where this problem was discussed as a significant concern for Swiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>headquarters.\u201d <em>(Compare </em>CC \u00b6 54 <em>with </em>AC \u00b6 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The Court finds these allegations still fail to implicate Defendant Weber in the improper application of new cash to old accounts receivables. The Amended Complaint, like the Consolidated Complaint, is vague as to the \u201cproblem\u201d discussed at the meeting. In the context of the paragraph, the \u201cproblem\u201d could be Olsten\u2019s receivables at the time of acquisition and Adec-co\u2019s receivables following the 2000-2001 system conversion. Alternatively, the \u201cproblem\u201d could be in reference to the misapplication of cash receipts. The only difference in the two pleadings is that the Amended Complaint attributes this information to CW11. (AC \u00b6 66.) Significantly, CW11 provides no insight on who attended the meeting or what was said. The absence of these details undermines a strong inference of scienter. Further, there are no allegations indicating how CW11 would know what Mr. Eaton was aware of, or how CW11 would know what was discussed at the undated meeting Weber attended. Thus, these allegations remain too vague and conclusory on which to impute scienter. <em>Cf Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1015 (stating a complaint must describe sources \u201cwith sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The Amended Complaint alleges Defendants were aware of Adecco North America\u2019s receivables problems and improper application of current cash receipts because these problems were \u201cwell known throughout the Company.\u201d (AC \u00b6 66.) According to CW9, \u201c[sjenior Adecco executives routinely discussed\u201d the \u201cpervasive problem\u201d of outstanding and uncollected receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 73. In dismissing the Consolidated Complaint, Court found these allegations to be too vague and conclusory to give rise to a strong inference of scien-ter. <em>Adecco, </em>371 F.Supp.2d at 1218. That one of the statements is attributed to CW9 does not persuade this Court to revisit its conclusion. CW9 is a former Regional Vice President for Adecco Staffing North America. (AC \u00b6 52(i).) There are no allegations regarding that confidential witness\u2019s responsibilities, what interaction, if any, CW9 had with Defendants, or any other information indicating how CW9 would be in a position to know what senior Adecco executives discussed. Further, CW9 provides no details as to <em>what </em>was discussed, or more importantly, that those discussions reflected Defendants acted with the requisite state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Like the Consolidated Complaint, the Amended Complaint relies on internal reports to support Plaintiffs\u2019 theory Defendants were aware of or involved in the alleged accounting manipulations. This Court found the Consolidated Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding internal reports did not give rise to a strong inference of scien-ter because the pleading did not describe how or when any of the individual Defendants received the reports, how the individual Defendants knew the reports contained false information, or the sources of Plaintiffs\u2019 information regarding those reports. <em>Adecco, </em>371 F.Supp.2d at 1218-19. The Amended Complaint contains additional allegations regarding these internal reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">CW1 recalls that Adecco North America\u2019s financial information was transmitted via Excel spreadsheet to Switzerland. (AC \u00b6 52(a).) CW10, a former international financial analyst for Adecco Staffing North America, adds that Defendant Weber maintained an office and spent time at Adecco\u2019s Redwood City, California Office, and that once a month financial information was sent to Redwood City for review. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(j). According to CW5, \u201ccorporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>disseminated monthly operating reports reflecting billing, collections, age trial balance [\u2018ATB\u2019], and NSB\u201d that \u201ccontinually revealed outstanding receivables.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Plaintiffs further allege Adecco North America\u2019s reports regarding aging receivables were inaccurate. According to CW6, a former Area Vice President for Adecco Staffing North America, Adecco\u2019s receivables procedures failed to record and track customers\u2019 payments, erroneously billed customers, and improperly charged interest to branch offices on outstanding receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(f). CW6 states that Adec-co\u2019s corporate offices in Melville, New York prepared a weekly ATB report that tracked the aging for the Company\u2019s outstanding receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52(f), 83. According to CW6, the ATB reports were consistently inaccurate. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 84. CW2, a former office manager and executive recruiter for Adecco similarly states that \u201cflash reports\u201d were consistently inaccurate and had to be submitted multiple times before updated information appeared in the reports. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(b). CW7, a former employee in the Accounts Receivable Department Adecco fabricated monthly reports regarding write-offs of bad receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 87. CW7 also claims he refused to complete a false report regarding the amounts of bad receivables written off by Adecco North America in March 2003. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The allegations that financial information was provided to Defendants via internal reports do not suggest scienter, but rather routine business practice. Thus, that Swiss headquarters received an Excel spreadsheet, and that Weber received financial information at his Redwood office are insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter. There are no details as to the information provided in those reports or more particularly, facts indicating those reports contained information indicating the reserves were too low or uncollectible receivables should have been written earlier before year-end 2002. <em>See Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 985 (holding that a complaint that relies on internal reports must \u201ccontain some specifics from those reports\u201d and facts that indicate their reliability such as who drafted the reports, which officers reviewed them, and their contents).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The allegations that internal reports regarding aging receivables were inaccurate do not compel the conclusion Defendants engaged in fraud when reporting the Company\u2019s performance in 2000 and 2001. There are no averments quantifying the impact, if any of these purportedly inaccurate reports on the Company\u2019s allowance for receivables during the relevant time frame. Similarly, CW7\u2019s statement that he refused to falsify a report in March 2003 does not indicate why Adecco\u2019s 2000 and 2001 year-end financials understated reserves. Further, he does not provide any information regarding the impact of the allegedly fabricated monthly reports on Adecco\u2019s 2000 and 2001 financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The Amended Complaint relies on CW1 and CW8 for its scienter allegations. According to CW1, the reserve was reevaluated monthly at corporate headquarters. (AC \u00b6 63.) Plaintiffs maintain that increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts by tens or hundreds of millions of dollars would have materially impacted the Company\u2019s earnings, and would have revealed that the merger was not what it had been represented to be. <em>Id. </em>According to CW1, other senior managers recognized that a higher reserve would reduce operating profits and bonuses and argued that the reserve should be lowered. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63-64. CW8, a former Senior Regional Vice President of Adecco North America, was told by Southern Division Vice President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Joyce Russell that \u201cAdecco maintained a reserve account to cover the outstanding receivables written off each quarter and that Adecco maintained a \u2018slush fund\u2019 to cover the losses.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 52(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">These allegations also fail to give rise to a strong inference of scienter. That reserves were reevaluated on a monthly basis does not mandate the conclusion the Defendants knew they should have raised their reserves to adequately cover the un-collectible receivables. Further, the fact that senior managers wanted to <em>lower </em>the reserve does not support the inference that reserves were too low during the time frame at issue or that Adecco should have written off the uncollectible receivables before year-end 2002. Finally, the allegation that Adecco \u201cmaintained a reserve account to cover the outstanding receivables written off each quarter and that Adecco maintained a \u2018slush fund\u2019 to cover the losses,\u201d <em>id., </em>does not suggest that during the relevant time frame Adecco failed to adequately reserve for the uncollectible receivables or should have written off those receivables. To the contrary, that statement would suggest Adecco had reserved for uncollectible receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Plaintiffs contend Swiss headquarters was aware of Adecco North America\u2019s receivables problem because Adecco North America suffered from liquidity problems. (Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n at 10.) According to CW11, Adecco North America had cash shortages on a fairly regular basis, meaning that the money coming in was not enough to cover the payments going out. (AC \u00b6 74.) Plaintiffs contend this was mainly due to the uncollected receivables problem. <em>Id. </em>When collections problems led to liquidity shortages, Adecco North America employed three different means of obtaining the cash needed to cover short-term expenses: short-term bank loans, short-term loans from the Company\u2019s Swiss headquarters, and liquidation of investments. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 75. According to Plaintiffs, the fact that Swiss headquarters loaned money to Adec-co North America compels the conclusion Defendants were aware of the problems with the receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">These allegations do not support a strong inference of scienter. Absent from the Amended Complaint are detailed allegations indicating the Defendants made these loans to perpetuate a fraud. Further, the Court does not find as a matter of fact or law that a loan from a parent company to a subsidiary is indicative of accounting malfeasance. One company may need to borrow money from a related company because its business has taken an downturn due to changing market conditions. Simply, that Adecco loaned its North American operations money because the latter suffered from liquidity problems does not lead to the conclusi\u00f3n Defendants were actively engaged in fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The Amended Complaint also relies on events occurring in 2003 to support scien-ter. According to CW1, E &amp; Y raised the Company\u2019s internal control weaknesses relating to North American receivables as early as January 2003, and towards the end of 2003 E &amp; Y informed Defendants it would not sign off on the Company\u2019s year-end financial statements due to the continuing misapplication of new moneys to old receivables. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52(a), 54, 76. Plaintiffs further argue that the $100 million write-off in June 2003 and the $35 million write-off the following year are basically admissions that the earlier allowances for doubtful accounts were not large enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">As discussed above, the Amended Complaint does not allege facts indicating Adecco should have increased its allowance for uncollectible receivables by $100 million in its year-end financial statements for 2000 and 2001. The subsequent write-offs of $100 million in year-end 2002 and addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tional $35 million in year-end 2003 therefore are not corroborative of anything. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on those write-offs constitutes impermissible \u201cfraud by hindsight.\u201d <em>See Ronconi v. Larkin, </em>253 F.3d 423, 430 n. 12 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201c[fjraud by hindsight is not actionable\u201d) (alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 988 (\u201cCongress enacted the PSLRA to put an end to the practice of pleading 'fraud by hindsight.\u2019 \u201d). Similarly, that E &amp; Y raised concerns about Adecco North America\u2019s internal controls in January 2003 does not, by itself, impugn the Defendants\u2019 actions in 2000 and 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In sum, the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations are too vague and conclusory to support a strong inference of scienter based on Defendants\u2019 positions or their purported knowledge of the accounting manipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">B. Scienter Based on Stock Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Unusual or suspicious stock sales can serve as circumstantial evidence of scienter. <em>Ronconi, </em>253 F.3d at 434; <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 986. \u201cBut not every sale of stock by a corporate insider shows that the share price is about to decline.\u201d <em>Ronconi </em>253 F.3d at 435. Accordingly, \u201ccourts have repeatedly held that the mere existence of stock sales does not raise a strong inference of fraudulent intent, [citation] Plaintiffs have the burden at the pleading stage of explaining why the stock sales were unusual or suspicious.\u201d <em>PetSmart, </em>61 F.Supp.2d at 1000; <em>Ronconi, </em>253 F.3d at 435; <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 987. To meet this burden, the plaintiffs must show the trading was in amounts \u201cdramatically out of line with pri- or trading practices, <em>at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.\u201d Ronconi, </em>253 F.3d at 435 (internal quotations omitted). The Ninth Circuit has identified three relevant factors when analyzing insider sales: \u201c \u2018(1) the amount and percentage of shares sold by insiders; (2) the timing of the sales; and (3) whether the sales were consistent with the insider\u2019s prior trading history.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Silicon Graphics, </em>183 F.3d at 986).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The Consolidated Complaint alleged that Defendant Jacobs is the chairman of the Jacobs Family Foundation, a private philanthropic organization with a 100% beneficial interest in KJ Jacobs AG. According to Plaintiffs, during December 2003, KJ Jacobs AG sold approximately 80,000 shares of Adecco common stock and transferred by way of gift over 6 million shares of Adecco common stock. The Court held these allegations were insufficient because the Consolidated Complaint did not allege facts indicating the stock transactions at issue were out of line with prior trading history. <em>Adecco, </em>371 F.Supp.2d at 1221-22. Further, the stock transactions occurred in December 2003, <em>after </em>the Company wrote off uncollectible receivables in its year-end 2002 financial statements, and at a time that is not temporally proximate to the alleged accounting fraud occurring in 2000 and 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 1222.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The Amended Complaint again relies on the December 2003 stock sale by KJ Jacobs AG to support an inference of scienter. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 50, 53.) The pleading has added the allegation that Jacobs caused KJ Jacobs AG to sell $196 million worth of Adecco stock on February 9, 2001. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 50, 53. Plaintiffs contend this sale occurred at approximately the same time Defendant Weber attended a meeting at North American headquarters where the company\u2019s North American receivables were discussed as a major concern for Swiss Headquarters. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 50. The Amended Complaint also alleges that during that time the Company \u201cstarted concealing its uncollectible receivables by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>applying newly received moneys to old receivables.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The additional stock sale, although within the relevant time period, is still insufficient to raise a strong inference of scien-ter. Even assuming Jacobs controlled the disposition of the stock \u2014 a matter disputed by the parties \u2014 there are no allegations he obtained any personal benefit from the transactions pleaded. Further, as with the Consolidated Complaint, there is no information provided indicating the transactions were out of line with prior trading history. Also significant is the absence of any allegations that the other Defendants engaged in insider sales during the Class Period. \u201cOne insider\u2019s well timed sales do not support the \u2018strong inference\u2019 required by the statute where the rest of the equally knowledgeable insiders act in a way inconsistent with the inference that the favorable characterizations of the company\u2019s affairs were known to be false when made.\u201d <em>Ronconi, </em>253 F.3d at 436 (internal footnote omitted); <em>see also Acito, </em>47 F.3d at 54 (holding that one individual defendant\u2019s stock sales did not give rise to a strong inference of scienter when he sold only 11% of holdings and other officers did not sell stock). Accordingly, the Court concludes the Amended Complaint\u2019s aver-ments regarding stock sales do not raise a strong inference of scienter. <em>Cf Lipton, </em>284 F.3d at 1036-37 (finding that one insider\u2019s stock sales did not provide an inference of fraudulent intent was reinforced by the fact he was the only insider to sell stock during the class period); <em>Ronconi, </em>253 F.3d at 436 (holding that one defendant\u2019s trading supported only a weak inference of scienter because the other equally-knowledgeable insiders sold too soon to take advantage of their allegedly fraudulent statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">C. Scienter Allegations In Totality</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">When reviewing whether a complaint properly states a securities fraud claim under the PSLRA, the court must consider \u201c \u2018whether the total of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, even though individually lacking, are sufficient to create a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1022 (quoting <em>Nursing Home, </em>380 F.3d at 1230); <em>Am. West, </em>320 F.3d at 938. When \u201cconsidering whether a strong inference of scienter has been pled, \u2018the court must consider <em>all </em>reasonable inferences to be drawn from the allegations, including inferences unfavorable to the plaintiffs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1022 (quoting <em>Gompper, </em>298 F.3d at 897).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The crux of Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that Defendants overstated revenues by failing to write off or properly reserve for uncol-lectible receivables. However, the Amended Complaint advances seemingly dissonant theories for how this fraud was perpetuated. On the one hand, certain paragraphs suggest the Defendants directed the application of new moneys to old accounts receivable. Other averments indicate the misapplication of current cash receipts to old receivables occurred because of material weaknesses in internal controls. This suggests mismanagement, not fraud. The deficiencies in the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding falsity undermine any inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Further, even if the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations regarding the Defendants\u2019 positions in Adecco were sufficient to raise a reasonable inference of scienter, the Court finds the remaining scienter allegations are insufficient to bolster this inference into a strong inference. The remaining allegations are either too vague and eonclusory, basing the Defendants\u2019 knowledge on Plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the problems were \u201cwell known\u201d and \u201cdiscussed,\u201d or reflected in various internal reports whose contents, authors, recipients, and dates, are not described in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>detail. <em>See Daou, </em>411 F.3d at 1022 (\u201cGeneral allegations of defendants\u2019 \u2018hands-on\u2019 management style, their interaction with other officers and employees, their attendance at meetings, and their receipt of unspecified weekly or monthly reports are insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.\u201d). In addition, that KJ Jacobs AG is the only purported insider who traded stock during the relevant time period negates any inference of scienter. Also undermining a strong inference of scienter is the lack of information indicating any of the confidential witnesses would have been in a position to know what Defendants knew during the relevant time period. Accordingly, taken as a whole, the Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts indicating Defendants knowingly or recklessly made false or misleading statements when reporting the Company\u2019s 2000 and 2001 financial results in SEC filings and press releases, and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">\n<em>\u00a7 20(a) VIOLATION.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Section 20(a) of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act provides for controlling person liability for every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any of the provisions of this title. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). To establish control person liability, a plaintiff must show that a primary violation occurred, and that the defendant exercised actual power or control over the primary violator. <em>Am. W., </em>320 F.3d at 945. Accordingly, because Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 10(b) claim fails, the \u00a7 20(a) claim must be dismissed as well. <em>Heliotrope General, Inc. v. Ford Motor, Co., </em>189 F.3d 971, 978 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">\n<em>LEAVE TO AMEND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Leave to amend a complaint should be freely granted unless amendment would be futile. <em>Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Lipton, </em>284 F.3d at 1039. This Court\u2019s previous order detailed the various deficiencies in the Consolidated Complaint. The Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations are not significantly different, adding only averments regarding confidential witnesses who do not appear to have been in a position to knew the information they purport to report. The Court finds further leave to amend is not warranted under these circumstances. Accordingly, the Amended Complaint will be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs, the record, oral argument, applicable law, and good cause appearing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">1.
