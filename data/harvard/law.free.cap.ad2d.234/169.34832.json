Any damages awarded for such injuries caused by the negligence of the receiver, her agents or her employees would be part of the expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>administration payable out of the receivership funds. Indeed, in settling her account, the receiver noted her exposure and asked that a reasonable sum of money be set aside to cover any possible liability. That such request was denied should not preclude a meritorious claim; however, \" '[l]iability is not synonymous with ability to pay\u2019 and it, therefore, is not a condition of suit that the receiver be in funds to pay it\u201d <em>(supra, </em>at 234).
