The defendants moved for a new trial on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">(1.) Because the court erred in overruling defendants\u2019 motion to continue the case, for the reason that the proceedings did not disclose that there had been any original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>suit in the lower court, and in ruling that, inasmuch as it appeared from the statements of counsel, that all the record in that court is here, that the defendants were present in that court, had pleaded the general issue <em>ore tenus, </em>and went to trial without objection, they had waived all right to object at this stage of the case to the absence of pleadings\u2014the defendant upon said trial having obtained judgment in his favor, from which plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">(2.) Because the verdict was contrary to evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">This motion was made before Judge Tompkins on 22d of June, 1882, and\u00f3n the 26th day of February thereafter was overruled by Judge Roney. No bill of exceptions was prosecuted thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">There had been a garnishment in the suit, which was dissolved by the defendants\u2019 giving bond, with Newberry as security. When the verdict was returned in the superior court, judgment was entered both against the defendants and the security on the bond dissolving the garnishment. At the April term, 1883, of the superior court, the defendants and security on the bond dissolving the garnishment moved to set aside the judgment rendered against them, upon this, among other grounds: that no suit was ever instituted against the defendants in the justice\u2019s court from which an appeal could be taken, no summons having issued and been served upon the defendants, and without this that no garnishment could issue which a'bond could be taken to dissolve; in short, that the entire proceeding was a nullity. This motion was overruled, and from the judgment overruling the same a writ of error was prosecuted to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The record here shows that the grounds taken in this motion were supported by the' facts in the case. A summons, calling the defendants into court to answer the plaintiff\u2019s case, was indispensable to give jurisdiction to the justice\u2019s court. Without it there was no case pending between the parties,\u2014Code, \u00a74139,\u2014and any judgment rendered in its absence is void. $4 <em>Ga., </em>496.
