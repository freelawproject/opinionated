But in the present case, the exception is to the refusal of a motion for new trial made after the close of the term of the trial, on the ground of newly discovered evidence to prove an <em>alibi; </em>and it appears that the testimony was neither in fact newly discovered nor was any diligence used in obtaining it. This courqi will therefore not do a vain thing by reinstating the case.</p><p id=\"b921-12\">Motion to re-instate denied.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
