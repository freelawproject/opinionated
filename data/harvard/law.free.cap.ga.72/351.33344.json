In answer to the rule nisi, the sureties set up the following facts: A. N. West was arrested on a warrant for assault with intent to murder, and Hartley, Hines and Bateman became the sureties on his bond for $200.00 for his appearance at the October term, 1882, of Taylor superior court. After he gave this bond, he was again arrested on another warrant by the sheriff of Taylor county, and for another offense, was bound over therefor, and gave a bond for his appearance at the same term of the court, with James West, his brother, and J. W. Sou ter, his father-in-law, as sureties, who thereupon took him in their charge, and advised, directed and commanded him to flee the country, and leave his bondsmen to their rights under the law, which he did. And further, after these defendants became the sureties of West, the sheriff of the county, by virtue of the warrant above stated, arrested West and took him out of their custody and into his own custody.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqmz\">The rule was made absolute, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-12\">W.

Nor does it matter that the sheriff arrested defendant on a different charge while in their custody as bail under this charge. In contemplation of law, the defendant is always, from the date of the bond, in the custody of his bail, but the bond binds them to produce him for trial. If at the time of the arrest on the last charge, if done in their presence, as their answer to the rule intimates, they had notified the sheriff that they then and there delivered him up, and were responsible no longer on the case in which they were his sureties, then the sheriff would have required other sureties on this charge or put the principal in jail, and these plaintiffs in error would have been discharged; but this was not done, and the naked question decided beforeremains, does the arrest of the principal on a different charge by the sheriff release his sureties for appearance to answer the first charge ?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">That is <em>res adjudicate </em>and must stand as the law of this case. The cases in 27 Ga., 311 ; 51 Id., 158, and 58 Id., 341, do not touch this.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">See West <em>et al. vs. </em>Colquitt, governor, 71 <em>Ga., </em>559.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
