It is incumbent on the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>alleging error to show error, and if he fails to do so, an affirmance will result.</p><p id=\"b922-5\"><em>(a.) </em>There is no copy of the written evidence used on the trial, and this deficiency is, by the statement of the parties agreed on in writing here, attributed solely tothe[defendant\u2019s counsel, who was absent when the motion was perfected and heard. No satisfactory reason is given for his absence, but in consequence of- his failure to attend, none of the questions made by the bill of exceptions were presented to and passed upon by the presiding judge at the hearing of the motion. This court has no jurisdiction to consider anything except the rulings, decisions and charges of the court \u25a0 below, nor can it determine an agreed case made up and brought here solely by parties or their counsel.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
