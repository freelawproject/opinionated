Rwy., </em>determined at the present term of court. Our special legislation as to the taxation of railroads virtually excludes counties arid municipal corporations from levying a tax upon them and the appurtenances-necessary to maintain and operate them, for county and municipal purposes, by making no provision for levying and collecting suchi tax.
