At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss upon the ground that the letter was not an absolute guaranty, but a \u25a0-conditional one, or mere promise to guaranty upon a condition, which condition bad never been fulfilled by plaintiff; and also upon the ground that the plaintiff had failed to give legal proof of the defendant\u2019s handwriting.

The instrument under consideration states, in effect: \u201cI will be guarantor for everything sold up to the present time. Hereafter I propose to be the purchaser of these .goods; and as to future goods, if you will invoice them to me, I will be responsible, and send you a check when due.\u201d The court of appeals has decided in Henry McShane Co. v. Padian, 142 N. Y. 207, 36 N. E. 880, that a guarantor may not be made liable, by a forced construction of the language of the guaranty, for that which lie did not undertake, but that the apparent meaning of the words used determines the extent of the liability. We think the judgment = should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
