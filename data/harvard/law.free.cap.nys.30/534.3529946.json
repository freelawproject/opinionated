Plaintiff obtained a verdict, on the ground that his injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant, and from the judgment entered thereon, and the order denying motion for a new trial, this appeal is taken. The learned counsel for the appellant alleges for ground of reversal certain erroneous rulings of the trial judge, which we will proceed to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The first ground of error alleged is the admission of the following question, put during the cross-examination of the motorman of the car in question. The witness was being cross-examined as to the number of the various appliances for stopping the car, and the following question was put by plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cQ. On the front platform of this car, do you mean to say that the instrument [one for sanding the track] wasn\u2019t there? A. I didn\u2019t use it if it was there. I can\u2019t say it was or it wasn\u2019t. Q. If it were there, then-there would be six instruments for the motorman to handle in case of a rapid stopping of the car, wouldn\u2019t there?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">This question was objected to, and an exception was taken to its-admission, and the witness answered in the affirmative. We fail to see the slightest force in this exception, or how it could affect the result. The number of appliances for stopping the car was certainly a proper subject for cross-examination. The witness, in his answer just previous to the question excepted to, said that he did not know if the sanding instrument was on his car. Non. constat but that counsel intended to prove by some other witness\u2019 that it was there. How, then, could defendant\u2019s case be affected by the witness\u2019 admission that, if it was there, it would, with the other appliances he had already enumerated, make six in all to handle in order to stop the car quickly? Even if it was erroneous to allow the question, it must appear that it would have a tendency to excite the passions, arouse the prejudice, awaken the sympathies, or warp or influence the jury, to make its admission constitute-error. Anderson v. Railroad Co., 54 N. Y. 334. That the admission of this question could not affect the result we are bound to conclude from the fact that the witness had already testified fully on-this subject of the sanding machine, as appears by the following' questions and answers, at folio 249:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201cQ. Aren\u2019t you, as a motorman, called on to sand the track? A. Not always; no, sir. There is an instrument for sanding the track. It is on the car. It is on all the cars. It is underneath the seat at each end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>And again, at folio 251, and immediately preceding the question objected to, the witness testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\">\u201cQ. Now, we have got five instruments for the single motorman to use, all of which come in play when it is desirable to make a sudden stop of the car, haven\u2019t we? A. In case we have a train like I had that morning, yes, sir. Q. You started, I think, in your examination, with only two of them? A. To stop a car, but there is\u2014 Q. There seem to be five at least. Now, how about the sand? That would make a sixth one, wouldn\u2019t at? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">That exception is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Further ground of error is alleged in the exclusion of a question put to the witness Inman, who was called on the part of the defendant. He had testified that he saw the accident; that, when he first saw the horses attached to the beer wagon, they were walking on an ordinary walk; that, when the leaders got near the cross walk of Second avenue, the driver jerked his lines, applied his whip, and started his horses ahead; and that at that time the train was between 50 and 70 feet from Forty-Second street. He also testified that he \u201chad had a great deal of experience with the operation of driving trucks and horses.\u201d Then the following question was put:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cQ. Now, If the driver of that beer wagon had not whipped up his horses, .starting them ahead, as he did, when that train was within fifty or seventy feet of it, would there have been plenty of time for that team to have -passed in safety? (Objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.) The Court: That 3s a conclusion. Defendant\u2019s counsel: I will take an exception. The Court: Yes, and I state to you that you can ask him what extra speed he put on, .\u2022and how far he went, but not his general conclusion. I will allow you to -ask every element from which the witness can infer the conclusion that .you ask. Defendant\u2019s counsel: I take an exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Plainly, this was an attempt on the part of the learned counsel for the appellant to get the opinion of the witness as an expert truck driver before the jury. \"We do not think that this was such .\u2022a case or situation as to render expert testimony admissible. On. the contrary, it was one where, with all the facts and circumstances before them, the jury were just as competent to answer the question for themselves as to rely on the opinion of the witness, be he ever :so expert or experienced a driver. The court, as above shown, -tendered counsel an opportunity to prove all the facts, all the elements from which a correct conclusion might be drawn by the jury, and that was all that the defendant was entitled to. As was said in Ferguson v. Hubbell, 97 N. Y. 507, at page 513:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cWhere the facts can be placed before a jury, and they are of such a .-nature that jurors generally are just as competent to form opinions in reference to them and draw inferences from them as witnesses, then there is no occasion to resort to expert or opinion evidence. To require the ex-clusi\u00f3n of such evidence, it is not needed that the jurors should be able to see the facts as they appear to eyewitnesses, or to be as capable to draw, -conclusions from them as some witnesses might be, but it is sufficient that the facts can be presented in such a manner that jurors of ordinary intelligence and experience in the affairs of life can appreciate them, can base intelligent judgments upon them, and comprehend them sufficiently for the -ordinary administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>No one of the cases cited in appellant\u2019s brief sustains the position taken by the learned counsel for the appellant that the exclusion of the question was erroneous. We might go further, and sustain the exclusion of the question, on the ground that the witness was not fully qualified as an expert to answer it. A proper answer involved not alone experience in driving horses, but also some knowledge as to the speed of trolley cars and the ability of the witness to judge as to how rapidly the car was moving. On this latter point, he was not shown to possess any expert knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is further contended that the learned trial judge should have charged the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s counsel: I ask your honor to charge the jury that there can in no view of the case be any recovery in this case by the plaintiff for loss of wages or earnings subsequent to the 1st day of January, 1893.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">To this request the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cI think I will decline to charge that, and leave to the recollection of the jury the question of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel took an exception, whereupon the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cIf you call my attention to special parts of the evidence, I will have it read to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">We do not think that this exception was well taken, in view of the fact that the decision of the point coveFed by the request was left to the jury to determine, on its recollection of the evidence, and that, coupled therewith, the learned trial judge offered to have read to the jury any special parts of the evidence relevant to the question to which defendant\u2019s counsel might call attention. The trial of this cause was begun on the morning of February 7, 1894, and was not concluded till the 9th. Some 20 witnesses were examined on the trial, and the testimony in the case on appeal covers 114 pages. It is unreasonable to assume or expect that, after such a protracted trial, the court should be able to recall at once the evidence on each particular point involved, and be prepared to say exactly what the evidence was thereon. The course of the learned trial judge in declining to charge the request as a matter of law, and in leaving it to the recollection of the jury to determine on the evidence, together with the offer to have read to the jury any special parts of the evidence to which defendant\u2019s counsel might call his attention, was eminently fair to the defendant, and we fail to see how this disposition of the request could be in any respect prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">It is further contended that the learned trial judge erred in refusing to charge the following requests by defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-14\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that the testimony of the plaintiff as to whether his knee was cracked shall be disregarded, in the light of the testimony of Dr. Speir, Dr. Malone, and Dr. Fowler in this case. (Refused and exception.) I ask your honor to charge the jury now that in no view of the evidence can there be any recovery in this case on account of any cracked or fractured kneepan. (Refused and exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Immediately previous to the putting of the first of the above requests, a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to his injuries was read from the stenographer\u2019s minutes, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cThe dashboard turned back, and the pin that the bar handle goes onto damaged my left knee; that is, made an incised wound in the left knee. Q. Is that the knee in which you are still lame? A. Yes, sir. Q. How deep did it puncture the knee? Do you know? Didn\u2019t it pierce through the knee? A. It. pierced right through the cap; yes, sir. Q. You don\u2019t know how deep it was? A. No, sir; I can\u2019t say how deep. Q. Was your knee affected? A. It was slightly cracked. Q. The kneepan? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Dr. Speir, one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, testified that plaintiff had an injury over the right knee; that the left knee had a punctured wound over the patella or kneecap, and that it had penetrated in a way which produced an inflammation of the lining membrane of the kneejoint; that the patella was not fractured in either knee. Dr. Malone, another of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, testified that when he first saw plaintiff, over two weeks after the accident, he \u201chad an injury to both knees. There was a wound over the patella of the right knee, and a scar over the patella of the left knee.\u201d And both Drs. Speir and Malone testified that the injury to the left knee developed synovitis. We think that with this evidence before the jury, coupled with that of Dr. Fowler, the expert witness on the part of the defendant, it was not the duty of the court to direct the jury to disregard plaintiff\u2019s testimony in any particular. All of the evidence was before the jury. It was their duty to carefully weigh it all, to reconcile, if they could, apparent discrepancies, and to determine the facts. We can readily see how the plaintiff might have used the word \u201ccracked\u201d in the sense of \u201cpunctured\u201d in describing the injury to his kneepan, and believe that he was testifying truly. Defendant was not, in our opinion, in any manner prejudiced by the refusals to charge as requested, as the court had already charged,, in response to a previous request of defendant\u2019s counsel, that there was \u201cno evidence that plaintiff\u2019s kneecap or kneepan was fractured, as claimed by plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his summing up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In the course of the discussion arising out of the last-mentioned request, the learned trial judge incidentally said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cAs I understand, the testimony is that both of his kneecaps were punctured. That would be a fracture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">To this remark counsel for the defendant excepted, whereupon the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cThat is as I understand the evidence; but, if that is not the evidence,. I ask the jury to disregard entirely what I say upon the subject. If counsel will call my attention to that particular part of the evidence, I will have it read to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Even if we were convinced that the remark of the trial judge was erroneous, and afforded ground for. a valid exception, such error was effectually cured by the direction to the jury to disregard entirely what the trial judge had said, and the offer to have read the particular part of the evidence bearing on the question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>We do not, however, desire to be understood as holding that the-remark of the trial judge constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment and order denying, motion for a new trial should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
