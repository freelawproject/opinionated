The judgment demanded is that defendants be compelled to execute the written agreement, or that plaintiff have damages awarded him. It is quite evident from the allegations of the complaint that plaintiff has no interest in the land; his interest is in the profits expected to be realized upon a sale, nothing appears showing that defendants are bound to sell at any specified time, or that there shall be profits when sold, or that they do anything more than to refuse to recognize plaintiff\u2019s claim to a writing and repudiate his interest in profits. If the writing be executed, it would only evidence plaintiff\u2019s right to profits, if any were ever made, and if there was a failure to pay the profits, on a sale, plaintiff would have his action at law for damages, which would afford him complete relief. Under such circumstances, plaintiff cannot invoke the equitable aid of the court. Slauson v. Watkins, 86 N. Y. 602; Cushman v. Jewelry Co., 76 N. Y. 370. It is quite possible that plaintiff can make a case entitling him to an order of examination for the purpose of perpetuating testimony, even though his cause of action be not at the time perfect. Bank v. Sheehan, 101 N. Y. 176, 4 N. E. 333; Town of Venice v. Woodruff, 62 N. Y. 468; In re Ketchum, 60 How. Pr. 154. But he shows no ground for the maintenance of this action. The demurrer should be sustained, and judgment ordered for defendants, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
