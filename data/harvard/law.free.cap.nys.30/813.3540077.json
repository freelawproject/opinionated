Percy Morgan to recover the value of property stored with said warehouse company in April, 1891. The theory of the action is that the warehouse company, after the bailment, and about July 1, 1892, surrendered possession of the warehouse where the goods were stored, together with the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>sion of said goods, to the defendant D. Percy Morgan, who at the time of the loss was in possession of the warehouse and property, the complaint so alleging. Both defendants answered the complaint, and at the trial the jury rendered a verdict against the defendant Morgan for $325, the foreman saying in answer to a question that the jury had not taken into account the People\u2019s Cold-Storage &amp; Warehouse Company. After the trial of the action, which was held on February 15, 1893, the defendants moved, upon notice of motion, to set aside the verdict as irregular, or to dismiss the complaint as against the People\u2019s Cold-Storage &amp; Warehouse Company, and this motion was properly denied. The defendants were severally and not jointly liable, each being responsible for any injury occurring while in possession and control of the property, so that there was no irregularity in the verdict as against Morgan. The judge could not, seven days after the trial was concluded, dismiss the complaint as to the other defendant, although he might have done so at the trial. For these reasons we think the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
