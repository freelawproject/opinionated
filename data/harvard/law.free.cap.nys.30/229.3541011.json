A claim for the value of certain printing was also made as a second cause of action. Defendant pleaded a general denial as to the first cause of action, and set up, as a further defense, the allegation that the contract for the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>vertising in question was .made with one Tongue, and that payment was agreed to be accepted by the latter in the form of clothing furnished by defendant, a tailor. To the second cause of action the answer was a general denial. The justice gave judgment for the plaintiff upon the second cause of action, and found in favor of defendant upon the first.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b250-5\">Argued before BOOKSTAVER and BISCHOFF, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\">C.

A bill for clothing was sent in accordance, with the agreement as alleged by defendant, wherein credit for the agreed price of the work was given. The printing work, which was the subject of the second cause of action, having been furnished by plaintiff through negotiations had with Tongue in manner similar to those which took place as to the advertising, and with the same provision for payment \u201cin trade,\u201d the finding in favor of plaintiff upon that issue establishes the fact that Tongue\u2019s arrangement for individual payment in clothing furnished was held by the justice to in no way affect the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, and it appears from the defendant\u2019s testimony that the said Tongue was understood to be acting for the plaintiff corporation. Moreover, it appears from a letter sent by defendant to plaintiff shortly before suit was brought, and received in evidence, that the former reaffirmed his subsequent acceptance of the \u2022contract as performed by expressing his reliance upon the bill for clothing above referred to, with the credit for advertising work, \u2022and threatening to sue plaintiff for the balance due thereon. Upon \u2022the record, the determination of the justice upon the several issues -presents an inconsistency which would require a reversal of the \u00a1judgment, and, in this connection, a new trial of all the issues must be ordered.
