An order was made, directing defendant to pay plaintiff\u2019s judgment out of his salary, and defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-11\">The opinion of HEWBHRG-ER, J., at special term, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1q\">This is an application that defendant apply part of his salary to the payment of plaintiff\u2019s judgment. It appears that the defendant is in receipt of a salary of $500 a month, but claims that he uses the same for the support of his family. He is a widower, and has one son, 26 years of age, who is married, and does not live with the defendant. Section 2463 of the Code exempts the earnings of the judgment debtor for his personal services, when it appears that those earnings are necessary for the use of a family wholly or partly supported by his labor. It is also claimed by the defendant that he supports two orphan nieces. I know of no legal obligation on the part of the defendant to support them, and therefore it is not within the exemption provided for in the Code. As the defendant claims to expend but $150 for the support of his son, there remains sufficient to pay plaintiff\u2019s claim herein. Let an order be made, directing the defendant to pay plaintiff\u2019s judgment out of the salary due him for the month of May.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b229-12\">Argued before FITZSIMOHS and CCXNLAH, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-13\">Philip Carpenter, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-14\">Joseph A.
