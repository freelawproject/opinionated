Apart, however, from this, we think that the affidavits upon which the motion itself was based are clearly insufficient, within the case of Thurfjell v. Witherbee, 70 Hun, 401, 402, 24 N. Y. Supp. 278, wherein it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-15\">\u201cAffidavits to change the place of trial, which state that the moving party can prove material facts by the persons named, are held to be sufficient; but affidavits stating that the moving party \u2018expects\u2019 to prove such facts are insufficient, unless the affidavits disclose grounds showing that the facts can probably be established by the persons designated. This may be done by positive averments made by the party, or by affidavits of the proposed witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
