This was error, for at most a plaintiff can only be nonsuited at the close of his case, and may thereafter bring a new action for the same cause, first paying the costs of the action in which he was nonsuited; but not so if the judgment is upon a verdict of the jury, for such judgment is a bar to a subsequent action for the same cause. The plaintiffs\u2019 proof shows that their salesman called at defendant\u2019s saloon at a time when defendant was in charge of his saloon, and took an order for a barrel of whisky for defendant from one Helmuth, then dealing with such salesman as buyer for defendant, and that Helmuth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>was also defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, at a salary of $10 per week. The plaintiffs made proper effort to prove delivery of this barrel of whisky to defendant, by showing by their salesman that he had subsequently seen the same in defendant\u2019s saloon, but, on defendant\u2019s objection, were not allowed to do so, and to all of which plaintiffs excepted. The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
