The lease expired in May, 1892, and the premises had become dilapidated. Plaintiffs gave the key to defendant for the purpose, as they state, of showing the premises to persons wishing to hire or purchase, but, as the defendant contends, so that he might renovate the premises, and make them presentable to a tenant, and thus induce a hiring after May 1, 1892. The jury, as juries often do in cases of this character, rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for six cents, and this the trial judge set aside as inadequate. There was no forcible entry by the defendant, no eviction, and no forcible keeping out of the plaintiffs. The most that can be said is that the defendant exceeded his license, and put the premises in good order and condition. This act of the defendant resulted in no injury to the plaintiffs. Indeed, it tended to make the premises more valuable to them; for they had a right to use them, improvements and all, to the 1st of May, 1892, and they were not excluded from the exercise of this right by any act of the defendant. The damages being unliquidated, and the trespass of a trifling rather than of a substantial character, the jury had the right to fix the amount at six cents,\u2014a result quite common in actions of this kind. See Wayle v. Wayle, 9 Hun, 125; Toomey v. Railroad Co., 2 Misc. Rep., at pages 84, 85, 21 N. Y. Supp. 448. For these reasons the order granting a new trial must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
