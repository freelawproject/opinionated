There is also submitted an appeal from an order in the same action, made at the same time, granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to discontinue the action as to said appealing defendants. The two appeals were argued together. There can be no object, therefore, in passing upon the question submitted to us on this appeal. The defendants have ceased to be parties to the action. Should we conclude to reverse the order, the plaintiffs cannot be compelled to serve a reply. The only effect of a decision would be to obtain the opinion of this court upon the legal questions involved. Appellate courts have uniformly refused to pass upon \u201cmere abstract questions, from the determination of which no practical result can follow.\u201d People v. Common Council of Troy, 82 N. Y. 575; Assurance Co. v. Smith (Sup.) 16 N. Y. Supp. 114 Appeal dismissed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
