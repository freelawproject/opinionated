The answer of the defendant Bouse is a general denial, and alleges that the bill of sale was given for a valuable consideration, and in good faith. 'The answer of the defendant Hurwitz is, in substance, a general denial. On the trial, both at the opening as well as at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action should have been brought in equity to set aside the bill of sale from the defendant Hurwitz to Bouse, and not In law, as this action is brought, which motions were denied and exceptions duly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">We think the trial justice properly denied the motions, and correctly stated the law in his charge to the jury. See Quinby v. Straus, 90 N. Y. 664. The case of Braem v. Bank, 127 N. Y. 509, 28 N. E. 597, to which the appellants\u2019 counsel has referred, has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>application to this case. In that case the plaintiff recovered a judgment against a manufacturing company. On the same day the defendant obtained a judgment against the same company upon an offer and acceptance. In an action against the defendant for damages for fraud in obtaining the judgment, the court properly held that it was a subject of equitable jurisdiction as to who was entitled to the fund arising from the sale under the several executions. In this case no such question arises. We think, therefore, that the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
