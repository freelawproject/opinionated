The plaintiff performed services until June 29, 1886, when he was \"\u2018relieved from duty.\u201d He received pay till June 30, 1886, which included all services actually rendered. The action is to recover the stipulated compensation from that time, on the legal Action that, although he performed no services and had no duties, he was never actually discharged from the place, hence his right to pay continued to run ad infinitum; and this claim is based upon the cases of Gregory v. Mayor, etc., 113 N. Y. 416, 21 N. E. 119, and Emmitt v. City of New York, 128 N. Y. 117, 28 N. E. 19. Those decisions have certainly invited much litigation, but the principles decided thereby were never intended to embrace the horde of claims which have been made under them. The plaintiff alleges in his complaint and proved at the trial that he was relieved from duty, which impliedly assumes that he was legally so relieved, and the term \u201crelieved from duty,\u201d as applied to the character of his employment, is tantamount to \u201cdischarge,\u201d for it meant that, and nothing less. The right to pay in such an employment is inseparable from duty, and, when the plaintiff was relieved from the exercise of the earning power, he was effectually discharged from the service altogether. Web. Diet. He acted on this assumption when he sought a civil-service examination for a position on the police force, for in his written application he described his previous employment as \u201cguard, etc.,\u201d and gave, as the cause of \u201cleaving,\u201d \u201crelieved from duty.\u201d It was never intended by any adjudicated case to hold that persons in subordinate employments, like that of the plaintiff's, should, after being relieved from duty, recover from the municipality pay as upon full performance of service, nor is there any legal warrant for any such interpretation of the law. The rule (to which there are not many exceptions) is \u201cno work, no pay,\u201d founded on the just principle that the one is a just equivalent for the other. The conclusion reached is in accord with the rulings in Gore v. Mayor, etc. (Super. Ct. N. Y.) infra, and Kelly v. Same (Sup.) 24 N. Y. Supp. 1, in both of which cases the right of recovery was denied, though the claims were entitled to as much, if not more, consideration than the one .in suit. It follows that there must be judgment for the defendant.
