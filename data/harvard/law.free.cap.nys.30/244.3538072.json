The plaintiff\u2019s assignor testified to the defendant\u2019s direct request for the services, while the defendant, with equal positiveness, denied that any such request was made; and furthermore the defendant\u2019s husband, called as a witness for defendant, testified in effect that the services were rendered upon his retainer, and upon his promise to pay therefor. This conflict it was the special province of the justice below to determine, and with such determination upon the facts\u2014in this case, favorably to the defendant\u2014the appellate court is not to interfere,, in the absence of a palpable perversion of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">In part, the services in suit consisted of the investigation of the-vendor\u2019s title to a certain steamboat purchased by the defendant\u2019s: husband, and the preparation of a mortgage of such property to the defendant, she having advanced her husband part of the purchase money. With a view of demonstrating the worthlessness of the services rendered by plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the defendant was permitted, against the objection .and .exception of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, upon cross-examination of the plaintiff\u2019s witness Cohn, to elicit the fact that she had sustained a loss of $8,000 by reason of her investment in this mortgage; there being no pretense that the-loss was occasioned by neglect .or want of skill on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor in the performance of the services above particularized, and it being conceded that the loss was wholly owing to the precarious character of the security,\u2014the federal laws giving preference, in the payment of claims out of the proceeds of the sales of vessels, to such liabilities as were incurred in navigation. A solicitor or attorney at law is under no duty to dissuade his client from entering upon a contemplated business venture. Having concern for the latter\u2019s prosperity, the former may tender his advice in that regard, but if he fails so to do he is not chargeable with neglect. The special skill which the solicitor or attorney engages himself to exert in his client\u2019s behalf is such as is peculiar to his profession; but the relation of solicitor (or attorney) and -client imposes upon the former no duty, as to an exercise of sagacity in business ventures, superior to that of the latter. An attorney at law or solicitor?, therefore, who has not assumed personally to invest his client\u2019s moneys, and who is -called upon only to lend his professional aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>for the purpose of carrying his client\u2019s proposed venture into effect, by investigation of the title to the property or security constituting the subject-matter of the proposed investment, and the preparation of the necessary legal documents, assumes no responsibility for loss which may come from the client\u2019s ill venture. Weeks, Attys. at Law, \u00a7\u00a7 304, 311. Hence, the attorney or solicitor is not chargeable with neglect or want of skill because he has failed to advise his client against the venture, nor can the fact of the loss in any de- ' gree affect the value of the former\u2019s services. For the error pointed out the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
