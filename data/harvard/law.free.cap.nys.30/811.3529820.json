The plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>stamped on the face of the shipping receipt the words \u201cRefrigerator car.\u201d The defendant\u2019s receiving clerk canceled the words \u201cRefrigerator car,\u201d and stamped on the face of the receipt the words, \u201cNot to be loaded in refrigerator car,\u201d and signed it. The lemons were put in the ordinary box cars, and thereby became frosted, frozen, and greatly deteriorated in value. On the date of shipment the testimony showed the weather was very cold, the temperature ranging from 28 to 19 deg. The plaintiff and a number of fruit dealers testified that it would not be safe or prudent to load or transport in a box car lemons, when the temperature was below freezing point, for transportation from New York to Pittsburgh. The trial justice submitted the question of negligence to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and upon the judgment entered upon such verdict, and the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The trial justice properly submitted the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury to determine. The mere fact that the shipping clerk had erased the words \u201cRefrigerator car\u201d did not operate to exempt the defendant from liability for loss occasioned by its own negligence. The defendant was bound to exercise ordinary care in the shipment and transportation of the fruit. The testimony clearly showed that the defendant was guilty of negligence in shipping the fruit in the manner it did, and as this is the only question raised on the appeal the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
