It appears from the testimony that the horse, for the agreed price of which this suit is brought, was sent to defendants for trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>contemplation of purchase; that defendants\u2019 managing agent,, through whom the whole transaction was conducted, subsequently expressed himself to plaintiff as satisfied with the animal, except that it was \u201coff its feed,\u201d and that he would accept it at the price-asked should it regain its health in that regard. Plaintiff testified that, after this, he held a conversation with the agent over the telephone, and that the latter then stated that the horse was working all right, and was no longer off its feed. The above might well be taken as sufficient evidence to establish a sale of the animal, but, upon the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, there is no doubt that the facts stated formed the only basis for a verdict against the defendants. The justice, however, submitted the case to the jury upon the hypothesis that the evidence would justify a finding that a sale took place when the animal was delivered, whereas the evidence shows clearly and without contradiction that this delivery was purely for the purposes of trial. Thus, under the charge, the jury could have reached their verdict while giving credit to the defendants\u2019 agent\u2019s direct contradiction of plaintiff\u2019s testimony with regard to the conversation over the telephone, and yet this conversation was the only basis for a finding that the minds of the parties had met. We cannot hold that this error was cured by the charging of defendants\u2019 requests to charge to the effect that \u201cthe minds of the parties must have met to constitute a sale,\u201d or \u201cthat the delivery was as consistent with a delivery for trial as with delivery after sale,\u201d for this still left unavoided the elements of objection above referred to. For can the subsequent consent of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the court charge, in effect, that the delivery was for trial only, alter the question. The court did not so charge, and the case went to the jury with the erroneous instruction unchanged. Appellants\u2019 exceptions to the charge in this regard present error, which requires a reversal of the judgment. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
