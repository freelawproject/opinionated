The only question for our consideration is whether the court erred in refusing to charge at defendant\u2019s request that \u201cif the plaintiff commenced the altercation, and in the course of it addressed indecent and insulting language to the conductor, and language such as was calculated or likely to produce an assault, the verdict must be for defendant.\u201d Assuming that this is a sound statement of law under the authority of the prevailing opinion in Scott v. Railroad Co., 53 Hun, 414, 6 N. Y. Supp. 382, it seems to us that the court charged so much thereof as was applicable to the facts in this case. The plaintiff testified that the conductor, after he had paid his fare, demanded of him, at several different times, the payment of the same, and without provocation, save his refusal to pay his fare a second time, that the conductor clubbed him severely. The conductor testified that\" at different times he demanded the fare, which was not paid, and that plaintiff, while standing on the platform, used abusive language to him, after which he stepped from that platform to the platform of the adjoining car, when the plaintiff drew an iron wrench out of his pocket, and struck at him; that he then took his eight-inch stick out of his pocket, and struck the plaintiff. It is manifest from this testimony, if the conductor is to be believed, that this assault on plaintiff was not provoked by any insulting words, but by the threatened assault upon Mm by plaintiff with the wrench. The court charged that if plaintiff assaulted or threatened to assault the conductor, the latter was justified in assaulting plaintiff. This testimony of the conductor is the only evidence that, before he assaulted the plaintiff, the lattter used insulting language, or threatened to assault the conductor. After examining the testimony, we see no reason to disturb the verdict. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
