Hayes against James P. Bainbridge. Plaintiff\u2019s motion to frame issues raised by defendant\u2019s counterclaim to be tried by jury was denied, and plaintiff appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">The opinion of Mr. Justice RTJMSEY at special term is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKD\">The complaint sets up the giving of the note and the chattel mortgage, and the payment of usury, and prays judgment that both be declared void. The answer sets up the same things, except the usury, which it denies, and_ prays judgment by way of enforcing the two papers. The facts set up in the complaint and in the answer are precisely the same, and the causes of action in the two pleadings are not separate and distinct. When the defendants have answered the plaintiff\u2019s proof, they have exhausted the evidence to prove their counterclaim; and they can make no proof upon it, except what they offer to disprove the plaintiff\u2019s case, because both claims are settled when the plaintiff\u2019s case lias been decided. The case is therefore within Cook v. Jenkins, 79 N. Y. 575. No reason appears why the court should exercise its discretion by sending the case to a jury for trial. Motion denied, with \u00a710 costs, to abide event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b169-6\">Argued before DWIGHT, P.
