A judgment for $2,803.27 was rendered in favor of plaintiff, and both parties appealed. The judgment was affirmed on plaintiff\u2019s appeal, but was reversed on defendant\u2019s appeal. 29 N. Y. Supp. 698. Plaintiff now moves to resettle the order of the general term. Denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-11\">The plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendant after a trial had before a referee, and both parties appealed; plaintiff, on the ground that the referee should have awarded $4,914.62 instead of $2,803.27, the sum allowed, and defendant on the ground that even the reduced sum was an excessive recovery. The court determined (1) on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal that the judgment was not inadequate, and disposed of such appeal by affirming the judgment as against the plaintiff; (2) it determined on the defendant\u2019s appeal that the judgment was excessive, and that it must be reversed, and a new trial had, unless the plaintiff stipulated to reduce the recovery from $2,803.27 to $1,370.42, in which case the judgment for that amount would be affirmed. Proper provision was also made as to the costs upon the two appeals. The plaintiff agreed upon the form of the general term order. Plaintiff, however, declined to stipulate to reduce the recovery, so that one judgment was entered on the order, affirming the judgment on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, but awarding a new trial on the defendant\u2019s appeal. 29 N. Y. Supp. 698. The plaintiff now moves to resettle the order by having it contain the simple award of a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b564-12\">Argued before FREEDMAN, McADAM, and GTLDERSLEEVE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-13\">Gr.

Code, \u00a7 1294. Such a right was sustained in Monnot v. Merz (Super. N. Y.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 380, affirmed by court of appeals 131 N. Y. 646, 30 N. E. 866. In that case, as in this, the defendant claimed that, notwithstanding a deduction made in the plaintiff\u2019s demand by the referee, the judgment was still excessive. The court of appeals made a further deduction on the defendant\u2019s appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>plaintiff also appealed from the same judgment, on the ground that certain other deductions allowed by the referee from the plaintiff\u2019s claim should have been disallowed. An application to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was denied. 17 N. Y. Supp. 380, supra. The appeals were heard separately, and the plaintiff succeeded upon his appeal in this court (18 Y. Y. Supp. 780), and in the court of appeals as well (138 N. Y. 673, 34 N. E. 515). In. the case cited, as in the one under review, there were double appeals, and the court was called upon to hear each, and to render-appropriate judgments upon both. See, also, Genet v. Davenport, 60 Y. Y. 194. The judgment directed by the referee in this case, as in those cited, was founded upon items easily distinguishable and separable, so that the general term could readily determine which constituted liabilities against the defendant, and which were not of an enforceable character, that final judgment might be rendered thereon. The order sought to be resettled declares the judgment rendered by the general term upon both appeals, and it could not have been well expressed in any other form. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is that, as a new trial was ordered as to part of the-plaintiff\u2019s demand, it should have been so directed as to all; and. Goodsell v. Telegraph Co., 109 N. Y. 147, 16 N. E. 324, is cited to-sustain Ms contention. It will be found on examination that in that case, as well as in the authorities therein cited, there was but one appeal taken from the original judgment; and it was held that upon such an appeal there could not be a new trial as to part of an entire demand, and an affirmance as to the residue, leaving a fragmentary part to be tried in the court below, and the residue to go-to the court of appeals. But the principle decided there does not reach the question in the form in which it arises here, nor has any reported case been called to our attention which holds that upon double appeals, such as were taken in this instance, the court cannot dispose of both by rendering such judgments thereon, by way of affirmance, reversal, or modification, as the nature of the case and justice require. For these reasons the motion to resettle the-order must be denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
