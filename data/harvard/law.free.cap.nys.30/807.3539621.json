The defendant claimed that he should have hired, under his agreement, two assistants, for $40 per month, leaving him a balance of $60 for his services. This issue of fact was submitted to the jury, and they decided in favor of the plaintiff, which finding, we find, is amply sustained by the testimony. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that he was not paid for a month\u2019s services, and that he hired an extra boy, to whom he paid $81; but he only claimed $145, for which a verdict was rendered in his favor. Although the complaint was for services rendered, and the testimony showed that for that claim the plaintiff was only entitled to $80, yet testimony was admitted, without objection, showing that plaintiff had expended $81 for the extra boy\u2019s hire. The trial justice had a right, therefore, to amend the pleadings so as to conform to the proof, and he committed no error in so doing. The entire evidence, taken together, shows the usual contradictions; the plaintiff contradicting the defendant, and vice versa. It was therefore the duty of the jury to select the side which they credited. They did so, by believing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and decided accordingly. We find no error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
