A recovery of $214.83, the amount of the note and protest fees, together with two months\u2019 interest, or of such amount less $175, the value of a ring claimed by defendants to have been accepted by plaintiff in part payment, alone could find support upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the record. The award of $125.99 is not secundum allegata et probata, and forms no guide whereby this court may find the true intention of the justice\u2019s decision. The action must therefore be sent back for a new. trial, as in Fuld v. Kahn, 4 Misc. Rep. 600, 24 N. Y. Supp. 558. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants, to abide' the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
