Ibid., page 506.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\" pgmap=\"370\">He must show that the judgment is wrong, that he did not owe the debt for which it was rendered, or that he has offered to pay it, before he asks the aid of a court of equity. He must do equity as the condition upon which he asks equity. Williams v. Hitzie, 83 Ind. 309.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-8\" pgmap=\"370\">If a party can say nothing against the justice of a judgment, can give no reason why, in equity, he ought not to pay it, a court of equity will not interfere, but will leave him to contend against it at law in the best way he can. Stokes v. Knarr, 11 Wis. 389; cited and approved in Williams v. Hitzie, 83 Ind. 309; also in Burch v. West, 134 Ill. 258.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\" pgmap=\"370\">Equity can not relieve against the operation of a judgment simply on account of its hardship.

Love, 13 Ill. 486, in which it appeared that it had been determined by the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri, that the entry of satisfaction on the docket of the judgment should stand, and the present, in which a judgment has been merely set aside, leaving, so far as appears, the suit in which it was entered still pending.</p> <p id=\"b371-12\" pgmap=\"371\">We do not at present express any opinion upon any question in this case, other- than that arising from the decree.</p> <p id=\"b371-13\" pgmap=\"371\">Under the circumstance of, so far as appears, the pending of the original suit in Indiana, the most that should be done here would be to stay proceedings under the Illinois judgment until the determination of the Indiana suit, if such there be.</p> <p id=\"b371-14\" pgmap=\"371\">The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
