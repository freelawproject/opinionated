It is fundamental law that a. railway company, when properly organized and empowered by the laws of the State, has full authority and right to use its right of way for its legitimate chartered purposes, to the exclusion of all the world; and it has an absolute right to work its engines in the usual and proper way, and when necessary, in the exercise of this right, to send forth particles of fire from them, and it is not liable for injuries caused thereby to private property, unless it fails to exercise its right in a lawful manner and with reasonable care and skill.

The jury found defendant guilty of the negligence charged, and assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages at $82. For this sum and costs of suit judgment for plaintiff was entered, to reverse which the defendant sued out this Avrit of error. Twelve errors are assigned, and one only seems to be relied on, viz.: That the verdict was against the eAddence and \u25a0 the court erred in refusing to set it aside.</p> <p id=\"b156-10\" pgmap=\"156(18) 157(90)\">It was proven that the fire was communicated by the defendant\u2019s locomotive engine while passing along its railroad, and by the provision of Par. 104, p. 1949, Starr &amp; Curtis Kev. Statute, 2d Yol., this proof must be taken as full prima facie evidence to charge the defendant with the negligence complained of. The prima facie case for plaintiff thus established was sought to be overcome by the evidence of servants of the defendant, to the effect that the engine was equipped with a spark-arrester of the most approved style, in good repair, and was operated by a skilled and competent engineer and fireman.</p> <p id=\"b157-4\" pgmap=\"157\">But it also appears in evidence when the fire was communicated, the engine was pulling a light train at ordinary speed, on a down grade, and the engineer testified on cross-examination that if the spark-arrester was in good condition under the conditions in which he was then running his train, he did not believe the engine could throw fire and ignite grass 110 feet away, and further testified that he did not believe that sparks could escape through a properly constructed arrester under the conditions in which he was then running and set fire to grass 110 feet off. And it does appear by the proof, the fire was communicated to the grass of plaintiff at that distance from the passing engine. A conflict of evidence thus existed touching the character and condition of the spark-arrester, a vital question in the case, which the jury determined in favor of appellee, and no good reason appears for disturbing the verdict.

Kingman, 49 Ill. App. 43; and L. E. &amp; W. v. Black, decided by this court June 23, 1894, sustain our view above expressed. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
