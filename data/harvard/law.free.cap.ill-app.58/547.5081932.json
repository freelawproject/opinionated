On August 7, 1876, a judgment was entered in the said proceedings, adjudging to the \u201c owner or owners \u201d of the said west thirty-three feet of block 7 the sum of $2,092.66, and ordering that upon the payment into court, for the use of such \u201c owner or owners,\u201d the city should take possession.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\" pgmap=\"545\">The city took possession of the 33-foot strip in 1884, but no claim was made for the $1,528.56, the proportion of the said special assessments coming to the. \u201c owner or owners \u201d of the north 289 5-10* feet of the said west thirty-three feet until 1893 or 1894, the -money lying in the city treasury.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\" pgmap=\"545\">In the meantime, about a year after the condemnation judgment, by full warranty deed, dated March 7, 1877, appellants and their wives conveyed the said north 289 5-10 feet of said west half of block 7 by metes and bounds, including the west 33-foot strip, to one Henry Engelking.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\" pgmap=\"545\">The deed recites, in the granting clause : \u201c This conveyance is made subject to condemnation of one-half on Hermitage avenue by the city of Chicago.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\" pgmap=\"545\">Immediately upon purchasing the property, Engelking subdivided the same into fifteen lots and streets and alleys as \u201c Engelking Subdivision, etc.,\u201d the plat being recorded June 21, 1877. On that plat the west thirty-three feet is marked off as \u201c Hermitage avenue,\u201d and marked on said Hermitage avenue appears, \u201c As opened, City v.

Because appellant\u2019s rights under the condemnation judgment were fixed, and they could only be divested by assignment in express terms. Conveyance of the property condemned by warranty deed does not carry with it the compensation under the judgment.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-6\" pgmap=\"546\">Second. Granting, for the sake of argument, that the warranty deed carried with it the compensation money, nevertheless the reservation in the granting clause withheld the fund to appellants.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-7\" pgmap=\"546\">Third.

The city had a right to repeal the ordinance on which the condemnation proceeding ivas based, or to dismiss its suit at any time, provided it had not taken possession of the land and no demand for payment of the compensation had been made.

This right exists without there being any corresponding right upon the part of the owner to compel the public to take the property at the value determined by the judgment. It is like a unilateral contract; the option is strictly with the public. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. v. City of Chicago, 148 Ill. 141. As a consequence, neither the ownership nor title is divested by the judgment in such proceedings, and a conveyance by one having the title when such judgment is entered and before possession taken or payment made, passes the property with all rights and burdens appertaining thereto, precisely as if no such judgment had been rendered, save that the grantee takes as the grantor, held subject to the right of the public to acquire the same upon payment of the amount of the judgment. All real estate is held subject to the right of the public to condemn the same for public use; the only distinction between the holding before and after a judgment in condemnation pro-' ceedings is that thereafter the price which the public must pay in order to obtain the property is fixed.</p> <p id=\"b548-5\" pgmap=\"548\">When, therefore, appellants, after judgment, conveyed these premises to Henry Engellcing, they conveyed all the rights which they had growing out of the ownership of this property. If nothing further was done\u2019by the city, Henry Engellcing would have remained the owner they made him. As thereafter the city paid into court the amount of the judgment, the administratrix of Henry Engellcing is entitled to such money. It was paid for his land, his title, his possession, not that of appellants. \u2022</p> <p id=\"b548-6\" pgmap=\"548\">The views here expressed are in accordance with the opinion of this court in Rice v. The City of Chicago, 57 Ill. App. 558.</p> <p id=\"b548-7\" pgmap=\"548\">The clause in the conveyance, \u201c This deed is made subject to condemnation of one-half of Hermitage avenue by the city of Chicago,\u201d was not a restriction of the granting terms of the instrument, but a mere indication that against the effect of such proceedings the grantors made no undertaking.</p> <p id=\"b548-8\" pgmap=\"548\">In this suit only the rights of appellant and appellee are involved. It is therefore unnecessary to consider what is urged concerning the supposed claims of' others.</p> <p id=\"b548-9\" pgmap=\"548\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
