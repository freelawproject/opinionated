The bill alleges that the complainant, while insured in the association in the sum of $1,000, sustained an injury to his head, which totally incapacitated him from following the business of a switchman, and that the association refusing to pay the claim, the complainant sued the association at law as a corporation and obtained service upon \"Win. E. Simsrott, its grand secretary and treasurer.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\" pgmap=\"529\">The bill further alleges that the association represented itself to the complainant and held itself out to the world as a corporation, and that it was a corporation defacto.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\" pgmap=\"529\">The association failed to enter an appearance in the law court, and judgment was rendered against it by default; an execution was duly issued and returned \u201c no property found.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-11\" pgmap=\"529(37) 530(35)\">The association, by its board of directors, filed its answer to the bill, alleging that it was a voluntary association having several thousand members throughout the United States and Canada; that it was not incorporated under \u2018the laws of this or any other State or country; that it did not hold itself out to the public or to its members as a corporation, and that it was not a corporation defacto.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">It is further alleged that the board of directors had no knowledge that the judgment in question had been obtained until a creditor\u2019s bill was filed in the Circuit Court on the judgment.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530\">A temporary injunction was granted, without notice, restraining the board of directors and officers of the association from collecting or paying out any moneys.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\" pgmap=\"530\">In order to have it dissolved, the association paid $1,150 into court to abide the result of this suit, and the injunction was thereupon dissolved.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\" pgmap=\"530\">During the pendency of this suit the Circuit Court of Cook County appointed John E. Fitzpatrick receiver of this association, and the said receiver by leave of court was made a party defendant in this cause and filed his answer, which is in \u2022 substance the same as the answer previously filed by the board of directors. He also filed a cross-bill setting forth substantially the same facts as he stated in the answer and prayed that the judgment be vacated and set aside.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\" pgmap=\"530\">The case was referred to master in chancery Stein, to take testimony and report conclusions. The master took the testimony and reported the date of the filing of the praecipe, the issuing of the summons and the return thereupon; that default was taken and afterward set aside and default again taken and judgment entered against the Switchmen\u2019s Mutual Aid Association for $1,050, and that execution issued thereupon; that the declaration was not filed in time for the second term, and that a stipulation was written on the back of the declaration, waiving this objection.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-10\" pgmap=\"530\">The master further found that Barnum, Humphrey &amp; Barnum had no authority to stipulate for the association, and that even if they had, the facts did not show that they had stipulated waiving this defect.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-11\" pgmap=\"530(19) 531(38)\">The master -further found that there was no such corporation in existence as the Switchmen\u2019s Mutual Aid Association of North America; that it did not hold itself out as a corporation, and that the facts upon which the complainant relied were not sufficient to justify him in believing the association to be a corporation.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">The master further found that this was a case wherein a court of equity should refuse to lend its assistance, and recommended that complainant should be relegated to such remedies as he might be able to obtain at common law; and also recommended that receiver\u2019s cross-bill be dismissed.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">Upon exceptions being filed to the master\u2019s report, the court refused to pass on the master\u2019s report, or the exceptions thereto, in so far as said report referred to findings of fact or conclusions of fact, but held that the complainant was entitled to a decree, and entered a decree in favor of the complainant, from which decree the receiver has prayed this appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, James 0.

If the element of fraud is wanting there is no estoppel; there must be deception and change of conduct in consequence, in order to estop the party from showing the truth. Davidson v.

Hughes, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-5\" pgmap=\"533\">The Circuit Court of Cook County is a court of general jurisdiction, and had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject-matter. The defendant in the common law proceeding might have appeared and divested the court of jurisdiction to render judgment, by demanding a non-suit. Having failed to do this, it can not now complain and avoid its liability under the judgment. Cullander v. Gates, 45 Ill. App. 374.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-6\" pgmap=\"533\">In a collateral proceeding, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to render the judgment must be presumed.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-7\" pgmap=\"533\">In People v. Seelye, 146 Ill. 221, it is said: \u201c If a court has jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, it is altogether immaterial, where its judgment is collaterally called in question, how grossly irregular or manifestly erroneous its proceedings may have been; its final order can not be regarded as a nullity and can not, therefore, be collaterally impeached.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-8\" pgmap=\"533\">The rule thus laid down has been frequently recognized by this court. Swiggart v. Harber, 4 Scam. 364; Buckmaster v. Carlin, 3 Scam. 104; Hernandez v. Drake, 81 Ill. 34; Monroe v. People, 102 Ill. 406; Kenny v. Greer, 13 Ill. 432.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-9\" pgmap=\"533\">Nothing is presumed to be without the jurisdiction of courts of general jurisdiction, except what specially appears to be so.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-10\" pgmap=\"533\">In Maloney v. Dewey, 127 111. 402, the bill attacked collaterally the decree of the United States Circuit Court. It was contended, among other things, that the summons was void because not returnable on a day during the term; that the summons was not properly served. It was held that the decree could not be attacked for such irregularities. See also C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. v. Watson, 113 Ill. 195; Jenkins v. International Bk., 111 Ill. 462; Neff v. Smyth, 111 Ill. 100.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b533-11\" pgmap=\"533(50) 534(25)\">Where there is jurisdiction, a judgment is binding upon all parties until it is reversed in a regular proceeding. See, as affirming the doctrine of the foregoing cases, Tunesma v. Schuttler, 114 Ill. 157; Union National Bk. v. International Bank, 123 Ill. 510; Culver v. Phelps, 130 Ill. 217; Wenner v. Thornton, 98 Ill. 157; Chudleigh v. C. F. I. &amp; P. Ry., 51 Ill. App. 491; Magnusson v. Cronholm, 51 Ill. App. 473.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-5\" pgmap=\"534\">\u201c Errors intervening after jurisdiction attaches, and which might have affected the judgment if urged at the proper time and in the proper forum, cannot be effectively insisted upon in a collateral proceeding, whether in law or equity.\u201d Johnson v. Miller, 50 Ill. App. 60.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-6\" pgmap=\"534\">\u201c The test of jurisdiction is, whether the tribunal had power to enter upon the inquiry, not whether its methods \"were regular, its findings right, or its conclusions in accordance with the law.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-7\" pgmap=\"534\">In Callender v. Gates, 45 111. App. 374, the defendants were served in a foreign country. It was held, if they wished to make that objection it was necessary to appear and plead to jurisdiction, and a failure to do so will be considered as a waiver.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-8\" pgmap=\"534\">The association is estopped to deny it was a corporation defacto at the time it was suited. The exercise of corporate powers by an association, in the absence of a compliance with the statutes providing for the incorporation of insurance and indemnity associations, under the facts in this case, constituted the defendant a corporation de facto. Its corporate existence, however, was an issue which should have been raised by a plea of nul tiel corporation, and it is now too late to seek the advantage of a lack of diligence on the part of the defendant and of such a plea.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b534-9\" pgmap=\"534\">Under the decisions in Miami Powder Co. v. Hotchkiss et al., 17 Bradw. 622, U. S. Express Co. v. Bedburn, 34 Ill. 459, and Hudson v. Green Hill Cem. Co., 113 Ill. 618, the Switchmen\u2019s Mutual Aid Association of North America is properly held a corporation defacto.. See, also, Bigelow on Estoppel (4th Ed.), 525; Dooley v. Cheshire Glass Co., 15 Gray 494; West v. Madison Co. Agr. Co., 82 Ill. 205.</p> <opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b534-10\" pgmap=\"534\">Mr. Presiding Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AXu\" pgmap=\"534\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b534-11\" pgmap=\"534\">The name of the association imported that it was a corporation.</p> <p id=\"b535-4\" pgmap=\"535\">It contracted with appellee as if it were a corporation, and can not now be heard to deny its representations. U. S. Express Co. v. Bradbury, 34 Ill. 459; Hudson v. Green Hill Cemetery Assn., 113 Ill. 613; Miami Powder Co. v. Hotchkiss, 17 Ill. App. 622.</p> <p id=\"b535-5\" pgmap=\"535\">Appellant can not in this collateral proceeding, object to the judgment obtained against the association whose receiver he is. The court which rendered judgment against the association had jurisdiction over the subject-matter and over the person of the defendant. Its judgment upon a declaration that had been filed, but nine days before the commencement of the term, was at most but error, which can not in this proceeding be argued as a reason for disregarding such judgment. Town of Lyons v. Cooledge et al., 89 Ill. 529; People v. Seelyer, 146 Ill. 189; Clark v. Kern, 146 Ill. 348.</p> <p id=\"b535-6\" pgmap=\"535\">It is true that when a.court of equity is called upon to enforce a decree rendered in another proceeding, it will refuse to do so, if, upon examination, such decree is found to be inequitable. Wadhams v. Gay, 73 Ill. 430.</p> <p id=\"b535-7\" pgmap=\"535\">We find as the court below did, that nothing appears to show that the judgment against this da facto corporation is inequitable or unjust; and appellee was, as appears, entitled to the aid of a court of equity to enable him to realize upon the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p> <p id=\"b535-8\" pgmap=\"535\">The receiver, who has appealed from the order of the court below, should act impartially for the benefit of all the creditors of this association; and unless there are facts existing not shown by the record here filed, we do not see why he should continue to endeavor to deprive appellee, a judgment creditor, of the rights to which his judgment entitled him. See High on Receivers, Sec. 202.</p> <p id=\"b535-9\" pgmap=\"535\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
