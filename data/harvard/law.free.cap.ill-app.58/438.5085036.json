His title is conditional, and in case of a time draft, it is conditioned upon the consignee\u2019s acceptance, and is by such acceptance divested.

Merchants Bank, 1 Otto, 91 U. S. 92, as decisive in favor of the carrier, and therefore reverse without remanding, that the question may at once go before the Supreme Court.
