But if not bad on that account, and the question Avhether the cause of action in the new counts is the same cause of action as that stated in the original declaration is one for the court to determine on an inspection of the whole declaration, then it appears that the cause of action thus neAvly stated was the same cause of action originally declared upon.

Stearns v. Reidy, 133 Ill. App. 246.</p> <p id=\"b274-5\" pgmap=\"274\">If the pile was there, nothing in the case explains how it got there further than that such piles came from cleaning out fires and ash-pans of engines. Bor is there any evidence of how long it had been there, except the testimony of the appellee that it was cold, and his testimony, corroborated by other that such a pile, in the absence of any water upon it, will smoulder twelve to eighteen hours.</p> <p id=\"b274-6\" pgmap=\"274\">Whether the pile was there, and if there its condition, was testified to only by the appellee.</p> <p id=\"b274-7\" pgmap=\"274\">Bow, assuming that such a pile was there, and had been there during the whole or the larger part of the working hours of the previous day, and that its presence increased the perils of a service\u2014switching in the night\u2014necessarily dangerous, it was a question for the jury whether the appellant was negligent. And passing the question of pleading, the real question is whether an instruction offered by the appellant that the appellee was not entitled to recover should have been given. . Eleven instructions for the appellee, and ten unmodified and four modified for the appellant were given. Six asked by the appellant were refused.</p> <p id=\"b274-8\" pgmap=\"274\">To go over all that the appellant urges upon the subject of instructions would take too much space, and we must briefly state that in our judgment no error of law is in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
