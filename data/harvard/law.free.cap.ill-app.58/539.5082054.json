It shall not be lawful for any person to locate, build, construct or keep in any block in which two-thirds of the buildings are devoted to exclusive residence purposes, a livery, boarding or sale stable, gas house, gas reservoir, paint, oil or varnish works, within 200 feet of such residence, on either side of the street, unless the owners of a majority of the lots in such block fronting or abutting on the street consent in writing to the location or construction of such livery stable, gas house, gas reservoir, paint, oil or varnish works therein.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\" pgmap=\"537\">\u201c Such written consent of the property owners shall be filed with the commissioner of buildings before a permit be granted for the construction or keeping of such livery stable, gas house, gas reservoir, paint, oil or varnish works.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\" pgmap=\"537\">The legislature has empowered cities to direct the location of livery stables, in the following terms:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\" pgmap=\"537\">\u201c To direct the location and regulate the use and construction of breweries, distilleries, livery stables, blacksmith shops and foundries within the limits of the city or village.\u201d 3 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Statutes, 191, paragraph 82.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\" pgmap=\"537\">The defendants admit that they are engaged in the business of keeping a livery stable, boarding and sales stable at 27os. 211 and 213 Evanston avenue, in the city of Chicago. The building which they were occupying on the 7th day of June, 1894, for that purpose, was constructed under a building permit to erect a two-story and basement brick carriage repository and stable in the rear, which was issued July 28, 1893. Instead of building a stable in the rear, it appears that the horses, some thirty or more, were kept in the basement. The building is back about fifty-nine feet from the street and has a plank drive-way running from the entrance of the stable, which is about six feet above the ground, down to Evanston avenue. The livery stable and drive-way are so near to a residence building on the adjoining lot that carriages driving out and in shake the whole building. On the 7th of June, 1894, there were thirty-one buildings in the block in which this livery stable is located, twenty-eight of which were devoted to exclusive residence purposes.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\" pgmap=\"537\">Eo petition has ever been signed by a majority of the property owners, as required by the ordinance governing the location and keeping of livery stables in the city of Chicago.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-9\" pgmap=\"537(40) 538(90)\">This suit was originally brought before a justice of the peace, where judgment was entered against the defendants, and was by the defendants appealed to the Circuit Court of Cook County. Upon the trial before the court, a jury having been waived, certain propositions of law, in pursuance of the statute, were offered on behalf of the plaintiff, presenting the question of the legality of the ordinance in question, which the court was requested to hold as the law governing the ease, but the court held the section of the ordinance to be invalid and entered a finding for the defendants. Motion for a new trial having been overruled, the court entered judgment upon the finding. The plaintiff brings the case to this court by appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-5\" pgmap=\"538\">Appellant\u2019s Beief, Faeson &amp; Greenfield, Attorneys.</attorneys><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\" pgmap=\"538\">Cities and villages are expressly authorized to direct the location of livery stables. 3 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Statutes, 191, Far. 82.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\" pgmap=\"538\">An express power granted by the legislature to a municipal corporation carries with it everything necessary to make it efficient.

If the clause permitting a majority of the owners to do away with the restriction is invalid, does its fall carry with it the entire ordinance, or does the restriction remain, not subject to removal ?</p> <p id=\"b541-4\" pgmap=\"541\">That public powers and trusts can not be delegated is well established. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Sec. 96, 4th Ed.; Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 248; City of E. St. Louis v. Wehrung, 50 Ill. 28; Tregman v. Chicago, 78 Ill. 405-410.</p> <p id=\"b541-5\" pgmap=\"541\">Ordinances as well as statutes of this nature, that is, providing that a restriction may be removed or that license to do acts shall not be given except upon the consent of the owners of specific property, have long been known in this State. Such ordinances and statutes differ from enactments, the taking effect of which is made to depend upon their ratification by vote of the people of a particular locality. In the case last mentioned the legislative body enacts a statute or ordinance, the going into effect of which as an operative law, is made to depend upon a contingency, viz., its approval by vote of the people of a locality for which the law is designed. The power to enact laws to go into effect upon a contingency has always been exercised; most grants of franchises are of this kind. Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 136; Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382.</p> <p id=\"b541-6\" pgmap=\"541\">Such legislation is not a delegation of a trust or power; it is merely giving a cestui que trust an opportunity to say whether it desires to have the power exercised or accepts that offered. People v. Reynolds, 5 Gil. 1; People v. Hoffman, 116 Ill. 584; Home Ins. Co. v. Swigert, 104 Ill. 353; Bull v. Reid, 13 Grattan, 78; State v. Parker, 26 Vt. 357; Lathrop v. Stedman, 42 Conn. 583; Erlinger v. Beneau, 51 Ill. 94.</p> <p id=\"b541-7\" pgmap=\"541(18) 542(17)\">There is a distinction between the power which city authorities exercise over the use to which private property may be put, and the control possessed by the city over the use of the public streets.</p> <p id=\"b542-5\" pgmap=\"542\">The private property of citizens is not held in trust by the municipal authorities, while the streets are held in trust for the use and benefit of the entire public\u2014for those who own no property as much as for those who have a great deal.</p> <p id=\"b542-6\" pgmap=\"542\">To, in the case of public streets, parks and grounds, surrender or delegate the control over the trust, not to the people of a particular locality, but to the owners of certain property as such, and not to them per capita, but in proportion to their property ownership, so that the functions of government are to be exercised, privileges to be given or withheld, not by the people, but by the owners of specific property, the voting power of each being determined by the amount of property possessed, is quite different from merely giving to the owners of certain lots the right to say whether a general restrictive ordinance shall be extended to such property.</p> <p id=\"b542-7\" pgmap=\"542\">A municipal corporation can exercise only such powers as are intrusted to it.</p> <p id=\"b542-8\" pgmap=\"542\">The city of Chicago is nowhere empowered to delegate any of its powers; it may direct the location of livery stables; it can not delegate to certain property holders this power.

Memphis Railroad, 10 Wallace, 38-52.</p> <p id=\"b542-9\" pgmap=\"542\">A delegation of power by a city is valid if expressly authorized by the legislature. City of Brooklyn v. Breslin et al., 57 N. Y. 591-594.</p> <p id=\"b542-10\" pgmap=\"542\">We are of the opinion that the common council of the city of Chicago could not delegate to the owners of a majority of certain lots the power to determine whether in a particular locality the location of a livery stable should be unlawful.</p> <p id=\"b542-11\" pgmap=\"542\">The keeping of a livery stable is a lawful and useful business; it may, by the city, be reasonably restricted to certain localities, but such right to restrict can not be delegated.</p> <p id=\"b543-3\" pgmap=\"543\">Can the .invalid portion of the ordinance be separated from the remainder so as to leave the latter in force ?</p> <p id=\"b543-4\" pgmap=\"543\">The ordinance in question makes, in the blocks under consideration, the keeping of a livery stable unlawful, unless the owners of a majority of certain lots consent, in writing, to such location. It is a penal enactment. Clearly, if the specified owners of a majority of lots should consent in writing to the keeping of a livery stable in such locality, the city could not, by the imposition of fines and penalties under this ordinance, prevent such location.</p> <p id=\"b543-5\" pgmap=\"543\">It follows that the portion following the word \u201c unless \u201d is a necessary part of the ordinance.</p> <p id=\"b543-6\" pgmap=\"543\">Hor do we think that it was the intent of the common \u201d council that this ordinance, without the provision following the word \u201c unless,\u201d should stand as its direction as to where livery stables, etc., might be located.</p> <p id=\"b543-7\" pgmap=\"543\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b543-8\" pgmap=\"543\">Gary, J.</p> <p id=\"b543-9\" pgmap=\"543\">I agree to the foregoing with many misgivings.</p> <p id=\"b543-10\" pgmap=\"543\">It is important that the question should be settled by the highest authority.</p> <p id=\"b543-11\" pgmap=\"543\">Shepard, J., dissents.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
