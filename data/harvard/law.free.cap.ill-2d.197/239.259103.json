(West 1998)) in which he alleged that, following the entry of his guilty plea, his court-appointed attorney refused his request to \u201cfile an appeal\u201d and became \u201ctotally unavailable in regard to the case.\u201d The circuit court dismissed the petition as frivolous or patently without merit. See 725 ILCS 5/122\u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998). The appellate court affirmed. 305 Ill. App. 3d 853. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgments of the circuit and appellate courts.</p> <p id=\"b253-5\" pgmap=\"253\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b253-6\" pgmap=\"253\">Defendant was indicted in 1997 on one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and one count of unlawful possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. In October 1997, while before the circuit court, defendant stated that he wished to plead guilty to the count of unlawful possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. In exchange for defendant\u2019s plea, the State agreed to drop the remaining count and recommend a term of imprisonment not to exceed six years. The circuit court admonished defendant of his rights, accepted the plea, and sentenced defendant to six years\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p id=\"b253-7\" pgmap=\"253(160) 254(13)\">The circuit court then informed defendant that, although he had pled guilty, he retained the right to appeal. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 605(b) (145 Ill. 2d R. 605(b)), the circuit court explained to defendant the conditions to pursuing an appeal from a guilty plea that are set forth in Supreme Court Rule 604(d) (145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d)). Rule 604(d) requires a defendant who wishes to appeal from a judgment entered upon a guilty plea to first file a motion in the circuit court to withdraw his guilty plea within 30 days of sentencing. 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d). Such a motion must specify the grounds for withdrawal of the plea. 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d) (\u201cThe motion shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor\u201d). In the case at bar, the circuit court properly admonished defendant that he could appeal from \u201cthe judgment of conviction on [the] plea, or the sentence imposed,\u201d but only after filing \u201ca written motion to withdraw or take back your plea.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b254-3\" pgmap=\"254\">No further pleadings were filed after sentencing.</p> <p id=\"b254-4\" pgmap=\"254\">In February 1998, defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 1996)). Defendant made a number of allegations within his petition including, inter alia, an allegation that his attorney failed to subpoena witnesses that defendant had requested and an allegation that his attorney showed a lack of interest in his case. Defendant also alleged the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254\">\u201cI requested to [my attorney] Lenik to file an appeal, after the Judge (DeLaMar) explained to me that I could do so. Atty. Lenik stated in regard to the appeal, quote [szc] On what grounds? unquote [szc] Atty. Lenik had taken it or decided for herself not to file an appeal, in spite of my numerous requests to. She (Atty. Lenik) also became totally unavailable in regard to the case in spite of the repeated calls by my wife on my behalf.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b254-6\" pgmap=\"254\">The circuit court found that \u201c[t]his allegation [was] in essence a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to allow the Petitioner to appeal.\u201d After reviewing pertinent case law relating to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and Rule 604(d), the circuit court concluded that \u201cit would appear that the Petitioner cannot just make the bare allegation that he requested counsel to file a motion to withdraw his plea. The Petitioner must show prejudice. In the least, [this] would apparently mean that the Petitioner would have to show grounds for a motion to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d The circuit court determined that \u201c[t]he Petition for Post-Conviction Relief as provided to this Court does not show *** [any] recognized issues that can be raised in a Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea.\u201d The circuit court then dismissed defendant\u2019s petition as frivolous or patently without merit. See 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b255-4\" pgmap=\"255\">Defendant appealed, arguing that the circuit court erred in concluding that defendant had to show how he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Relying upon this court\u2019s decision in People v. Moore, 133 Ill. 2d 331 (1990), defendant contended that prejudice should be presumed. In Moore, this court held that the prejudice prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel (see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984)) need not be established where counsel fails to perfect a defendant\u2019s appeal after trial and the defendant subsequently seeks post-conviction relief. In such cases, prejudice is presumed. Moore, 133 Ill. 2d at 339.</p> <p id=\"b255-5\" pgmap=\"255\">The appellate court, however, distinguished Moore on the ground that the defendant in that case was convicted following a trial. Citing People v. Wilk, 124 Ill. 2d 93 (1988), and People v. Wendt, 283 Ill. App. 3d 947 (1996), the appellate court concluded that prejudice should not be presumed for a defendant who has pleaded guilty and agreed to a specific sentence. 305 Ill. App. 3d at 857-58. Finding no grounds for withdrawing the guilty plea set forth in defendant\u2019s pro se petition, or any explanation of how defendant was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to file the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858.</p> <p id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for leave to appeal (177 Ill. 2d R. 315(a)) and, on November 16, 2000, issued an opinion affirming the judgment of the appellate court. Defendant subsequently filed a petition for rehearing, which we allowed. 155 Ill. 2d R. 367; 134 Ill. 2d R. 612(p).</p> <p id=\"b255-7\" pgmap=\"255\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b255-8\" pgmap=\"255\">I</p> <p id=\"b255-9\" pgmap=\"255(18) 256(227)\">The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 1998)) provides a remedy for defendants who have suffered a substantial violation of their constitutional rights at trial. Under the Act, a post-conviction proceeding not involving the death penalty contains three stages. People v. Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d 410, 418 (1996). At the first stage, the circuit court must independently review the post-conviction petition within 90 days of its filing and determine whether \u201cthe petition is frivolous or is patently without merit.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122\u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998). If the court determines that the petition is either frivolous or patently without merit, the court must dismiss the petition in a written order. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998). A post-conviction petition is considered frivolous or patently without merit only if the allegations in the petition, taken as true and liberally construed, fail to present the \u201cgist of a constitutional claim.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418, citing People v. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d 64, 74 (1988). The \u201cgist\u201d standard is \u201ca low threshold.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418. To set forth the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim, the post-conviction petition \u201cneed only present a limited amount of detail\u201d (Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418) and hence need not set forth the claim in its entirety. Further, the petition need not include \u201clegal arguments or [citations] to legal authority.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418.</p> <p id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">In his special concurrence, Justice Fitzgerald notes that several decisions from our appellate court have stated that, under the \u201cgist\u201d standard, the pro se defendant must \u201c \u2018plead sufficient facts from which the trial court could find a valid claim of deprivation of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) 197 Ill. 2d at 260 (Fitzgerald, J., concurring), quoting People v. Lemons, 242 Ill. App. 3d 941, 946 (1993). In our view, the \u201csufficient facts\u201d test used in Lemons and other appellate decisions is at odds with this court\u2019s holdings and should be avoided.</p> <p id=\"b256-6\" pgmap=\"256(10) 257(100)\">On its face, the \u201csufficient facts\u201d test requires a pro se defendant to file a factually complete petition at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings. In other words, the defendant must allege facts that would support all the elements of a constitutional claim. This conclusion follows from the requirement, as stated in Lemons, that the facts alleged must be such that the \u201ctrial court could find a valid claim of deprivation of a constitutional right.\u201d Lemons, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 946. Necessarily, if facts supporting all the elements of a constitutional claim are not included in the petition, the circuit court could not \u201cfind a valid claim.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b257-5\" pgmap=\"257\">However, requiring this type of full or complete pleading is contrary to this court\u2019s holding that the pro se defendant \u201cneed only present a limited amount of detail\u201d (Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418) to survive summary dismissal at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings. It is also at odds with the \u201cgist\u201d standard itself since, by definition, a \u201cgist\u201d of a claim is something less than a completely pled or fully stated claim.</p> <p id=\"b257-6\" pgmap=\"257\">Further, the \u201csufficient facts\u201d test imposes too heavy a burden on the pro 'se defendant. While in a given case the pro se defendant may be aware of all the facts pertaining to his claim, he will, in all likelihood, be unaware of the precise legal basis for his claim or all the legal elements of that claim. In many cases, the pro se defendant will be unaware that certain facts, which in his mind are tangential or secondary, are, in fact, critical parts of a complete and valid constitutional claim. Under the \u201csufficient facts\u201d test, however, the pro se defendant must recognize the facts that need to be pled to support a \u201cvalid claim.\u201d This is an unrealistic requirement. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the \u201csufficient facts\u201d test.</p> <p id=\"b257-7\" pgmap=\"257(35) 258(111)\">If the circuit court does not dismiss the post-conviction petition as frivolous or patently without merit, then the petition advances to the second stage. Counsel is appointed to represent the defendant, if necessary (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 4 (West 1998)), and the State is allowed to file responsive pleadings (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 5 (West 1998)). At this stage, the circuit court must determine whether the petition and any accompanying documentation make a substantial showing of a constitutional violation. See People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366, 381 (1998). If no such showing is made, the petition is dismissed. If, however, a substantial showing of a constitutional violation is set forth, then the petition is advanced to the third stage, where the circuit court conducts an evidentiary hearing (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 6 (West 1998)). Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418.</p> <p id=\"b258-5\" pgmap=\"258\">Although the circuit court in the instant case dismissed defendant\u2019s petition at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings, we note that the appellate court, in reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision, applied both the first and second stage standards for determining whether a noncapital, post-conviction petition should be dismissed. At the outset of its opinion, the appellate court correctly indicated that the issue presented in this case is whether defendant\u2019s petition is frivolous or patently without merit. 305 Ill. App. 3d at 855. At the conclusion of its opinion, however, the appellate court stated: \u201cWe affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s postconviction petition. Under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, defendant has the burden of showing a substantial violation of his constitutional rights occurred in the proceedings that resulted in his conviction. Defendant\u2019s petition failed to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel ***.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858.</p> <p id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258(54) 259(42)\">These latter statements are inappropriate, given the procedural posture of this case. The relevant question in the case at bar is not whether defendant\u2019s petition makes a substantial showing of a constitutional violation; that is a second stage inquiry. Rather, the question we must address is whether, pursuant to section 122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) of the Act, defendant\u2019s petition was properly dismissed at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings. Thus, the issue before us is limited solely to whether defendant\u2019s \u201cpetition is frivolous or is patently without merit.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b259-5\" pgmap=\"259\">Our review of the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition is de novo. As we have explained, \u201c[d]ue to the elimination of all factual issues at the dismissal stage of a post-conviction proceeding, the question is, essentially, a legal one, which requires the reviewing court to make its own independent assessment of the allegations. Thus, a court of review [is] free to substitute its own judgment for that of the circuit court in order to formulate the legally correct answer.\u201d Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 388.</p> <p id=\"b259-6\" pgmap=\"259\">II</p> <p id=\"b259-7\" pgmap=\"259\">Defendant argues that his post-conviction petition should not have been dismissed as frivolous or patently without merit by the circuit court because the petition raises a nonfrivolous claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and appeal. As noted, the appellate court rejected this argument. The appellate court concluded that defendant\u2019s petition was properly dismissed as frivolous because the petition failed to include any explanation of \u201chow defendant was prejudiced or why his guilty plea should be withdrawn.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858. Drawing a distinction between convictions obtained following a trial and convictions obtained by guilty plea, the appellate court rejected defendant\u2019s contention that prejudice should be presumed for a pro se defendant who alleges he has been deprived of his right to appeal by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. In so holding, the appellate court distinguished the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327, 23 L. Ed. 2d 340, 89 S. Ct. 1715 (1969).</p> <p id=\"b260-4\" pgmap=\"260\">In Rodriquez, the defendant was convicted following a jury trial on several narcotics charges (see Rodriquez v. United States, 387 F.2d 117 (9th Cir. 1967)). The defendant\u2019s trial counsel subsequently failed to submit a notice of appeal within the appropriate time period. Although the defendant thereafter attempted to file a notice of appeal himself, the trial court ruled that the expiration of the appeal period deprived the court of jurisdiction over the matter. The defendant subsequently pursued post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that he had been improperly denied his right to appeal. Both the District Court for the Northern District of California and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth District denied the defendant\u2019s petition, holding that he had failed to disclose what errors he would have raised on appeal. In rejecting this reasoning, the Supreme Court held:</p> <blockquote id=\"b260-5\" pgmap=\"260\">\u201cThe Ninth Circuit seems to require an applicant under 28 USC \u00a7 2255 to show more than a simple deprivation of [the right to appeal] before relief can be accorded. It also requires him to show some likelihood of success on appeal; if the applicant is unlikely to succeed, the Ninth Circuit would characterize any denial of the right to appeal as a species of harmless error. We cannot subscribe to this approach.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260(135) 261(47)\">Applicants for relief under \u00a7 2255 must, if indigent, prepare their petitions without the assistance of counsel. [Citation.] Those whose education has been limited and those, like petitioner, who lack facility in the English language might have grave difficulty in making even a summary statement of points to be raised on appeal. Moreover, they may not even be aware of errors which occurred at trial. They would thus be deprived of their only chance to take an appeal even though they have never had the assistance of counsel in preparing one. *** Those whose right to appeal has been frustrated should be treated exactly like any other appellants; they should not be given an additional hurdle to clear just because their rights were violated at some earlier stage in the proceedings. Accordingly, we hold that the courts below erred in rejecting petitioner\u2019s application for relief because of his failure to specify the points he would raise were his right to appeal reinstated.\u201d Rodriquez, 395 U.S. at 330, 23 L. Ed. 2d at 344, 89 S. Ct. at 1717.</blockquote> <p id=\"b261-5\" pgmap=\"261\">The appellate court in the case at bar limited Rodriquez to those instances where a pro se defendant alleges that he was denied a right to appeal following trial. Recognizing that \u201c[m]ost defendants are not trained in the law,\u201d the appellate court concluded that \u201cdefendants convicted after trial should not be denied appellate counsel.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858. According to the appellate court, \u201c[f]or a defendant convicted after trial, who has always professed innocence, the right to appeal insures due process and provides an important safety net to those who may have been wrongly convicted.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858.</p> <p id=\"b261-6\" pgmap=\"261\">In contrast, the appellate court reasoned, \u201ca defendant who has admitted guilt [does not] need a safety net to protect against a wrongful conviction.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858. The court noted that, on appeal from a guilty plea, \u201c[w]ith certain exceptions, the defendant is \u2018limited to structural challenges to the plea proceedings themselves, i.e., whether the plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently based on competent advice from counsel.\u2019 \u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858, quoting Wendt, 283 Ill. App. 3d at 957. According to the appellate court, \u201c[a] defendant does not need appellate counsel or legal expertise to allege his plea was involuntary or that he was tricked into pleading guilty.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 858. Thus, the appellate court declined to presume prejudice and, instead, concluded that it was appropriate to place the burden on the pro se defendant to explain why his guilty plea should be withdrawn.</p> <p id=\"b261-7\" pgmap=\"261(32) 262(27)\">Shortly after the appellate court filed its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985, 120 S. Ct. 1029 (2000). In that decision, the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that Rodriquez is limited to those cases where a defendant\u2019s conviction is obtained following a trial.</p> <p id=\"b262-5\" pgmap=\"262\">In Flores-Ortega, the defendant was charged by the State of California with various crimes and entered a plea of guilty to second degree murder. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison and, at that time, advised the defendant of his right to appeal within 60 days. Although defense counsel wrote \u201cbring appeal papers\u201d in her file, no notice of appeal was filed within the applicable time period. Four months after he was sentenced, the defendant attempted to file a pro se notice of appeal, which was rejected by the clerk of court. Having exhausted state habeas corpus proceedings, the defendant filed a federal habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on the basis of his attorney\u2019s failure to' file the notice of appeal after allegedly promising the defendant that she would do so.</p> <p id=\"b262-6\" pgmap=\"262\">The Supreme Court held that Strickland provided the proper framework for evaluating the defendant\u2019s claim. With respect to the performance prong of Strickland, the Court observed that it has been \u201clong held that a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. The Court explained that this is so because counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal cannot be considered a strategic decision: \u201cfiling a notice of appeal is a purely ministerial task, and the failure to file reflects inattention to the defendant\u2019s wishes.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. Moreover, a defendant who instructs counsel to initiate an appeal reasonably relies upon counsel to do so. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035.</p> <p id=\"b263-4\" pgmap=\"263\">The Court went on to explain, however, that it could not determine from the record before it whether the defendant had conveyed his wishes regarding whether to appeal. Given this fact, the Court concluded, \u201cwe believe the question whether counsel has performed deficiently by not filing a notice of appeal is best answered by first asking a separate, but antecedent, question: whether counsel in fact consulted with the defendant about an appeal.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. Thus, in the Court\u2019s words, the question at \u201cthe heart of this case\u201d was \u201c[u]nder what circumstances does counsel have an obligation to consult with the defendant about an appeal?\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 996, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. After setting out these circumstances, the Court determined that, based on the limited record before it, a conclusion could not be reached as to whether counsel in that case had a duty to consult. The Court therefore remanded the cause to the district court for further consideration of this issue. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 487, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 1001-02, 120 S. Ct. at 1040.</p> <p id=\"b263-5\" pgmap=\"263(146) 264(92)\">With respect to the prejudice prong of the Strickland test, the Court stated that whether a defendant is required to show actual prejudice or whether prejudice is presumed \u201cturns on the magnitude of the deprivation of the right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 482, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 998, 120 S. Ct. at 1037. Where a defendant alleges that during a critical stage of a judicial proceeding he was denied the assistance of counsel altogether, \u201c \u2018[n]o specific showing of prejudice [is] required,\u2019 because \u2018the adversary process itself [is] presumptively unreliable.\u2019 \u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038, quoting United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657, 668, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2047 (1984). In Flores-Ortega, the Court explained that defense counsel\u2019s \u201calleged deficient performance arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability, but rather to the forfeiture of a proceeding itself.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. In other words, the \u201cdeficiency deprived [defendant] of the appellate proceeding altogether.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. This, the Court held, \u201cdemands a presumption of prejudice.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038.</p> <p id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">The Court went on to note, however, that although prejudice was presumed, the defendant still had to show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance \u201cactually cause[d] the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s appeal.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 484, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. Accordingly, the Court held that the defendant would have to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 484, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. The Court recognized that showing nonfrivolous grounds for appeal might help establish that the defendant would have, in fact, appealed. Critically though, the Court stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264\">\u201c[Although showing nonfrivolous grounds for appeal may give weight to the contention that the defendant would have appealed, a defendant\u2019s inability to \u2018specify the points he would raise were his right to appeal reinstated,\u2019 Rodriquez, 395 U.S. at 330[, 23 L. Ed. 2d at 344, 89 S. Ct. at 1717], will not foreclose the possibility that he can satisfy the prejudice requirement where there are other substantial reasons to believe that he would have appealed. *** We *** conclude here that it is unfair to require an indigent, perhaps pro se defendant to demonstrate that his hypothetical appeal might have had merit before any advocate has ever reviewed the record in his case in search of potentially meritorious grounds for appeal.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 486, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 1001, 120 S. Ct. at 1039-40.</blockquote> <p id=\"b265-4\" pgmap=\"265\">Flores-Ortega thus establishes that a pro se defendant, even if he pled guilty, cannot be required to demonstrate how his appeal would have been successful in order to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to pursue a requested appeal. The appellate court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary in the case at bar is therefore in error.</p> <p id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265\">The State maintains, however, that Flores-Ortega is distinguishable from the instant case under the deficient performance prong of Strickland. As the State points out, the deficient performance alleged in Flores-Ortega involved the failure to file a notice of appeal, a ministerial act. See Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. In contrast, the deficiency alleged in this case, i.e., the failure to file a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, is not a ministerial act because grounds for withdrawing the plea must be alleged in the motion. See 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d) (\u201cThe motion shall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor\u201d). In the State\u2019s view, because the filing of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is not considered a ministerial act, \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to file such a motion, without any rational basis to do so from the client, cannot be labeled unreasonable.\u201d Thus, according to the State, defendant\u2019s petition must be dismissed as frivolous because it does not allege any grounds for withdrawing the guilty plea.</p> <p id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265(92) 266(206)\">The State\u2019s argument is unpersuasive because it contradicts the principles of Rodriquez and Flores-Ortega. Defendant in the case at bar alleges that he repeatedly asked his attorney to file an appeal but that she had \u201ctaken it or decided for herself not to file\u201d one. For purposes of deciding whether defendant\u2019s petition is frivolous, we must take these allegations as true. People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366, 380 (1998), quoting People v. Jennings, 411 Ill. 21, 26 (1952). There is nothing of record which indicates that defendant\u2019s counsel reviewed the plea proceedings for error or consulted with defendant regarding grounds for an appeal before deciding not to file the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Cf. Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 278 n.10, 145 L. Ed. 2d 756, 775 n.10, 120 S. Ct. 746, 760 n.10 (2000) (\u201c[I]n all cases, [an indigent defendant has] the right to have an attorney, zealous for the indigent\u2019s interests, evaluate his case and attempt to discern nonfrivolous arguments\u201d before deciding not to pursue an appeal). Under these circumstances, as Rodriquez and Flores-Ortega hold, it is unreasonable to place a burden on the pro se defendant to demonstrate the merits of his hypothetical appeal. It is irrelevant whether one characterizes this burden as a requirement to allege deficient performance or prejudice because the principle remains the same: the pro se defendant cannot be expected \u201c \u2018to specify the grounds for [his] appeal and show that they have some merit.\u2019 \u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 486, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 1001, 120 S. Ct. at 1040, quoting Peguero v. United States, 526 U.S. 23, 30, 143 L. Ed. 2d 18, 25-26, 119 S. Ct. 961, 966 (1999) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring, joined by Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ.).</p> <p id=\"b266-5\" pgmap=\"266(129) 267(120)\">Indeed, adopting the State\u2019s position, which would place a burden upon the pro se defendant to recognize both legal and factual errors in the plea process in order to survive summary dismissal on post-conviction, would inevitably result in certain defendants being improperly denied any meaningful review of plea proceedings, despite the constitutional right to a direct appeal (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6). For example, assume that a defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced after being improperly admonished or after some other legal error occurs. The defendant asks his attorney to file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea and appeal but counsel, for whatever reason, fails to do so. No motion to withdraw the plea is filed, no record is made that counsel reviewed the proceedings for error, and no appeal is taken. The defendant subsequently files a pro se post-conviction petition alleging that he asked his counsel to file a motion to withdraw the plea and appeal, but that his counsel ignored the request. Based upon the State\u2019s reasoning, the post-conviction circuit court must dismiss the petition as frivolous and patently without merit because no grounds for filing the Rule 604(d) motion are set forth. Thus, even though the circuit court has no assurance that an attorney has ever reviewed the plea proceedings for error, and even though, despite the defendant\u2019s request, no appellate review of any kind has occurred, the defendant\u2019s petition is given no further consideration. This result is unacceptable.</p> <p id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">The State makes an additional argument that involves a comparison of post-conviction proceedings and Rule 604(d). The State maintains that placing a burden on pro se defendants at the initial stage of post-conviction to specify grounds for withdrawing their guilty pleas puts these defendants in no more difficult a position than a defendant who, after pleading guilty, is without counsel and who therefore must file a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Rule 604(d). Thus, according to the State, the burden it seeks to place on defendant in this case is a reasonable one. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267\">Rule 604(d) states that upon receipt of a pro se motion to withdraw a guilty plea</p> <blockquote id=\"b267-7\" pgmap=\"267(99) 268(13)\">\u201c[t]he trial court shall then determine whether the defendant is represented by counsel, and if the defendant is indigent and desires counsel, the trial court shall appoint counsel. *** The defendant\u2019s attorney shall file with the trial court a certificate stating that the attorney has consulted with the defendant either by mail or in person to ascertain his contentions of error in the sentence or the entry of the plea of guilty, has examined the trial court file and report of proceedings of the plea of guilty, and has made any amendments to the motion necessary for adequate presentation of any defects in those proceedings.\u201d 145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d).</blockquote> <p id=\"b268-6\" pgmap=\"268\">Rule 604(d) adequately addresses the concerns relating to attorney representation that arise when a defendant files a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Once a pro se defendant notifies the circuit court that he wishes to withdraw his guilty plea and appeal, the protections offered by Rule 604(d), i.e., the appointment of counsel and the attorney certificate, are automatically triggered. See, e.g., People v. Griffin, 305 Ill. App. 3d 326, 330 (1999) (\u201cAfter a defendant demonstrates his desire to appeal, the trial judge is obligated to inquire whether the defendant seeks counsel\u201d). Significantly, as our appellate court has explained, there is no provision in Rule 604(d) for dismissing a pro se motion to withdraw a guilty plea as frivolous. This is so because \u201c[i]t would be contrary to the purpose of the rule to draw a conclusion about the legal basis of the defendant\u2019s motion before he has had an opportunity to consult with an attorney to insure that there is legally \u2018adequate presentation of any defects\u2019 (107 Ill. 2d R. 604(d)) in his guilty plea proceedings. Because of the \u2018strict waiver requirements of Rule 604(d), fundamental fairness requires that a defendant be afforded a full opportunity to explain his allegations and that he have assistance of counsel in preparing the motion.\u2019 \u201d People v. Velasco, 197 Ill. App. 3d 589, 591-92 (1990), quoting People v. Ledbetter, 174 Ill. App. 3d 234, 237-38 (1988); see also People v. Pegues, 277 Ill. App. 3d 884, 888 (1996); People v. Barnes, 263 Ill. App. 3d 736, 738-39 (1994); People v. Adams, 74 Ill. App. 3d 727, 731 (1979); People v. Moore, 45 Ill. App. 3d 570, 572 (1976).</p> <p id=\"b268-7\" pgmap=\"268(61) 269(58)\">Contrary to the State\u2019s assertions, a defendant proceeding pro se under Rule 604(d) faces a significantly lesser burden than that which the State seeks to place on defendant in the case at bar. A pro se defendant under Rule 604(d) does not have to make an \u201cadequate presentation of any defects\u201d (145 Ill. 2d R. 604(d)) in his guilty plea proceedings or face summary dismissal because there is no provision in Rule 604(d) that provides for summary dismissal of a pro se motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Accordingly, the State\u2019s attempt to equate the burden it would place on defendant in this case to the one faced by pro se defendants under Rule 604(d) is unavailing.</p> <p id=\"b269-5\" pgmap=\"269\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b269-6\" pgmap=\"269\">Because there is nothing of record to establish that defendant\u2019s trial counsel ever reviewed the plea proceedings for error before deciding not to pursue an appeal, and because it is contrary to the holdings o\u00ed Flores-Ortega and Rodriquez under these circumstances to require defendant, who is proceeding pro se, to provide grounds for withdrawing his guilty plea and his appeal, we hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing defendant\u2019s petition at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings. Whether, in the circumstances of this case, defense co\u00fcnsel\u2019s decision not to file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel requires the appointment of an attorney who will be able to consult with defendant regarding his claim and explore in more detail the factual and legal ramifications of defendant\u2019s claim. At this juncture, it would be inappropriate to conclude that defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is so completely lacking in substance that it is frivolous or patently without merit.</p> <p id=\"b269-7\" pgmap=\"269(88) 270(62)\">Our holding is limited to the specific issue before us, i.e., whether the circuit court erred in dismissing defendant\u2019s petition at the first stage of the post-conviction proceedings. We do not hold that defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. To merit an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he told his trial counsel to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to do so, defendant will have to make a substantial showing to that effeet. See Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 381. Such a showing will necessarily entail some explanation of the grounds that could have been presented in the motion to withdraw the plea. Since defendant will be at the second stage of the post-conviction proceedings and will be represented by an attorney, rather than proceeding pro se, this will not present an unreasonable burden.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the appellate court and the circuit court are reversed. The cause is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b270-7\" pgmap=\"270\">Appellate court judgment reversed; circuit court judgment reversed; cause remanded.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b270-9\" pgmap=\"270\">JUSTICE FITZGERALD,</author> <p id=\"A_c\" pgmap=\"270\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b270-10\" pgmap=\"270\">I agree with the majority that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing the defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition. I write separately to discuss the confusion surrounding so-called first-stage dismissals under section 122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) of the Act. Understandably, there is great reluctance to accept dismissal of a petition filed by an indigent defendant without the benefit of counsel. This reluctance, and the vague language contained in section 122 \u2014 2.1, have led to the use of the terms \u201cgist\u201d and \u201clow threshold\u201d in an effort to define the first-stage pleading standard. I write separately to discuss the problems inadvertently created by these terms.</p> <p id=\"b270-11\" pgmap=\"270(64) 271(40)\">In 1983, the General Assembly amended the Act to include section 122 \u2014 2.1, which directed the trial court to conduct a threshold evaluation of post-conviction petitions and to dismiss those which were \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cpatently without merit.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 122 \u2014 2.1(a). The Act currently provides: \u201cIf the petitioner is sentenced to imprisonment and the court determines the petition is frivolous or is patently without merit, it shall dismiss the petition in a written order, specifying the findings of fact and conclusions of law it made in reaching its decision.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b271-5\" pgmap=\"271\">The General Assembly, however, never defined \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cpatently without merit.\u201d Instead, our appellate court provided the initial gloss on these terms. In People v. Baugh, 132 Ill. App. 3d 713 (1985), the defendant, whose pro se post-conviction petition was summarily dismissed, argued that section 122 \u2014 2.1 violated due process because it denied counsel to indigent defendants. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court approved federal legislation requiring indigent habeas corpus petitioners to prepare petitions without the benefit of counsel. Baugh, 132 Ill. App. 3d at 717; see Rodriguez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327, 330, 23 L. Ed. 2d 340, 344, 89 S. Ct. 1715, 1717 (1969); see also Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 488, 21 L. Ed. 2d 718, 722, 89 S. Ct. 747, 750 (1969) (\u201cIt has not been held that there is any general obligation of the courts, state or federal, to appoint counsel for prisoners who indicate, without more, that they wish to seek post-conviction relief\u201d). The court then observed:</p> <blockquote id=\"b271-6\" pgmap=\"271\">\u201cWhile it is obvious that counsel should be better able to more artfully draft a petition than an indigent petitioner unschooled in legal drafting, it is certainly not clear that an indigent petitioner could not present the gist of his claim so that the trial court could make an initial determination as to whether *** the claim is frivolous. An indigent petitioner is not deprived of post-conviction relief. We do not find a denial of due process by the operation of section 122 \u2014 2.1.\u201d Baugh, 132 Ill. App. 3d at 717.</blockquote> <p id=\"b271-7\" pgmap=\"271\">See also People v. Dredge, 148 Ill. App. 3d 911, 913 (1986) (\u201ca petition for post-conviction relief need only contain a simple statement which presents the gist of a claim for relief which is meritorious when considered in view of the record\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b272-4\" pgmap=\"272\">Three years later, in People v. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d 64 (1988), this court rejected a similar due process argument, noting that an indigent defendant is entitled to appointed counsel after the trial court determines that the claims are not frivolous or patently without merit. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d at 74. We held that, \u201cUnder the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, the [defendant] must set forth the specific manner in which his rights were violated. [Citation.] The [defendant] does not have to construct legal arguments or cite to legal authority. Once the [defendant] sets out allegations demonstrating a meritorious constitutional claim, he is entitled to have counsel represent him ***.\u201d Porter, 122 Ill. 2d at 74. We then quoted Baugh with approval, recognizing that an indigent defendant may be able to present the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d at 74.</p> <p id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">In the wake of our opinion in Porter, however, our appellate court continued to grapple with the sufficiency of pleadings required to survive the first stage of a post-conviction proceeding, and with the meaning of \u201cgist.\u201d Compare People v. Sanders, 209 Ill. App. 3d 366 (1991) (holding that in the first stage of the proceedings a petitioner must set forth facts which show the denial of a constitutional right), with People v. Von Perbandt, 221 Ill. App. 3d 951 (1991) (holding that limited detail is required to survive the first stage of the proceedings). In People v. Lemons, 242 Ill. App. 3d 941, 946 (1993), the appellate court attempted to clarify the meaning of \u201cgist\u201d:</p> <blockquote id=\"b272-6\" pgmap=\"272\">\u201cA \u2018gist of a meritorious claim\u2019 is not a bare allegation of a deprivation of a constitutional right. Although a pro se defendant seeking post-conviction relief would not be expected to construct legal arguments, cite legal authority, or draft her petition as artfully as would counsel, the pro se defendant must still plead sufficient facts from which the trial court could find a valid claim of deprivation of a constitutional right.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b272-7\" pgmap=\"272(7) 273(91)\">Thereafter, other appellate panels relied upon Lemons for the standard in determining whether to dismiss a petition during the first stage of the proceedings. See, e.g., People v. Prier, 245 Ill. App. 3d 1037, 1040 (1993) (\u201c \u2018[although a pro se [litigant] *** would not be expected to construct legal arguments, cite legal authority, or draft her petition as artfully as would counsel, the pro se defendant must still plead sufficient facts from which the trial court could find a valid claim\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original)), quoting Lemons, 242 Ill. App. 3d at 946.</p> <p id=\"b273-5\" pgmap=\"273\">In People v. Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d 410, 418 (1996), we had a chance to clarify Porter and the first-stage pleading standard. An extended quotation from Gaultney is necessary to show what we said, and what we did not say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b273-6\" pgmap=\"273\">\u201cPursuant to the Act, a post-conviction proceeding that does not involve the death penalty has three distinct stages. In the first stage, the defendant files a petition and the circuit court determines whether it is frivolous or patently without merit. At this stage, the Act does not permit any further pleadings from the defendant or any motions or responsive pleadings from the State. Instead, the circuit court considers the petition independently, without any input from either side. To survive dismissal at this stage, a petition need only present the gist of a constitutional claim. People v. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d 64, 74 (1988). This is a low threshold and a defendant need only present a limited amount of detail in the petition. At this stage, a defendant need not make legal arguments or cite to legal authority. Porter, 122 Ill. 2d at 74. The Act provides that the petition must be supported by \u2018affidavits, records, or other evidence supporting its allegations\u2019 or the petition \u2018shall state why the same are not attached.\u2019 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2 (West 1992). If the circuit court does not dismiss the petition pursuant to section 122 \u2014 2.1, it is then docketed for further consideration.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418.</blockquote> <p id=\"b273-7\" pgmap=\"273(51) 274(26)\">In the first instance, I note that the facts in Gaultney presented a peculiar hybrid of the first and second stages; the trial court had dismissed the petition as frivolous, but only after the State had filed a motion to dismiss. At issue in Gaultney was whether the State\u2019s motion to dismiss tainted the trial court\u2019s first-stage review of the petition. We did not directly address the level of pleadings required to survive the first stage.</p> <p id=\"b274-5\" pgmap=\"274\">More importantly, Gaultney did not redefine the first-stage pleading requirement \u2014 it did not mention any dispute regarding the pleading threshold for first-stage dismissals; it did not correct, modify, or clarify this threshold; and it did not set a new standard. Gaultney simply followed the course we set in Porter. I believe that Gaultney is consistent with Lemons. Although Gaultney does not directly refer to the \u201csufficient facts\u201d pleading requirement stated in Lemons, it does state that a petition must be supported by some degree of factual evidence. Both opinions discuss the necessity to present factual evidence in order to state the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim. The consistent tenor of post-Gaultney appellate court cases supports this reading. See People v. Truly, 318 Ill. App. 3d 217, 222 (2000); People v. Patton, 315 Ill. App. 3d 968, 972 (2000) (citing Lemons); People v. Donley, 314 Ill. App. 3d 671, 673-74 (2000) (quoting Lemons); People v. Hill, 308 Ill. App. 3d 691, 698-99 (1999) (citing Gaultney, Porter, and Lemons); People v. Douglas, 296 Ill. App. 3d 192, 197 (1998) (quoting Lemons); People v. Davison, 292 Ill. App. 3d 981, 985 (1997) (citing Gaultney and Lemons); People v. McClain, 292 Ill. App. 3d 185, 190 (1997) (reconciling Gaultney and Lemons), overruled on other grounds, People v. Woods, 193 Ill. 2d 483 (2000); People v. Anderson, 287 Ill. App. 3d 1023, 1031 (1997) (citing Gaultney and Lemons).</p> <p id=\"b274-6\" pgmap=\"274(63) 275(92)\">The present case illustrates the confusion that exists surrounding the meaning of the term \u201cgist.\u201d In this court\u2019s original opinion, before we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for rehearing, the majority concluded that in order to allege ineffective assistance of counsel on the basis that an attorney failed to preserve appeal rights, a defendant must show the \u201cgrounds he or she would have had to withdraw his or her plea of guilty had the proper motion\u201d been filed by counsel. The opinion provided, \u201c[w]e refuse to create a rule which would require defense counsel to invent grounds for withdrawal of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea when defendant fails to provide counsel with an articulable basis for doing so and he offers none in his post-conviction petition.\u201d The allegations contained in the petition \u2014 the defendant\u2019s order, \u201cFile an appeal,\u201d and the attorney\u2019s response, \u201cOn what grounds\u201d \u2014 did not state the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim.</p> <p id=\"b275-5\" pgmap=\"275\">The current opinion, which I join, reaches the opposite conclusion from the same set of facts. We now hold that the allegation of a mere request to file an appeal, and an attorney\u2019s failure to perfect that appeal, is sufficient to state the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim. I agree with this conclusion because the facts, as alleged in the defendant\u2019s petition, show the real possibility of a valid constitutional claim in two ways. First, the exchange between the defendant and his attorney, in which the attorney asked the defendant \u201cOn what grounds\u201d he sought to appeal, leads me to believe that further conversation occurred. Once the attorney asked, \u201cOn what grounds,\u201d it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant provided a response. This entire exchange warranted further inquiry by the trial court. Second, if the defendant did not respond to counsel\u2019s inquiry, and counsel failed to do or say more, her lack of a response warranted further inquiry. The defendant\u2019s attorney was required to advise the defendant: an attorney may not relieve herself of the obligation to represent a defendant by forcing the defendant to provide a legal theory or basis for the claim.</p> <p id=\"b275-6\" pgmap=\"275(34) 276(88)\">Notwithstanding my agreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion, I find that this case shows the inherent problems caused by the vague language contained in section 122 \u2014 2.1. Certainly, judicial economy is not accomplished in cases such as this, where \u201cgist\u201d is interpreted in two different ways. We should be vigilant to avoid catchwords like \u201cgist\u201d which shortcut reliance on the relevant statutory language, though I note that we have previously employed the term \u201cgist\u201d to include the elements of a crime. See People v. Steenbergen, 31 Ill. 2d 615, 619 (1964) (\u201cIn a prosecution for robbery, the gist of the action is that the accused forcibly took property that was in the care, custody, or control of another person\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b276-5\" pgmap=\"276\">Instead, we should rely first on the language used within the Act. Section 122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) addresses petitions which are \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201cpatently without merit.\u201d \u201cFrivolous\u201d means \u201cof little weight or importance: having no basis in law or fact.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 913 (1993); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 677 (7th ed. 1999); accord Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493, 498, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 1400 (1967) (legal points \u201carguable on their merits\u201d are not frivolous). \u201cPatently\u201d means \u201cclearly, obviously, plainly.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1654 (1993); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1147 (7th ed. 1999). \u201cMerit\u201d means \u201clegal significance, standing, or importance.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1414 (1993); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1003 (7th ed. 1999). Consequently, the trial court should dismiss petitions having no basis in law or fact or petitions which clearly, obviously, and plainly lack legal significance.</p> <p id=\"b276-6\" pgmap=\"276(80) 277(221)\">In my view, this standard does not require the defendant to set forth the claim \u201cin its entirety\u201d (197 Ill. 2d at 244), but it does require the defendant to plead sufficient factual allegations to support a valid claim of deprivation of a constitutional right. See Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418 (\u201cThe Act provides that the petition must be supported by \u2018affidavits, records, or other evidence supporting its allegations\u2019 \u201d), quoting 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2 (West 1992); Porter, 122 Ill. 2d at 74 (\u201cUnder the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, the petitioner must set forth the specific manner in which his rights were violated\u201d); see also People v.

People v. Scott, 194 Ill. 2d 268, 279 (2000) (the Act establishes an original and independent remedy by a civil proceeding); People ex rel. Fahner v. Carriage Way West, Inc., 88 Ill. 2d 300, 308 (1981) (\u201cIllinois is a fact-pleading State. *** The complaint is deficient when it fails to allege the facts necessary for the plaintiff to recover\u201d); accord Vernon v.

Vanden Dorpel, 172 Ill. 2d 399, 408 (1996). This standard allows the trial court to exercise its screening function to dispose of frivolous petitions which raise claims that have no constitutional basis or present constitutional claims clearly rejected by controlling case law.</p> <p id=\"b277-5\" pgmap=\"277\">A consistent theme runs through the legislative debates: section 122 \u2014 2.1 was enacted to allow trial judges to evaluate and dismiss frivolous petitions without incurring the expense of copying transcripts and appointing counsel. That is, the purpose of section 122 \u2014 2.1 was not to prevent the filing of post-conviction petitions, but, according to Senator Sangmeister:</p> <blockquote id=\"b277-6\" pgmap=\"277\">\u201c[A]t least let a judge look at it ***. *** [Tjhat\u2019s what we have judges for, let them look at the petition and if it has merit, fine ***.

Representative Hawkinson stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b279-5\" pgmap=\"279\">\u201cThis is an excellent piece of legislation. It will not create a new bureaucracy in any sense. What happens too often under the present law is a frivolous post-conviction petition will be filed, and when I say frivolous, and what this Bill addresses is a petition will be filed by some jailhouse lawyer that will state one ground. It will state, for example, that I deserve to have my conviction thrown out because I was improperly represented by the public defender. Anyone that looks at the record in the case can easily see that the person was not even represented by a public defender, but was represented by a private attorney. This is the type of thing that the Bill addresses, where a quick look at the record in the case will show that the petition is absolutely untrue. There [is] no need to go to the expense of appointing a court appointed lawyer, of bringing the individual back from the penitentiary. It only addresses that type of petition.\u201d 83d Ill. Gen.

These comments demonstrate that the General Assembly intended section 122 \u2014 2.1 to serve as a modest barrier to meritless petitions. Lowering the defendant\u2019s pleading burden too far contradicts the legislature\u2019s intent.</p> <p id=\"b280-6\" pgmap=\"280\">Today\u2019s opinion raises an additional concern. In order to provide clarity to the Act, this court has divided the Act into a progression of \u201cstages.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418. In order to prevail in the second stage of the proceedings, a defendant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of a violation of constitutional rights.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 4 (West 1998). The underlying purpose of the entire Act, however, is to provide relief from a \u201csubstantial denial\u201d of rights under the United States or Illinois Constitutions. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b280-7\" pgmap=\"280\">In the current opinion, the majority states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b280-8\" pgmap=\"280(28) 281(66)\">\u201cAt the outset of its opinion, the appellate court correctly indicated that the issue presented in this case is whether defendant\u2019s petition is frivolous or patently without merit.

Under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, defendant has the burden of showing a substantial violation of his constitutional rights occurred in the proceedings that resulted in his conviction. Defendant\u2019s petition failed to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel ***.

The relevant question in the case at bar is not whether defendant\u2019s petition makes a substantial showing of a constitutional violation; that is a second stage inquiry.\u201d (Emphases added.) 197 Ill. 2d at 246.</blockquote> <p id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281\">The majority criticizes the appellate court\u2019s incidental use of the word \u201csubstantial,\u201d but misapprehends the appellate court\u2019s opinion. The appellate court, in referring to a \u201csubstantial violation\u201d simply sought to focus attention on the central purpose of the Act \u2014 to provide a procedural mechanism through which a defendant can assert \u201cthat in the proceedings which resulted in his or her conviction there was a substantial denial of his or her rights under the Constitution of the United States or of the State of Illinois or both.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 (West 1998); see Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 378-79. The appellate court did not, as the majority charges, wrongfully impose a higher \u201csubstantial showing\u201d burden. At the outset, the appellate court recognized that the defendant need only \u201cassert the gist of a constitutional claim.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d at 855. The appellate court\u2019s statement was not inappropriate, but rather \u201cgeneral terminology that is common in post-conviction proceedings.\u201d Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 422.</p> <p id=\"b281-7\" pgmap=\"281(41) 282(47)\">The conclusions reached in our own cases show that reasonable persons have difficulty determining whether the defendant\u2019s allegations have met the murky frivolousness standard. These cases depend more on fact variances and less on cognizable legal standards, and the legal standards we have formulated inadvertently aggravate this confusion. In light of the continuing struggle of Illinois courts to bring clarity and certainty to the Act\u2019s pleading requirements for first-stage petitions, I believe that the trial bench and bar should approach first-stage proceedings with caution.</p> <p id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">Where doubt exists regarding dismissal at the first stage, the trial court should not hesitate to allow the claim to proceed to the second stage, where counsel may amend the petition and craft a more proper pleading for the court\u2019s review. If the petition is dismissed at the second stage of the proceedings, a reviewing court is presented with more adequately pleaded facts. Conversely, if the defendant is granted an evidentiary hearing, the defendant will obtain that which by law is his right. At present, this solution serves both the ends of justice and judicial economy.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b282-6\" pgmap=\"282\">JUSTICE GARMAN,</author> <p id=\"AHX\" pgmap=\"282\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b282-7\" pgmap=\"282\">I believe the trial court correctly dismissed defendant\u2019s pro se post-conviction petition as frivolous and patently without merit because the petition failed to allege grounds for the withdrawal of defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p> <p id=\"b282-8\" pgmap=\"282(122) 283(139)\">The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 1998)) limits a defendant to constitutional challenges of the proceedings that resulted in his conviction. A post-conviction proceeding is a collateral attack on a prior conviction and sentence and \u201cis not a substitute for, or an addendum to, direct appeal.\u201d People v. Kokoraleis, 159 Ill. 2d 325, 328 (1994). In such a proceeding, the defendant bears the burden of establishing a substantial deprivation of his constitutional rights. People v. Guest, 166 Ill. 2d 381, 389 (1995). As noted by the majority, under the Act, a post-conviction proceeding not involving the death penalty is divided into three stages. People v. Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d 410, 418 (1996). At the first stage, the trial court examines the defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition and shall dismiss the petition if it is frivolous or patently without merit. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a) (West 1998). At this stage, the petition need only present the \u201cgist\u201d of a constitutional claim. Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418. If the petition survives first-stage dismissal, it will advance to the second stage, where the court must determine whether the defendant has made a substantial showing of a violation of his constitutional rights. At this stage, the trial court shall appoint counsel, if necessary, to represent an indigent defendant. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 4 (West 1998). If the post-conviction petition advances to the third stage, the trial court will conduct an evidentiary hearing. 725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 6 (West 1998); Gaultney, 174 Ill. 2d at 418.</p> <p id=\"b283-5\" pgmap=\"283\">In his pro se post-conviction petition, defendant alleged that his trial counsel \u201chad taken it or decided for herself not to file an appeal, in spite of [his] numerous requests to [do so].\u201d The trial court determined that this allegation was one of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal to this court, defendant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to perfect his right to appeal by filing a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced him. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 697-98, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984).</p> <p id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283(64) 284(207)\">The determinative fact in this case is defendant\u2019s choice to plead guilty. Entering a guilty plea is a \u201c \u2018grave and solemn act.\u2019 \u201d People v. Evans, 174 Ill. 2d 320, 326 (1996), quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747, 756, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (1970). It is not a \u201c \u2018temporary and meaningless formality reversible at the defendant\u2019s whim.\u2019 \u201d Evans, 174 Ill. 2d at 326, quoting United States v. Barker, 514 F.2d 208, 221 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In Illinois, a defendant who pleads guilty is not entitled to a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence. To challenge his guilty plea, the defendant must first file with the trial court \u00e1 motion to withdraw his plea and vacate the judgment against him. This motion \u201cshall be in writing and shall state the grounds therefor.\u201d 188 Ill. 2d R. 604(d). If the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea is allowed, the plea of guilty, sentence, and judgment will be vacated and a trial date will be set. 188 Ill. 2d Rs. 605(b)(3), 604(d). In this instance, there is no appeal. If, on the other hand, the motion is denied, only that decision can be considered on review. Evans, 174 Ill. 2d at 329. Further, a voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional errors or irregularities. People v. Peeples, 155 Ill. 2d 422, 491 (1993); People v. Horton, 143 Ill. 2d 11, 22 (1991); People v. Del Vecchio, 105 Ill. 2d 414, 433 (1985); see also 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel &amp; N. King, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 21.6 (2d ed. 1999).</p> <p id=\"b284-5\" pgmap=\"284(95) 285(42)\">Unlike the defendant who is convicted pursuant to a guilty plea, the defendant who chooses to go to trial and is convicted has an automatic right to an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant who chooses to be tried maintains his innocence. As the appellate court noted, \u201c[f]or a defendant convicted after trial, who has always professed innocence, the right to appeal insures due process and provides an important safety net to those who may have been wrongly convicted.\u201d 305 Ill. App. 3d 853, 858. The defendant who appeals from a conviction following a trial may raise any issue on appeal as long as that issue has been properly preserved. See People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 186 (1988) (both a trial objection and a written post-trial motion raising the issue are required to preserve alleged errors).</p> <p id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285\">Thus, when a defendant, convicted after trial, asks his attorney to file a notice of appeal and the attorney fails to do so, that defendant\u2019s right to appeal has been violated. This is what occurred in Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327, 23 L. Ed. 2d 340, 89 S. Ct. 1715 (1969). There, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that the defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition, in which he alleged \u201cthat his retained counsel had fraudulently deprived him of his right to appeal,\u201d needed to specify the points he would raise on appeal. Rodriquez, 395 U.S. at 329, 23 L. Ed. 2d at 343, 89 S. Ct. at 1716. The Court noted that \u201c[tjhose whose right to appeal has been frustrated should be treated exactly like any other appellants; they should not be given an additional hurdle to clear just because their rights were violated at some earlier stage in the proceedings.\u201d Rodriquez, 395 U.S. at 330, 23 L. Ed. 2d at 344, 89 S. Ct. at 1717.</p> <p id=\"b285-6\" pgmap=\"285(137) 286(72)\">Similarly, in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985, 120 S. Ct. 1029 (2000), the defendant was denied his right to appeal by counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal. The defendant entered a plea of guilty pursuant to a California rule that permitted him both to deny committing a crime and to admit the evidence was sufficient to convict him. The trial judge advised the defendant of his right to file an appeal within 60 days. Counsel failed to file a notice of appeal within the requisite period and the defendant\u2019s subsequent pro se notice was rejected as untimely. Then, the defendant filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief pursuant to section 2254 of the United States Code (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1994)), alleging constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel based on his counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal after she promised to do so. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 474, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 993, 120 S. Ct. at 1033. The majority concludes that in Flores-Ortega, \u201cthe Supreme Court rejected the proposition that Rodriquez is limited to those cases where a defendant\u2019s conviction is obtained following a trial.\u201d 197 Ill. 2d at 250. I disagree with this conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b286-5\" pgmap=\"286\">The Flores-Ortega decision was premised on the performance prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel. The question presented in the case was whether counsel is deficient for failing to file a notice of appeal when the defendant has not clearly conveyed his wishes one way or the other. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 477, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 995, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. The majority correctly notes that \u201cthe question at \u2018the heart of the case\u2019 was \u2018[ujnder what circumstances does counsel have an obligation to consult with the defendant about an appeal?\u2019 \u201d 197 Ill. 2d at 251, quoting Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 996, 120 S. Ct. at 1035. The Court, however, also discussed the prejudice prong of Strickland. The Court held that assuming the defendant\u2019s counsel was deficient under the first prong, that deficiency completely deprived the defendant of appellate proceedings he wanted and \u201cto which he had a right.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. This denial required a presumption of prejudice under the second prong. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 999, 120 S. Ct. at 1038. The Court noted that the prejudice standard \u201cbreaks no new ground, for it mirrors the prejudice inquiry applied in *** Rodriquez v. United States.\u201d Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 485, 145 L. Ed. 2d at 1000, 120 S. Ct. at 1039. This prejudice standard is inapplicable to the case at bar because a defendant who pleads guilty in Illinois is not entitled to an appeal.</p> <p id=\"b287-4\" pgmap=\"287\">The defendant in Flores-Ortega entered a plea of guilty pursuant to California law. In California, a defendant convicted following a plea of guilty \u201cshall, within 60 days after the judgment is rendered, file as an intended notice of appeal the statement required by section 1237.5 of the Penal Code; but the appeal shall not be operative unless the trial court executes and files the certificate of probable cause required by that section.\u201d Cal. Rules of Court, R. 31(d) (2001). Section 1237.5 of the California Penal Code provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b287-5\" pgmap=\"287\">\u201cNo appeal shall be taken by the defendant from a judgment of conviction upon a plea of guilty *** except where both of the following are met:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b287-6\" pgmap=\"287\">(a) The defendant has filed with the trial court a written statement, executed under oath or penalty of perjury showing reasonable constitutional, jurisdictional or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b287-7\" pgmap=\"287\">(b) The trial court has executed and filed a certificate of probable cause for such appeal with the county clerk.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1237.5 (West 2000).</blockquote> <p id=\"b287-8\" pgmap=\"287\">California law, unlike the law of this state, does not require a defendant to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Although a defendant in California must comply with section 1237.5\u2019s written statement and certificate of probable cause requirements, the defendant maintains his right to appeal. Further, he maintains the right to assert on appeal any \u201creasonable constitutional, jurisdictional or other grounds going to the legality of the proceedings.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1237.5(a) (West 2000).</p> <p id=\"b287-9\" pgmap=\"287(58) 288(67)\">In contrast, the Illinois defendant is not entitled to directly appeal his conviction'and sentence following a plea of guilty. As previously noted, Rule 604(d) requires him to first file a motion with the trial court to withdraw his plea. If the defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea, the plea, sentence, and judgment will be vacated and the defendant will proceed to trial. If the motion is denied, the defendant may then appeal only the denial of that motion. Therefore, in Illinois, even when a defendant who has been convicted pursuant to a guilty plea requests his attorney to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the attorney\u2019s failure to do so is not a per se violation of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal.</p> <p id=\"b288-5\" pgmap=\"288\">This court\u2019s decision in People v. Wilk, 124 Ill. 2d 93 (1988), is instructive on the issue presented in this case. In Wilk, the defendants pled guilty to various charges and defense counsel filed notices of appeal. Defense counsel, however, failed to file motions to withdraw defendants\u2019 guilty pleas pursuant to Rule 604(d). We held that Rule 604(d) serves as a condition precedent for an appeal from a defendant\u2019s guilty plea. Wilk, 124 Ill. 2d at 105. The defendants, however, were not without a remedy. The remedy could be found in the Act:</p> <blockquote id=\"b288-6\" pgmap=\"288\">\u201c[I]n a post-conviction petition, the defendant pro se needs only to allege a violation of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, due to the attorney\u2019s failure to preserve appeal rights, and allege whatever grounds he or she would have had to withdraw his or her plea of guilty had a proper motion to withdraw been filed by defendant\u2019s counsel prior to the filing of a notice of appeal. At the hearing on the post-conviction petition, the two-pronged test laid down in Strickland v. Washington will apply to determine if in fact the defendant has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Wilk, 124 Ill. 2d at 107-08.</blockquote> <p id=\"b288-7\" pgmap=\"288(91) 289(78)\">A defendant who pleads guilty in this state voluntarily places himself in a different position from a defendant who is convicted after trial. The defendant who pleads guilty has given up his right to appeal unless he has grounds to withdraw his plea. When a judgment is entered upon a plea of guilty, the defendant is put on notice that, to challenge the judgment, he must provide grounds for the withdrawal of his plea. 188 Ill. 2d R. 605(b). If the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea is granted and the defendant is subsequently convicted after trial, he may then appeal that conviction. Consequently, the defendant who pleads guilty must state grounds for the withdrawal of his plea at the first stage of post-conviction if he alleges that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal. He must state more than just that his attorney did not file an appeal. Here, defendant has not alleged enough.</p> <p id=\"b289-5\" pgmap=\"289\">The majority\u2019s conclusion essentially eliminates the first stage of post-conviction when a defendant alleges he was denied an appeal due to ineffective assistance of counsel; whether the defendant pleaded guilty or was convicted after trial. The petition, according to the majority, need only allege that the defendant requested counsel to file an appeal and that counsel failed to do so. These petitions will automatically proceed to the second stage of post-conviction where the trial court will appoint counsel.</p> <p id=\"b289-6\" pgmap=\"289\">The majority\u2019s holding pl\u00e1ces defendants convicted after pleading guilty and defendants convicted after trial on equal footing in post-conviction proceedings where it is alleged that counsel deprived a defendant of appellate proceedings. I cannot agree with this result. Defendant failed to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to allege grounds for the withdrawal of his guilty plea. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p> <p id=\"b289-7\" pgmap=\"289\">JUSTICE THOMAS joins in this dissent.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b284-6\" pgmap=\"284\">Appeals, however, must be perfected by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within 30 days after the entry of the final judgment appealed from. In cases in which a death sentence is imposed, an appeal is automatically perfected without any action by the defendant or his counsel. 188 Ill. 2d R. 606(b).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
