The Board filed a cross-application to enforce its order requiring the company to allow the Union access to the plant for this study. The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 175 N.L.R.B. No. 48. We have jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 10(e) and (f) of the Act, 29 U. S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">The company and the Union bargained between January of 1967 and May of 1968. These bargaining sessions stemmed from the Board\u2019s earlier order requiring the employer to bargain with the union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">Prior to the commencement of bargaining, the company obtained new time and motion studies from a qualified engineering firm and used these studies as a basis for unilaterally changing its incentive wage system and establishing new wage rates, work quotas and standards for piecework production for employees in most departments of the company. Beginning in April of 1967, the Union on several occasions asked the company for permission to make its own time studies of factory operations. It felt a need for this information to determine the propriety of new piecework quotas and pay rates installed by the company. The company, however, denied the Union access to the plant for this study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">By the spring of 1968, negotiations failed to culminate in any contract. The Union again vigorously renewed its request for time and motion studies by its own engineers of various employees\u2019 operations in the plant. The company\u2019s reiteration of a denial of this request forms the basis for the present unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">During negotiations, the company fully disclosed to the Union the results and underlying data of its own engineers\u2019 time and motion studies. The company argues that this disclosure conclusively negates any proper reason or cause underlying the Union\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-11\">The parties agree that the Union has no absolute right to obtain its own independent time studies of the employer\u2019s operations, but must show that such information is necessary for intelligent negotiation. The parties, however, do not dispute that the bargaining agent for the plant employees needed time study information to properly perform his duties. The employer\u2019s studies may not necessarily fulfill that need. The Union is entitled to independently verify all factors underlying piecework incentive pay rates and to evaluate allowances computed for variable criteria such as thread breakage, machine downtime and employee fatigue. The company\u2019s disclosure in this case should not foreclose the Union from obtaining its own time studies as a basis for its negotiations for wages and other conditions of employment. The Union\u2019s need for this information is apparent and the Board\u2019s decision is not contrary to precedent. See McGraw-Edison Co. v. NLRB, 419 F.2d 67, (8th Cir., December 4, 1969), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-12\">We grant enforcement of the Board\u2019s order and deny the petition of Hamburg Shirt Corporation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">.
