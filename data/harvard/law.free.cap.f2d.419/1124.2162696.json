The dispositive question presented is whether the district court violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel in defense of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">The indictment was filed on December 5,1967. Appellant appeared for arraignment on December 18, without counsel. Pertinent to the issue presented here is what transpired at that time, shown by the following excerpts from the arraignment transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-10\">\u201cQ. [By Mr. Nelson, assistant United States Attorney] All right. Now before proceeding any further we note you are appearing in Court without an attorney. Do you have an attorney to represent you in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-11\">A. [By appellant] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-12\">Q. Do you have money with which to hire an attorney if you desired one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-13\">A. Well, not that hasn\u2019t been committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-14\">Q. [By the District Court] What do you mean by that? I don\u2019t understand it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-15\">A. Well, I am buying some land, and I put up all my belongings for security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-16\">Q. But you do have some land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-18\">Q. How much ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-19\">A. More than 160 acres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-20\">Q. How much more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-21\">A. 1,520 acres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-22\">Q. And located where, Hayes County or Lincoln County \u2014 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-23\">A. Lincoln and Hayes County; and Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-24\">Q. Well then the fact of the matter is you have got money enough to hire a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-25\">A. I wouldn\u2019t say that, your Honor. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-26\">Q. * * * I think you should consider the question of whether you shouldn\u2019t hire counsel. And I have a notion, having been raised in the adjoining county of the counties you have mentioned that if you have as much land as you have there you could hire counsel if you wanted to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-27\">A. Well, I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it would be very wise to be lying to you, your honor if I had the money I have this committed. \u2666X- * 4fr <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1185-29\">The district court made no further inquiry into the actual financial status of appellant. Rather, the court apparently assumed that appellant could not qualify for appointed counsel as an indigent, since he had indicated that he held an equity in 1,520 acres of land. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty, and the court stated that the case would be tried early in 1968. Appellant was particularly admonished by the judge several times in the course of the arraignment hearing to employ private counsel to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>On April 23, 1968, the date set for trial, appellant appeared with an attorney. The latter moved for a continuance. After colloquy, between the court and the attorney, the court was informed that appellant now desired to enter a plea of guilty as charged. Following a searching probe of appellant as to the volun-tariness of his guilty plea, however, the court concluded that the change of plea was not in fact truly volitional and therefore was not acceptable. Following a brief recess during which appellant and the attorney conferred outside of the courtroom, the attorney was permitted to withdraw from the case upon oral motion. The trial was continued to May 1, but the court emphatically informed appellant that it would countenance no further delay and the case would be tried on the specified date. Appellant was again urged to employ counsel, but the court cautioned him that if he failed to do so, he would have to represent himself at the May 1 trial. The court did not inquire of appellant at this proceeding whether he was able to retain counsel, apparently standing upon its earlier assumption that appellant was not in fact an indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">The case went to trial as scheduled on May 1. Appellant, having failed to retain counsel, attempted to represent himself. The trial was concluded on May 3, and, as stated, the jury found appellant guilty as charged. Thereafter, the court sentenced appellant to imprisonment for 2 years, providing that execution of all but 4 months of the sentence would be suspended. Appellant was also placed on probation for a period of 3 years, to commence following service of the 4-month term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">After filing timely notice of appeal, appellant petitioned this court to appoint counsel to represent him on appeal. In support of this petition, appellant executed a CJA Form 3a, \u201cAffidavit of Financial Status,\u201d which shows that, as of July 29, 1969, appellant \u201cHas indefinite \u2018equity\u2019 in 1520 Acres; not presently the owner; may have a cause of action against titled owner. Has interest in ASCS \u2018wheat certificates\u2019 \u2014 face value $4100. May be disputed, however.\u201d The remainder of the affidavit indicated that the 7 acres owned by appellant at his homesite had an estimated value of $500-750 and was encumbered by a tax lien for $560, that his 1964 automobile was mortgaged for an outstanding bank loan in excess of $1,000, that he was otherwise indebted for approximately $10,750, and that he had only $200 cash on hand. On the basis of this affidavit, which has never been controverted by the government, this court appointed an attorney to represent appellant on appeal, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A. In addition to the information submitted to this court by appellant in support of his application for appointment of counsel, we were informed at oral argument that the 1520 acres were under mortgage at the time the indictment was filed. Moreover, the assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted the charge and argued this appeal indicated at oral argument that his office was aware of the fact that foreclosure proceedings were imminent or in process when the case was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">The Sixth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court entitles a defendant in Federal court who is unable to retain private counsel in defense of a felony charge to the services of an attorney appointed by the court. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); Rule 44, Fed.R. Crim.P. This right to counsel may be waived, but such a waiver is not valid unless the defendant has been informed of his right to appointed counsel and then intelligently and understandingly rejects the offer in clear and unmistakable language. Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948); Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 69-71, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Johnson v. Zerbst, supra at 464-465 of 304 U.S., 58 S.Ct. 1019. Any waiver must clearly appear on the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-8\">\u201cPresuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible.. The record must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u201d Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 890, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">In this case, the record clearly reveals and the government concedes on appeal that, contrary to the statement of the district court in its final judgment order, the appellant at no time waived his right to appointed counsel. Indeed, the record reflects that appellant made efforts to retain counsel and obviously desired to be fairly represented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">The government, however, argues that appellant was not entitled to appointment of counsel because he was not an indigent within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 and the Sixth Amendment. But indigency in that sense is not necessarily equatable with destitution. Rather, the status comprehended is a more realistic one. T.he plan for implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 adopted by the District Court for the District of Nebraska pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006 A(a) and approved by the judicial council of this circuit provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018financial inability,\u2019 as considered for the purposes of this plan, does not mean indigency. The defendant does not have to be destitute to be eligible for an appointment of counsel. The Judge * * * need only be satisfied that the representation essential to an adequate defense is beyond the means of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">As we have shown, the appellant clearly indicated at arraignment that he was unable to employ private counsel because his existing assets were then \u201ccommitted.\u201d At that juncture, the district court was under a duty to make further inquiry, by whatever means appropriate, into appellant\u2019s financial condition in order to satisfactorily determine whether his apparent assets in the form of an unspecified interest in real estate so exceeded his outstanding liabilities that he could <em>in fact </em>afford to employ an attorney. See Wood v. United States, 389 U.S. 20, 88 S.Ct. 3, 19 L.Ed.2d 20 (1967), rev\u2019g per curiam 373 F.2d 894 (5th Cir. 1967), on remand, 387 F.2d 353 (5th Cir. 1968) ; Cuevas v. Wilson, 264 F.Supp. 65, 71-72 (N.D.Cal.1966). The Criminal Justice Act of 1964 provides that the court, \u201cif satisfied after <em>appropriate inquiry </em>that the defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent him.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(b) (emphasis added). The assumption of adequate liquidity from appellant\u2019s bald statement of \u201cI am buying some land,\u201d coupled with the court\u2019s per- \u2022 sonal knowledge of land values in the area of appellant\u2019s acreage, is not a sufficiently \u201cappropriate inquiry\u201d to ensure the appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. In light of the uncontroverted showing of appellant\u2019s indigency in this court, \u201cthe record does not convincingly show that there was adequate inquiry into the question of [appellant\u2019s] financial ability to retain counsel, * * Wood v. United States, 389 U.S. at 20-21, 88 S. Ct. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-15\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court for a new trial. Upon remand, the district court shall appoint counsel to represent appellant at the new trial unless, after full and adequate inquiry, it appears that appellant is then in a position to afford private counsel of his own choice. We pretermit decision on the issue of the admissibility of appellant\u2019s alleged incriminating statements to a government investigator, without prejudice to a determination of that issue by the district court at the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-16\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
