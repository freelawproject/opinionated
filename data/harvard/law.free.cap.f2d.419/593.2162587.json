Do these words relate to a prison term of fixed or minimum length, as contrasted with the common \u201cnot more than * * * years\u201d, or, on the other hand, do they relate to a prison term <em>which must be served </em>and as to which postconviction benefits of suspension of sentence, probation, and parole are specifically denied?</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">William Herbert Jones appeals pro se and in forma pauperis from the denial of his motion, allegedly based on 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255 and Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P., to vacate and set aside his sentence and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-24\">In August 1965 an indictment was returned in the Western District of Arkansas charging Jones with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that on May 25, 1965, while effecting a robbery of the United States Post Office at Bonnerdale, Arkansas, of cash and blank money orders, he, by the use of a pistol, assaulted, wounded, and placed in jeopardy the life of the acting postmaster. After a plea of not guilty Jones was tried to a jury and was convicted. The 25-year sentence specified by the last part of \u00a7 2114 was imposed on October 19. The judgment, however, contained the following additional provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-25\">\u201cIt is further adjudged that pursuant to the provisions of Section 4208 (a), Title 18, United States Code, five years is hereby fixed as the time after which the defendant shall be eligible for parole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-26\">The reference to \u00a7 4208(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is obviously directed to \u00a7 4208(a) (1) and not to \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>4208(a) (2). The reference in \u00a7 4208(a) (1) to one-third of the maximum sentence is geared to the general parole eligibility provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Jones was assigned to Leavenworth. He alleges that on reaching the penitentiary he was informed that the parole provision did not apply to one who had received the 25-year sentence provided by \u00a7 2114.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In his petition, filed April 18, 1969, to the district court Jones asserted that \u00a7 2114 \u201ccarries a mandatory penalty\u201d; that a provision for parole \u201cis inapplicable\u201d; that his sentence is illegal and should be vacated; that he should be returned for resentencing; and that the new sentence \u201cshould not be inconsistent with the original intent of this most honorable Court.\u201d Presumably, Jones would imply, by all this, that a 5-year sentence was the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The district court denied Jones\u2019 motion without a formal hearing but ordered the modification of the judgment of conviction \u201cby striking therefrom all reference to the provision of 18 U.S.C. 4208(a).\u201d In its memorandum-order the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adu-dedup-0\">\u201cThe sentence of twenty-five years is mandatory by the terms of the statute he was charged with violating, and since the length of the sentence is man-datorily fixed by the statute, the court was in error in providing in the judgment of conviction that, under the provision of 18 U.S.C. 4208(a), the defendant would be eligible for parole after service of five years of the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201cThe court is of the opinion that the sentence as pronounced was and is valid, and that the mere insertion in the sentence of the provision in an attempt to make applicable 18 U.S.C. 4208(a) was and is ineffective and void. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuA\">\u201cOnly questions of law are raised by the motions of the petitioner, and all facts necessary to the determination of the questions are reflected by the record. * * * If the motion of petitioner were granted and the entire sentence set aside, it would necessarily follow that he would be given another 25 year sentence since the court is convinced that it would not be justified in placing him on probation at this time, but this should not be construed as any indication that the petitioner would not be entitled to parole if he conforms to all rules and regulations after he had served one-third of the sentence of twenty-five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">In his appellate briefs Jones states that he accepted his sentence in good faith and waived his rights for appeal and Supreme Court review; that had he not been given the parole date he would have appealed; that the district court intended that he be eligible for parole in 5 years; and that he has already served 4 years \u201cstriving at all times to meet the requirements of parole.\u201d Jones thus finds himself in a position where, having asked in his way for relief, he ends up with something seemingly more unassailable than before.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Section 4208(a) (1), quoted in footnote 2 above, authorizes the sentencing court to set an earlier time for parole eligibility than would otherwise be the ease under the one-third-of-the-term measure established by \u00a7 4202. The difference for Jones would be that between 5 years and 8% years and, because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>now has served more than 4 years, the difference appears to him to be critically important.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The difficulty, however, arises from the fact that \u00a7 4208 (along with \u00a7 4209, relating to young adult offenders, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 334, relating to institutes and joint councils on sentencing) had its birth with the Act of August 25, 1958. Pub. L. No. 85-752, 72 Stat. 845. Section 7 of that Act states, \u201cThis Act does not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 72 Stat. 847. Is, therefore, the fixed 25-year sentence prescribed by the last part of \u00a7 2114 a \u201cmandatory penalty\u201d which makes unavailable the discretionary parole eligibility provisions of \u00a7 4208(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We start with two factors of some significance. The first is an observation in S.Rep. No. 2013 (1958) accompanying H.J.Res. 424 (which became Pub.L. No. 85-752), 2 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 3891-3892 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cPURPOSE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the proposed legislation, as amended, is to improve the administration of justice by authorizing the Judicial Conference of the United States to establish institutes and joint councils on sentencing and to provide additional methods of sentencing. The legislation does not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">\u201cAs set forth under \u2018Purpose\u2019 above, the proposed legislation provides that it shall not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty. This is to assure that the mandatory penalties provided by statute for special categories of crime, <em>such as armed robbery of a post office </em>and violations of the Narcotic Control Act of 1926, as amended by the Narcotics Control Act of 1956, shall not be affected in any way by the provisions of the bill\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">The second, supplied by Jones, is a statement in a communication dated June 6, 1969, from Eugene N. Barkin, Legal Counsel for the Bureau of Prisons, to the warden at Leavenworth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">\u201cIt has always been the position of this office, as explained in our earlier memorandum, that parole eligibility under Section 4208(a) could be used on Armed Postal Robbery cases. There is some indication in the legislative history to the contrary however.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">With these somewhat opposing observations we turn to the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\"><em>The narcotic cases. </em>Section 7237(d) of 26 U.S.C. is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The denial of general parole eligibility (by the reference to \u00a7 4202) to these violators came with the amendment of \u00a7 7237(d) by the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, being the Act of July 18, 1956, ch. 629, Title I, \u00a7 103, 70 Stat. 568. Ten years later the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966, being the Act of November 8, 1966, Pub.L. 89-793, Title V, \u00a7 501, 80 Stat. 1449, inserted the words, \u201cand in the case of a violation of a law relating to narcotic drugs\u201d, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>thus, though backhandedly, opened the way for marijuana offenders to be eligible for parole under \u00a7 4202: See H. Rep. No. 1486 and Conf.Rep. No. 2316 (1966), 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 4245 at p. 4262 and 4263 at 4269 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">These positive statutory provisions seem clear enough and, indeed, the courts have held, apparently consistently, that the penalties imposed by the designated narcotic statutes are \u201cmandatory\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 7 of the 1958 Act. O\u2019Neal v. United States, 332 F.2d 152 (9 Cir. 1964); Vaughn v. United States, 359 F.2d 809, 810 (7 Cir. 1966); Rivera v. United States, 318 F.2d 606, 609-610 (9 Cir. 1963) (concededly a marijuana situation but one prior to the 1966 amendment, noted above, which made the parole provisions of \u00a7 4202 available to a marijuana offender); Trujillo v. United States, 377 F.2d 266 (5 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 899, 88 S.Ct. 224, 19 L. Ed.2d 221 (same). See Munich v. United States, 337 F.2d 356, 361 (9 Cir. 1964); Smith v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 324 F.2d 436, 439 n.6 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 978, 11 L. Ed.2d 975; Robinson v. United States, 313 F.2d 817, 820 (7 Cir. 1963); Berry v. United States, 412 F.2d 189 (3 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">It is to be noted, however, that, in these situations, the door is closed to <em>all </em>relief for the offender by way of suspension of sentence, probation, and parole. His sentence must be served. It is \u201cmandatory\u201d in the true sense of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\"><em>The armed postal robbery cases under the last part of </em>\u00a7 <em>2114. </em>With precedent so firmly established in the narcotic area, it is perhaps not too surprising that there are decisions in the books that a postal offense violative of the last portion of \u00a7 2114 (a statute, incidentally, which has roots back to 1799) also occasions a mandatory penalty to which the benefits of \u00a7 4208(a) are unavailable. Rulings to this effect were made by the Seventh and Sixth Circuits on the very same day in 1965. In United States v. Cameron, 351 F.2d 448 (7 Cir. 1965), the court rested its decision simply on \u00a7 7 of the 1958 Act and the cited Senate Report\u2019s reference to \u201carmed robbery of a post office\u201d. That defendant\u2019s motion to \u201cmodify or reduce\u201d his 25-year sentence and to have the benefit of \u00a7 4208 had been denied by the district court on the ground that it lacked discretion to apply the parole statute. In United States v. Hardaway, 350 F.2d 1021 (6 Cir. 1965), the district court had imposed the 25-year sentence and, as in the case before us, had provided that the defendant should become eligible for parole as the board of parole determined. Hardaway, as did Jones, argued that the parole provision was illegal and moved to correct his sentence. This was denied. On appeal the government conceded that the case should be remanded but with instructions to strike the parole provision. The court of appeals vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. It, too, felt that there was no power to authorize parole because of the restrictive language, in the 1958 Act. The court cited, however, the <em>Donovan </em>and <em>Smith </em>cases, both referred to below and described them as situations where the courts permitted probation for a \u00a7 2114 offense but were \u201cnot empowered to authorize the use of parole\u201d. 350 F.2d at 1022. This comment as to the holdings in <em>Donovan </em>and <em>Smith </em>about probation is correct, but we read both <em>Donovan </em>and <em>Smith </em>in vain for any reference therein as to the unavailability of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">On the other hand, it now seems established, despite an earlier apparently contrary holding in Tesar v. United States, 128 F.2d 591 (6 Cir. 1942), that one convicted of a violation of the last phrase of \u00a7 2114 may have the benefit of a suspended sentence and probation under 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 3651. United States v. Donovan, 242 F.2d 61, 64 (2 Cir. 1957); Smith v. United States, 284 F.2d 789, 791 n. 2 (5 Cir. 1960); United States v. Cameron, supra, 351 F.2d at 449; United States v. Hardaway, supra, 350 F.2d at 1022 (where the court did not cite its earlier seemingly contrary holding in <em>Tesar). </em>See Andrews v. United States, 373 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>334, 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383 (1963). It is interesting to observe that in United States v. Donovan, supra, 242 F.2d at 64, Judge Medina phrased the issue in terms of whether the 25-year sentence \u201cis absolutely mandatory\u201d or is subject to suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We have come to the conclusion that we must disagree with the results reached in the <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Hardaway </em>cases, and we hold that the benefits of \u00a7 4208(a) are available for discretionary use by the sentencing court for a defendant convicted of a violation of the last phrase of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114. We do so because :</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">1. It seems to us that it is illogical and inconsistent to hold on the one hand, as the cases clearly do, that a \u00a7 2114 offender may have his entire sentence suspended and be placed on probation, and yet, on the other hand, to deny to him the lesser benefit of parole after serving some time. It makes no sense to go all the way on suspension and probation and yet be unable to go part of the way on incarceration for a time and then parole. If the 25-year sentence is not mandatory so as to preclude probation or suspension, it should not be mandatory so as to prevent the sentencing court from exercising parole discretion under \u00a7 4208 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">2. The situation with respect to the narcotic offenses described in \u00a7 7237(d) produces no inconsistency. There all is denied \u2014 suspension, probation, and parole, and each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">3. The Congress has carefully delineated in \u00a7 7237(d) the narcotic offenses with respect to which suspension, probation, and parole are denied. Just as meticulously the Congress in 1966 removed the marijuana offender from the proscription as to parole. But the denial of these benefits to the armed postal robbery offender has to be read, if at all, in a statute less specific and less clear than \u00a7 7237(d) and is made to depend upon a narrower reading of the word \u201cmandatory\u201d than the example of \u00a7 7237(d) permits. Just as Judge Medina reasoned in the <em>Donovan </em>case that we need more and greater congressional assurance for a denial of the general statutory provisions fof probation, so here we need greater congressional assurance for the denial of otherwise broadly applicable parole provisions. We thus are inclined to channel \u00a7 7 of the 1958 Act only into statutes such as \u00a7 7237(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">4. We know of nothing which prevents the application and availability of the general parole eligibility provisions of \u00a7 4202 to one who has received the 25-year sentence under \u00a7 2114. If the 25-year term and its specificity are to be significant enough to render relief under \u00a7 4208(a) unavailable, there would be no reason why relief under \u00a7 4202 should not also be rendered unavailable. Such is not the case. Yet both statutes effectuate the same policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">5. The attitude of the Bureau of Prisons, as revealed by the letter of the legal counsel, is not without significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">6. The reference to armed robbery of a post office in the 1958 Senate Report is, of course, somewhat troublesome as a matter of legislative history. That reference, however, is not supported with cited authority. It may have been no more than an honest but gratuitous insert of an example which the scrivener assumed without accompanying research. The statement is of doubtful validity in view of the Second Circuit\u2019s prior holding in United States v. Donovan, supra, and it is undercut by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s subsequent observation in Smith v. United States, supra. In any event, the statement is not authoritative. Construction of an existing statute is a task for the courts and not for legislative committees. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall long ago observed that \u201ca mistaken opinion of the legislature concerning the law, does not make law.\u201d Postmaster-General of U. S. v. Early, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 136, 148, 6 L.Ed. 577 (1827); Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U.S. 149, 162, 40 S.Ct. 438, 64 L.Ed. 834 (1920). See United States v. Philadelphia Nat\u2019l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 83 S.Ct. 1715, 10 L.Ed.2d 915 (1963), where the Court held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>proposed consolidation of banks was forbidden by \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act, despite the observation in H.Rep. No. 1416 (1960), 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, 86 Cong., 2 Sess. 1995 at 1998 (1960), that \u201cthe Clayton Act offers little help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASj\">7. The Supreme Court in Andrews v. United States, supra, seems to take a broad view of the choices open to the trial court when a defendant is convicted of a violation of the last phrase of \u00a7 2114:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a6i-dedup-0\">\u201cThe District Court may, as before, sentence the petitioners to the same 25 years\u2019 imprisonment; it may place one or both of them on probation; <em>it may make some other disposition </em>with respect to their sentences.\u201d 373 U.S. at 340, 83 S.Ct. at 1240 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">There is no intimation in that language that parole is unavailable. Indeed, the implication is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In summary: We hold that the term \u201cmandatory penalty\u201d in \u00a7 7 of the 1958 Act means a sentence which must be served devoid of the benefits of suspension, probation, and parole. Illustrative of this are the sentences for the narcotic offenses described in \u00a7 7237(d). We further hold that a 25-year sentence imposed pursuant to the last part of \u00a7 2114 is not a mandatory penalty within the meaning of \u00a7 7 of the 1958 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Jones, therefore, is entitled to parole eligibility under \u00a7 4208(a) (1) in accord with the originally imposed sentence. His prison records should be corrected accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Jones, of course, must recognize that the parole board need not grant him parole status merely because the time for his parole eligibility arrives. The granting of parole is discretionary with the board. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4203(a); Cagle v. Harris, 349 F.2d 404, 405 (8 Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 965, 86 S.Ct. 455, 15 L.Ed.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">This result makes it unnecessary for us to consider the secondary issue whether the district court could regard the reference in the original judgment to \u00a7 4208(a) as mere void material and sur-plusage, subject to being stricken, or whether the judgment must be vacated and the case remanded for formal resen-tencing. Compare the procedure noted or directed in Coon v. United States, 411 F.2d 422, 423 (8 Cir. 1969); United States v. Hardaway, supra, 350 F.2d at 1022; and Robinson v. United States, supra, 313 F.2d at 822, with that in Bailey v. United States, 301 F.2d 299 (7 Cir. 1962), and O\u2019Neal v. United States, supra, 332 F.2d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Jones\u2019 respective motions to vacate and set aside his sentence and to return him for resentencing were properly denied and that denial is affirmed. To the extent, however, that the district court\u2019s order would modify the 1965 sentence by striking therefrom all reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a), it is vacated and the sentence as originally imposed remains.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-14\">. \u201c\u00a7 2114.
