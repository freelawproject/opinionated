The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, granted the Appellees motion for summary judgment on the ground that the stipulated damage was expressly excluded by the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The parties stipulated that on May 3, 1966, a fracture occurred in the crankshaft of a motor driven air compressor owned by Appellant. This breakdown of machinery caused the Appellant\u2019s facility to be shut down until the machinery could be repaired. The only direct physical damage to tangible property was to the air compressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The parties further stipulated the actual loss sustained by Appellant resulting from the interruption and extra expense was $42,637.01; and that the amount recoverable in the event of a ruling for the Appellant would be $37,637.-01, together with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum from March 11, 1967, the date when the award of the appraisers was determined and filed. The difference between the actual appraised loss and the amount recoverable is due to the existence of a $5,000.00 \u201cdeductible\u201d provision in the policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The policy of insurance that is the subject of the instant case contains two basic sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The first, known as the Difference of Conditions Form,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> insured the Appellant\u2019s real and personal property against \u201call risks of direct physical loss of or damage to the property insured,\u201d subject to certain specific exceptions for which the insurer offers no coverage. This basic policy, being one for physical damage to tangible property, provides no coverage for business interruption losses. The second section of the policy is an endorsement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> insuring Appellant against loss from \u201cbusiness interruption,\u201d and \u201cextra expense\u201d related thereto, \u201ccaused by damage to * * * property * * * by the perils insured against.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The sole question on appeal is whether this second section of the policy insured the Appellant\u2019s business interruption losses, and extra expenses related thereto, when the sole damage to real or personal property of the Appellant was caused by mechanical breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">In construing the coverage of the business interruption endorsement, the language of the parties should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Foote Mineral Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 173 F.Supp. 925 (D.C.Tenn.) aff\u2019d 277 F.2d 452 (6th Cir.), cert. denied 364 U.S. 818, 81 S.Ct. 49, 5 L.Ed.2d 48 (1959). American Alliance Ins. Co. v. Keleket X-Ray Corp., 248 F.2d 920 (6th Cir.1957). <em>See also, </em>Annot. 17 Am.Jur. 2d Contracts \u00a7 245 at 634-635 and 83 A. L.R.2d 885, 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">In determining the plain meaning of an insurance contract, the contract should be read as a whole and each word given its appropriate meaning, if possible. Significant variations in the language employed should be attributed their reasonable and logical meaning. Farmers\u2019 National Bank v. Delaware Insurance Co., 83 Ohio St. 309, 337, 94 N. E. 834 (1911), Annot., 83 A.L.R.2d 885, 896. <em>See, </em>American Alliance Ins. Co. v. Keleket X-Ray Corp., 248 F.2d 920 (6th Cir.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">In those instances where the wording of an insurance contract is doubtful or ambiguous, the contract is construed in a manner most favorable to the insured. The basis of this rule is that the insurer \u2014 who formulates the insurance contract and proffers it to the insured for the ostensible benefit of the insured in the event of a loss \u2014 is responsible for the language employed. Furthermore, the purpose of the contract being to provide insurance coverage, an interpretation of doubtful terms which construes the language to provide such coverage tends to effectuate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>presumed good faith intent of the contracting parties. Munchick v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N. Y., 2 Ohio St.2d 303, 209 N.E.2d 167 (1965), and Peterson v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 175 Ohio St. 551, 197 N.E.2d 194 (1964). <em>See also </em>Chavers v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 295 F.2d 812 (6th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Turning now to the instant insurance policy and endorsement, we find that the parties have contracted for a limited indemnification at Appellant\u2019s facility. The endorsement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201c1. Business Interruption</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">A. Subject to all its provisions and stipulations, <em>this policy covers against loss </em>resulting directly from necessary interruption of business <em>caused by damage to </em>or destruction of real or personal <em>property, </em>except finished stock, <em>by the peril(s) insured against. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\u201c4. Extra Expense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Q\">A. Subject to all its provisions and stipulations, this policy covers the necessary <em>Extra Expense, </em>as herein defined, incurred by the insured in order to continue as nearly as practicable the normal operation of the business, <em>immediately following damage to or destruction of the building or contents thereof, by perils insured against. </em>* * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The scope of coverage of business interruption losses and related extra expenses is defined by the phrases\u2014 \u201ccaused by damage to * * * property, * * * by perils insured against\u201d and \u201cimmediately following damage to * * * [property], by perils insured against.\u201d These modifying phrases give rise to conflicting interpretations of the coverage for business interruption losses, and related extra expenses, when \u2014 as stipulated in the instant ease \u2014 such losses and expenses result from a \u201cmechanical breakdown\u201d in machinery. On the one hand, the phrases could be so read as to place a single condition upon recovery for losses and expenses \u2014 that is, the losses be caused by damage to property insured under the first part of the policy. On the other hand, the modifying phrases can be read as placing two separate prerequisites on recovery under the second part of the contract \u2014 that is, first, the loss must be caused by damage to property; and second, the loss must be caused by a \u201cperil insured against.\u201d In the stipulated facts of the instant case, the first of these interpretations would preclude recovery and the latter interpretation would permit recovery in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The District Court denied recovery. It observed that the business interruption endorsement did not cover all business interruption losses, but only those losses following \u201cdamage to tangible property, by perils insured against.\u201d In effect, the District Court dismissal of the complaint indicates that the intention of the contracting parties was to provide indemnity only for -business interruption losses which specifically arise from \u201cinsured\u201d property damage under the first section of the policy. Such an interpretation of the contract language construes the phrase \u201cby perils insured against\u201d as modifying \u201cdamage to [tangible] property\u201d and creating a single precondition to recovery for losses: the presence of \u201cinsured\u201d property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">We are of the opinion that the modifying phrases \u201cdamage to [tangible] property\u201d and \u201cby perils insured against\u201d may be considered as creating two separate and independent conditions for recovery upon business interruption losses, rather than a single condition of insured property damage, as the District Court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">The first condition of the presence of \u201cdamage to property\u201d is met by the stipulation of the parties that there was a fracture in the air compressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">The second condition that the losses must be caused by a \u201cperil insured against\u201d is met by the language of \u00a7 9 of the basic policy. That section provides that a \u201cmechanical breakdown\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>a \u201cperil excluded\u201d only for the limited purposes of certain damage \u201cto machinery and equipment,\u201d its repair and replacement. For all other purposes, a \u201cmechanical breakdown\u201d is a \u201cperil insured against\u201d under the basic policy. Any subsequent damage caused by such breakdown as a piece of machinery breaking off and cracking the walls or causing a fife which destroyed property would be indemnified.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">That \u201ca mechanical breakdown\u201d may be treated as a \u201cperil insured against,\u201d except for certain limited purposes of the basic property insurance, is indicated by significant variations in the terms of the contract. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the basic policy define the terms \u201cperils insured against\u201d and \u201cperils excluded;\u201d they read, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201c8. <em>Perils Insured Against: </em>Except as hereinafter excluded this policy insures against all risks of direct physical loss of or damage to the property insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201c9. <em>Perils Excluded: </em>There is no liability under this policy for loss or damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">(a) Caused by: (1) hostile or warlike action. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">(b) Caused by nuclear reaction. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">(e) to machinery and equipment, caused by mechanical or electrical breakdown within such machinery or equipment. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">The placement of the phrase \u201ccaused by\u201d in the insurance clauses defining \u201cexcluded perils\u201d reveals that some perils shall be excluded entirely (e.g., those resulting from warlike action or nuclear reaction), while other shall only be partially excluded (e.g. a mechanical breakdown shall be excluded only insofar as it causes in certain manner damage to machinery and equipment).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Insofar as a peril is wholly and entirely excluded from the first section of the contract (damage from nuclear reaction), any business interruption losses resulting from that excluded peril would not be indemnified because such losses would not result from \u201cdamage to property by a peril insured against.\u201d On the other hand, if business interruption losses flow from a mechanical breakdown \u2014 which is an \u201cexcluded peril\u201d for certain limited purposes and \u201ca peril insured against\u201d for all others \u2014 it is not clear whether such partially excluded perils are to be treated as \u201cperils insured against.\u201d While the only damage to tangible property by the mechanical breakdown was excluded from coverage, this fact does not negate the language of the contract which infers by the variation in the position of the phrase \u201ccaused by\u201d that a mechanical breakdown may be generally considered a \u201cperil insured against.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">The language of the contract does not unambiguously condition recovery on the presence of insured property damage under the basic policy as the Appellee insurance company argues; nor does it provide sufficient guidance as to whether a mechanical breakdown is to be treated as a \u201cperil insured against\u201d for purposes of business interruption losses. We believe that from the language employed by the insurance company one cannot clearly ascertain that the exclusionary clause is applicable to the facts in this case. Therefore, applying the principles set out earlier in this opinion we hold that ambiguous language is to be construed strictly against the insurance company. It could have drawn up a policy unambiguously conditioning recovery for business interruptions solely upon the occurrence of insured property damage. The insured is entitled to the benefit of the ambiguity created by the insurance, company\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-16\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter judgment for Appellant in the sum of $87,637.01, together with interest at the rate of six percent per annum commencing March 11, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>APPENDIX 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">DIFFERENCE OF CONDITIONS.
