He was represented by counsel at arraignment and with advice of counsel entered a plea of guilty. At a later proceeding in absence of counsel he was sentenced to a term of twelve to twenty-five years, which sentence he is now serving in the custody of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-18\">In these proceedings in habeas corpus appellee attacks the sentence imposed upon the ground that he had not waived counsel at the time of sentencing. The District Court entertained hearing on the claim, found in favor of appellee and directed that he be resentenced or released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-20\">This appeal was taken by Arizona on behalf of appellant warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-21\">There was no transcript of the proceedings at the time of sentencing. A minute entry of the proceedings reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-22\">\u201cDefendant is present.without counsel and desires that the Court proceed without counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-23\">Before the District Court appellee testified that his counsel did not appear with him at the sentencing proceeding; that he was asked if he wanted to proceed without counsel, to which he answered no; that an effort was made to locate his counsel and that, pursuant to such effort, everyone \u201csat there about 15, 20 minutes before the clerk recalled [petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s] office and still couldn\u2019t locate him.\u201d The petitioner then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-24\">\u201cSo he [the Court] said, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t locate your attorney. What do you want to do?\u2019 I told him that I didn\u2019t know what to do. So he said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll proceed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-25\">Testimony of others who were present at the time of sentencing could cast no light on the question of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-26\">In Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 890, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962), it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1435-27\">\u201cThe record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understanding^ rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1435-28\">Arizona\u2019s proof falls far short of this. Even assuming the accuracy of the court record, there was nothing to indicate that counsel was intelligently and understanding waived. <em>See </em>Wilson v. Wiman, 386 F.2d 968 (6th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1042, 88 S.Ct. 1634, 20 L.Ed.2d 303 (1968). The finding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>District Court that petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily waive counsel cannot on this record be said to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
