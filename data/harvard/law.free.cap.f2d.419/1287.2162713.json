He urges that the time he spent \u201cin custody\u201d but on parole must count as time served on his three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">As explained by the trial judge who heard the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-11\">\u201cIn essence, petitioner\u2019s argument is that after revocation of parole and return to prison, he was entitled to have the time during which he was on parole credited against [his] sentence because while on parole he was in the constructive custody of the Attorney General.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">Such a legal' position is specifically contrary to congressional enactment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-13\">\u201c * * * and the time the prisoner was on parole shall not diminish the time he was sentenced to serve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-22\">This court has rejected appellant\u2019s contention in Chandler v. Johnson, 133 F.2d 139, 142 (9th Cir. 1943), and Van Buskirk v. Wilkinson, 216 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-23\">These cases not only reject appellant\u2019s contention \u2014 they also uphold the constitutionality of the statutory release on parole procedure quoted above. It is only when congressional enactment transcends constitutional limitations, such as the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, enactment of ex post facto laws, and the like, that such statutes can be held unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-24\">We affirm what we said in <em>Van Buskirk, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-25\">\u201cWhen appellant was conditionally released, he became subject to all the provisions of law relating to parole, one of which was that if he violated his parole he should again be taken into custody and the time spent on parole should not diminish the time he was originally sentenced to serve.\u201d (p. 738)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-26\">Other courts, in an unbroken line of cases, have come to the same conclusion and have rejected appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We know of no cases to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-27\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 242-243, 83 S. Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963), is misplaced. It held only that a prisoner on parole was in technical \u2018custody\u2019 for the purpose of filing a petition for ha-beas corpus. It did not consider appellant\u2019s claim of unconstitutionality. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>was said in O\u2019Callahan v. Attorney General, 1 Cir., 351 F.2d 43 at 44 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIV-\">\u201cPetitioner accepted the parole \u2018custody\u2019 in the hope that it would discharge the balance of his prison sentence. Had he not violated the conditions it would have done so. The Constitution does not require that he have it both ways.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1348-14\">. First Circuit: O\u2019Callahan v.
