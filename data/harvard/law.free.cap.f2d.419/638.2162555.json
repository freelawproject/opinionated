A division of this court first heard the matter and, with one judge dissenting, affirmed, although only after attributing to the trial court a construction of the statute more restrictive than that thought necessary by the D.C. Court of Appeals. Because the statute is not one this court has construed before, and because of doubts as to the basis upon which appellant was charged and tried, consideration of the case <em>en banc </em>was deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We find that a narrower reading of the statute than that given by the D.C. Court of Appeals would be essential to its valid application. This construction of the statute, in turn, would render fatally defective the information filed against appellant, necessitating the vacation of appellant\u2019s conviction and the dismissal of the charge filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">When Sir Robert Peel first entered the British Cabinet as Home Secretary, two of his most urgent goals were police reform and law reform\u2014in that order. His experience in office did, not alter his estimate of the importance of these objectives, but it did cause him to reverse the order of their accomplishment; and his achievements in police reorganization and training came largely during his eventual Prime Ministership. It is said that he speedily learned that good police performance is highly dependent upon the existence of rationally conceived and clearly formulated criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">The President\u2019s Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia has drawn the same moral, and one of its principal targets was the archiac sections of the D.C.Code relating to disorderly conduct. After noting the many thousands of disorderly conduct charges made each year by the Metropolitan Police, the Commission said that \u201c[c]lose examination of these provisions is appropriate because of their pervasive impact on police-community relations and their vulnerability to constitutional challenge.\u201d The Commission went on to note the growing involvement of this court with these statutes, and it asserted that \u201clegal as well as practical considerations suggest that review of the two disorderly conduct statutes would not only be timely but may become essential.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission remarked that instructive models for this effort were readily at hand in the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and certain newly-revised state codes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">A key recommendation of the President\u2019s Commission was that \u201cCongress enact legislation creating a Commission to revise and reform the criminal laws of the District of Columbia.\u201d This proposal rested upon the Commission\u2019s considered judgment that Code revision would \u201chelp to define criminal behavior more clearly, assist police, prosecutors and judges, and increase the deterrent and rehabilitative impact of the criminal law.\u201d The Congress created such a revising committee in 1967,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and its members were appointed. The law authorized an appropriation to enable the new commission to do its work, in an amount not to exceed $150,000 \u2014 a sum equivalent to the reputed current cost of three B-52 bombing sorties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No appropriation has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>as yet been made, although it is not clear whether the failure of initiative has been in Congress or the executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">This promising project has, accordingly, not gotten off the ground; and police, prosecutors, and courts continue to try to enforce a 71-year old disorderly conduct statute which was not at its birth a model of craftsmanlike drafting and which has certainly not improved with age.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The information filed against appellant in General Sessions Court consisted of a catch-all printed form, with lines drawn through the inapplicable parts and the blank spaces filled in with appropriate information. It alleges that appellant, on November 6, 1965, and in front of 2714 14th St., N.W.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">\u201cdid then and there use profane language, indecent and obscene words and under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby, did congregate with others on a public street and did refuse to move on when ordered by the police. * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">Although these allegations are not keyed in the information to any specific statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is conceded that the prosecution purported to be proceeding under two separate sections of Title 22 of the Code, namely, Section 1107 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 1121,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>each of which is quoted in full in the margin. The alleged use of \u201cprofane language, indecent and obscene words\u201d is thought to violate Section 1107, while the charge of congregating and refusing to move on under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned is bottomed upon Section 1121(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Although the record indicates that a reporter was present at the trial before the General Sessions Court sitting without jury, the D.C. Court of Appeals refused appellant\u2019s request to have a transcript prepared at public expense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant, with new counsel who was not present at the trial, was therefore obliged to proceed on a \u201cStatement of Proceedings and Eyidence\u201d signed by the trial judge some four and one-half months after the trial had occurred. This statement described the testimony as being to the effect set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The prosecution\u2019s first witness was a police officer (Freto) who testified that at about 7:30 P.M., on November 6,1965, he and his police partner (Bizeub) were walking south in the 2700 block of 14th Street, N.W. It was Saturday night, the area was generally congested, and the sidewalks were crowded. In front of a laundromat at 2742 14th Street, the officers saw appellant and four other men standing in a semi-circle. Although the sidewalk was said to be about 13 or 14 feet wide, Officer Freto said that the men were blocking the flow of pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk, and that he and his partner had to walk around the group of men. Therefore, before continuing south on 14th Street, the officer told the men to move on. After advancing some 200 to 300 feet further down the street, Officer Freto noticed that the five men had disobeyed his order and had not dispersed. The officers therefore backtracked, and again told the men they were blocking traffic and would have to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">All but appellant obeyed the command. He, according to Officer Freto, said that he was not going anywhere, and that \u201cno God damn policeman\u201d could make him move, for he was the manager of the laundromat in front of which he was standing. The officer testified that he replied that the sidewalk was no place to conduct business, and that he again told appellant that he was violating the law by not moving. Appellant then said that \u201cno son of a bitch\u201d was going to make him move.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">According to the officer, two of appellant\u2019s companions, who had previously moved away, returned at this point and asked appellant to join them; and appellant\u2019s wife, who had been inside the laundromat, came outside and also asked him to move. Appellant continued to refuse, but did move in the direction of the laundromat. When about three or four feet from the laundromat, but while still on the sidewalk, he said to the officer: \u201cI dare you to lock my God damn ass up.\u201d The officer at this point took hold of appellant to arrest him. Appellant proceeded into the laundromat, however, and a minor scuffle ensued between him and the two officers, after which he was taken into custody. Officer Freto acknowledged, apparently on cross-examination, that he was aware that as a result of this incident a complaint to the police department had been made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The testimony of the second policeman substantially confirmed that of his colleague. He, in addition, stated that appellant had been loud and boisterous, and had at one point stated that \u201cno God damn rookie\u201d was going to make him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>move. Officer Bizeub denied using a stick or blackjack, and said that the officers had not injured appellant in the scuffle.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">At this point in the trial, the Government rested its case. The trial court, on the basis of Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 86 S.Ct. 211, 15 L.Ed.2d 176 (1965), granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss as to the refusal to move on charge under Section 1121, but the trial continued on the obscene language count under Section 1107. In defense, three witnesses, including appellant\u2019s wife testified that they had seen the policeman push appellant after hearing the policeman order him to move on. Each said that he had heard no profane words. Appellant, who took the stand, denied uttering any profane words. The trial court found the appellant guilty of violation Section 1107,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but suspended imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Affirming the conviction, the D.C. Court of Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">Appellant also maintains that the qualifying language of \u00a7 22-1121, the general disorderly conduct statute\u2014 \u201cunder circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby\u201d \u2014 must be read also into \u00a7 22-1107. We do not agree. \u00a7 22-1107 contains no provision making a consequential or probable breach of the peace an element of an offense under that section. As applicable here, it simply provides that it is unlawful \u201cto * * * use profane language * * * in any place wherefrom the same may be heard.\u201d When the charge against appellant under \u00a7 22-1121 was dismissed under the authority of <em>Shut-tlesworth </em>there was removed the need for the trial judge to find from the evidence presented that a breach of the peace was theatened by appellant\u2019s offensive language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">227 A.2d at 62. The court then went on to hold that, although there were good reasons to require a showing of relationship to a breach of the peace under the general disorderly conduct statute (Section 1121) in order to avoid First Amendment problems, there was no such need in respect of Section 1107, since \u201c[p]rofane language has never been entitled to protection under the First Amendment.\u201d 227 A.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The construction so placed upon Section 1107 by the D.C. Court of Appeals did not appear to be the critical factor to the majority of the division of this court which first heard the appeal. In affirming, it said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-11\">taking the statute <em>as applied to Appellant, </em>we need not consider the punishment of words which have no tendency to provoke a breach of the peace# It is true that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals determined that there is no need to find a tendency to a breach of the peace under section 1107. 227 A.2d at 62. But both the information and the trial court\u2019s statement described the charge for which appellant was convicted as the \u201cuse of \u2018profane, indecent and obscene words\u2019 under circumstances such that a breach of peace may be occasioned.\u201d Since the conviction is for this charge, we find no constitutional defect in the statute as applied to Appellant. And we have no occasion to consider whether the statute may be constitutionally applied in' cases where there is no tendency to a breach of the peace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">(Emphasis in original.) Citing Chap-linsky v. New Hampshire, where the Supreme Court upheld a conviction under \u201ca statute narrowly drawn and limited to define and punish * * * the use in a public place of words likely to cause a breach of the peace,\u201d 315 U.S. at 568, 573, 62 S.Ct. at 766, 770, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), the division went on to find that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>[e]ven were we to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the officer\u2019s original order to \u201cmove on\u201d was ill-advised, Appellant\u2019s verbal abuse, \u201ctrigger words,\u201d profanity, and curses directed at the officer were not a permissible response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The case in its present posture raises several issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">First, is a conviction under Section 1107 sustainable if the statute is not interpreted to require something more than simply the utterance of profane and obscene language in public? Second, if something more is required, was the information adequate, and did the trial judge apply the proper construction at the trial? Only if affirmative answers to these questions are warranted need we reach the other issues of whether there was substantial evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction, and whether appellant\u2019s actions were constitutionally privileged under the First Amendment, thus making the application of the statute to him unconstitutional. We find that Section 1107 would require an additional element in order to be constitutional. Because the information did not allege this element, we reach the result of reversal and dismissal. We have, in addition, no confidence that the trial court weighed the evidence in the light of the requisite construction and this too requires the conviction to fall. Thus, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the evidence or the constitutionality of the statute as it would have been applied to appellant had he been charged and tried properly by reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">That portion of Section 1107 which makes it illegal for any person \u201cto curse, swear, or make use of any profane language or indecent or obscene words\u201d is on it face extraordinarily broad, so broad in fact that it would allow punishment of the hapless stonemason who, after crushing his toe, innocently utters a few relieving expletives within earshot of a public place.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>.. Appellant has argued, before the D.C. Court of Appeals and this court, both to the division and <em>en banc, </em>that Section 1107 should be construed to apply only under circumstances where the language either threatens a breach of the peace, or is so grossly offensive to citizens actually hearing it as to amount to a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">The prosecution, contrarily, argued to the D.C. Court of Appeals and the division of this court that there was no necessity to narrow Section 1107 by adding an additional element to the offense. Before this court <em>en banc, </em>however, the Corporation Counsel now takes the position that the statute should be construed to include additional elements beyond its actual language,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> so that words alone will not support a conviction. With all the fervor of a recent convert, the prosecution even adduces legislative history in support of the narrowing interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">An examination of the relevant interests involved, as well as a recognition of the serious constitutional problems posed by a notably broad statute regulating speech,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> leads us to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>lieve that Section 1107 could be validly applied only if it were construed to require something more than simply the utterance of profane or obscene language in a public place. The District of Columbia appears to have no legitimate interest in punishing a person simply because he has uttered, out of the presence of anyone else, some words which might be considered \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201cprofane.\u201d As the Supreme Court has recently indicated in Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969), the state has no \u201cright to protect the individual\u2019s mind from the effects of obscenity\u201d simply because it wishes \u201cto control the moral content of a person\u2019s thoughts.\u201d This, the Court said, would be inconsistent with the \u201cphilosophy of the First Amendment.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">To determine those interests which are relevant, it is useful to examine the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). There the Court upheld, over First Amendment objections, a conviction under a New Hampshire statute which provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, nor call him by any offensive or derisive name * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">However, the New Hampshire Supreme Court had, by an earlier decision, explicitly narrowed the statute, and declared that its purpose was to protect the public peace: No words were forbidden \u201c \u2018except such as have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the persons to whom, individually, the remark is addressed\u2019. * * * Such words, as ordinary men know, are likely to cause a fight.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By affirming the conviction, the United States Supreme Court showed that the state had a legitimate interest in punishing profane or obscene words spoken in public under circumstances which created a substantial threat of violence. Both the facts of <em>Chaplinsky </em>itself,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the cases which followed it,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>, indicate that the circumstances under which words are spoken are of critical importance in deciding whether the Constitution permits punishment to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Apart from punishing profane or obscene words which are spoken in circumstances which create a threat of violence, the state may also have a legitimate interest in stopping one person from \u201cinflict [ing] injury\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> on others by verbally assaulting them with language which is grossly offensive because of its profane or obscene character. The fact that a person may constitutionally indulge his taste for obscenities in private does not mean that he is free to intrude them upon the attentions of others. In this regard, the Supreme Court\u2019s obscenity decisions are instructive. Although the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit criminal punishment of private possession of obscene materials,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> this does not mean a state cannot punish one who commercially exploits similar literature through public advertisements which are sexually provocative.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">We therefore conclude that Section 1107 would not be invalid if the statutory prohibition against profane or obscene language in public were interpreted to require an additional element that the language be spoken in circumstances which threaten a breach of the peace <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And for these purposes a breach of the peace is threatened either because the language creates a substantial risk of provoking violence,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or because it is, under \u201ccontemporary community standards,\" <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> so grossly offensive to members of the public<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> who actually overhear it as to amount to a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Corporation Counsel argues in effect that appellant\u2019s conviction can stand under this restrictive reading of the statute because (1) it was the reading which the trial judge applied in finding appellant guilty, (2) the evidence was adequate to support the verdict on this theory, and (3) appellant\u2019s behavior was not privileged under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> There is in our view, however, a defect in appellant\u2019s conviction which is not repaired by these considerations, even if they be assumed to be true. It relates to the information itself which we, unlike the division, do not read as alleging that appellant uttered the words in question under circumstances likely to cause a breach of the peace. Upon a close reading, it appears that the information was clrawn upon the premise which the prosecution relied until this rehearing <em>en banc, </em>namely, that the element of a threatened breach of the peace is not an essential one in the crime with which appellant was charged under Section 1107. The critical phrase, \u201cunder circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned,\u201d modifies the refusal to move on charge, not the profane language charge. It is hardly surprising that this should be so since that was the way the prosecutor then viewed the requirements of the two statutes. Thus, appellant was put to trial on an information omitting to charge an element which we have found would be an essential component of the crime created by Section 1107. The law is clear that an information is defective if it fails to allege a \u201ccritical element\u201d of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Rule 6(a) of the Criminal Rules of the Court of General Sessions provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">The information shall contain a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">Because the language of this rule follows that of Federal Rule 7(c),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the cases interpreting the Federal Rule provide guidance for the proper interpretation of the General Sessions Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">While an indictment or information which follows the language of the statute defining the offense is ordinarily sufficient, this is not the case if an essential element of the offense is not contained in the statutory language. Honea v. United States, 344 F.2d 798, 803-804 (5th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Honea, </em>the indictment was for the crime of obtaining money by a false impersonation of a federal employee. Although the statute defining this offense did not expressly require that the impersonation be made with an intent to defraud, the court decided that such intent was an \u201cessential element\u201d of the offense. It then held that, although the indictment followed the statutory language, it was defective for \u201cfailing to include an allegation\u201d that the impersonation was with an intent- to defraud. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">.As to whether the absence of an allegation that Honea did the acts in question with intent to defraud makes this indictment insufficient, our problem is much easier. This Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>recently stated in Walker v. United States, supra:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">\u2018It is elementary that an indictment must set forth the elements of the offense to be charged, and if it does not a conviction based thereon cannot stand.\u2019 342 F.2d [22] at 26.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">See also Russell v. United States, 1962, 369 U.S. 749, 763-764, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240; 4 Barron, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1913 and 1964 Supp. \u00a7 1913 (Wright ed.). \u2018An indictment or information in the language of the statute [as: here] ordinarily is sufficient, except where the words of the statute do not contain all of the essential elements of the offense; but if the statute omits an essential element, the indictment must supply it with certainty.\u2019 Babb v. United States, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 538, 539. One of the laudable reforms of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was to eliminate the necessity for much of the cumbersome claptrap which typically encased the common law indictment. See F.R.Cr.P. 7. Yet \u2018the substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules.\u2019 Smith v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 1, 9, 79 S.Ct. 991, 997, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041. It is often said that an indictment must (a) apprise the defendant of what he will have to meet and (b) protect him from double jeopardy. This indictment is sufficient as to (b), but, as in Russell, insufficient as to (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">344 F.2d 803, 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> This court is not disabled from noticing the defect in the information because at trial appellant may not have objected to it for failing to allege an offense.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although the Criminal Rules of the General Sessions Court do provide that most objections \u201cbased on defects * * * in the information\u201d must be raised \u201cby motion before trial\u201d to avoid a waiver, there is an explicit exception for an objection that the information fails \u201cto charge an offense.\u201d The relevant Rule in fact provides that \u201cthe failure of the information to charge an offense <em>shall be noticed by the court at any time </em>during the pendency of the proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Once again, the General Sessions Rule parallels that of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 12(b) (2). And the case law under the federal rule clearly indicates that an appellate court can notice for the first time on appeal the fact that an indictment does not contain an essential element of an offense, even though that element is not revealed in the statute itself. <em>See </em>Walker v.

The information having failed to charge an offense, the conviction founded upon it cannot stand, and the information itself is subject to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">We are reinforced in this result by a lack of certainty that the trial court weighed the evidence under a correct view of the statute. Although the division did infer that the court found appellant guilty of using profane and obscene language \u201cunder circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned,\u201d the only support in the record for that conclusion is the statement, at the beginning of the trial court\u2019s \u201cStatement of Proceedings and Evidence,\u201d that appellant was \u201ccharged with * * * use of \u2018profane, indecent and obscene words' under circumstances such that a breach of peace may be occasioned. * * *\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>That this is <em>not </em>what appellant was charged with is clear from the face of the information. <em>See </em>p. 647, <em>swpra.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>This defendant appeared before the Court on December 29, 1965 charged with two counts of disorderly conduct; namely (1) use of \u201cprofane, indecent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>and obscene words\u201d under circumstances such that a breach of peace may be occasioned, and (2) congregating with others on a public street and refusing to move on when ordered to do so by the police. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty to both counts and the following testimony was then given. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">While it is thus clear that the trial court misread the information when the account of the trial was written up some four and a half months after it took place, there is nothing in the record which shows that it properly weighed the evidence in light of the interpretation of the statute which we have found to be a necessary predicate of constitutionality. There are, good reasons to suppose that the court in fact failed to make any findings related to breach of the peace. First, the statute by its terms did not require such a finding, and the D.C. Court of Appeals had never read any such requirement into the statute. Sec- and, there is every reason to suppose that the prosecution\u2019s position at the trial, as it was until this case was accepted for <em>en banc </em>reconsideration, was that there was no need to prove that the profanity threatened a breach of the peace in order to violate Section 1107. Third, the trial court made no findings of fact that a breach of peace was threatened, and the judgment entered by the trial court, written on the day of trial and not four and a half months later, simply found appellant guilty of the \u201cuse of profane language.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And, finally, it is not without significance that the D.C. Court of Appeals in its opinion nowhere views the General Sessions Court as having found a threat of a breach of the peace. Where, as here, there is so much uncertainty that a trial court applied the correct view of a criminal statute to the facts before it, the conviction must fall. <em>See </em>Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 92, 86 S.Ct. 211, 15 L.Ed.2d 176 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We have, therefore, no occasion to pursue the matter; of whether, had the information been sufficient and had the trial judge applied the proper standard, the evidence would have supported the conviction. That, we remark in passing, is not an inquiry most fairly and effectively to be made by reference to an abbreviated recollection of what witnesses said nearly five months before. Neither do we think it useful to speculate in these circumstances upon the constitutionality of Section 1107 as it might have been applied to appellant on this record, or to others in facts not before us at all. We are of the opinion that the construction seemingly placed upon Section 1107 by the D.C. Court of Appeals is an untenable one, and one which, had it been persisted in by the prosecution, would have made that statute vulnerable to constitutional attack on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">We reverse the judgment of the D.C. Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Court of General Sessions with directions that the judgment of conviction be vacated and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">.

Even slight incidents can and often do flare into disorder and riots, especially where the police assert some measure of authority in their effort to maintain a degree of public peace.

Possibly the officer therefore should not have directed that they move. Yet instead of seeking peaceful redress because of such commands, the appellant openly flouted the officer. His truculence was made apparent in unmistakable terms when he told the officer \u201cno son of a bitch\u201d was going to make him move. Such an expression and others disclosing the appellant\u2019s attitude, undoubtedly figured in efforts by his erstwhile companions and even his wife to persuade him that his position, if inflexible, was rash at the very least.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Presumably untutored in the niceties of the law as some of my colleagues would read it, those who were right there at the scene realized that the appellant\u2019s conduct might occasion a breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">So in retrospect it seemed to the prosecutor who charged that the appellant had used certain language \u201cunder circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby.\u201d So it seemed to the trial judge who after finding the appellant guilty, had prepared for use on appeal his \u201cStatement of Proceedings and Evidence.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So it seemed to a majority of the sitting division who first heard argument on the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">I think the conviction should stand<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the appellant\u2019s \u201cfighting words\u201d were not a \u201cpermissible response\u201d as the Supreme Court put it in Chaplinsky v.
