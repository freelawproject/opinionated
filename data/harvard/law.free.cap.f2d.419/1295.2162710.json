The district court declined to consider the merits of this claim on the ground that it had been presented in a previous petition for habeas corpus and rejected by another judge of the district court, in a judgment affirmed by this court on August 5, 1965. Van Hook v. Eklund, 348 F.2d 920 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">As petitioner points out, subsequent to this court\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s rejection of his first petition, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered a number of decisions which have a direct and substantial bearing upon the constitutional issues underlying his claim. <em>See </em>Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S. Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966); Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968); and Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968). In these circumstances, \u201cthe ends of justice would be served by permitting the redetermination of the ground\u201d in a new petition. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 16-17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">Petitioner also alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the appeal of his original conviction in the California courts and was not accorded the right guaranteed by Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The district court rejected this contention on the ground that \u201cpetitioner admits that counsel filed a brief with the appellate court demonstrating counsel\u2019s belief in the lack of merit of petitioner\u2019s contentions.\u201d This appears to be a reference to petitioner\u2019s allegation that counsel \u201cfiled a three (3) page no-merit letter in the Appellate Court, and advised the Court that the appeal was without merit.\u201d But <em>Anders </em>required that counsel file \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\u201d (386 U.S. 744, 87 S.Ct. 1400); and the district court could not know whether this requirement was complied with since the court did not have the state court records and briefs before it. The state asserts, however, that petitioner has not presented his <em>Anders </em>claim to the state courts in collateral proceedings which are still available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">The order denying the petition for habeas corpus is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court. It is suggested that the district court may wish to hold the proceedings in abeyance to accord the courts of the State of California the initial opportunity to consider petitioner\u2019s first ground for relief in the light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions, and to afford petitioner the opportunity to exhaust his state remedies with respect to his second ground for relief if he has not already done so. Harders v. California, 373 F.2d 839 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
