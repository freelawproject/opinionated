We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-15\">In this, his second motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, appellant attempts to gain relief by contending that he was denied assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">After an evidentiary hearing held on appellant\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court found that appellant was not denied the right to counsel, but that he knowingly and voluntarily waived assistance of counsel after being fully advised of his rights in that regard. Bell v. United States, N.D.Miss.1966, 265 F. Supp. 311. This Court affirmed. Bell v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 763; cert. denied 389 U.S. 881, 88 S.Ct. 121, 19 L.Ed.2d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-17\">This same contention having been previously presented and considered on a similar motion, the district court was not in error in denying relief based upon the record and without <em>a, </em>hearing. Sanders v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148; Williams v. United States, 5th Cir. 1962, 309 F.2d 890, cert. denied 373 U.S. 940, 83 S.Ct. 1545, 10 L.Ed.2d 694; Wells v.

Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.
