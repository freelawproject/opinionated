All of the tangible assets of the bankrupt had been sold before the presently challenged sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">In dismissing the bankrupt\u2019s petition for review, the district court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-9\">\u201c[u]nder Section 39c of the Bankruptcy Act, only a \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 can petition for review of a Referee\u2019s order. A \u2018Person Aggrieved\u2019 is one who is directly and adversely affected <em>pecuniarily </em>by the order. Hartman Corp. of America v. United States, 304 F.2d 429 (8 Cir. 1962); In re Henry Wood Sons Co., 279 Fed. 608 (D.C. Mass.1922). In any event, real value was realized by the trustee for the benefit of the creditors, and the bankrupt may not petition for review where fair value is exchanged for the asset, if it be one, of only a skeletal charter and a dormant right of purchase. Of course, a grossly inadequate bid is quite another matter. The argument of the petitioner is that the trustee had no assets to sell in this regard. If that is so, then only the purchaser has been harmed by his speculation. If the bankrupt corporation had inherent rights in these intangible property rights, then the trustee\u2019s duty under the Act was to sell, and this is precisely what he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">We agree with the district court that the bankrupt was not \u201caggrieved,\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, by the sale it is attempting to challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
