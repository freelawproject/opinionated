The Court erred, he contends, in these respects: (a) by refusing to admit into evidence as an exhibit a fingerprint report prepared by the F.B.I.; (b) by granting the Government\u2019s motion ,to strike the testimony of one of its own witnesses; and (c) by refusing him in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>advance of trial a list of the persons to whom the Government had, prior to his arrest, submitted photographs for identification purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\"> Upon reviewing each of these contentions against the whole record, we find none of them justify a reversal and the evidence sufficient to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
