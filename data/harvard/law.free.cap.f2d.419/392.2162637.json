United States, 403 F.2d 190 (9th Cir. 1968), and was again convicted. His sole contention on this appeal is that the discovery of the wallet on May 7 was the fruit of an unlawful search conducted two days earlier. There is nothing in the present record, however, to change our conclusion on the prior appeal that \u201c[i]f the unlawful search or questioning of appellant [on May 5] contributed in any degree to the ultimate seizure of his wallet, its role must be considered de minimis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">Defendant points out that, but for the negligence of the government agents, the wallet would have been found in the unlawful May 5 search, and would have been subject to suppression. He argues that to admit the wallet in evidence therefore enables the government to take advantage of its \u201cown wrong\u201d (Silver-thorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920)), namely, its failure to conduct the unlawful search of May 5 effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">The contention is without merit. The \u201cwrong\u201d to which Justice Holmes referred in <em>Silverthorne </em>was a search which violated the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The exclusionary rule is not applicable to the wallet because it was not discovered as a result of such a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
