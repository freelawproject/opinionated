Appellee settled the ensuing injury claims, and appellant, pursuant to a local statute requiring contribution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reimbursed appellee to the extent of one-half of its outlay. This it did because the waiver contained in the Federal Tort Claims Act, FTCA, extends to claims for contribution when the government is a joint tortfeasor. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 1951, 340 U.S. 543, 71 S.Ct. 399, 95 L.Ed. 523.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government made one exception, which has resulted in the present lawsuit. One of the persons killed by the collision was a government employee. The government\u2019s obligation to its employees is under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, FECA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq., a statute antedating the FTCA, and similar in content to state workmen\u2019s compensation acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 16(c) of the FECA pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>vides that this is its sole obligation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government discharged this liability by paying the widow $8,600. Thereafter the widow sued appellee, and recovered $50,000 by way of settlement. As required by section 32 of the FECA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the widow then repaid the $8,600 to the government. Appellee demanded contribution by the government to the extent of $8,600.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Citing section 16(c), the government refused. The parties having stipulated to the above facts, the court granted judgment for the appellee, 293 F.Supp. 809, and the government appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Basically it is appellee\u2019s position that the limitation contained in section 16(c) has the purpose of restricting recovery by the employee and his representatives, and is not directed at rights of unrelated third parties. The issue is not that simple. The inquiry must be, what right is appellee seeking to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">It is clear that if appellee\u2019s claim to reimbursement were a strictly independent right, personal to appellee, section 16(c) would not bar such recovery. Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co. v. United States, 1963, 372 U.S. 597, 83 S.Ct. 926, 10 L.Ed. 2d 1. There a private shipowner, whose vessel collided with a government vessel, brought suit in admiralty. A cross libel was filed. Finding both to blame, the court divided the damages. The government, asserting that section 16(c) was a bar to its further liability, objected to the court\u2019s including in the gross damages the amount that Weyer-haeuser was required to pay a government employee injured in the collision. The Court rejected this contention, saying, at p. 601, 83 S.Ct. at p. 929,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 7(b), added [to the FECA] in 1949, was to establish that, as between the Government on the one hand and its employees and their representatives or dependents on the other, the statutory remedy was to be exclusive. There is no evidence whatever that Congress was concerned with the rights of unrelated third parties, much less of any purpose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>disturb settled doctrines of admiralty law affecting the mutual rights and liabilities of private shipowners in collision cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Appellee cannot take all the comfort from <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>that it might wish. While the result there was to include in the damages to be divided between the parties what Weyerhaeuser had to pay the government employee, Weyerhaeuser had a direct right of action against the government because of the collision with its vessel. The Court held that section 16(c) of the FECA did not bar the inclusion of Weyerhaeuser\u2019s tort liability to the government employee as part of its consequential damages. The resultant division of damages was not contribution, but was in accordance with the admiralty rule of reduced recovery when there is contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The decision below is not supported by <em>Weyerhaeuser, </em>and is inconsistent therewith. The court awarded Weyerhaeuser one-half of what it was required to pay to the government employee, a sum substantially greater than the compensation payment under the FECA. <em>See </em>9 Cir., 294 F.2d 179. If the <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>principle applied to the case at bar, appellee should recover $25,000, not $8,600. Neither the court below, nor the cases upon which it relied, nor even appellee (see n. 6, <em>swpra) </em>makes that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">While on the subject of consistency, we might add that the court\u2019s award of $8,600 is inconsistent with the basic concept of contribution, which is sharing, not payment in full. On appellee\u2019s theory, that the government\u2019s liability of $8,600 was occasioned by joint negligence, it would seem that the obligation should be divided between them. Instead, the government has been made to pay as much as if the negligence had been solely its own. The court\u2019s reasoning, 293 F.Supp. at 815, seemingly that the government should pay one-half of the $50,000, but that \u201climitless, contribution would probably compel a complete reconsideration of the actuarial basis of compensation insurance,\u201d while supported by a dictum in Elston v. Industrial Lift Truck Co., Inc., 1966, 420 Pa. 97, 216 A.2d 318, and in accord with the Pennsylvania rule as there summarized, seems impermissible ad hoc legislation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Either the government owes $4,300, or, conceivably, $25,000, or it owes nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">Although appellee mistakes the effect of <em>Weyerhaeuser, </em>the government places too much reliance upon Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 1953, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143. There the combined negligence of a stevedore and a shipowner resulted in injury to an employee of the stevedore. In the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. there are exclusivity and recoupment provisions comparable to the pertinent section of the FECA. The stevedore paid compensation under the Longshoremen\u2019s Act to the injured worker, who then sued the shipowner. The latter demanded that its accountability for damages to the worker be reduced by the amount of the stevedore's payment, and that the stevedore, because of its negligence, be forbidden to recoup from the employee \u2014 in effect what is being sought here. Otherwise, it argued, the stevedore would be profiting from its own lack of care. The Court refused, holding that the statutory scheme for workmen\u2019s compensation would be violated by such a result.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">The government fails to note the absence in <em>Pope &amp; Talbot </em>of any statute providing for contribution. The ship owner sought to create rights merely from the fact that it was making a pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ment which benefited the negligent stevedore. This was a circular argument. If the shipowner had prevailed, in whole or in part, the stevedore would, in effect, have been indemnifying the shipowner for its own negligence, contrary to Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling &amp; Refitting Corp., 1952, 342 U.S. 282, 72 S.Ct. 277, 96 L.Ed. 318. The circumstances that the shipowner\u2019s payment ultimately benefited the stevedore was <em>res inter alios. </em>The latter\u2019s payment to its employee had nothing to do with negligence, but was contractual indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">An injured party\u2019s insurance does not redound to lessen the liability of the third party who caused the injury. Had the stevedore in Pope <em>&amp; Talbot </em>been an ordinary insurer that had contracted with the employee, the shipowner would have received no benefit from, or credit on account of, the compensation payment. Bangor &amp; A. R. Co. v. Jones, 1 Cir., 1929, 36 F.2d 886; Parmiter v. United States, D.Mass., 1948, 75 F.Supp. 823; Note, Unreason in the Law of Damages: The Collateral Source Rule, 77 Harv.L. Rev. 741 (1964); Rest. Torts \u00a7 920, Comment e. Correspondingly, the fact that the employee here had agreed with the government to make a refund in certain circumstances was none of the shipowner\u2019s concern.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We must, accordingly, determine whether the right of contribution as between joint tortfeasors calls for a different result. We think not. We reach this result not by application of rubric\u2014 whether the government was a joint tortfeasor or not \u2014 because stating the question in such manner tends to assume the point, but by considering the nature of the right of contribution. Contribution does not create direct liability in tort, each towards the other, between two tortfeasors. Rather, as the word implies, it is a right based upon equitable fairness. The right to have the other tortfeasor contribute to his outlay arises in whichever tortfeasor satisfies the loss. It is inequitable that as between two parties jointly liable the ultimate loss should be fortuitously determined by the injured party\u2019s choice of defendant. Gregory, Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors: A Defense, 54 Harv.L.Rev. 1170 (1941); Leflar, Contribution and Indemnity Between Tortfeasors, 81 U.Pa. L.Rev. 131, 137 (1932); Note, Toward a Workable Rule of Contribution in the Federal Courts, 65 Colum.L.Rev. 123, 125 n. 19 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> As a matter of legal principle the route to contribution must be via subrogation or assignment based upon payment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In such circumstances we would suppose that there would be nothing to be subrogated to if the other party claimed to be a joint tortfeasor, was never under liability to the injured party. Nor do we readily see any unfairness,' so far as the non-liable party is concerned, for he, by hypothesis, receives no benefit from the satisfaction of the other actor\u2019s liability. Some courts, nevertheless, have found unfairness unless the immune party contributes, without, however, explaining where the unfairness lies. <em>See, e. g., </em>Zarrella v. Miller, 1966, 100 R.I. 545, 217 A.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">With all due respect, compelling contribution here could be said to be a windfall. But if such decisions are sound they cannot affect the case at bar. In <em>Zarrella </em>the party required to contribute was a husband whose negligence, along with the negligence of the party seeking contribution, had injured his wife. Under state law the husband was immune from suit by the wife. The court held, nonetheless, that he was liable to contribute. Even if Rhode Island would ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tend this principle to override the workmen\u2019s compensation statute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we would not be bound. The immunity being state-created, the state, through its courts, may properly determine its extent. In the case of the FECA the immunity is federally created; its extent must be determined by the federal courts, particularly when the issue is one of government liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Looking at the question as one of federal law, we hold that contribution cannot be had from the government when the government was under no tort liability to the injured party. Even when the person obliged to pay was only secondarily liable, and lienee entitled to full indemnity, it has been held that no right arises against the primary actor if, as the employer, he was statutorily immune from tort liability. United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener, 9 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 379; Bertone v. Turco Products, Inc., 3 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 726; Slattery v. Marra Bros., Inc., 2 Cir., 1951, 186 F.2d 134, 139. These are a fortiori cases, as a duty might be thought to arise between one primarily liable directly to the one only secondarily liable. <em>But ef. </em>Slattery v. Marra Bros., Inc., <em>supra, </em>where the court pointed out, in denying recovery, that the only legal relationship was that of joint tortfeasors, each to the injured party. We need not go as far as those courts to hold that contribution is barred in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated. Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\">. Rhode Island adopted an early version of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act.

Burnings Constr. Co., La.App., 1965, 172 So.2d 721. If abstract fairness is the test, in the workmen\u2019s compensation cases the employer, at least overall, does incur contractual liability, which is to be offset by immunity in the individual case. <em>Cf. </em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b407-6\">COFFIN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Abh\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-0\">I concur in the court\u2019s conclusion and share what seems to be its ultimate rationale. The purpose of this separate statement is to underscore that rationale, which, in my view, is more strongly supported by the relevant cases than the court\u2019s opinion reflects.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">There are two elements in'the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act which together support denial of contribution to appellee: the immunity from suit by the injured party conferred on the government by section 8116(c); and the provisions establishing and protecting the Employees\u2019 Compensation Fund as a source for payment of the obligations stemming from the government\u2019s absolute liability for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">The significance of the first element springs from the basic justification of contribution. As Prosser succinctly states it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-14\">\u201cThere is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss, for which two defendants were equally, unintentionally responsible, to be shouldered onto one alone, according to the accident of a successful levy of execution, the existence of liability insurance, the plaintiff\u2019s whim or spite, or his collusion with the other wrongdoer, while the latter goes scot free.\u201d Prosser, Torts (Hornbook Series, 3d ed. 1964), p. 275.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">In the case where one of the tortfeasors is immune from suit by the injured party \u2014 our case \u2014 -the rationale behind contribution no longer exists, for there is no possibility of the arbitrary, fortuitous, or collusive choice of defendants which underlies contribution. That the government may go \u201cscot free\u201d may be somewhat unfair, but the unfairness stems not from the law of contribution but from the fact that the government is given immunity under section 8116(c) in exchange for strict liability for specified benefits for all injuries of its covered employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 597, 83 S.Ct. 926, 10 L.Ed.2d 1 (1963), helps appellee not at all. The Court observed, at 601, 83 S.Ct. at 929 that \u201c[t]here is no evidence whatever that Congress was concerned with the rights pf unrelated third parties\u201d in passing section 8116(c). This observation has no bearing here because, as noted above, immunity from contribution arises from tort immunity <em>not </em>by legislative intent but because the underlying justification for contribution no longer exists when one tortfeasor is ^immune from suit by the injured party.' Even were appellee to have had a direct cause of action in tort against the government, it could not rely on <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>to recover for its payments to the injured government employee. <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>was, as the whole opinion and sequence from grant of certiorari to holding indicate, strictly the product of a unique admiralty doctrine in which payments to victims are included in defining damages to be shared.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Court there found no intent to disrupt the age-old doctrine of divided damages in admiralty eases; I find no intent to alter the traditional rule that tort immunity yields contribution immunity. <em>See </em>Prosser, <em>supra </em>at 277; 19 A.L.R.2d 1003; 26 A.L.R.3d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The second element in this case is the linkage of a compensation scheme based on absolute liability with a fund which is protected in part by a recoupment provision when employees are injured by others, section 8132. Its significance for our case, it seems to me, was settled by Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 411-412, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953), in which the Court held, as to a similar scheme, that preventing the employer from recouping benefits paid would frustrate the purpose of the statute. Surely that same frustration occurs here if appellee can defeat recoupment. That there was no right of contribution in <em>Pope &amp; Talbot </em>did not weigh heavily on the Court\u2019s mind and does not seem to me to detract at all from the authority of the case as applied to our situation. I concede that it might not be conclusive if appellee\u2019s right were of a more compelling nature. <em>Compare </em>Wallenius Bremen G.m.b.H. v. United States, 409 F. 2d 994 (4th Cir. 1969) with United Air Lines, Inc. v. Wiener, 335 F.2d 379 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 951, 85 S.Ct. 452, 13 L.Ed.2d 549 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The presence of this statutory fund and scheme is also an adequate basis for distinguishing Zarrella v. Miller, 100 R.I. 545, 217 A.2d 673 (1966), which gives the court so much concern. The Rhode Island court was willing to subject a husband, who could not be sued by his wife, to liability for contribution to a joint tortfeasor. It thus applied contribution where the traditional justification \u2014 the possibility of a captious choice of defendant \u2014 was lacking; but, as the court there points out, with the marital relationship removed from the case by a change in party plaintiff, there was no reason for recognizing the interspousal immunity. This, reasoning does not apply to allow contribution from an employer subject to a workmen\u2019s compensation system. A change of party plaintiff from injured victim to liable tortfeasor would not remove the fact that the legislative purpose would be frustrated if third parties could defeat the recoupment provision. Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-5\"> For this reason I see no useful purpose in speculating what appellee\u2019s recovery would have been if appellee had a direct cause of action. It would have recovered its damages \u2014 but without inclusion of any amount paid to the employee. Moreover, the court\u2019s reference to $4,-300 seems to imply that in contribution each party is obligated to pay half of what it would have had to pay had it been the lone tortfeasor. That logic would mean that the injured party in this ease only gets $29,300 instead of the $50,000, i. e., $25,000 from Newport (half what it would have paid) and $4,300 from the government (half what it would have paid).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
