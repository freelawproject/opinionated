J.1968). The controlling issue is whether the negligent act of the Government\u2019s agent \u2014 the negligent dissemination of certain in-flight information by an air traffic controller to Captain Wenzel\u2014 was a proximate cause of the crash of the aircraft of which appellant Wenzel was pilot-in-command. The court below found some negligence on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>appellee but held affirmatively that \u201c * * * the evidence is insufficient to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving that the negligence imputable to the defendant was a proximate or concurring cause of the crash of the aircraft * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">At approximately 6:13 P.M. on February 16, 1963, after compliance with routine pre-flight procedures and having received clearance from a Government air-traffic controller, appellant and his copilot took off from McChord Air Force Base (McChord), Washington State, in a commercially owned C-46 two-engine cargo airplane. Although the flight\u2019s destination was Malstrom Air Force Base, Great Falls, Montana, roughly seven minutes later when the plane was 13 mjles northeast of McChord, the crew requested permission to return to the base. Approximately 6 minutes after take-off, the plane\u2019s left engine had experienced a \u201crunaway prop\u201d, a grave inflight emergency. When informed of the nature of the plane\u2019s difficulty, the controller handling the flight in question concluded that an emergency existed, and all radar room personnel in the Federal Aviation Agency\u2019s Radar Approach Control facility at McChord Air Force Base were alerted.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Following an initial exchange of information concerning the plane\u2019s prospective return to McChord, and after the plane has experienced two \u201crunaway prop\u201d episodes with the left engine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the air traffic controller reported to the crew that the plane was about nine miles northeast of McChord and \u201cexactly five miles north of the runaway at Thun Field.\u201d Wenzel, supra, at 980. The reference to Thun Field by the controller was the first information received by the crew concerning the existence of Thun Field. The crew had no personal knowledge whatsoever about Thun Field, and had to rely completely on the controller\u2019s transmissions and their visual observations for pertinent data upon which to base decisions concerning Thun.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">After learning of Thun Field\u2019s proximity to their flight position, the crew asked the controller to have the Field flash its landing lights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested a radar vector to Thun Field. The controller gave the proper instructions and advised the aircraft that it was then four miles north of Thun and correctly en-route to the heading provided. The controller then volunteered that \u201cThe length of the runway is 5300.\u201d When the plane was one mile from Thun Field, the controller gave additional flight information. However, as the plane approached for a landing, it advised the controller as follows: \u201cHigh, we\u2019ll have to go around.\u201d The plane, though over the center of the runway, turned left sharply, climbed over adjacent trees, and crashed a mile-and-a half northeast of the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">The court below found that the transmission to the crew that the runway length was 5,300 feet was incorrect, and that \u201cThe Thun Field runway extends in a northeast-southwest direction for a physical distance of 3040 feet. Its corrected length was 2667 feet.\u201d Wenzel, supra, at 981. Regarding this information as above stated the trial court held, inter alia: \u201c * * * that * * * the Rapeon Controller * * * failed to exercise reasonable care in the information which it furnished to the plaintiff * * * respecting the length of the Thun Field runway.\u201d Wenzel, supra, at 989. Appellant contends that the court\u2019s finding that plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of showing that defendant\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of the accident is incorrect and should be overruled. He offers a two-pronged argument: First, that had the controller provided proper information, Wenzel would probably have proceeded back to McChord Air Force Base as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>his initial intention; and Second \u2014 presumably in the alternative \u2014 had the controller provided accurate information to the crew, a different approach and a successful landing at Thun Field could have been accomplished.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to the assertion that the flight would have proceeded back to McChord but for the controller\u2019s mention of Thun Field, appellant urges that an alternative landing site which was inadequate for the landing of the plane should not have been even mentioned by the controller. It is obvious that the gist of appellant\u2019s second argument (i. e., that if proper information had been given to the crew, a successful landing could have been made at Thun), undercuts the thrust of the appellant\u2019s contention that Thun Field was an unsuitable alternative landing site. Further, in the existing serious emergency the controller\u2019s mention of the availability of Thun Field evidently was much appreciated by the distressed crew as without first inquiring about the field\u2019s characteristics, the crew immediately asked to have Thun Field flash its landing lights and requested a radar vector to Thun. Actually, the incorrect information about the length of the runway was received not only after a decision had already been made by the crew to land at Thun, but when in fact, the plane was just about three miles north of Thun Field. On this point the district court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cAssuming that the McChord control misinformed the plaintiff respecting the availability or suitability of Thun Field as a place to set down the aircraft, <em>I find no evidence that such misinformation was a proximate cause of the injuries of which complaint is made,\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) 291 F. Supp. at 984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">The court found in effect, that if the runway at Thun was inadequate, \u201c * * * the evidence is uncontradicted that the unsuitability of the airfield became or must have become obvious and apparent to the plaintiff * * * \u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for Captain Wenzel, did, in fact, execute a successful mis-approach after flying down the field for some distance, did successfully turn left sharply off the airstrip,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201c * * * had regained substantial altitude and traveled a distance of a mile and a half from the airfield where it crashed in the course of its second turn.\u201d At 984. The court later stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u201cWhether the immediate cause of the crash was another runaway propeller or an explosion or too steep a banking turn too near the ground with wing tip contact with a ground obstruction is neither disclosed by nor to be inferred from the evidence in the case.\u201d At 985-986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">\u201c(The controller) * * * did nothing to control or influence the handling of the aircraft which was in the exclusive control and the primary responsibility of the plaintiff as pilot.\u201d At 986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Similarly, appellant\u2019s theory that a different approach would have been made to Thun if the correct landing strip information had been provided does not cure the primary defect found in his case by the court below, viz., the failure by the plaintiff to establish proximate cause. As indicated, Captain Wenzel evidently had discovered that the runway was not situated as he expected and that it was necessary to execute a mis-ap-proach; but as also pointed out above, he <em>successfully </em>did execute a mis-approach, and after that crashed for some other unknown cause. The court below soundly concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201cThe continuity of the chain of alleged causation between * * * (the controller\u2019s) misinformation respecting the length of the runway and the crash of the aircraft was broken by a series of events in no way chargeable to that misinformation.\u201d At 985.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">There is no doubt that appellant had the burden of establishing both negligence and proximate cause in this claim in order to recover. Ferrin v. Donnellefeld, Wash., 444 P.2d 701, 702 (1968).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In White v. Greyhound Corporation, 46 Wash.2d 260, 280 P.2d 670, 672-673 (1955), the Supreme Court of Washington made it clear that proximate cause \u201c * * * must be established by facts and legitimate inferences therefrom \u2014 not by speculation or conjecture.\u201d And where based on the evidence, under one theory of the suit the plaintiff would be liable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and under another the defendant, the plaintiff has not met his burden. Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wash.2d 802, 180 P.2d 564, 569 (1947). It should be noted in the appeal before us that, \u201cIn consequence of the long period of unconsciousness which he suffered following the crash plaintiff was unable to recall any of the events immediately preceding the crash * * Wenzel, supra, 291 F. Supp. at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">After exhaustively analyzing all of the evidence, the trial court rightly decided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">\u201cBecause of the absence of evidence respecting the events which transpired in the execution of the aircraft\u2019s go-round I am unable to reach a conclusion as to the cause of the crash * *. Speculation may not serve in lieu of evidence * * *.\u201d Wenzel, supra, at 988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">From our independent study of the trial record we are satisfied that the district court judgment is sound and right. It will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">. Soon after the first runaway prop, Captain Wenzel had been successful in \u201cfeathering\u201d the left engine; feathering is a technique whereby the blades of a propeller are turned to a position streamlined with the plane so as to reduce excess drag.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-14\">. The F.A.A. facility was unable to reach Thun Field by telephone, and the lights were not flashed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-5\">. Appellant also suggests the trial court erred by not applying the substantive law of the State of Washington re: the standard of \u201cproximate cause.\u201d Certainly, it is undisputed that under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the liability of the United States is to be determined \u201c * * * in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed. 2d 492 (1962). However, we are not convinced that the law of Washington State on. proximate cause is any more favorable to appellant than the cases of Wenninger v. United States, 234 F.Supp. 499 (D.Del.1964), aff\u2019d. 352 F.2d 523 (3 Cir. 1965); and United States v. Schul-tetus, 277 F.2d 322, 86 A.L.R.2d 375 (5 Cir. 1960), relied on by the court below. See, for example, Ferrin v. Donnellefeld, Wash., 444 P.2d 701 (1968); White v. Greyhound Corporation, 46 Wash.2d 260, 280 P.2d 670 (1955); Wilson v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 44 Wash.2d 122, 265 P.2d 815 (1954); and Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wash.2d 802, 180 P.2d 564 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-15\">. At 983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-16\">. The testimony clearly shows that in executing a mis-approach, the preferred technique is to fly straight over the runway for its entire length, and to climb slowly, rather than to turn sharply and climb suddenly which was what was done here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. Undoubtedly the law of Washington governs this issue. See footnote 3, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">. The court also held that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Government\u2019s affirmative defense of contributory negligence. Wenzel, supra, 291 F.
