The Whopper-Burger Shop, appeals from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granting the petition of Burger King of Florida, Inc., brought under section 14 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064), to cancel Southern\u2019s registration <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of \u201cWhoppaburger\u201d for \u201csandwiches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-20\">The board granted cancellation on the basis of Burger King\u2019s prior use of \u201cWhopper\u201d in connection with its sales of burger-type sandwiches in its Burger King restaurants as well as its service-mark registration<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d for drive-in restaurant services,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-21\">In our opinion the use of \u201cWhoppa-burger\u201d by respondent in connection with sandwiches concurrently with petitioner\u2019s use of \u201cWhopper\u201d and \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d in connection with the sale of hamburger sandwiches is likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-22\">Southern does not \u2014 indeed, cannot \u2014 seriously question Burger King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>priority of <em>use </em>of either \u201cWhopper\u201d or \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d in connection with the sale of burger-type sandwiches. Nor does it question the board\u2019s conclusion that the goods are substantially the same. Rather Southern urges that the board erred in considering the use by Burger King of the expression \u201cWhopper\u201d at all. In Southern\u2019s view, Burger King did not prove the <em>trademark </em>usage of \u201cWhopper\u201d which it alleged in its petition for cancellation, and thus did not establish that the registration sought to be cancelled will cause Burger King any damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Appellee\u2019s case here, however, does not depend on its proving that it made trademark use of the expression \u201cWhopper.\u201d It is sufficient if we find a likelihood of confusion between \u201cWhoppaburger\u201d and appellee\u2019s registered service mark \u201cHome of the Whopper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\"> Turning to that question, we have- considered Southern\u2019s arguments that \u201cWhoppaburger\u201d and \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d differ in appearance, sound and meaning; that \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d is a \u201cweak\u201d mark; and that it is somehow \u201csignificant\u201d that no evidence of actual confusion has been adduced by Burger King. Those arguments; however, do not convince us of error in the board\u2019s decision. We are satisfied that purchasers familiar with appellee\u2019s drive-in restaurants operating under the service mark \u201cHome of the Whopper\u201d wherein \u201cWhopper\u201d burger-type sandwiches are sold <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would, on encountering appellant\u2019s \u201cWhoppaburger\u201d sandwiches, be likely to assume by reason of confusion, mistake or deception that a common source or origin existed. It is not necessary, of course, to demonstrate actual confusion in trade' in order to establish a likelihood thereof. Salem Commodities, Inc. v. Miami Margarine Co., 44 CCPA 932, 244 F.2d 729, 114 USPQ 124 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-23\">. Reported at 153 USPQ 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-24\">. Registration No. 791,918, issued June 29, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-25\">. Registration No. 782,990, issued January 5, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-26\">. The record supports the board\u2019s findings that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-27\">The restaurants operating under the name \u201cBurger King\u201d are self-service restaurants specializing in a limited menu comprising hamburgers, fish sandwiches, hot dogs, french fries, milk shakes, soft drinks, coffee, and milk. The main item of sale is a hamburger which is sold under the designation \u201cWhopper\u201d and \u201cWhopper\u201d hamburger sandwiches have been sold in \u201cBurger King\u201d restaurants since 1958. And since that same time, \u201cBurger King\u201d restaurants have featured the service mark \u201cHome of the Whopper.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\">. As appears from an earlier decision of the board, appellee\u2019s service mark, which identifies its restaurant services and distinguishes them from those of others, has been construed to refer to the place where not only appellee\u2019s restaurant services are rendered but also where its goods \u2014here \u201cWhopper\u201d hamburger sandwiches \u2014 are sold.
