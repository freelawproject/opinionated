Walden, 411 F.2d 1109 (4 Cir. June 10, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-25\">Bauguess\u2019 second claim, that the evidence did not establish that he pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sessed and sold distilled spirits, centers specifically on his allegation that the Government did not prove that the containers purchased from Bauguess contained distilled spirits. Throughout the trial the witnesses, the district attorney, the defense attorney, and the court referred to the contents of the containers as \u201cwhiskey,\u201d \u201cliquor,\u201d or \u201cnontaxpaid whiskey.\u201d Although the precise term, \u201cdistilled spirits,\u201d used in the statute was not used during the trial, the terms which were used have been held to be the equivalent of the statutory term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The undercover agent who made the purchases from Bauguess testified that he had smelled the liquid and that it appeared to be intoxicating. There was also evidence that other officers made a check and found the contents of the containers to be nontaxpaid whiskey. We find the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-15\">. United States v.
