In Municipal Elec. Ass\u2019n of Mass. v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n., 134 U.S.App.D.C.-, 413 F.2d 1052 (1969),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> decided on March 26, 1969, we set aside the orders and remanded the cases to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">Municipals\u2019 present petitions challenge the Commission\u2019s orders permitting, under Section 6(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the case of Vermont Yankee, and under Section 7 of the Act in the case of Maine Yankee, the issuance and sale of promissory notes to banking institutions to raise funds needed for interim financing of the construction of the respective power projects.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Municipals contend that the interest of the public, investors, and consumers mentioned in the sections referred to, which the Commission must consider in authorizing financing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>through the notes, includes antitrust factors, as in the case of stock acquisitions, and that the Commission erroneously denied to Municipals an evidentiary hearing on its anticompetitive allegations with respect to the financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Any antitrust considerations included in the public, investor and consumer interest referred to in Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, we think in all the circumstances of the present petitions might well be resolved under the terms of our remand of March 26, 1969, in Municipal Elec. Ass\u2019n of Mass. v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n, <em>supra. </em>In so concluding we observe that we do not have before us the question whether the action of the Commission, of which we have been advised, in reinstating its approval of the stock acquisitions, subject to conditions to be determined, fully satisfies our March 26 decision and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We accordingly deny the present petitions without prejudice to such right of review as might be appropriate with respect to further orders of the Commission in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\">.
