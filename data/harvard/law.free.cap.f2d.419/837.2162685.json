The Board was insured by the Casualty Company under a $200,000 policy which protected against any judgment recovered against the insured by reason of any negligence on its part or on the part of any of its employees. Suit was brought in the Superior Court of New Jersey against the Board and one of its teachers by Stanley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Miller and his parents, based on serious injuries sustained by the Miller boy during a gym class. In the action, at which Judge Mills presided, a jury found the teacher negligent, and awarded Stanley Miller $1,180,000 and his parents $35,-140. On defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, Judge Mills sustained the parents\u2019 award and reduced that of the boy to $300,000,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the Millers accepted when the parties waived their right to appeal. The Board then sued the Casualty Company in the New Jersey District Court, on the grounds of diversity, for the amount of the judgment in excess of its policy coverage, claiming the Casualty Company failed to make a good faith effort to settle the ease within the policy limits. Judge Wortendyke, sitting without a jury, decided in favor of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We affirm the decision of the District Court on the opinion of Judge Worten-dyke. 293 F.Supp. 541 (D.N.J.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In the factual presentation in appellant\u2019s brief and oral argument, appellant alleged error in several findings of fact included in Judge Wortendyke\u2019s opinion. We shall consider these points seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court incorrectly stated that Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company suggested the Board consider settlement \u201cof the <em>probable </em>excess over the policy coverage * * *\u201d (emphasis added), 293 F. Supp. at 548, whereas the Company never admitted there was <em>probable, </em>as opposed to <em>possible, </em>excess policy coverage problems. The use of the word \u201cprobable\u201d was undoubtedly an inadvertent error. That Judge Wortendyke was aware of the precise language used by the Company is made clear by his earlier reference to the actual letter sent by the Company. 293 F.Supp. at 546-547. In any event, there is no indication that the Court below attached any significance to the word \u201cprobable\u201d in reaching its ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">The appellant also takes issue with Judge Wortendyke\u2019s statement that Judge Mills \u201csuggested\u201d to the Casualty Company representatives during a settlement conference that they offer $150,000 to settle the case. 293 F.Supp. at 550. Although the record clearly shows Judge Mills did not suggest or recommend the case be settled for $150,000, the record does make it clear Judge Mills advised the Casualty Company the plaintiffs would accept $150,000 and the Company\u2019s representatives were definitely aware that the plaintiffs were willing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The appellant further suggests Judge Wortendyke incorrectly stated that Judge Mills \u201cexpressly recognized the probability that a verdict might be expected in excess of $100,000\u201d. 293 F. Supp. at 551. Although we find no evidence in the record of this recognition by Judge Mills, we do not deem this error significant to Judge Wortendyke\u2019s determination of the ease. The Company itself was aware that the case was worth this amount since the Company authorized a settlement of $100,000 \u2014 an offer which was never communicated to the plaintiffs or their counsel. This authorization, when coupled with the Company\u2019s knowledge that the plaintiffs would settle for $150,000, was crucial in Judge Wortendyke\u2019s decision regarding the lack of good faith of appellant in failing to settle the case within the policy limits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The judgment of the United States District Court for New Jersey will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">.
