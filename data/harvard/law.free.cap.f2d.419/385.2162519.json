Foremen, on more than one occasion, made decidedly coercive, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>hence illegal, statements to employees about the Union and their participation in it. Worse yet, Company officials figured prominently in the encouragement and solicitation of signatures for a de-certification petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Second, the Company violated 8 (a) (5) when it ceased negotiating with the certified Union as soon as a decertification petition was filed on behalf of certain employees. The Company does not contest the Union\u2019s majority and admits that it has never doubted the Union\u2019s strength. Its sole contention is that when some employees file a decertification petition, the Board may not insist that the Company display good faith. Clearly, this position is not in accordance with the law. See NLRB v. Rish Equipment Co., 407 F.2d 1098, 1100-1101 (4th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
