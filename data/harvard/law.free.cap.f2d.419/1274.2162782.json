More specifically, it asserts that the record as a whole demonstrates that a hiring hall agreement existed between the Company and the Union at the time Moore was hired. The Board concedes that if the Company were obligated to use the hiring hall, which was operated in a nondiscriminatory manner, there was no violation of the Act when the Union asked the Company to discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>Moore. See Local 357 Intern. Broth. of Teamsters, etc. v. N.L.R.B., 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11 (1961). However, the Examiner found after hearing oral testimony, and the Board adopted his finding, that there was no hiring hall agreement in existence at the crucial time. In essence the Union is quarreling with the Board\u2019s evaluation of the evidence because it argues that the Company\u2019s conduct and oral expressions evidenced an intent to bind itself to accept only those personnel that were referred to it by the Union. We find that the Board\u2019s conclusions are reasonable and have substantial support on the record considered as a whole. The Union\u2019s conduct was beyond the pale. See Radio Officers\u2019 Union, etc. v. N.L. R.B., 347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1334-21\">. 172 N.L.R.B.
