Appellant was identified as the robber by the teller, the manager of the bank, and another eye witness. He was indicted on a two count indictment charging violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> robbing a federally insured bank \u2014 and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d) <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>putting life in jeopardy during such robbery. He was convicted on both counts, and given concurrent sentences of 18 years on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">Here he attacks the conviction on three grounds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>We </em>do not, however, find reversible error and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is that evidence of a display of a gun close to the face of the woman teller in the course of repeated demands for more and more money is not enough by itself to satisfy the jeopardy of life requirement under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d) of an objective state of danger. This contention has, however, recently been rejected by this Court in Baker v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 1069 [No. 24094, June 20, 1969]. There we held that a gun \u2014 whether actually loaded or unloaded, but not known by the victim to be unloaded \u2014 \u201cused in connection with and at the scene of a bank robbery is as a matter of law a dangerous weapon and that those on the immediate scene of the robbery are placed in an objective state of danger * * <em>Baker, supra, </em>412 F.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-8\">Every young boy in his first exposure to the excitement of firearms, every recruit on his first visit to a target range gets drilled into him the idea that every gun is to be treated as loaded. A good rule in peaceful pursuits ought to have even more vitality when the weapon is being used in rank, felonious law breaking. We reaffirm the common sense reading of \u201cputting in jeopardy\u201d that a jury can \u201creasonably consider that the usual meaning was likewise the law\u2019s meaning \u2014 life was in peril, not merely thought to be\u201d. Smith v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 789, 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-14\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the Trial Court committed reversible error in charging the jury. He complains that the jury was charged that the \u201claw makes no distinction between the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence; it requires only that the jury, after weighing all the evidence, must be convinced of the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt before he can be convicted.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument is that there is a significant difference between circumstantial and direct evidence: circumstantial evidence to support a conviction must be \u201cinconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.\u201d Vick v. United States, 5 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-15\">Although the law recognizes a difference, the Trial Court did not err. First, in Holland v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150, the Court held that the failure of the Trial Court to charge that the Government\u2019s proof had to \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt\u201d was not error. The Court said that \u201cwhere the jury is properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt, such additional instruction on circumstantial evidence is confusing and incorrect.\u201d 348 U.S., at 139-140, 75 S.Ct., at 137, 99 L.Ed., at 166. Secondly, here the Government\u2019s case was not based on circumstantial evidence. There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>three eye witnesses who positively identified Appellant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Appellant\u2019s third assertion of error is the Trial Court\u2019s refusal to reopen the case after it had been submitted to the jury so that Appellant could offer additional evidence. After the case had been submitted to the jury, the jury requested that a portion of the testimony be read to them. The jury was interested in testimony of an arresting officer who had testified that $250.00 was found in Appellant\u2019s possession. After the testimony was read, Appellant wanted to introduce evidence that, he claimed, contradicted the testimony of the officer. Appellant claimed to be able to produce a witness who would testify that he had only $.12 in his possession when he was first booked in jail. Appellant admitted, however, that he had known of this testimony throughout the trial. Equally important, other circumstances permitted the Trial Judge at that late stage to conclude that the proffered testimony neither contradicted nor undermined that of the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">The reopening of a case is a matter of the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion, Hale v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 410 F.2d 147, 152, which should be exercised with caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1354-9\">. \u201cWhoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, or any savings and loan association * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-10\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">. \u201cWhoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1354-18\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing.
