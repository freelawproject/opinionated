This court cannot fault that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">That Apker, after being caught, may, thereupon and therefor have been placed in segregated confinement by the institutional officials for 37 days and subsequently convicted and sentenced to confinement by a Federal court for the same acts does not constitute \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d under the Fifth Amendment.
