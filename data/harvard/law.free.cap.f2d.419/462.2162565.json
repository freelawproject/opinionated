The first was against the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation\u2019s application serial No. 215,259, filed March 29, 1965, to register VANA-PRESS for men\u2019s shirts, cuffs, collars, pajamas, sports shirts, underwear, knit shirts, and slacks, first use claimed on July 3, 1962. The second was against appellee\u2019s application serial No. 215,260, filed March 29, 1965, to register VANO-PRESS for the identical goods, claiming first use on March 2, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">Appellee concedes to appellant priority in the use and registration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of VANO as a trademark for household cleaner, liquid and powder form laundry starch, clothing and household bleach, fabric fluffer, laundry starch in spray form, fabric finishes, and ironing aids.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">In a concise opinion, the board reached the conclusion that confusion, mistake, or deception (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052 (d)) was \u201cnot at all likely\u201d in view of the cumulative differences in the marks as a whole and the goods to which they are respectively applied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">Appellant-opposer contends its mark is arbitrary and hence entitled to broad protection and that the law requires all doubts to be resolved against the newcomer. We agree with these propositions but consider them inapplicable to the facts of this case. The board apparently had no doubts, nor do we. VANOPRESS is not altogether arbitrary when it is considered that it is a Van Heusen mark and applied to clothing which requires no pressing. It is highly suggestive and obviously related to its owner\u2019s name. The fact that VANO may be entirely arbitrary does not alter these facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-25\">Appellant makes a number of arguments directed to showing that the goods, though clothing on the one hand and chemical products on the other, are really quite closely related. One is that both parties used a Chinese laundryman theme in TV commercials to emphasize no ironing on the one hand and ironing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>aids on the other. We are not persuaded by this that the public would assume common origin for shirts and starch, etc. The evidence appears to demonstrate that applicant-appellee\u2019s shirts have a permanent press by reason of the composition of the textile fabric and a special pressing technique on special equipment and not by reason of any chemical finishing agent applied to the fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Though it is possible for appellant to argue in the abstract that appellee\u2019s mark VANOPRESS is nothing but its mark VANO with \u201cpress\u201d added thereto, there is nothing to show that the mark was actually created in that fashion or that any ulterior motive is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The VANAPRESS mark is clearly even less likely to cause confusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Finding, as we do, that the oppositions were properly dismissed, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-13\">.

Appellee makes the counter suggestion that VANO was probably selected \u201cbecause of its meaning in Italian, which is: I vanish.\u201d This, according to our Italian dictionaries, appears to be untrue. The verb for vanish is \u201csvanire.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">. The board opinion, in footnote 2, has called attention to the need to reexamine the VANAPEESS application since the evidence shows this mark to have been used only on slacks, even that use having been discontinued in 1965. Also, it appears that VANOPEESS was not used on slacks and perhaps not for cuffs and collars, wherefore it likewise requires reexamination. These matters are beyond our jurisdiction and are mentioned only to assure that they are not overlooked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
