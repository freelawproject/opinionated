The facts relevant to this controversy are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-20\">The bankrupt, a manufacturer and distributor of metal and plastic products, had its principal place of business in Philadelphia. It also had plants in Woodbury, New Jersey, and Millsboro, Delaware. Pursuant to a conditional sales agreement dated May 20, 1965, Mitchell purchased two hydraulic cutting machines from Herman Schwabe, Inc., appellee. Schwabe\u2019s plant is in Brooklyn, New York, and the contract was entered into there. The contract provided that the machines were to be kept in Mitchell\u2019s Philadelphia plant until they had been fully paid for and that they could not be placed elsewhere without Schwabe\u2019s prior consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-21\">On May 21, 1965, Schwabe filed a financing statement in the Philadelphia Prothonotary\u2019s Office, and on May 24, 1965, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-22\">At or about the time of the purchase, Mitchell had the machines picked up by its truck at Schwabe\u2019s Brooklyn location and, despite the contract provisions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> took them to its plant in Woodbury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>New Jersey. The machinery was used exclusively in that plant and was never physically in Pennsylvania. Appellee Schwabe never recorded its security interest in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On August 3, 1966, Mitchell filed a voluntary petition for an arrangement under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act and co-receivers were appointed to take charge of its property. On April 5, 1967, Mitchell was adjudicated a bankrupt with the same receivers continuing to serve. At a meeting of the creditors on August 9, 1967, one of the co-receivers was appointed trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">In the meantime, appellee Schwabe had filed a reclamation petition <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the machinery on April 18, 1967. The receivers, in compliance with an order from the referee directing them to file an answer to the petition,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> averred that Schwabe had failed to comply with the recording provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code of New Jersey, where the property was located. A hearing was held before the referee on September 12, 1967, and on October 25, 1967, the referee granted Schwabe\u2019s reclamation petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>On June 9, 1967, while Schwabe\u2019s petition was pending, a special meeting of the creditors was held at which time the receivers\u2019 petition to sell their right, title and interest in all the bankrupt\u2019s assets, except cash, subject to liens and claims, to appellant Armstrong, a secured creditor of the bankrupt,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was granted by an order entered by the referee. The hydraulic cutting machines were included in the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The dispute, then, is actually between the seller, Schwabe, and appellant, Armstrong, with the latter contending that Sehwabe\u2019s security interest was unper-fected and hence subordinate to the rights of the trustee under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110 (c) (Supp.1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Armstrong contends, therefore, that it succeeds to the rights of the trustee and takes the property free of Schwabe\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Appellant Armstrong argued before the referee that since the equipment had remained continuously in the bankrupt Mitchell\u2019s Woodbury plant, New Jersey law governed the perfection of Schwabe\u2019s security interest, and Schwabe should have filed a financing statement in that state in order to perfect its security interest. Schwabe having failed to do so within four months<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> after the property was installed in the debtor\u2019s New Jersey plant, Armstrong contended that Schwabe\u2019s security interest, even assuming it had originally been perfected in Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was unperfected and hence invalid against the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">\n<em>Decision of Referee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">The referee\u2019s decision was based primarily on \u00a7 9-103(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He ruled that under this section of the Uniform Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Code (seemingly New Jersey\u2019s) Schwabe had a \u201cvalid perfected security interest as against the Trustee and his assignee.\u201d (App. 29a). In reaching this result the referee held, in light of the debtor\u2019s improper removal of the equipment to New Jersey and Schwabe\u2019s filing in Pennsylvania, that \u201cthe only proper construction\u201d of the four-month rule of \u00a7 9-103 (3) was that the time period does not begin to run until \u201cthe secured party has been notified of the removal and has failed to re-record the financing statement.\u201d (App. 27a-28a). Implicit in this conclusion must have been a determination that Schwabe\u2019s filing in Pennsylvania was sufficient to perfect its security interest in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">The referee also noted that under the Article 9 section on rules of priority, \u00a7 9-301(1), \u201cthe assignee in this particular case [Armstrong] is not a person who takes priority over an unperfected security interest.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Finally, the referee said that under \u201cSection 9-401(2), since this was a filing made in good faith, it is effective against the assignee or the trustee, who had knowledge<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>financing statement,\u201d App. 28a, citing In the Matter of Komfo Products Corp., 247 F.Supp. 229 (E.D.Pa.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Section 9-401(2) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">(2) A filing which is made in good faith in an improper place or not in all of the places required by this section is nevertheless effective with regard to any collateral as to which the filing complied with the requirements of this Article and is also effective with regard to collateral covered by the financing statement against any person who has knowledge of the contents of such financing statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Even if appellant Armstrong had actual knowledge of Schwabe\u2019s unperfected security interest, which appellant denies, we are concerned primarily with the knowledge of the trustee to whose rights the appellant, Armstrong, succeeded. Both under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and under \u00a7 9-301(3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Uniform Commercial Code the trustee has the status of an ideal lien creditor. Under the Code section the trustee can be affected with \u201cknowledge\u201d if it is shown that every creditor of the bankrupt had such knowledge, which has not been shown here. Under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, however, the trustee may have the status of an ideal lien creditor even if all the creditors do in fact have actual knowledge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We need not reach the possible conflict between the Uniform Commercial Code and the Bankruptcy Act on this point because there is no evidence in the record to indicate that every creditor of the bankrupt had actual knowledge of appellee\u2019s unper-fected security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>Komfo, swpra, </em>relied upon by the referee as well as by appellee, is clearly distinguishable. In <em>Komfo, </em>which involved an assignment of accounts receivable as security, the financing statement had not been properly recorded prior to the time that the debtor had made <em>an assignment for the benefit of creditors. </em>The security interest <em>was </em>perfected prior to the subsequent bankruptcy of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In resisting the creditor\u2019s reclamation petition for the accounts receivable in <em>Komfo, </em>the trustee relied on \u00a7 70(c) and \u00a7 70(a) (8) of the Bankruptcy Act. The court summarily rejected the \u00a7 70(c) claim because the security interest in the accounts receivable <em>had been </em>perfected prior to the date of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Section 70(a) (8) created a somewhat more difficult problem <em>not present in the instant case. </em>This provision of the Bankruptcy Act gives the trustee title to \u201cproperty held by an assignee for the benefit of creditors appointed under an assignment which constituted an act of bankruptcy * * 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110(a) (8) (1953), as was the case in <em>Komfo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">While it was true that the security interest had not been perfected prior to the assignment for the benefit of creditors, the status of the assignee as an ideal lien creditor under \u00a7 9-301(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was dependent upon whether all of the creditors represented by the assignee had knowledge of the unperfected security interest. The court, in <em>Komfo, </em>found strong evidence in the record that this was so and remanded the case to the referee for \u201ca determination of whether all the creditors had knowledge of the security interest prior to the execution of the assignment for the benefit of creditors.\u201d 247 F.Supp. at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">The gist of <em>Komfo, </em>then, was that while the trustee could not prevail under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, he may have been able to succeed to the rights of the assignee in bankruptcy <em>if </em>the latter had priority over the holder of the un-perfected security interest under \u00a7 70 (a) (8). <em>Komfo, </em>therefore, is wholly inapposite to the direct \u00a7 70(c) problem we have here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The referee also held the \u201cequitable doctrine\u201d of Bank of Marin v. England, 385 U.S. 99, 87 S.Ct. 274, 17 L.Ed.2d 197 (1966), to be an alternative ground for his decision, finding the bankrupt\u2019s action in placing the equipment in New Jersey in violation of the conditional sales agreement, coupled with Armstrong\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of Schwabe\u2019s security interest, to be a sufficient basis for granting the reclamation petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">\n<em>Decision of District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzZ\">The district court affirmed<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the referee\u2019s order on the grounds stated by the referee and for some additional reasons. The court held that assuming, without conceding, that Schwabe\u2019s failure to file in New Jersey rendered its security interest unperfeeted and hence subordinate to the rights of the trustee, appellant Armstrong would still not prevail be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>cause it had knowledge<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of Schwabe\u2019s security interest. This result was based on the court\u2019s conclusion that a sale in bankruptcy is a judicial sale, and that a purchaser at a judicial sale takes free from liens only if he was without actual or constructive notice of them.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The district court also seemed to adopt the referee\u2019s conclusion that under Article 9 priority rules Armstrong\u2019s knowledge prevented it from taking title free of the security interest even though it purchased the machinery from the trustee.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">As an alternative ground for affirming the referee\u2019s decision, the district court held that because Mitchell was able to transport the machinery to New Jersey, Armstrong should not be permitted to argue that the equipment was not mobile, and construing the Code liberally this equipment could be characterized as \u201cgoods of a type which are normally used in more than one jurisdiction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9-103(2).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That being the case, the district court reasoned that Schwabe\u2019s filing in Pennsylvania was effective to perfect its security interest as the debtor Mitchell\u2019s chief place of business was in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">At the outset we note a dispute between the parties as to which law governs the validity and perfection of Schwabe\u2019s security interest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellant Armstrong, noting that both New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted the Uniform Commercial Code, claims that New Jersey law governs because the equipment was physically present in that state.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And \u00a7\u00a7 9-302(1) and 9-401 of the Code, as adopted in New Jersey, require that a financing statement be filed in the state where the collateral is located in order to perfect a security interest in the type of equipment involved here (assuming for present purposes that these machines are not mobile goods of a type which are normally used in more than one state). As no financing statement was ever filed in New Jersey, Armstrong contends that Schwabe\u2019s interest is not perfected. To Schwabe\u2019s argument that the Pennsylvania filing perfected its security interest, Armstrong replies that even if that is correct, such perfection lapsed after the machinery had been in New Jersey more than four months. See \u00a7 9-103(3), <em>supra note 10.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Schwabe asserts that its security interest was perfected in Pennsylvania, as held by the referee, and that it could not become unperfected solely by reason of Mitchell\u2019s removal of the equipment to New Jersey without the seller\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Despite the seemingly harsh result, we believe that neither a liberal construction of the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code nor the <em>Bank of Marin </em>declaration that \u201cequitable principles govern the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> can avail the appellee-seller on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Because, as explained later, we do not consider the machines in question here as \u201cgoods of a type which are normally used in more than one jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7 9-103(2), we hold, under any choice-of-law criterion, that Schwabe\u2019s security interest was unperfected as of the date of bankruptcy, i. e., when Mitchell filed its Chapter XI petition. The states which have any connection with the transaction are New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and each has enacted the Uniform Commercial Code. In our view, \u00a7 9-103(3) precludes the recognition of appellee\u2019s security interest as perfected regardless of which\u2019 state\u2019s law is deemed controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Even if we assume that \u00a7 9-102(1) (a)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> is not applicable because of the multi-state nature of Schwabe\u2019s original agreement with the bankrupt Mitchell, we must look to \u00a7 9-103(3) for resolution of the perfection problem. Had the machinery been taken to Mitchell\u2019s Philadelphia plant within 30 days after the security interest had attached,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it is clear that Pennsylvania law would control, and Schwabe\u2019s Pennsylvania filing would have perfected its security interest as the parties intended that the property be kept in Pennsylvania (see \u00a7 9-103(3); In re Kokomo Times Publishing &amp; Printing Corp., 301 F.Supp. 529, 5 U.C.C. Reporting Service 954, 963 (S.D.Ind. 1968)). Or, had the property remained in New York for not more than 30 days, not in the seller\u2019s possession, the Pennsylvania filing would probably have been sufficient to perfect the security interest in New York as well for that period. (See 1 Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property \u00a7 22.9 (1965)). The second sentence of \u00a7 9-103(3) seems to suggest that where the parties understood at the time that the security interest attached that the goods would be kept in Pennsylvania, if the property is <em>not </em>taken into Pensylvania within 30 days after the security interest attached Pennsylvania law would no longer govern the validity and perfection of the security interest. <em>(Id.) </em>Had the equipment remained in New York beyond 30 days, it seems fair to say that New York law would then govern the validity and perfection of Sehwabe\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">If the goods had remained in New York more than four months, not in the seller\u2019s possession, there is little doubt that under New York law the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Pennsylvania filing would not have served to perfect the seller\u2019s security interest in light of the rather clear intent expressed in \u00a7 9-103(3) that the secured party is under a duty to keep himself informed of his debtor\u2019s dealings with the collateral. <em>But here, the goods having been removed directly to New Jersey, under </em>\u00a7 <em>9-103(8) the failure to file a financing statement in that state clearly rendered the security interest un-perfected at the end of four months even were we to consider the security interest to have been originally perfected in Pennsylvania.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Contrary to the position of the referee, the four months\u2019 period, when applicable,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> begins to run whether or not the secured party has notice that the collateral has been removed to another jurisdiction. Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 9-103, Comment 7;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In re Welker, 2 U.C.C. Reporting Service 169 (W.D. Pa.1964) (decision of referee); Churchill Motor, Inc. v. A. C. Lohman, Inc., 16 App.Div.2d 560, 229 N.Y.S.2d 570, 577 (1962), reviewed in Hogan and Penney, Commercial Law, 14 Syr.L.Rev. 248, 256 (1962); First National Bank of Bay Shore v. Stamper, 93 N.J.Super. 150, 225 A.2d 162, 169 (1966), discussing \u00a7 9-103(3) of the New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code; 1 Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property \u00a7 22.8, p. 626 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">To reiterate, since Schwabe never filed a financing statement in New Jersey, we believe that under Pennsylvania, New Jersey or New York law its security interest was unperfected as the equipment had been in New Jersey longer than four months. That being the case, it follows that Schwabe\u2019s interest is subordinate to the rights of the trustee under both \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and \u00a7 9-301(1) (b) and (3) of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">With regard to the applicability of \u00a7 9-103 (2) <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> relating to mobile goods, we think the approach adopted by the district court, however equitable in intent, places too great a strain on the meaning of \u201cgoods of a type which are normally used in more than one jurisdiction.\u201d While the enumeration of certain types of goods in \u00a7 9-103(2) is not intended to be all inclusive, it seems clear that the test for mobile goods turns on the type of goods involved and not on their actual use in or transportation between more than one jurisdiction. To say that goods fall within that section simply because they may be and are easily transported from state to state overlooks the nature of the test for mobile goods and the particular problem \u00a7 9-103(2) was intended to resolve.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In view of the scope of \u00a7 9-103(2),'we conclude that industrial equipment of the type involved here may not be characterized as mobile goods within the meaning of that section. Therefore, the filings in Pennsylvania did not serve to perfect appellee\u2019s security interest under \u00a7 9-103 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">There remains the issue of Armstrong\u2019s title and the effect, if any, of its \u201cknowledge\u201d of Schwabe\u2019s unperfected security interest. As already noted, Armstrong disputes the referee\u2019s finding as well as that of the district court that it had actual knowledge of Schwabe\u2019s security interest. In any event, we believe that a finding of such knowledge or notice, actual or constructive, is immaterial if we decide that a purchaser from a trustee in bankruptcy takes free of the lien invalidated under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Granting that a bankruptcy sale is a judicial sale,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> we see no reason why local law on judicial sales or any other state law, such as Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, should determine what interest a party acquires at a bankruptcy sale. The broad powers which the \u201cstrong-arm clause\u201d of \u00a7 70(e) confers upon the trustee are intended to be utilized for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate in order \u201cto secure all the bankrupt\u2019s property for an equal distribution according to the terms of the [Bankruptcy] Act.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> To allow the lien of an unperfected security interest, invalid as against the trustee, to be resurrected against a purchaser from the trustee will surely inhibit bidding by such prospective purchasers with resulting harm to the bankruptcy estate. While this question does not seem to have arisen with any frequency, there is clear authority for the position we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">In Collier, it is stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">The fact that a purchaser has acquired knowledge of an unrecorded transfer which is invalid against the trustee under \u00a7 70c because of the lack of perfection does not disable the purchaser from acquiring at a bankruptcy sale all of the title which the trustee is authorized to transfer.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">In General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Raz Delivery, Inc., 238 App.Div. 277, 264 N.Y.S. 412 (1933), <em>noted </em>in 18 Minn.L. Rev. 586 (1934), Raz had purchased two motor vehicles pursuant to conditional sales contracts reserving title in the vendor as security. General Motors was the assignee of the vendor. The conditional sales contracts were recorded subsequent to Raz\u2019s filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, and the trustee sold the vehicles free and clear of liens to Weiss. Weiss then sold them to Raz, who had been discharged from bankruptcy and who obviously had knowledge of the conditional sales agreements. In deciding that Raz held the vehicles free of the General Motors\u2019 claim, the court did not rely on the fact that the sale to Weiss was free of liens but held that since General Motors was subordinate to the rights of the trustee, \u201cthe lien was lost\u201d and could not be asserted against one holding title acquired through the trustee. 264 N.Y.S. at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>A similar result was reached in Schuch v. Northrup-Jones, Inc., 162 Cal. App.2d 279, 328 P.2d 279 (1958), where the court held that the purchaser at a bankruptcy sale acquired the property free of liens even though he had knowledge of an unrecorded chattel mortgage and the sale was subject to liens and encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">In summary we conclude,</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">(1) that under any interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code of any of the states which had any contact with this transaction, appellee Schwabe\u2019s security interest was unperfected;</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">(2) that the trustee\u2019s status as an ideal lien creditor under \u00a7 70(c) of the Bankruptcy Act and under the Uniform Commercial Code enabled him to sell the hydraulic cutting machines free of the unperfeeted security interest, and</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">(3) that appellant Armstrong, as a purchaser from the trustee, took title to the machines free of appellee Schwabe\u2019s unperfected security interest whether or not Armstrong can be charged with knowledge or notice of such security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Because the result here may seem somewhat harsh, as is not unusual in Uniform Commercial Code cases, we have reviewed with special care the authorities cited by the appellee and we have found none which directly call for a conclusion opposite the one we have reached.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The order of the district court affirming the order of the referee in bankruptcy will be reversed and the petition for reclamation filed by appellee accordingly denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">. 280 F.Supp. 433 (E.D.Pa.1968).

The rights of the mortgagee are therefore protected against subsequent transactions to the same extent that they are in the state of original situs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-18\">Security transactions which deal with removals fraudulently induced by a party claiming a conflicting interest in the chattel do not involve any choice of law problem, since all the states agree in their refusal to exercise jurisdiction, since no jurisdiction exists * * * (citing cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-25\">But the \u201cparty claiming a conflicting interest\u201d here, appellant Armstrong, is a purchaser from the bankruptcy estate and had no part in any fraudulent conduct, even assuming the bankrupt Mitchell\u2019s breach of the sales agreement may be so characterized. Furthermore, as more fully developed later, the rule expressed in the first paragraph quoted above no longer represents the prevailing law as now embodied in the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-26\">In Joy Manufacturing Co. v. Brooks, 224 F.Supp. 537 (S.D.W.Va.), <em>aff'd per curiam, </em>325 F.2d 721 (4th Cir. 1963), a closely analogous case, a conditional buyer took the goods into a different West Virginia county than he had evidently promised to do, causing the conditional seller to file in the wrong county under the West Virginia Uniform Conditional Sales Act in effect at that time. When the buyer went into bankruptcy, it was held that the trustee prevailed against the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>led seller under \u00a7 70(c). The district court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">I am not indifferent to Joy\u2019s situation resulting from the misleading representations of the bankrupt, but that cannot be a determinative factor here. As the Court held in Fairbanks Steam Shovel Co. v. Wills, 240 U.S. 642, 36 S.Ct. 466, 60 L. Ed. 841 (1915), the duty rests upon the seller to select the proper recording district, and upon his failure to ascertain or select the proper district, it is the seller rather than innocent purchasers or creditors protected by the Act who must suffer the consequences of this failure. Nor does the bankrupt\u2019s misrepresentation to Joy as to the location of the property in West Virginia estop the trustee from challenging the defective filing. The Act was designed for the protection of creditors, and the trustee is the representative of those creditors. Stewart v. Platt, 101 U.S. 731, 25 L.Ed. 816 (1879); Fairbanks Steam Shovel Co. v. Wills, supra; Earhart v. Valerius, D.C., 25 F. Supp. 754. In my opinion Joy\u2019s failure to comply with Sections 5 and 6 of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act rendered the contracts invalid against the trustee in bankruptcy by virtue of the provisions of Section 70, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act, and for that reason the order entered by the Referee on November 29, 1962, denying petitioner\u2019s reclamation petition will be affirmed. 224 F.Supp. at 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">.

Although some courts have appeared to think that a bankruptcy court is obliged to apply the conflict-of-laws rules of the state of the forum, the more supportable view is that the bankruptcy court should be free to exercise for itself the choice of applicable state law. In any event, the tendency of the courts is to treat the law of the situs of the property at bankruptcy as governing to the extent that \u00a7 70c refers to nonbankruptcy law.
