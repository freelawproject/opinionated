Thereafter this Court dismissed a second appeal as frivolous and entirely without merit. United States v. Huckaby, 400 F.2d 576, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 933, 89 S.Ct. 291, 21 L.Ed.2d 269, rehearing denied, 393 U.S. 1046, 89 S.Ct. 617, 21 L.Ed.2d 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-22\">The two appeals in the present cases, which were consolidated for briefing and oral argument, are from the dismissal by the District Court of a \u201cmotion for relief in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis\u201d and a proceeding which was treated by the District Court as a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant complains that he was denied relief without an evidentiary hearing. The record discloses that the District Court previously had accorded appellant two evidentiary hearings, first on his original jury trial and a second on his motion for a new trial on grounds of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-23\">Upon consideration, .the Court concludes that both of the present appeals are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
