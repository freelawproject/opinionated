The petitioner\u2019s sole contention in the instant petition is that Section 489(c) [489c] is unconstitutional. The contention is without merit. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has found the statute to be constitutional, Castillo v. State, 411 S.W.2d 741 (Tex.Crim.App. 1967). Similar federal legislation placing reasonable restrictions on the possession and use of firearms has also been held constitutional. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922 (e), (f) (former Section 902, 15 U.S.C.). United States v. [Lauchli] Lauchi, 371 F.2d 303 (7 CA 1966); Smith v. United States, 312 F.2d 119 (10 CA 1963); Brown v. Clark, 274 F.Supp. 95 (E.D.La. 1967).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-12\">. Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5th Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526 [Oct. 7, 1969].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
