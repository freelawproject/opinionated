ROBINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">This is an appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from a conviction for the armed robbery <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Meridian Market on August 24, 1966. The Government\u2019s proof against appellant consisted of in-court identifications by the proprietor and an employee of the market, and an oral confession by appellant while detained by the police after his arrest. Appellant offered no evidence in his own behalf. He now argues, as he did at trial, that the presiding judge should have excluded both the confession and the identifications, and thus left the Government with a case no better than his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Both confessions and identifications made while an accused is in police custody without benefit of counsel are constitutionally suspect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s contentions on this appeal thus not atypically invoke doctrinal considerations that would have a vitiating effect on each prong of the Government\u2019s presentation unless exempted by special conditions. Accordingly, we must examine closely the circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s confession and identifications in order to determine whether they pass the strict tests for admissibility which have been judicially prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">Appellant was arrested at 4:15 p. m. on September 7,1966, pursuant to a warrant issued in connection with a robbery at Mike\u2019s Carry Out, and was taken to a precinct station. Upon arrival at about 4:30 p. m., the arresting officer immediately telephoned Detective Sergeant Robert T. Keahon, of the Robbery Squad, who instructed him to book appellant and bring him directly to the Robbery Squad office at police headquarters. At a pretrial hearing, held to pass upon the admissibility of the confession, Keahon testified that all arrestees brought to a precinct station are subsequently conveyed to headquarters for processing, that is, fingerprinting, photographing and completion of the \u201cline-up sheet.\u201d In addition, Keahon stated that he was personally in possession of appellant\u2019s arrest warrant, \u201cwas familiar with the case, and * * * was going to handle the case. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-15\">The arresting officer called in a police wagon from the streets and, when it arrived, drove appellant through closing hour traffic to police headquarters, and presented him to Keahon at 5:20 p. m. Keahon ascertained that appellant had been advised of his rights<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the arresting officer, and read to him from a form which gave the Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> warnings in some detail. Appellant said he understood the contents of the form, did not want a lawyer, and would obtain one the next morning if necessary. He then signed a statement to the effect that he knew his rights and did not desire the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-16\">Keahon then \u201cstarted talking to him about the Mike\u2019s Carry Out,\u201d the offense for which he had been arrested, but before he could utter more than a few words, appellant exclaimed, \u201cI don\u2019t care, I want to clear Ted. Teddy didn\u2019t do it. * * * Teddy didn\u2019t shoot that woman in the High\u2019s store or rob her. I did.\u201d \u201cTeddy,\u201d it developed, was one Theodore Moore, who had been arrested for a robbery at a High\u2019s Market. With that, appellant proceeded to confess, without prompting, to a series of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>recent crimes, the fourth of which was the Meridian Market holdup for which he was convicted in this case. Keahon testified that he asked appellant no questions whatever about that affair except to identify the market appellant was admitting he had robbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The Meridian Market confession was made at 5:45 p. m. When appellant finished confessing to various other offenses, Keahon brought in witnesses to identify him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Formal processing was completed at about 7:30 p. m., and appellant was taken before the United States Commissioner on the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Appellant contends that his confession was inadmissible under Mallory v. United States<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because it was obtained during a period of unnecessary delay in his presentment before a judicial officer. The Government denies a <em>Mallory </em>violation and argues that, even if there were one, the confession is admissible under Title III of the so-called District of Columbia Crime Bill.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think the record raises a substantial question as to whether appellant\u2019s transfer from the precinct station to police headquarters was an unnecessary delay in terms of contemporary judicial construction of Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We do not, however, reach that question, or the sensitive issues concerning the applicability<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and constitutionality of Title III which lurk behind it, because the case is properly resolvable on another basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-17\">Appellant attacks his confession on <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as well as <em>Mallory </em>grounds, alleging that he did not effectively waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Our decisions have recognized the importance of inquiry as to whether the accused was effectively apprised of his rights when the admissibility of a confession under <em>Mallory </em>is at stake.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And as we recently observed in Naples v. United States,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which involved a <em>pre-Miranda </em>confession, the evolution in our understanding of <em>Mallory </em>has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1224-18\">\u201cparalleled the visible movement by the Supreme Court towards the application of Fifth and Sixth Amendment considerations to the pre-arraign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>ment period. That movement culminated, of course, in <em>Miranda, </em>in the shadow of which Rule 5 (a) now resides and which has probably made academic problems of the kind we confront on this record.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Now we must consider directly the effect on <em>Mallory </em>of a <em>Miranda </em>that has come of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Although not explicitly premised on constitutional grounds, <em>Mallory </em>has been ultimately concerned with effectuation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections against the dangers of involuntary self-incrimination in stationhouses and with the other evils inherent in police interrogation of an accused in secret.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he delay [in presentment before a magistrate],\u201d <em>Mallory </em>admonished, \u201cmust not be of a nature to give opportunity for the extraction of a confession.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Its parent opinion, McNabb v. United States,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> rested on the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtKK\">\u201c[legislation [comparable to Rule 5 (a)] * * *, requiring that the police must with reasonable promptness show legal cause for detaining arrested persons, constitutes an important safeguard \u2014 not only in assuring protection for the innocent but also in securing conviction of the guilty by methods that commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society. For this procedural requirement checks resort to those reprehensible practices known as the \u2018third degree\u2019 which, though universally rejected as indefensible, still find their way into use. It aims to avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1225-16\"><em>Mallory </em>itself has stood guard against not only the \u201cthird degree,\u201d but also \u201cthe pressures in a Police Station upon prisoners under secret interrogation without counsel, relative or friend.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These, of course, are precisely the concerns of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-17\">The <em>Mallory </em>solution for these iniquities was enforcement by an exclusionary rule of the requirement that the accused be brought \u201cbefore a judicial officer as quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights * * <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But this remedy was at best imperfect because some delay in presentment is unavoidable and, as <em>Mallory </em>concedes, additional delays for some purposes may be justifiable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such postponements are, of course, as susceptible to abuses as any others, and experience has exemplified the difficulty inherent in ascertaining either the real purpose of a challenged delay or the actual nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>interrogations carried out behind closed stationhouse doors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">In <em>Miranda, </em>the Supreme Court eschewed this uncertain detour through Rule 5(a) and attacked the problem of custodial interrogation directly. It held that the accused is entitled to the assistance of counsel before he is questioned and, in effect, that any confession he makes while in exclusive police custody prior to arraignment is presumptively inadmissible under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Such confessions can stand if, but only if, the accused affirmatively and understandingly waives his rights, and the Government bears \u201ca heavy burden\u201d in attempting to show such a waiver.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-13\">Thus, absent convincing evidence of waiver, no confession may be admitted, regardless of the dispatch with which the accused is presented before a magistrate. Conversely, should the Government carry its burden, we think it follows that the confession is not inadmissible solely on the ground that the accused was not taken before a magistrate at the earliest possible moment. A valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver is necessarily, for the duration of the waiver,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> also a waiver of an immediate <em>judicial </em>warning of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And what <em>Miranda, </em>as a constitutional interpretation, leaves an accused at liberty to yield, he may, we believe, forego equally under Mal<em>lory.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Provided the exacting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>standards for waiver are met, the overriding purpose of <em>Mallory </em>has been served.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">By no means is this to say that unjustified delay in compliance with Rule 5(a) has no bearing on the admissibility of a confession forthcoming during a period of such delay. As <em>Miranda </em>made clear,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-5\">\u201c[w]hatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights. In these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">Thus, the greater the tardiness in presentment prior to a confession, the heavier the Government\u2019s already \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing effective waiver. Certainly some conceivable delays are so long that no subsequent confession could be deemed the product of voluntary waiver. And nothing in <em>Miranda </em>affects the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of evidence of any sort obtained during detention following an illegal arrest.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-13\">Thus the vital question here is whether appellant voluntarily and understandingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. If he did not, his confession was inadmissible under <em>Miranda. </em>If he did, the confession was admissible even if the purpose inspiring his transfer to police headquarters was interrogation for the production of evidence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>The record discloses that appellant objected when, as he began his string of confessions, Sergeant Keahon started to take notes on his confession. How strenuously he objected does not appear, but it is noteworthy that Keahon stopped writing at that point. He testified entirely from memory to the details of the confession, which was made a year before the trial began, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A74\">\u201cat the beginning of his admission, I started to write notes, and he stopped me and said: Don\u2019t write anything down. I will tell you about this but I don\u2019t want you to write anything down.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The strong implication is that appellant thought his confession could not be used against him so long as nothing was committed to writing. If, as his avowed motive for confessing suggests, he was brooding over a guilty conscience while the warnings were being given, he might well have failed to absorb their message. Or he may simply have been laboring under the common misapprehension that the police could not use in court anything he said unless they were able to introduce a written statement. Whatever the reason, the evidence raises a serious question as to whether he intelligently waived his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-9\">Appellant was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in their entirety. He signed what purported to be an express waiver. If there were no other evidence in the record, the Government would have discharged its burden, and no further inquiry would be necessary. But while \u201c[a]n express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement <em>could </em>constitute a waiver,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>teaches that in many circumstances it does not.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Here, Sergeant Keahon\u2019s testimony suggests powerfully that the waiver was not understandingly made; in addition, the hour appellant spent in custody before the ceremonial \u201cwaiver\u201d casts doubt on whether it was voluntarily made. Since the Government offered no evidence to dispel these doubts, we cannot say on this record that it carried its \u201cheavy burden * * * to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>ly waived his privilege against self-incrimination * * <footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">The Government argues, however, that because the question was not raised below, appellant should not be allowed to present it here. We disagree. Appellant\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> was initially confronted with the signed waiver and what appeared to be a spontaneous confession. It is scarcely surprising that he prepared a <em>Mallory, </em>not a <em>Miranda, </em>argument. The evidence connoting that appellant did not understandingly waive his rights did not develop until the direct examination of Sergeant Keahon. Defense counsel then made an apparent attempt to raise the issue in a general way, but the matter was lost in the <em>Mallory </em>argument he was pursuing. We do not demand more of appellants as a condition to litigation of issues fundamental in the criminal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Nonetheless, because the Government had no clear warning that it would need to produce more evidence, we are reluctant to reverse for a new trial. Appellant\u2019s ban on note-taking inveighs against intelligent waiver, but this inference might be overcome, for example, if Sergeant Keahon admonished him that even an oral confession would be used against him, and appellant replied that he knew that but still did not want anything written down. Absent some additional evidence, comparable in quality, of understanding waiver, however, his confession cannot stand. Accordingly, we shall remand the record in this case to the District Court for an evi-dentiary hearing and findings of fact on the validity of appellant\u2019s purported waiver.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-16\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-17\">Appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in permitting two eyewitnesses to the Meridian Market robbery to identify him at the trial as a participant. His argument is that these in-court identifications were products of prior extrajudicial identifications made in circumstances so unnecessarily suggestive and promotive of faulty recognition as to impinge on due process of law.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We deferred our disposition of this case to enable evaluation of appellant\u2019s claim in the light of the recent <em>Clemons </em><footnotemark>38</footnotemark> decision by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-18\">One, but only one, of the pretrial episodes complained of falls within the area of constitutional condemnation. More than a month after appellant\u2019s arrest, Louis I. Rezniek, the owner of the market, and William Simpson, an employee, both of whom were present when the holdup occurred, viewed appellant while confined in a cellblock. Appellant was the only person they were shown, and both witnesses knew at the time that appellant had confessed. As the Government now itself characterizes the incident, this single-suspect cellblock confrontation was \u201cindeed suggestive\u201d; so much so, we hasten to add, as to render it offensive to due process.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-19\">The Government, however, did not rely upon the out-of-court iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>tifications at the trial.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The question, then, is whether the in-court identifications had a source sufficiently independent of the cellblock exhibition as to be free from its taint.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The trial court found that there was no taint, and we deem the evidence adequate to support that finding.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Reznick and Simpson each testified at trial that they remembered appellant from impressions received at the time of the robbery. The offense was perpetrated by two men during daylight hours over a period of several minutes during which both Reznick and Simpson had excellent opportunities to scrutinize the two robbers. Afterwards, they gave the police detailed joint descriptions of the culprits, one of which depicted appellant reasonably well. In addition, Rez-nick selected appellant\u2019s photograph out of \u201ca box of pictures\u201d given him by the police shortly after appellant\u2019s arrest. This evidence, we hold, was sufficient to support the finding that Reznick\u2019s identification was not tainted by the cell-block confrontation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">As to Simpson, who made no prior photographic identification, the proof on independent source for his in-court identification included a very significant event. On the night of appellant\u2019s arrest, Simpson was brought to police headquarters to identify him. According to the uncontradicted testimony of Detective Keahon,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-14\">\u201cwhen Mr. Simpson walked into the office, he saw Frazier and he said: There\u2019s the man that approached me in the back and stated, this is a holdup. And at the same time the Defendant Frazier shook his head; and I asked him what did he mean by shaking his head; and he said: Yes, that is the man that was behind the meat counter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">Ordinarily, an identification arising out of so suggestive a confrontation would itself be constitutionally dubious.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Here, however, not only did Simpson identify appellant, but appellant also identified Simpson. There can be no doubt on the record that by \u201cthe man that was behind the meat counter,\u201d appellant referred to Simpson\u2019s presence there at the time of the robbery. At this juncture, his urge to confess was so strong that he even acted out one of the other holdups to which he had confessed in order to convince hesitant eyewitnesses to that crime that he had indeed been the perpetrator. His statement, however, is relevant here, not because it is evidence of guilt and thus, indirectly, of the reliability of Simpson\u2019s identification, but rather because it tends directly to confirm the existence of an independent source for the challenged identification. And, with this, there could hardly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>any \u201csubstantial likelihood of irreparable mistaken identification.\u201d <footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">We remand the case to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">.

Whenever it appears that an arrest was made without probable cause, a question may arise independently of <em>Mallory </em>as to whether evidence subsequently obtained in violation of Rule 5(a) must be excluded as fruit of the illegal arrest.

This case itself is illustrative of the difficulty: the police practice of processing at headquarters persons arrested at the precinct may or may not be essential to efficient police administration ; if it is essential, it nonetheless presents obvious opportunities for improper interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">. After the warnings have been given \u201c[i]f the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. * * * This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 [58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461] (1938), and we re-assert these standards as applied to in-custody interrogation.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, <em>supra </em>note 3, 384 U.S. at 475, 86 S.Ct. at 1628.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1226-12\">. A valid waiver ceases to be effective whenever the accused indicates in any manner that he wishes to remain silent or that he wants an attorney. Miranda v. Arizona, <em>supra </em>note 3, 384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1226-15\">. <em>Miranda </em>implicitly assumes that it is possible for the police to convey to the accused sufficient understanding of his rights to enable him to make an intelligent waiver. A police warning, to be effective, must be given with proper solicitude for actual understanding. Moreover, a waiver made in the coercive atmosphere of police custody is less likely to be voluntary than one made before a commissioner. Thus the Government carries such a weighty burden of proving waiver in cases involving confessions to the police. But irrespective of who gives the warnings or takes the confessions, the ultimate question is whether the waiver is voluntary in the full sense of the word. If an accused did not understand what a magistrate told him, an ensuing confession would not be rendered admissible because he had been advised of his rights by a judicial officer. Similarly, under <em>Miranda, </em>a waiver may be valid even though made on the basis of police warnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1226-17\">. We do not conclude, however, that in waiving his right to remain silent, the accused also impliedly waives his right to complain of a <em>prior </em>violation of Rule 5(a). Bather, we construe <em>Mallory </em>not to require exclusion of an otherwise admissible confession because of a brief delay in obtaining a <em>Miranda </em>waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">. Rule 5(a) also confers upon the accused a prompt opportunity to persuade a magistrate, at a preliminary hearing under Rule 5(c), that there is no prohable cause for holding him. While, of course, that policy remains in force, see Adams v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 19, 130 U.S.App.D.C. at 208, 399 F.2d at 579, <em>Mallory </em>has enforced it only coincidentally, since it has no effect if no incriminating evidence is obtained as a result of the delay, and since it has been read not to apply where the unnecessary delay in presentment to a magistrate occurs <em>after </em>a confession. Coor v. United States, <em>supra </em>note 21, 119 U.S.App.D.C. at 260, 340 F.2d at 785, Bailey v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 241, 328 F.2d 542, cert. denied 377 U.S. 972, 84 S.Ct. 1655, 12 L.Ed.2d 741 (1964); Lockley v. United States, 106 U.S.App. D.C. 163, 270 F.2d 915 (1959); Porter v.

Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 70-71, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">If probable cause is found, Rule 5(a) still serves to promote early consideration of an accused\u2019s admission to bail. This function of the rule has taken on added importance with the enactment of the Bail Reform Act, 80 Stat. 214 (1966), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 <em>et seq. </em>But for the same reason that <em>Mallory </em>has little relevance to the goal of assuring expeditious determination of the existence of probable cause, it is not a significant antidote to the problem of delays in bail hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-15\">Rule 5(a) also serves to provide early warning by a magistrate of the right to counsel, which may be important in protecting an accused\u2019s interest at a line-up. See Williams v. United States, \u2014 U.S.App.D.C. \u2014, 419 F.2d 740 (Dec. 20, 1968). Thus, identification evidence obtained in the absence of counsel may be excluded independently of the rules of United States v. Wade, Gilbert v. California, and Stovall v. Denno, all <em>supra </em>note 3, if it is obtained during an \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d in presentment. If the right to counsel has been validly waived under <em>Miranda, </em>however, this issue will not arise. Moreover, even in the absence of a waiver, if counsel was in fact present at the challenged confrontation, and if the resulting identification is otherwise admissible, <em>Mallory </em>does not require its exclusion because of a violation of Rule 5(a).

If Sergeant Kea-hon was not admonished about note-taking until after the challenged confession was given, we must disbelieve his explanation as to why he had no notes concerning it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">. The thrust of <em>Miranda </em>is that in order to permit \u201ca full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and <em>effectively </em>apprised of his rights * * *.\u201d 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624 (emphasis added). Specifically included among the warnings the Court found essential to an <em>adequate </em>apprisal is notice of the fact that \u201canything said can and will be used against the individual in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 86 S.Ct. at 1625. This warning is needed in order to make him aware of the consequences of foregoing his privilege not to speak. \u201cIt is only through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And as this explanation suggests, a warning is not <em>effective </em>if it is not understood.

United States, 138 U.S. App.D.C. 27, 408 F.2d 1230 (Dec. 6, 1968) <em>en banc, </em>but I do not agree with those parts of the majority opinion relating to the inadmissibility of statements which Appellant made to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">The sole issue separating me from the majority is whether Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) required Appellant\u2019s statements to be excluded from the evidence. In answering this question affirmatively the majority leans heavily on Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957), the standing of which has been drawn into serious doubt by recent Congressional enactments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s cognizance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the message that this series of legislation bears for <em>Mallory </em>and their apparent agreement with the lower court\u2019s finding that <em>Mallory </em>was not violated here,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> belies <em>Mallory\u2019s </em>true significance to the issues at hand. Moreover it is unsound to treat <em>Mallory </em>and <em>Miranda </em>as closely related; the former is a quanti-tive test of time delay, the latter is a qualitative test of the circumstances of the interrogation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-21\">Of more concern is the majority\u2019s expansion of <em>Miranda </em>into a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule, thereby transcending the Fifth Amendment requirement that only those statements elicited through <em>compulsion </em>be excluded from evidence. Indeed, <em>Miranda </em>itself cannot be read as going beyond the language of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any lingering doubts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>this score were resolved by a recent exposition on the subject by the Supreme Court. In discussing the scope of <em>Miranda </em>the Court pertinently noted in Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 303-04, 87 S.Ct. 408, 414, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), that, \u201csince at least as long ago as 1807, when Chief Justice Marshall first gave attention to the matter in the trial of Aaron Burr, all have agreed that a necessary element of compulsory self-incrimination is <em>some kind of compulsion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added) (footnote omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">In <em>Miranda </em>the Supreme Court held that certain warnings must be given to a suspect before \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d could be conducted. The underlying assumption was that these warnings were necessary to prevent the subversion of trial rights at unsupervised pretrial confrontations between an accused and the State. Whereas <em>pre-Miranda </em>eases had alternately invoked the Fifth and Sixth Amendments <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>made el\u00e9ar that the Fifth Amendment was the central value at stake. The articulation of a stringent waiver requirement was merely a device through which the Court sought to ensure that Fifth Amendment guarantees were not unduly impaired at pretrial interrogations. The guidelines set forth in <em>Miranda </em>were means servicing constitutionally prescribed ends; as artifices of implementation they are subordinate and only incidental to the rights they were designed to secure. By postulating a waiver concept .the Court did not intend to eclipse the threshold inquiries into the presence of compulsion and the quality of police conduct attending the making of inculpatory statements. This is the background of controlling legal principles on which this case ought to be decided. I do not agree that they give rise to a plausible claim of improper police tactics amounting to coercion requiring reversal or remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-11\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-12\">Frazier was presented to Officer Kea-hon at headquarters at 5:20 P. M. Their meeting was prefaced by Keahon\u2019s reading the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to him from PD-47 (a form card which all police officers carry and which had previously been read to Frazier by Officer Sandy upon his arrest). He repeated these warnings to Frazier when he read PD-54, a form which advised him of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and contained a statement of an intention to waive his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. Thereafter, at 5:30 P. M., Frazier himself read this form, orally stated that he understood its meaning,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and signed the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-13\">Officer Keahon testified that he then read the arrest warrant relating to the robbery of Mike\u2019s Carry Out Shop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>started to question Frazier on that robbery. But, after Keahon had spoken but a few words, Frazier blurted out his desire to clear a third person who had been arrested for the robbery and shooting at a High\u2019s Store. Within minutes Frazier, by way of exculpating others, admitted to his involvement in the robberies at the High\u2019s Store, at Mike\u2019s Carry Out Shop, at the Dodge Market, and at the Meridian Market \u2014 the last robbery being the one for which he was convicted in this case. During this discourse Frazier objected to Officer Kea-hon\u2019s taking written notes. Keahon testified: \u201cAt the beginning of his admission, I started to write notes, and he stopped me and said: \u2018Don\u2019t write anything down. I will tell you about this but I don\u2019t want you to write anything down.\u2019 \u201d [Tr. 72.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">The admission of the Meridian Market robbery was unsolicited and appears to have been volunteered. Officer Keahon testified that he did not ask Frazier whether he participated in the Meridian Market robbery and that the only questions asked in relation to that robbery during the initial confession were for the purpose of corroborating the identification of the market. Thus it seems that the confession was totally spontaneous and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">Following the statements Frazier was retained in the robbery squad office for nearly two hours, where he was quizzed in detail about the four robberies, reiterated his confessions, was displayed to several witnesses, and reenacted several of the robberies. Thereafter he was placed in a cell for the night because a Commissioner was not available and was presented the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-7\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-8\">The record demonstrates entirely reasonable police activity satisfying the deterrent purposes underlying the <em>Miranda </em>rule. There is not a scintilla of evidence suggesting that what had been forthcoming from Appellant\u2019s lips was the result of unreasonable or improper police conduct. The fact that Appellant may not have desired the statement to be transcribed does not compel the conclusion that he was being subjected to the kind of police activity found unconscionable in <em>Miranda. </em>The most that can be said from Appellant\u2019s statements is that he may have <em>unintentionally </em>incriminated himself. The Fifth Amendment, however, serves neither to discourage nor to prohibit self-incrimination, it militates only against <em>compulsory </em>self-incrimination. The record does not even remotely suggest that Appellant was being compelled to incriminate himself, no less compelled to utter any words at all. There is not the slightest indication that Appellant was unaware of his rights or labored under a misbelief that his failure to speak could be used against him as evidence of guilt. There is no intimation that the environment would have neither permitted nor honored a non-waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-12\">In fact, no issue is even purportedly raised as to Appellant\u2019s willingness to make the statements that were eventually used against him. Indeed, evidence of his volition may be inferred from his voluntary participation later that evening in a series of identification procedures. In view of the obvious spontaneity surrounding its making, the statement could plainly have been used as a threshold oral confession.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-13\">In this regard it also bears noting that the \u201cplus factors\u201d so frequently contributing to a rejection of a confession are not present in this case. Frazier was repeatedly told of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent; he confessed immediately and without prior denials; he never repudiated his confession and he did not make any allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>tions of coercive threats or physical abuses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">By equating Frazier\u2019s insistence that the police not write notes with a desire not to incriminate himself, the majority engages in sheer speculation of Appellant\u2019s thought processes which places a premium on the capacity of judges to probe Appellant\u2019s mind. This approach bears an unfortunate resemblance to the sophistry engaged in by the courts which labored under the albatross of Betts v. Brady.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, the rule requiring courts to peer through kaleidoscopes in search of constitutional violations inevitably deteriorated into measuring the constitutional right in terms of the suspect\u2019s need \u2014 and invariably a horribly guilty suspect at that. Although this theory received currency during the era of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d, twenty years of inconsistent application which produced no judicially manageable standards eventually persuaded the Supreme Court in Miranda<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to turn to an essentially objective<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> mode of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Since the underlying purpose of <em>Miranda </em>was to curb police improprieties, the use of objective criterion provided courts with a more workable method of evaluating the reasonableness of police conduct. The unhappy theory holding the police accountable for environmental and personality factors unavoidably unique to each suspect and frequently beyond the pale of police perception came to rest in the shadow of an exclusionary rule grounded in deterrence. Indeed, the Supreme Court in Johnson v. New Jersey<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> confirmed the essentially deterrent underpinnings of <em>Miranda </em>and thereby placed its imprimatur on an interpretation focusing on the reasonableness of police conduct instead of the vagaries of human nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\"><em>Miranda </em>did not set down a <em>per se </em>proscription against pretrial questioning; it was addressed primarily to abusive and unwarranted tactics designed to subvert constitutional rights. Even if Frazier unwittingly incriminated himself, the police should not be held accountable in the absence of some evidence of deceit or misconduct on their part. Here, of course, there is no such evidence. Indeed, the majority clothes Appellant\u2019s remarks with a significance bearing no relationship to the record or to ordinary human experience. Throughout the majority opinion is circumspect avoidance of any discussion relating to coercion or improper police conduct. To the extent Appellant\u2019s utterances may be construed as indicating a misunderstanding of the consequences of his making incriminatory statements the majority has failed to supply a nexus between this and the presence of improper police conduct amounting to coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-9\">I have difficulty perceiving the basis for the majority\u2019s argument that it was unreasonable for the police to proceed with questions <em>after </em>Frazier made an apparently valid waiver. Although this waiver was not irrevocable,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> there is nothing to show that Frazier indicated \u201cin any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wish[ed] to remain silent\u201d or that he wanted an attorney. Miranda v. Arizona, <em>supra </em>at 473-474, 86 S.Ct. at 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-10\">Having complied with the postulates of <em>Miranda, </em>it was the absolute duty of the police as law enforcement agents to investigate promptly the circumstances of the crime and the suspect\u2019s possible participation. I am somewhat at a loss to know what more the Government could or should have done to comply with the directives of <em>Miranda. </em>Even if Frazier did not understand the privilege against self-incrimination, the majority\u2019s approach is unrealistic and goes beyond the mandates of any decided cases. It seemingly expects the police to detect indications of misunderstanding and lack of knowledge which are so subtle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>not even judges would recognize the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">The seeming anxiety of judges to protect every accused person from every consequence of his voluntary utterances is giving rise to myriad rules, sub-rules, variations and exceptions which even the most alert and sophisticated lawyers and judges are taxed to follow. Each time judges add nuances to these \u201crules\u201d we make it less likely that any police officer will be able to follow the guidelines we lay down. We are approaching the predicament of the centipede on the flypaper \u2014 each time one leg is placed to give support for relief of a leg already \u201cstuck\u201d, another becomes captive and soon all are securely immobilized. Like the hapless centipede on the flypaper, our efforts to extricate ourselves from this self-imposed dilemma will, if we keep it up, soon have all of us immobilized. We are well on our way to forbidding <em>any </em>utterance of an accused to be used against him unless it is made in open court. Guilt or innocence becomes irrelevant in the criminal trial as we flounder in a morass of artificial rules poorly conceived and often impossible of application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">The record raises the possibility that the only statements put into evidence were those made <em>prior </em>in time to Appellant\u2019s alleged equivocations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Police who act reasonably on facts presently in their possession should not be ascribed a taint by virtue of subsequent utterances of a suspect which might be said to exhibit symptoms forbidden by <em>Miranda. </em>The use of such a relating-back theory does violence to Miranda<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and brings us beyond the point of diminishing return in enforcing an exclusionary rule grounded in deterrence of proscribed police conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Constitution does not prohibit police interrogation of suspects who have waived the right to counsel and the majority opinion will not and should not impede interrogation after a waiver. What the holding will do is confuse and baffle police \u2014 as it will many judges.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">.

In assessing the legality of an arrest the question is framed in terms of whether the police officer had probable cause to believe a crime had been committed; similarly, in determining the admissibility of a confession, the question is whether there was sufficient reason for the police to believe that the suspect had consented to being questioned. In both instances the judicially declared objective of the rules is to prevent the police from reaping the benefit of official misconduct. Here Appellant is unable even to allege any police misconduct, hence the underlying predicate of the exclusionary rule is totally absent.
