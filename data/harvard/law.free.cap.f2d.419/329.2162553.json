(Kinter), to bargain collectively with Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 (Union), to offer to reinstate certain employees found to be discrimina-torily discharged, and to take other actions to remedy the effect of various other unfair labor practices. We find substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings, and grant enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">I VIOLATIONS OF SECTIONS 8(a) (1), 8(a) (3), 8(a) (4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The background is the classic struggle of a small unorganized enterprise to avoid organization of its employees. Kinter Bros, is a small retail grocery outlet in Mentor, Ohio, which regularly employs about twelve or thirteen people as cashiers, meatcutters, stockclerks, etc. In July, 1965, Joan Woe, a cashier, invited the Union to organize the Kinter employees. Woe spearheaded the campaign to obtain signatures on authorization cards. On July 16, 1965, the Union filed a petition for an election, and duly served a copy on Kinter. This petition was subsequently withdrawn. On October 25, 1965, the Union obtained another signature and, claiming to represent the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit, requested that Kinter recognize it as the representative of his shop employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Kinter was found by both the Examiner and the Board to have violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) on numerous counts both before and after the Union\u2019s demand for recognition. These violations included unlawful interrogation of employees, the paying of a preemptive bonus to undercut the Union and several discriminatory reprisals against employees who were thought to be instigators in the organization drive. As to the findings and decision on interrogation and the bonus it suffices to say these are amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">We turn for more detailed consideration to the findings of discriminatory reprisals and we reject both of Kinter\u2019s objections, as to Woe and Kolesar, and the Union\u2019s appeal, as to Grund.</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">a. <em>Joan Woe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">1. The Board found that Woe was discriminatorily discharged on two occasions. As to the first dismissal, in August 1965, Kinter contends this was the result of Woe\u2019s insubordination and \u201cbelligerence.\u201d We think there is ample support in the record for the finding that \u201cKinter discharged Woe as a reprisal for her union activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">The critical issue in a discharge case is whether the employee has been dismissed as part of a desire to hurt or to undercut the Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Kinter was openly hostile to labor activity, and, even prior to Woe\u2019s discharge, had demonstrated his anti-union animus. Kinter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>knew Woe was a central figure in the organization drive. Vera Morely, an employee, testified Kinter had said to her that Woe was a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d and \u201cthat he was going to get rid of her one way or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">2. Woe was rehired by Kinter after the first hearing in this case, and returned to the store March 8, 1966, where she continued in Kinter\u2019s employ until August 3, 1966. The Board found that the circumstances under which she quit at that time amounted to a constructive discharge that was discriminatory and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Although Kinter expressed no conditions at the time of Woe\u2019s reinstatement, the duties assigned her were different from those of the pre-Union days. Her pre-Union routine had been primarily to serve at the cash register, change prices and put up stock when business was slow, and fill in at the postal substation operated by the store. Upon her return Woe was primarily called upon to perform menial clean-up chores around the shop, chores that had been only a lesser part of her pre-Union routine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">The Examiner also found that: Although it had always been understood * * * that the most senior cashier had some kind of priority on the choice of [job] shifts, Woe was not given the opportunity to work the day shift, which she preferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Instead, Woe was assigned to a less desirable shift, even though the senior cashier retired shortly after Woe\u2019s return and new employees were hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">On July 16, Woe, due to \u201cher constant nervousness,\u201d consulted her doctor, who advised her to take a week off from work. She informed Kinter that she would not be at work for a week. When Woe subsequently called Kinter to tell him she would be available, he told her that the schedule for the coming week had already been drawn up and that she was not included. When Woe finally returned to work, August 3, she was again harassed and put to menial chores, seemingly without cause. The Trial Examiner, crediting Woe\u2019s testimony, found that the \u201cday\u2019s events had left her upset and nervous,\u201d and forced her to consult again with her doctor. On August 4, Woe wired Kinter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">Due to your treatment and action against me yesterday I have become ill and unable to work. Will let you know when I will return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">A finding of constructive discharge depends on \u201c[Whether the employer] deliberately made * * * working conditions intolerable and drove [the employee] into \u2018an involuntary quit.\u2019 \u201d NLRB v. Tennessee Packers, Inc., 339 F. 2d 203, 204 (6th Cir. 1964).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">The evidence is by no means one-sided and it is possible to draw conflicting inferences from the underlying facts. The Examiner\u2019s conclusions were favorable to Kinter. However, the Board, reviewing the primary facts found by the Examiner, concluded that Woe was constructively discharged since she was forced to quit by the humiliating and onerous conditions imposed as part of Kinter\u2019s continuing effort to undercut the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">We have reviewed the testimony and studied the opinions of both the Board and the Examiner. We are satisfied that the Board addressed itself \u201cto the salient conclusions and reasoning of the Examiner,\u201d and that there is substantial evidence to support the Board,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201ceven though there is also sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>stantial evidence to support the contrary conclusion of the examiner.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">b. <em>Helen Kolesar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Employee Kolesar worked in the meat department as a wrapper. Until July 26, 1965, she regularly worked thirty-three hours per week. The following week, after Kinter learned of the Union drive, Kolesar\u2019s work hours were reduced to twenty-five hours. She did not again work a thirty-three hour week in 1965 except on two occasions. Kinter testified, without offering supporting evidence, that his sales of meat had fallen off, but, as the Examiner noted in rejecting this explanation, Kinter \u201coffered no details or substantiation.\u201d The Examiner concluded, \u201cIn the light of its timing and other evidence of Kinter\u2019s opposition to the Union,\u201d that the reduction in hours was a discriminatory measure taken as reprisal for Kolesar\u2019s suspected involvement with the Union. This finding is supported on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There is substantial evidence that Kin-ter\u2019s anti-Union animus erupted in unlawful interrogation and other numerous unfair labor practices. Kolesar testified Kinter had asked her to sign a card indicating whether she had talked with anyone from the Union. When she sought to avoid the inquiry he accused her of contacting the Union. Kinter\u2019s hostility to the Union, his suspicion of Kolesar\u2019s involvement, combined with the timing of Ko\u00edesar\u2019s reduction in hours, amply supports a finding of discrimination. <em>Compare </em>Rivers Mfg. Corp. v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 511, 515 (6 Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVW\">c. <em>Olga Grund</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">The Union appeals from the Board\u2019s order relating to Olga Grund, who was the senior cashier. The complaint alleged her duties had been changed because of her involvement with the Union, and that she had been discriminatorily suspended on three occasions. The Examiner (and Board) concluded that there was no need to decide whether Grund was entitled to be reinstated to her former duties, since she had voluntarily left Kinter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also found that the three suspensions resulted from unjustified insubordination, and refused to award back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">The Examiner\u2019s conclusion, adopted by the Board, was that Grund\u2019s assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>was changed by Kinter in an attempt to undercut the Union. He further concluded, however, that Grund was openly uncooperative in refusing to assist the new postal assistant in the performance of her duties, and that the insubordination was not justified by the earlier discrimination, since Grund was not asked to perform \u201conerous, arduous, or demeaning\u201d tasks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We see no reason to modify the Board\u2019s order limiting relief in respect to Grund.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">II SECTION 8(a) (5) CHARGES: REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE, GOOD FAITH DOUBT.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We turn now to the question of whether Kinter\u2019s refusal to recognize and bargain with the Union after the Union claimed recognition on October 27, 1965, constituted a violation of section 8(a) (5) of the Labor Act, as was held by the Examiner and the Board.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">a. <em>The validity of the signatures</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">Kinter contends that the Board erred in finding that a majority of the unit wanted the Union. The starting point for our inquiry is the cards themselves, which were forthright in stating their purpose \u2014 -to authorize the Union as representative and collective bargaining agent. The only statement on the card, and one that appears on its face, is this short, clear and direct authorization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">I, the undersigned, an employee of _hereby authorize Retail Store Employees Union Local 880 to represent me for the purpose of collective bargaining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">Kinter claims two signatures\u2014 Terry Radcliffe and Theresa Reichard\u2014 were procured under false pretenses. The signing of such plain and unambiguous cards by an employee whose legal competency is not in issue is persuasive evidence of his intent, and can be vitiated only by clear and convincing evidence of gross misrepresentation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">The record does not present the \u201cclear\u201d evidence requisite to persuade us that employees were deceived as to the purpose of such a lucid and straightforward card. Reichard and Radcliffe testified that the Union solicitors said that the cards were only \u201cto show the boss\u201d that they had visited these employees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The organizers denied this, and their testimony was given credit by the Examiner (and in due course the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Board), based on both demeanor and the probabilities of the situation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">In one aspect the issue is simple: When there is a conflict of testimony and one witness is believed over another, in material part on the basis of demeanor evidence, we cannot say there was no substantial evidence to support the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The situation is not different because of its reference to the \u201cprobabilities\u201d of the situation. In deciding whether the Board\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable on the record we cannot fail to accord due deference to the Board\u2019s expertise in appraising these situations. We see no basis for withholding this deference from the Examiner\u2019s conclusion that it was unlikely that these experienced organizers resorted to such a \u201ctransparently irrelevant appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Assuming, however, that the organizers put forward such an emotional gambit, was it the kind of crucial statement that so distorts the organizing effort as to vitiate the simple card? Was it not more likely such a relatively unimportant aspect of the discussion as to have only minor significance, indeed to drop entirely out of the recollection of the organizers? Both employees acknowledged signing the card and filling in the blanks calling for name, address, date, job description. Neither employee was a stranger to unionism. Radeliffe\u2019s father, who was in the room when the organizers paid their call, was a union shop steward. Reichard\u2019s mother-in-law was a union card carrier. It is clear that many things were said in each conversation, although no one witness recalled either conversation in full. The card itself appealed to the principles of unionism, through quotations in the margins selected from the utterances of America\u2019s presidents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As might well be supposed, the organizers also, apparently, held out a hope of specific benefits to come: Reichard specifically recalled that they advised her the Union would obtain higher wages and better working hours <em>(supra, </em>note 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Recollections of what took place were somewhat murky and contradictory. In contrast stands the plain and simple fact that two people, of presumptively average intelligence, read and signed a clear card, and also took the effort to fill in the information called for. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (June 16, 1969). The evidence put forward to negative the obvious inference that these employees wanted what they signed for is anything but \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>See </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers [Hamburg Shirt Co.] v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>note 10.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>b. <em>Disposition of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><em>We </em>think our disposition of this case is controlled by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent rulings. In <em>Gissel </em>the Court affirmed the imposition of a bargaining order as to Sinclair as a remedy for an \u00a7 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain, where the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices have as a practical matter impeded recourse to the election procedure as a means of effectuating the choice of the majority. The Court affirmed the First Circuit\u2019s enforcement of the Board\u2019s order, which had imposed a bargaining remedy, on the ground that the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices were so extreme and highly coercive as to require such an order to effectuate the purpose of the act even assuming there had been no violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The <em>Gissel-Sinclair </em>ruling makes it clear that the Board order now before us must be enforced. The Board adopted the Examiner\u2019s conclusions, which included a determination that the employer\u2019s refusal to bargain was not due to a good faith doubt as to the Union\u2019s majority status, and that hence there was a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5). The Board also determined specifically\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">3. Because of the Respondent\u2019s widespread unfair labor practices beginning in July 1965, about the time the Union initially obtained majority status, we find that the policies of the Act would be effectuated by ordering the Respondent to bargain collectively with the Union, on request, even if the Respondent\u2019s refusal of the Union\u2019s bargaining request of October 27, 1965, were held not to violate Section 8(a) (5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">This determination, that the unfair labor practices were so extreme as to require a bargaining order even in the absence of an \u00a7 8(a) (5) violation, necessarily includes the lesser determination that the practices were so pervasive as to have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election process, and hence to warrant a bargaining order as a remedy for an unlawful refusal to bargain. That is the teaching of <em>Gissel-Sinclair </em>(395 U.S. 614-616).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Petition for enforcement granted.</p>\n<p id=\"A19\">Petition for review denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\">. <em>See </em>National Labor Relations Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et <em>seq. </em>(1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-12\">. <em>See </em>NLRB v.

The Examiner\u2019s decision limited back pay to the period August 1967-March 1968, when Kolesar was returned to a full work week (after another employee left). He found economic justification adduced by Kinter for a subsequent reduction of Kole-sar\u2019s hours. This issue presents a closer case, but on balance we think the Board did not abuse its discretion when it rejected the conclusions of its Examiner, \u201cinferring from all the circumstances\u201d that \u201crespondent was continuing its campaign to \u2018freeze out\u2019 Kolesar.\u201d <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-22\">.

The Trial Examiner did not rely on Kinter\u2019s testimony alone, but was influenced by the testimony of Barbara Locker, who corroborated Kinter\u2019s version of the Grund episode.

There is a dispute as to the appropriate bargaining unit. At the time of the Union\u2019s request for recognition thirteen people were employed at the Kinter store, including Harold Kinter, the owner. The Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion, adopted by the Board, was that the appropriate unit consisted of all the employees, excluding Kinter and his brother Howard, but including Woe, who had been discriminatorily discharged. We think the Board was well within its discretion. <em>See, e. g., </em>Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485, 491, 67 S.Ct. 789, 91 L.Ed. 1040 (1947) ; S. D. Warren Co. v.

While we are fighting for freedom, we must see, among other things, that labor is free.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A76\">FRANKLIN D.

Some of the language in our opinions may be taken as suggesting that a card plainly stating the purpose to designate the Union as representative and bargain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ing agent may not be impeached unless there were representations to the effect that its <em>only </em>purpose is an election. <em>See </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers [Sagamore Shirt] v. NLRB, 124 U.S.App. D.C. 365, 365 F.2d 898 (1966). However, it is clear that the ultimate test of these eases is whether there has been \u201cclear evidence of misrepresentation,\u201d <em>see </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers [Hamburg Shirt] v. NLRB, <em>supra </em>note 10, later refined in terms of \u201cgross misrepresentation.\u201d <em>See </em>International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agr. Implement Workers v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>129 U.S. App.D.C. at 202, 392 F.2d at 807. <em>See also </em>United Steelworkers v. NLRB, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 376 F.2d 770, cert. denied, Northwest Engineering Co. v.

NLRB v. Cumberland Shoe Corp., 351 F.2d 917 (6th Cir. 1965). The <em>Cumberland </em>test, as applied by this circuit, is in harmony with the approach announced by the Supreme Court in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (June 16, 1969). In \u201cresolving the conflict among the circuits in favor of approving the Board\u2019s Cumberland rule,\u201d the Supreme Court said (p. 606, 89 S.Ct. p. 1936):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM6\">we think it sufficient to point out that employees should be bound by the clear language of what they sign 'unless that language is deliberately and clearly canceled by a union adherent with words calculated to direct the signer to disregard and forget the language above his signature. * * * We cannot agree with the employers here that employees as a rule are too unsophisticated to be bound by what they sign unless expressly told that their act of signing represents something else.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
