(1964).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">The trial examiner found that there was illegal assistance \u2014 indeed, \u201cmassive assistance * * * far beyond the point of tolerance\u201d \u2014 but in view of the limited allegations in the complaint and the stance of General Counsel during the hearing <em>(see infra), </em>he abstained from finding \u201cdomination\u201d of the Committee by the Company. Before the Board, the Papermakers excepted to the examiner\u2019s refusal to find domination. General Counsel filed no exceptions or motions to amend its complaint even at this stage, see 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.17, but rather in its brief urged the Board to find domination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-16\">The Board, despite the fact that the complaint\u2019s allegation of a section 8(a) (2) violation was specifically limited to the acts of recognition, financial support, and maintenance of an oral contract, held that the complaint was sufficiently broad to encompass domination. It recognized, however, that the Company had not been confronted with this issue at the first hearing and so, in the interest of fairness, remanded the case to the trial examiner for further hearing on the domination issue so that the Company could raise any defenses and the parties could proffer additional evidence and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-17\">Thereupon, a year after the first hearing, a second hearing was held before the same trial examiner, which resulted in a finding of domination and a recommendation that the Committee be disestablished and that a new election be held to determine whether the Papermakers represented a majority of the Dennison employees. The Board adopted the findings and recommendations of the hearing examiner \u2014 168 NLRB No. 131 (1967)\u2014 and now seeks to enforce its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-18\">The initial question before us is whether the Board\u2019s remand for a second hearing was lawful. The Board based its authority for that remand on its conclusion that \u201cthe allegation of a violation of Section 8(a) (2) in the complaint is sufficient to include an allegation of employer domination.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-14\">\u201cIt shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u2014 to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it: \u2756 * <em>**</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>The Papermakers\u2019 charge against the Company alleged both domination and the contribution of financial and other support. The complaint issued by the Regional Director some seven weeks later alleged, in paragraph 7, that the Company was \u201crendering unlawful aid, assistance and support to the Committee\u201d by (a) recognizing the Committee as exclusive bargaining agent, (b) contributing financial and other support to it, and (c) maintaining an oral contract with the Committee providing for wages, hours, and working conditions. Paragraph 8 of the complaint alleged: \u201cBy the acts described above in paragraph 7, Respondent did engage in and is engaging in unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 8(a) (2).\u201d No reference to domination was included although, as the trial examiner properly noted, and General Counsel concedes, the word has achieved \u201cthe stature of a word of art\u201d. This deleted part of the original charge was not mere verbiage, nor could its deletions have been inadvertent: section 8(a) (2) has traditionally been viewed as encompassing two distinct types of violations, for proof of illegal assistance or interference results in the withholding of recognition until proper certification, whereas proof of domination signals the death knell for a labor organization. The Carpenter Steel Co., 76 NLRB 670 (1948); Hershey Metal Products Co., 76 NLRB 695 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Two of the acts alleged in the complaint \u2014 recognition and maintenance of an oral contract \u2014 give only an attenuated inference of domination, despite the requirement that the complaint give a clear and concise description of the acts which are claimed to constitute unfair labor practices. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.15. The third allegation, \u201ccontributing financial and other support,\u201d used the precise words of the part of section 8 (a) (2) <em>not </em>dealing with domination. In response to the Company\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars concerning the \u201cother support\u201d allegation, the General Counsel stated that the reference was to such conduct as allowing the Committee to use Company office and clerical staff, permitting Committee officials access to employees on Company premises and time, and endorsing the Committee and its achievements during pendency of various petitions filed by other unions. Again there was no direct reference to nor clear inference of a charge of domination. The trial examiner ruled that only illegal assistance had been alleged and so limited the evidence, to which the General Counsel took no exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">It was worse than bad procedural manners for the General Counsel to play cosy on this record by simply arguing for domination in its brief to the Board; this was a matter of substance. Unlike the situation in Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 407 F.2d 1357, 1361 (4th Cir. 1969), chiefly relied on by the Board in its brief, the distinction between a finding of domination and assistance is not a \u201cdistinction * * * without a difference.\u201d <em>See </em>The Carpenter Steel Co., <em>supra. </em>Nor could it be said that paragraph 8 of the complaint \u2014 alleging specific acts violative of section 8(a) (2)- \u2014 -has any efficacy as a \u201ccatchall\u201d clause. <em>Cf. </em>Boyle\u2019s Famous Corned Beef Co. v. N.L.R.B., 400 F.2d 154, 161-163 (8th Cir. 1968). The Board\u2019s syllogism is that because some acts were alleged which violate section 8(a) (2), and because that section also proscribes domination, domination was alleged. However, a specification of parts which are included in the whole is not a specification of the whole; when one orders apples at a market, he does not expect to be confronted with pears, although both are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>fruit. We have found no cases allowing the expansive interpretation of a complaint which the Board now urges on us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that proper procedure called for an amendment which, under the regulations, can be made after submission of a case to the Board. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">Our question therefore is whether, in light of General Counsel\u2019s failure to seek this substantive amendment, the Board can, in effect, <em>sua sponte </em>do it for him. The Company argues that by so acting the Board \u201cusurped the exclusive powers of the General Counsel in violation of section 3(d),\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1143-5\">\u201cThe General Counsel of the Board * * * shall have final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the * * * issuance of complaints * * * and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(d) (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">This section became part of the National Labor Relations Act with the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. Section 3(d) accompanied other provisions designed to separate the functioning of the Board from the functioning of the General Counsel, thereby leaving the prose-cutorial role to the General Counsel while limiting the Board to the performance of quasi-judicial functions. H.R.Rep. No. 510, U.S.Code Congressional Service, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947), p. 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">Were this all the statute provided, we would have no difficulty concluding that the Board lacked power to amend on its own motion. However, there remains section 10(b), a part of the original Wagner Act which was not deleted when section 3(d) was added in 1947. ' Section 10(b) provides that any complaint \u201cmay be amended by * * * the Board in its discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">We are fully aware that there may be some inconsistency between these two provisions. <em>See </em>International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers v. N. L. R. B., 110 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 289 F.2d 757, 760-762 (1960). However, when the Board\u2019s action supports the position taken by the General Counsel, we see no conflict between section 3(d) and 10(b), no usurpation of the General Counsel\u2019s prosecutorial function.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To read section 10(b) out of the Act in the absence of any conflict with section 3(b) would be not only an act of judicial repeal but would also deprive the Board of any power to act in the public interest in just such a circumstance as this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>where the General Counsel has indicated his position but misconceived his procedural approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">The question remains whether we render a disservice either to the Company in this case or to the future orderly conduct of Board proceedings by treating the Board\u2019s broad interpretation and remand as a <em>sua sponte </em>exercise of its amendment power under section 10(b). We think not. The issue of the scope of the complaint was a live one when the case was submitted to the Board, for the Papermakers had excepted to the trial examiner\u2019s failure to find domination and the General Counsel had sought through its brief to the Board a finding of domination. The Board did not, therefore, unearth an issue which the Company had no reason to know of in advance. More importantly, the action taken served the purposes of an amendment; not only was a new hearing had on the new charge, but the Company was fully apprised, as a result of the first hearing, of the evidence which might be weighed against it. Were we to say that what could have been accomplished by a motion to amend could not be done by action which accomplished the same purposes, we would honor form without regard for the function which form serves. As for the future regularity of proceedings, we see no advantage to the General Counsel or the Board in bypassing the amendment procedure; a new hearing is still required if the party was not confronted with the added charge at the first hearing, so that time is not saved, nor the record shortened, nor argument abbreviated by the use of interpretation rather than amendment. Thus, because the Board had the power to amend the complaint in these circumstances and should be treated as having exercised it, the Board\u2019s remand was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">Both the Company and the Committee contend, however, that even if the remand was within the Board\u2019s power, the second hearing violated due process because they were restricted by the trial examiner .to introducing evidence which had not been adduced at the first hearing, which ruling prevented their putting their case in the sequence and manner they deemed appropriate. In addition, they insist that .the record demonstrates such bias and unfairness on the part of the trial examiner that the hearing was a travesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">Concerning the ruling restricting the Company and the Committee to additional evidence, this was in accord with the mandate of the Board, reaffirmed by the Board over a motion for reconsideration. We see no prejudice on these facts. Of some 27 exhibits which were offered during the second hearing, almost all were admitted; the few which were rejected were either replaced by acceptable substitutes or were irrelevant. Testimony sought to be admitted and initially rejected was either eventually admitted or egregiously repetitive. The hearing .turned out to be substantially <em>de novo, </em>the trial examiner sensibly concluding that wide latitude in admitting evidence would save more time than haggling over each proffer. We concede, as we did in N. L. R. B. v. H. E. Fletcher Co., 298 F.2d 594, n. 5 (1st Cir. 1962), that there are situations in which piecemeal hearings may be significantly prejudicial because they prevent counsel from trying a case as he sees fit. Here, however, there has been no indication how counsel for the Company (or counsel for the Committee) would have proceeded differently, except to have been less cooperative in stipulating facts, which seems to us a matter of questionable tactics rather than of substance. Moreover, both the Company and the Committee knew what they had to confront in the second hearing: a constitution calling for management representation on a number of important committees combined with a half century history of intimate relationship between the Company and the Committee. A defense would necessarily require proof of independent Committee action and arms-length dealing in fact, and this kind of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>was fully introduced at the second hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">The contention that the trial, examiner\u2019s conduct precluded a fair hearing must also be rejected. Not only was there no formal objection during the hearing, in accordance with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.41, but there was no substantial showing of such personal bias as would support such a charge. Converse v. Udall, 262 F.Supp. 583, 590 (D.Or.1966); <em>cf. </em>N. L. R. B. v. Federal Dairy Co., 297 F.2d 487 (1st Cir. 1962); Bituminous Material &amp; Supply Co. v. N. L. R. B., 281 F.2d 365, 372 (8th Cir. 1960). The hearing, it is true, was an unseemly succession of <em>ad hominem </em>remarks by all except counsel for the Papermakers, whose participation was minimal. We have carefully scrutinized the record of the two-day hearing on remand and identified some 35 occasions of demeaning exchange among counsel and between the trial examiner and counsel. In part this is perhaps endemic to a hearing before the same examiner who presided over the first hearing and ruled against the Company. While this is not a basis for requiring a new examiner, N. L. R. B. v. Donnelly Garment Co., 330 U.S. 219, 236-237, 67 S.Ct. 756, 91 L.Ed. 854 (1947), it goes far to explain the atmosphere of tension and unmannerliness in the second hearing, which was completely absent from the first. The antagonism may also have stemmed from the appearance on the scene of counsel for the Committee,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whose unfamiliarity with the first hearing and applicable procedures exacerbated an already difficult situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">It was an unhappy hearing- \u2014 -the record sheds luster on no one \u2014 but all the relevant evidence was admitted and, as far as we can tell from our careful reading of the record, fairly considered. Unfortunate antagonism does not necessarily become prejudicial bias, and we have found no evidence in the record that it did so here. Bearing in mind that we do not have advisory power over administrative agencies, <em>Donnelly Garment, supra </em>at 237, 67 S.Ct. 756, we conclude that due process was accorded the Company and the Committee during the second hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">That there was substantial evidence of domination by the Company is clear. <em>See </em>n. 5 <em>supra. </em>We deal with a labor organization whose General Body is closer to management than to its own constituents; whose constituents merely vote for representatives to the General Body, never meet with it, do not pay dues, have no opportunity to discuss is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>sues before .they are resolved, and do not ratify decisions after they are made. Assuming that the General Body at times takes positions antithetical to management, these occasions have been rare and the entire process of Committee decision-making could be found to be unduly subject to management influence. What was sound thinking about labor-management relations when the Committee was founded in 1919 is not necessarily the legal minimum in 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">The petition for enforcement is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">\u201cPer Curiam. The petition for rehearing is denied. The fact that the Board \u201cmay\u201d amend a complaint \u201cupon motion,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7102.17, does not mean that it cannot do so <em>sua sponte </em>under section 10(b) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">By the Court:</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">.
