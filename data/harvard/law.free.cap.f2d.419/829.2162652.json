In essence the district court found as facts that the appellants failed to establish the identity of the aircraft that created the sonic booms; that there was negligence; and that the damage to the appellants' residential property was caused by the sonic booms.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">A careful examination of the record discloses that the findings of fact are substantially supported by the evidence, and are far from being clearly erroneous. The application of the clearly erroneous rule to this case, adversely to appellants\u2019 contentions, disposes of all questions on appeal presented by appellants which merit attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\u00b0 Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
