In August, 1961, Beverly approved a mortgage loan of $150,000 to C.M.O. Builders, Inc., a corporation which was owned in part by defendant Pickle and was the beneficial owner of the real property in question. Pickle had applied for the loan, signed the note individually, and assigned the beneficial interest in the property to Beverly as collateral. Plaintiff\u2019s suit is based on a real estate appraisal which Pickle had included with the loan application and which had been prepared by defendant Cook, a land appraiser and member of the Society of Residential Appraisers. Plaintiff alleged that the appraisal grossly over-valued the property in question and was prepared \u201cwith the knowledge and intent that said appraisal would be relied upon and that the person or corporation so relying thereon would thereby be deceived and defrauded.\u201d The district court, sitting without a jury, found for the defendants and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-13\">The judgment of the Court below was based on the findings that plaintiff failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the various elements of the charge of fraud. These elements were succinctly stated by the United States Supreme Court as \u201c(1) a false representation (2) in reference to a material fact (3) made with knowledge of its falsity (4) and with the intent to deceive (5) with action taken in reliance upon the representation.\u201d Pence v. United States, 316 U.S. 322, 338, 62 S.Ct. 1080, 1083, 86 L.Ed. 1510 (1942). <em>Cf. </em>Citizens Savings &amp; Loan Association v. Fischer, 67 Ill.App.2d 315, 325, 214 N. E.2d 612 (1966); Public Motor Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co., 69 App.D.C. 89, 99 F.2d 124 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-14\">Plaintiff, at trial, sought to establish the essential fact of reliance on the appraisal by the testimony of the four directors of Beverly who were members of the loan committee which approved the loan in question. The conduct of these directors in reviewing the loan application was admittedly cursory. Pickle\u2019s loan was approved at the same time as twenty others, no member of the loan committee ever inspected the property, and no one else was delegated the task of doing so or otherwise verifying the representations contained in the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-15\">The testimony of the loan committee members was generally weak and equiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>ocal. The transcript reveals that the directors were \u201crelatively new to this activity\u201d at the time the loan was approved, and subsequently, \u201ctightened up [their] procedure considerably.\u201d The witnesses agreed that it was customary to examine appraisals before approving loans. However, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the loan committee members did not remember seeing the appraisal in question, but merely assumed that since the inclusion of an appraisal was customary, they must have seen Cook\u2019s appraisal when they passed on Pickle\u2019s loan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiff failed to approve by a preponderance of the evidence that Beverly relied upon the representations made in the appraisal, we are governed by Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-5\">\u201cIn all actions tried upon the facts without a jury * * *, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon, and judgment shall be entered pursuant to Rule 58; * * *. Findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">The courts have had many occasions to comment upon the standards applied under Rule 52(a). The Supreme Court, in commenting on the above language, stated: \u201cThe rule requires that an appellate court make allowance for the advantages possessed by the trial court in appraising the significance of conflicting testimony and reverse only \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 findings.\u201d Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Company v. Linde Air Products Company, 336 U.S. 271, 275, 69 S.Ct. 535, 537, 93 L.Ed. 672 (1949). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 195, 83 S.Ct. 1773, 10 L.Ed.2d 823, n. 9 (1963); Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">In Fox River Paper Corp. v. United States, 165 F.2d 639, 640 (7th Cir. 1948), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-9\">\u201cWe have to determine only whether the finding of the trial court is clearly erroneous, [footnote omitted] The finding is not clearly erroneous if there is substantial evidence to support it. * * * We do not weigh the evidence or resolve any conflicts therein, or consider here the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1358-10\">Cf. Greiner v. Chicago &amp; E. I. R. Co., 360 F.2d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-11\">In the instant case, the witnesses remembered very little concerning the particular transaction in question. While some stated that they remembered seeing Cook\u2019s appraisal, others stated that they did not so remember. The directors had passed on some twenty loans on the day they approved Pickle\u2019s. The events in question took place some seven years prior to the trial. After an independent reading of the record, we are of the opinion that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial judge. While certain selected passages of the transcript might support plaintiff\u2019s position, this Court, which did not have the advantage of viewing the demeanor of the witnesses, is not left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the court below. See Prince v. Packer Manufacturing Company, 419 F. 2d 34 (7th Cir., dated November 18, 1969). The district court, on the basis of the testimony presented, was amply justified in concluding that Pickle\u2019s loan was approved summarily, without any reliance on Cook\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-12\">Since the finding that no reliance was proven precludes a recovery by plaintiff on the charge of fraud, we find it un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>necessary to discuss the correctness of the district court\u2019s findings on the other elements of the charge. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1357-17\">.
