As to contention (6), the application for leave to appeal will also be denied since the petition of the applicant only alleges that he was searched without a warrant at the time of his arrest. There was no allegation, nor any claim in the record, that there was an illegal seizure of any evidence, nor that any such evidence was used against the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
