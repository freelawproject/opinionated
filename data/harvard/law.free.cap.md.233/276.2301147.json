The appellant, on the stand, did not deny (in effect, confessed) the snatching. After he was taken into custody as a result of the description the victim gave the police, the appellant led the police to a lot where various items, which unquestionably had been in the victim\u2019s purse, including her income tax returns and envelopes addressed to her, were recovered. There can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>question that the evidence was sufficient to permit the trier of fact, the court sitting without a jury, to have been convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of ;he defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
