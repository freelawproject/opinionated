See Code (1957), Article 56, Section 228, which prohibits recovery in cases of this nature \u201cunless such person, copartnership, association or corporation was licensed hereunder * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The pertinent facts are simple and not in dispute. They disclose that at the time of the transactions involved herein there were in existence two real estate broker\u2019s licenses, one having been issued by the Real Estate Commission of Maryland to \u201cWilson B. Jameson, Trading as Jameson-Ryan Realty, Inc.,\u201d and the other to \u201cWilliam E. Ryan, Trading as Jameson-Ryan Realty, Inc.\u201d Jameson and Ryan were both officers of the appellee-corporation, and neither held an individual broker\u2019s license in Maryland, unless the licenses just mentioned constituted individual, rather than corporate, ones. The facts further show that no license was ever issued in the sole name of \u201cJame-son-Ryan Realty, Inc.,\u201d as it has been the consistent practice of the Real Estate Commission to issue real estate licenses to corporate brokers only in the form in which the licenses were here issued; namely to one, or more, individuals \u201ctrading as\u201d such corporate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The licensing of real estate brokers by the Real Estate Commission is controlled by Code (1957 &amp; 1963 Cum. Supp.), Article 56, Sections 212 to 232, both inclusive. Pertinent parts of Sections 218 and 221 are set forth below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The appellants contend that the Real Estate Commission simply failed to comply literally with the provisions of Section 218, and, since the terms thereof are unambiguous, the Commission\u2019s administrative practice in issuing corporate broker\u2019s licenses in the form described above was not controlling; hence, its action in issuing the licenses to Jameson and Ryan \u201ctrading as Jameson-Ryan Realty, Inc.\u201d was ineffective to constitute a corporate broker\u2019s license to the appellee, but merely constituted individual licenses to Jameson and Ryan. In support of this contention, they assert: \u201cSimilar statutes in New York and Pennsylvania have been held to require a real estate brok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>er\u2019s license issued to the corporation itself, as distinguished from the individuals involved,\u201d citing <em>Kernan &amp; Co. v. Smith, </em>210 N. Y. S. 131 (1925); <em>Comm. v. Samuel W. Black Co., </em>72 A. 261 (Pa. 1909); and <em>Comm. v. Trust Company, </em>60 A. 551 (Pa. 1905). Our reading of the cases, discloses no such holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In <em>Kernan, </em>the Court does not hold, nor even discuss, whether a corporate broker\u2019s license <em>must </em>be issued in the name of the corporation. The case holds that when a corporate broker\u2019s license has been issued, an individual officer authorized by such license to act for the corporation, may not act, under the license, as a broker in his own behalf. (Section 218 of our law explicitly so provides.) The <em>Trust Company </em>case held that a licensed corporate broker was not liable for a tax under a Pennsylvania statute as it was then framed; and the <em>Black Co. </em>case held that such a broker was subject to taxation under the statute, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The record does not disclose which of the two licenses mentioned above was first issued, but, in the view that we take of the case, this fact is immaterial; consequently, we assume that the Jameson \u201cTrading as Jameson-Ryan Realty, Inc.\u201d one was first in point of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">There is no provision in Maryland law which prescribes the precise form or wording of a broker\u2019s license, whether for an individual or a corporation. On the contrary Section 221 (c), <em>supra, </em>provides that the license certificate shall be \u201cin such * * * form as [the Commission] may approve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We think the facts, as we have stated them above, show, in regard to the first license, at least, a substantial compliance with Section 218 (a). The corporation\u2019s application for a license is not contained in the record. It must have designated Jameson as the applicant\u2019s officer authorized to represent it as a real estate broker, otherwise his name would not have been \u201cinserted in the license,\u201d as it actually was. Jameson must also have had the qualifications required by Section 217 (b) and (c) for a real estate broker\u2019s license, or he would not have been an officer \u201cduly qualified\u201d under Section 218 (a). The fact that the license was issued in the name of Jameson \u201ctrading as\u201d the corporation, not in his individual capacity, and the practice of the Commission in issuing corporate broker\u2019s licenses in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>form manifest a clear and unmistakable purpose and intention on the part of the Commission to issue a license to the corporation, Jameson-Ryan Realty, Inc., and the actual phraseology used in the license was not, we think, such as to defeat that purpose. We, therefore, hold that the first license issued was a corporate broker\u2019s license to said corporation, and as the parties agree that this is determinative of the case, the</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">. \u201c\u00a7 218 Partnerships, firms and corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">(a) <em>Designation of member as representative. </em>\u2014 Every copartnership, association or corporation applying for a real estate broker\u2019s license shall designate one of its members or one of its officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>who is authorized to represent the applicant as a real estate broker, and if such member or officer is duly qualified as herein provided his name shall be inserted in the license issued to such applicant, and he shall be authorized to perform all of the functions of a real estate broker only for and on behalf of said applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Licenses for all members acting as real estate brokers. </em>\u2014 Each and every member or officer of a partnership, association, or corporation, who will perform or engage in any of the acts specified in \u00a7 213 (a) of this subtitle [acts of a broker], other than the designated member or officer by the partnership, association or corporation in the manner above provided, shall be required to make application for and take out a separate broker\u2019s license in his or her own name individually; provided, however, that the license issued to any such member or officer of a partnership, association, or corporation shall entitle such member or officer to act as real estate broker only as officer or agent of said partnership, association, or corportion, and not on his or her own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201c\u00a7 221.
