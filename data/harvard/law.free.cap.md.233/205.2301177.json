Carnes, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Pennsylvania\u2019s insured, Dundalk Signs, Inc. (Dundalk), at the time of Carnes\u2019 injury, was principally engaged in sign painting and the painting and lettering of vehicles. Joseph W. Wolf was its president, chairman of its board of directors, owner of 50% of its stock and the active head in running its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Prior to the date of the accident which gave rise to Carnes\u2019 claim, Chester J. Bartko, Travelers\u2019 insured and an occasional customer of Dundalk, delivered his bus to Dundalk for some painting and lettering work. Dundalk usually closed at noon on Saturdays. However, upon the Saturday when Carnes was injured, Bartko phoned Wolf and asked if the bus were finished, and was advised that some lettering remained to be done. Bartko stated that he needed the bus that day so as to have it available for Monday, and Wolf thereupon told Bartko he would finish the job himself after closing hours and would wait for Bartko to come for the bus. This he did. Bartko arrived about midafternoon in his own car but without an extra driver for the bus. Bartko lived only two miles from the Dundalk shop and he asked Wolf to drive the bus to his home, promising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that he would return Wolf to the shop in his car. Upon Wolf\u2019s refusal to drive the bus, Bartko then suggested that he would drive it and that Wolf might follow him to his home in Bartko\u2019s car, after which Bartko would return Wolf to the shop, where he could pick up his own car to go home. Wolf agreed to this arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The record discloses that it was not standard practice for Dundalk to pick up and deliver the vehicles it had painted, although it had done so occasionally for other customers. In short, whenever this service was requested it was performed free of charge even though not considered a part of Dundalk\u2019s normal business and even though it involved an additional expense to Dundalk to send out an employee for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">While driving Bartko\u2019s car and preparing to turn into his driveway, Wolf collided with Carnes. At this time, Bartko had an insurance policy upon his car with Travelers. The pertinent part thereof in relation to the case at bar is an exclusionary clause therein. It reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cIII. Definition of Insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(a) With respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and, if the named insured is an individual, his spouse if a resident of the same household, and also includes any person while using the automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or such spouse or with the permission of either. The insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named insured or such spouse does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201c (1) to any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, operating an automobile sales agency, repair shop, * * * with respect to any accident arising out of the operation thereof * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">After the collision, Carnes filed suit to recover for his injuries and named Dundalk, Bartko and Wolf as defendants. Before trial, Travelers and Pennsylvania mutually agreed to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>settlement figure of $10,800 with releases to all defendants. This sum was accepted by Carnes under a stipulation between Travelers and Pennsylvania that each would advance $5,400 to consummate the settlement, but that neither insurer would thereby waive any defense in its claim of non-coverage, nor thereby admit liability for damages arising out of the accident. It was further agreed that the controversy over insurance coverage and liability should be resolved by litigation. The lower court found that the Travelers policy, because of the repair shop exclusion, did not provide Wolf with insurance coverage, but that the Pennsylvania policy did provide such coverage, and accordingly ordered reimbursement by Pennsylvania to Travelers in the amount of $5,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">At the time of the accident, Dundalk had a policy with Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania agreed to pay on behalf of the \u201cinsured\u201d all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages for bodily injuries to any person \u201ccaused by accident and arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined.\u201d Thereafter, the policy contains the following pertinent provisions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cDefinition of Hazards\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\"><em>ifc. </em>\u00ed}j 5jt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cDivision 2 \u2014 Premises \u2014 Operations \u2014 Automobiles Not Owned or Hired</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201cThe ownership, maintenance or use of the premises for the purpose of an automobile repair shop * * *, and all operations necessary or incidental thereto; and the use in connection with the above defined operations of any automobile not owned or hired by the named insured * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u201cHI Definition of Insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">\u201cWith respect to the insurance under coverages A, B, and D the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and also includes (1) any partner, employee, director or stockholder thereof, while acting within the scope of his duties as such, and any person or organization having a financial interest in the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ness of the named insured covered by this policy * s(c <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is conceded that the business of Dundalk is such that it is an \u201cautomobile repair shop\u201d under both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Pennsylvania contends that although Wolf was driving Bartko\u2019s car, this was not a \u201cuse [of an automobile not owned or hired by the named insured] in connection with the * * * operations\u201d of Dundalk, but was merely a favor, a gratuitous undertaking, or an accommodation. In other words, Wolf was merely acting as Bartko\u2019s agent, which rendered Travelers responsible, but not it; and, in any event, Wolf was not driving a vehicle upon which Dundalk had worked, so as to bring the vehicle within the coverage of its garage policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We shall consider Pennsylvania\u2019s arguments in the reverse order that they are presented in its brief. It asserts, as indicated above, that at the time of the accident, the operation of the Bartko automobile \u201cwas not in connection with the question of [the] garage business, but was * * * entirely outside of the scope of coverage of the garage policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We have been cited no case, and we have found none, wherein this Court has been called upon to construe the specific, pertinent language used in Pennsylvania\u2019s policy under similar circumstances to those in the case <em>sub judice. </em>However, in interpreting insurance contracts where there is no ambiguity, words are to be given their customary and normal meanings. <em>U.S. F. &amp; G. v. National Paving Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 178 A. 2d 872; <em>Haynes v. American Casualty Co., </em>228 Md. 394, 179 A. 2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">It is obvious that the automobile driven by Wolf was \u201cnot owned or hired by the named insured,\u201d therefore, in order to determine his coverage, <em>vel non, </em>under the garage policy, we need only decide whether its use was \u201cin connection with the above defined operations,\u201d namely, \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use of the premises for the purpose of an automobile repair shop, * * * <em>and all operations necessary or incidental thereto </em>* <em>* </em>(Emphasis ours.) In construing this and similar language in insurance contracts such as \u201cany accident arising out of the operation\u201d of a repair shop (the language used in Trav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>elers\u2019 policy), the Courts have been reluctant to attempt to set forth a hard and fast definition thereof, preferring to base their decisions upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, in which due consideration is given to such factors as the nature of the transaction, its connection with the business, and whether it is a natural and/or necessary incident of the operation thereof, though not necessarily foreseen or expected. <em>Allen v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>187 A. 512 (Vt.); <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guarantee Corporation v. Blackstock, Ltd., </em>181 S. E. 364 (Va.); <em>Phoenix Assur. Co. v. Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp., Ltd., </em>357 P. 2d 642 (Colo.). Compare <em>U.S. F. &amp; G. v. National Paving Co., supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In disposing of the particular question under discussion, Judge Jones stated: \u201cThe remaining salient point is whether the use of the automobile was in connection with Wolf\u2019s operation of the repair shop. It is found that it was. Dundalk Signs had no rule or policy prohibiting the delivery of vehicles to customers, it carried insurance to cover this very thing, and the fact that this service was infrequently performed is not a criterion to be considered. The fact is that in this particular instance the service was performed for the customer and even though Wolf may have considered it merely a favor or an accommodation, it was nonetheless a service arising directly from the work which he had performed for the customer.\u201d We agree. Wolf would not have been driving Bartko\u2019s car and the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>dent would not have occurred had not Bartko\u2019s bus been painted by Dundalk. The use of the car was related in time to the job done for Bartko, as Wolf was still at work when he was requested to render the service to Bartko, and he would not have been through work until he was brought back to Dundalk\u2019s shop. The relationship between Wolf\u2019s use of the car and Dundalk\u2019s business was clearly sufficient, we think, to render the use of the car an operation \u201cnecessary or incidental\u201d to the maintenance of the repair shop. Consequently, we hold that Wolf was insured under Pennsylvania\u2019s policy at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">What we have said above concerning the car\u2019s use by Wolf applies also to the exclusionary clause in Travelers\u2019 policy, unless Wolf was insured under that policy despite the exclusionary clause. Pennsylvania argues that the clause violates the public policy of this State. It cites the Code (1957), Article 66\u00bd, \u00a7 131 (a) (3), which states: \u201cIt [a policy of insurance offered as proof of financial responsibility] shall extend to insure any person using or legally responsible for the use of any motor vehicle described in said policy, when such use is with the permission of the insured person named in the said policy.\u201d Then Pennsylvania refers to <em>Wildman v. Government Employees\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>307 P. 2d 359 (Cal.), wherein the Court held that a policy which insured only the named insurer and his family to be against the public policy of that state, since it failed to comply with a statute requiring all policies of insurance issued on motor vehicles in California to cover all persons using the automobile with permission of the named insured. The distinguishing factor between our statute and the California law is that our statute applies only to policies issued as proof to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the insured\u2019s financial responsibility under the Motor Vehicle Responsibility Law, Code (1957), Article 66\u00bd, \u00a7 116 <em>et seq. </em>These policies are required to be issued only under certain circumstances, not applicable here. Exclusionary clauses, such as we have under consideration, have generally been held reasonable and valid, and have been enforced by the Courts. <em>Tondi v. Fidelity &amp; Casually Co., </em>156 Md. 684, 145 A. 182 (decided before the enactment of \u00a7 131, above); 7 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>p. 342, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and cases therein cited. Compare the Annotation in 47 A.L.R. 2d 564. We hold that the exclusionary clause in Travelers\u2019 policy does not violate the public policy of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">This brings us to the final phase of the case. Pennsylvania says that coverage was afforded under Travelers\u2019 policy notwithstanding the exclusionary clause. It argues that Bartko sought the services of Wolf and gave him express permission to drive the car, and then states, \u201cthe fact of such select permission alone has been held to prevent the operation of a garage repair exclusionary clause in the owner\u2019s policy,\u201d citing and quoting at length from the case of <em>Paine v. Finkler Motor Car Co., </em>264 N. W. 477 (Wisc.). The appellant, apparently, has misconstrued the holding of the Court in that case. There, a policy containing an exclusionary clause was issued to a car owner, whose wife gave permission to drive the car to an employee of a garage, who had been selected by her. The Wisconsin Court held that the driver of the car was <em>excluded </em>as an insured by reason of the exclusionary clause. Similar rulings were made in the cases of <em>Ederer v. Milwaukee Auto. Ins. Co., </em>265 N. W. 694 (Wisc.) and <em>Brower v. Employer\u2019s Liability Assur. Co., </em>177 A. 826 (Pa.), both cited by appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The case of <em>Asnis v. Bankers Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>164 A. 307 (N.J.) cited by the appellant, is not in point. The policy provisions were different from those involved in the case at bar. In addition, the decision therein has been criticized by Mr. Appleman, 7 Appleman, <em>op. cit., </em>at page 345, who states, after his criticism thereof, that since <em>Asnis </em>New Jersey has followed \u201ca more reasonable rule,\u201d citing two later cases in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Appellant also cites <em>Dixie Automobile Ins. Corp. v. Mason, </em>29 CCH Auto. Cases 2d 370 (Dist. Ct. of App., Fla.). In that case, an exclusionary clause identical with the one involved herein was construed. Dixie had issued its policy to the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>owner, Mason. While the car was being driven by the proprietor of a repair shop, who had the owner\u2019s permission to drive it, it was involved in an accident with one Ernest Joseph. Joseph brought suit against Mason and the proprietor of the repair shop. Dixie disclaimed liability, and requested declaratory relief. The Court held that the beginning of the exclusionary clause, wherein it is stated \u201cthe insurance with respect to any person or organization <em>other than the named insured or such spouse </em>(italics ours) does not apply\u201d renders the policy \u201cinapplicable only with respect to coverage for and on behalf of any person, organization, or any agent or employee thereof, operating any of the stipulated businesses * * *,\u201d but that the named insured and her spouse were \u201cspecifically exempt [ed] from the exclusionary clause.\u201d Hence, the car owner, as the named insured, was insured under Dixie\u2019s policy, but the proprietor of the repair shop was not. We do not reach the question in the instant case as to whether Bartko was covered by his Travelers\u2019 policy at the time of the accident, and we leave it open.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Although the original suit was brought by Carnes against Bartko, Dundalk and Wolf, the claims against Bartko and Dundalk were predicated not upon their active negligence, but upon their vicarious, or imputed, liability for Wolf\u2019s negligent actions under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Therefore, in the event of a finding of liability on their part, they would have a right of action for indemnity against Wolf for the damages suffered by them. <em>C. &amp; O. C. Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs, 57 </em>Md. 201. Since we have held above that Wolf was covered by Pennsylvania\u2019s policy and not by Travelers\u2019, Pennsylvania\u2019s policy must be looked to for payment of the damages done by Wolf, regardless of whether either of the policies covered Dundalk or Bartko for their vicarious liability, and regardless of the provisions in Pennsylvania\u2019s policy that this insurance shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co., </em>208 F. 2d 731 (C.A. 2); <em>Canadian Indemnity Co. v. United States F. &amp; G. Co., </em>213 F. 2d 658 (C.A. 9); <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Ind. Co., </em>228 F. 2d 365, (C.A. 9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>cert. den. 352 U. S. 826; <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. General Casualty Co., </em>187 F. Supp. 234 (D.C., Ida.).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We find no substantial merit in the suggestion made by the appellant that the exclusionary clause in Travelers\u2019 policy was inapplicable because the car involved in the accident was not the one worked upon by Dundalk. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Buckeye Union Casualty Co., </em>105 N. E. 2d 568 (Ohio); <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Urban, </em>146 N. E. 2d 387 (Ill.
