The minor, a female aged 16, was a student at a public school, and rode a school bus to and from school. Appellee is a contract carrier, and was the owner of the bus in which the minor was riding when injured. She boarded the bus at Glen Burnie, and it, preceded by two other buses, proceeded toward her home. After proceeding quite a few miles, during which stops had been made by all three of the buses without incident, the first and second buses stopped, and appellee\u2019s bus ran into the rear of the second, injuring the minor. The highway, at the point of collision, was a rather narrow, secondary one, but relatively straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Lt. Bates and Officer Fertitta arrived at the scene shortly after the collision. They examined the brakes on appellee\u2019s bus, and Bates found the brake pedal to be \u201chard and firm.\u201d He stated that he found the foot brake to be in operating order, and, although he could not \u201csay for sure,\u201d he thought it was in \u201creasonably good condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Fertitta testified that the operator of the bus, at the scene, told him that his brakes failed to hold, and, even though he placed the bus in low gear to slow down, it struck the bus in front of him; that the bus left no skid marks; and that he knew nothing about the braking system of the kind on the bus, but \u201cthe brake pedal seemed to have free play.\u201d He stated further that when he tested the foot brake, the motor was off, and he knew \u201cthe motor had to be running for the vacuum to work, but not for the hydraulic system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The appellants then called the service manager for the Hoffman Truck Center, a man of twenty years\u2019 experience in the repairing and maintenance of heavy-duty trucks and buses. He explained in detail the hydrovac system of braking. He examined appellee\u2019s vehicle; the \u201chard pedal\u201d indicated to him that the hydrovac or the check valve in it was faulty. He stated that the hydrovac magnifies \u201cmany, many times\u201d the pressure of the brake fluid, and without it, there would not be sufficient pressure on the brake shoes to stop the bus. When the engine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Is not running, or the hydrovac is not operating correctly, there is a \u201chard pedal, just like pushing against a stone wall.\u201d On the other hand, when the engine is running and the hydrovac operating properly, there is a \u201csoft pedal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The hydrovac sustained no damage to its exterior casing, and the witness found no leaks of brake fluid. He tested the suspected hydrovac unit by removing it from the bus, and installing it in another bus of the same kind. By this method, he \u201cproved that it was defective.\u201d He found that the check valve was inoperative, which could mean that the valve was defective, or dirt or some foreign material had gotten into it. The witness pointed out that the unit did not require regular inspection or maintenance, and there was no way of ascertaining a defect \u201cprior to actual failure.\u201d He stated that after \u201cyears and years of use,\u201d the hydrovac should be dismantled, but he did not think a six-year-old one, such as involved herein, should be dismantled.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The minor plaintiff, who had no driver\u2019s license and could not see the speedometer, took the stand and said the bus was going \u201cabout 45-50' miles an hour\u201d (the maximum for school buses is 45 miles per hour; Code (1957) Article 66\u00bd, \u00a7 261). She stated the bus had made several stops on the trip without difficulty, and prior to the collision, \u201cthe bus driver tried to slow down but he just couldn\u2019t.\u201d She saw him \u201cpushing the brake,\u201d and \u201cput his foot on the brake but it didn\u2019t help at all.\u201d Several other young passengers testified. They used some adjectival descriptions of the operation of the bus, such as it was going \u201cfast,\u201d or at a \u201cnormal\u201d speed, but they added little, if anything, to aid the appellants\u2019 cause. As a matter of fact, one of them stated that \u201csomething happened to the bus mechanism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">On this testimony, all offered by the plaintiffs below, Judge Sachse granted a motion for a directed verdict in favor of the defendant, and his ruling was, we think, correct. The plaintiffs faced one of those situations where it is difficult to prove enough to take their case to the jury on the question of primary negligence, without proving too much to permit a jury to pass thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">It is fundamental that in an action for damages for injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>alleged to have been caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove affirmatively defendant\u2019s negligence, and that it was a proximate cause of the injuries. For the purposes of this case, we shall assume, without deciding, that there was some evidence to support a possible inference of negligence on the part of appellee\u2019s driver had no brake failure been involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, plaintiffs proceeded further and showed by their own testimony that a sudden and unexpected brake failure was involved; and the cause of that failure was such that a reasonable inspection or test of the brakes would not have revealed. Compare <em>Sothoron v. West, </em>180 Md. 539, 26 A. 2d 16; <em>Kaplan v. Stein, </em>198 Md. 414, 84 A. 2d 81; <em>Garfinkle, et al. v. Birnios, </em>232 Md. 402, 194 A. 2d 91; and <em>Currie v. United States, </em>312 F. 2d 1 (C. A. 4), wherein <em>Hickory Transfer Co. v. Nezbed, </em>202 Md. 253, 96 A. 2d 241, is distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">At this point, we are confronted by the well-established rule of evidence that the burden mentioned above is not met by proof adduced by the plaintiff to the effect that defendant\u2019s negligence may have caused the injuries, or even that it probably did cause them, if it also appears from plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the injuries may have resulted from some other cause for which the defendant is not responsible. The rule was stated by Chief Judge McSherry for the Court in <em>Strasburger v. Vogel, </em>103 Md. 85, 91, 63 A. 202, thus: \u201cBut when the plaintiff himself shows that the injury complained of must have resulted <em>either </em>from the negligence of the defendant <em>or </em>from an independent cause for the existence of which the defendant is in no way responsible, he cannot be permitted to recover until he excludes the independent cause as the efficient and proximate cause of the injury * * See also <em>Moore v. American Stores Co., </em>169 Md. 541, 182 A. 436; <em>Wasserman v. Hutzler Co., </em>219 Md. 310, 149 A. 2d 1; <em>Joffre v. Canada Dry, Inc., 222 </em>Md. 1, 158 A. 2d 631, and cases referred to in the opinions. Compare <em>Great Atlantic, etc., Co. v. Adams, </em>213 Md. 521, 132 A. 2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We think the evidence produced by the plaintiffs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>instant case falls directly within the pattern of the above rule, and precludes their recovery against the defendant. It is obvious that the defendant could not properly be held responsible for a sudden and unforeseeable brake failure such as that proved by the plaintiffs, and which they showed could have caused the injuries; therefore it was incumbent upon them to eliminate the brake failure as the efficient and proximate cause of the injuries complained of, before they could recover for the negligence of appellee\u2019s driver, which we have had to assume. This, they failed to do; consequently, the action of the trial judge in taking the case from the jury was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-6\">. A rather tenuous assumption, especially after the above mentioned concessum that res ipsa has no application here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
