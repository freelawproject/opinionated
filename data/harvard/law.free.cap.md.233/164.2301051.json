Wash. San. Com., </em>187 Md. 67, 76, provides that as a condition precedent to the maintenance of a successful claim or of suit against a municipality, the claimant or his representative must, within ninety days of the occurrence, present to \u201cthe county commissioners, or the corporate authorities\u201d in person or by registered mail written notice \u201csetting forth the time, place and cause of the alleged damage, loss, injury or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The stipulated facts establish the following. The appellant Phyllis Jackson was injured while a passenger in an automobile driven by her husband, William Jackson, by reason of a collision of the automobile and a dump truck owned by the County and driven by its servant. The accident happened on January 18, 1962. The County employee who was driving the County dump truck reported the collision \u2022 to his' superiors shortly thereafter, in the regular course of business. The County\u2019s insurance carrier investigated the claim. On March 19, 1962, claimant\u2019s attorney gave oral notice of the claim to an assistant county attorney. On April 12, 1962, claimant\u2019s attorney sent a letter by ordinary mail to the County Commissioners of Anne Arundel County at the court house in Annapolis, which .read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201cWe. represent Phyllis and William A. Jackson, Jr., and their collision insurance carrier, Interstate Insurance Company, in a claim for damages against Anne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Arundel County Public Works arising out of a collision occurring on January 18, 1962, at Solley Road and Powhatan Beach Road with a County Roads truck operated by Joseph Frank Havranek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cPlease contact us promptly or if you carry liability insurance, have your insurance carrier contact us concerning payment of our claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The Commissioners received the letter within a day or two of mailing and before the expiration of ninety days from January 18, 1962. It also appears that on April 26, 1962, the County\u2019s insurer replied to claimant\u2019s attorney on behalf of \u201cour above insured\u201d (the County Commissioners of Anne Arundel County) that \u201csince our investigation clearly reveals negligence on the part of your client, William A. Jackson, Jr., we must respectfully deny your subrogation claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In response to appellant\u2019s argument that there was sufficient compliance with the statute requiring notice, the County argues that there was noncompliance with two essential requirements \u2014 there was no notice given of appellant\u2019s claim, only of a claim for property damage and, in any event, the notice was not delivered either in person or by registered mail. We find neither of the County\u2019s contentions to be sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The purpose of the statute clearly would seem to be to have the claimant furnish the municipal body with sufficient information to permit it to make an investigation in due time, sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it. The Legislature expressly provided that there be given the municipality written notice of \u201cthe time, place and cause\u201d of the alleged injury. The written notice which the County received in this case said there was a claim for damages against the County by Phyllis and William Jackson and their insurance carrier by reason of a collision with \u201ca County Roads truck operated by Joseph Frank Havranek\u201d on January 18, 1962, at Solley Road and Powhatan Beach Road. This would seem to be literal compliance with the statute\u2019s requirement of advice as to \u201cthe time, place and cause of the alleged damage\u201d and certainly, we think, there was substantial gratification of the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the statute when the appellant, Phyllis Jackson, put the County on notice that she had a claim for damages suffered at a specified time and place and from a stated cause. Under the great weight of authority, substantial compliance is enough. See annotation in 63 A. L. R. 2d 863, 866, entitled \u201cSufficiency of notice of claim against municipality as regards description of personal injury or property damage,\u201d and annotation in 62 A. L. R. 2d 397, 401, titled \u201cSufficiency of notice of claim against municipality with respect to nature of defect and cause of accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It is conceded that the appellant did not either deliver the notice in person or cause it to be delivered by registered mail, but it is also a stipulated fact that the notice, which we hold met the statutory standards, was actually received by the County in the ordinary mail within the time set by the Code provision. Statutes of this type are part of the law of many States and the majority of the cases recognize that the purpose of their specifics as to delivery is to make sure that notice actually is received within a short enough time after the injury occurs to give the municipality an opportunity to investigate while the matter is fresh. If the purpose of the statutes is fulfilled, the manner of the accomplishment of the fulfillment has not generally been tested too technically. <em>Teresta v. City of New York </em>(N. Y.), 108 N. E. 2d 397. In such cases substantial compliance generally is held to be enough. 18 <em>McQuillin, Mun. Corp., </em>3rd Ed., Sec. 53.162 (Cum. Supp.); 1 <em>Merrill on Notice, </em>Sec. 545, p. 570; 64 C. J. S. <em>Mun. Corp. </em>2199, a and f; 38 Am. Jur. <em>Mun. Corp. </em>Sec. 675; <em>Rhyne, Municipal Law, </em>Sec. 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In <em>Perl v. New York City Housing Authority, </em>231 N. Y. S. 2d 142, and <em>Drake v. Comptroller of City of New York, </em>104 N. Y. S. 2d 774, the notice was not sent by registered mail but actual receipt was admitted or demonstrated. It was held that the statutory prescription for sending the notice by registered mail was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs, and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
