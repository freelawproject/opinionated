However, as pointed out by this Court in <em>Hayden v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 613, this question should first have been considered as one of fact rather than as a question of law. In regard to the seventh contention, the hearing judge did not find, as a matter of fact, whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>was evidence to support the claim of incompetency of counsel. Therefore the case will be remanded so that the lower court may determine these two questions as matters of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">\n<em>Leave to appeal granted and case remanded for further proceedings as to Questions (4) and (7).</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
