On the point of illegal search, Judge Foster held that the point was not open on post conviction because the record showed that no objection was made at the trial on July 2, 1962, after the decision of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643. We agree. See <em>Porter v. State, </em>230 Md. 535, and <em>Shorey v. State, 227 </em>Md. 385. Cf. <em>Edwards v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 667. The cases recognize that even on direct appeal a procedural requirement of objection may be enforced in a State court without violation of constitutional rights, so that failure to object to the introduction of evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search would bar review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
