The record shows that Dr. Lerner examined the petitioner at the Patuxent Institution, at the request of his court-appointed counsel, on April 14, 1963, and filed in court a detailed four page report and impression finding that the petitioner fitted the description of a defective delinquent and recommending therapy in a structured close environment. A great deal of the material in this report could only have been obtained from the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The petitioner also alleges that Dr. Lerner \u201cgot mad and turned in the report on me because I told him I wanted Dr. Michael Miller as my Doctor and no one else.\u201d Code (1957), Art. 31B, sec. 7 (b) provides that a person charged with being a defective delinquent is \u201centitled, upon request, to be examined by a practitioner of psychiatry of his own choice * * *.\u201d But there is no allegation that he requested the court or his attorney to employ Dr. Miller, or that Dr. Miller was qualified or willing to make the examination; on the contrary, the record shows that his attorney employed Dr. Lerner, whose qualifications are unquestioned. We find no violation of basic rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
