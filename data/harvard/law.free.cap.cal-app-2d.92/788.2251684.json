All the foregoing papers were filed on December 18. The notice of motion for change of venue fixed the time for the hearing of the same for January 3, 1949. The affidavit of service by mail set forth that copies of all the papers had been placed in an envelope addressed to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and deposited with postage fully prepaid in the United States mail at Ventura. Copies of the documents that had been served by mail were personally served on plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys on December 29, and affidavit of personal service was filed on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The motions for change of venue came on for hearing on the day fixed in the notices. The motions were based on the notices of motion and affidavits on file which recited that defendants were residents of Ventura County. The motions were resisted by counsel for plaintiffs. The grounds of the resistance do not appear in the record. No evidence, oral or documentary, was introduced by plaintiffs in support of their opposition, and the motions were submitted on the evidence contained in defendants\u2019 affidavits. Thereafter the court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the order must be affirmed for the reason that defendants failed to comply with sections 396b, 1013 and 1013a of the Code of Civil Procedure. The applicable portions of those sections are as follows: Section 396b provides that an action may \u201cbe tried in the court where commenced, unless the defendant, at the time he answers or demurs, files with the clerk, ... an affidavit of merits and notice of motion for an order transferring the action or proceeding to the proper court, <em>together with proof of service, </em>upon the adverse party, of a copy of such papers.\u201d Section 1013 provides: \u201cIn case of service by mail, the notice or other paper must be deposited in the <em>United States postoffice, </em>in a sealed envelope, with postage paid, addressed to the person on whom it is to be served, . . . The service is complete at the time of the deposit, ...\u201d Section 1013a provides that \u201cProof of service by mail may be made by affidavit . . . showing the date and place of deposit in the mail . . . and also showing that the envelope was sealed and deposited <em>in the mail </em>with the postage thereon fully prepaid, ...\u201d (Emphasis added in the foregoing quotations.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The chain of plaintiff\u2019s argument that proof of service is defective is that: (1) section 396b requires the filing of the papers therein mentioned \u201ctogether with proof of service,\u201d (2) under section 1013 the deposit of the papers must be \u201cin the United States <em>post office\u201d; </em>(3) section 1013a requires that proof of service by mail shall show that the papers were \u201cdeposited in the mail\u201d; (4) defendants\u2019 affidavits of service by mail follow the language of section 1013a and recite that the papers were \u201cdeposited in the mail\u201d instead of saying, in the phraseology of section'1013, that they were \u201cdeposited in the United States postoffice\u201d; (5) by reason of the failure to use the words of section 1013a in the affidavit of mailing, the \u201cproof of service\u201d required by section 396b is defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and the court therefore did not acquire jurisdiction to hear the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">It is the fact that service was made, rather than the proof of service, that vests the court with jurisdiction to act. <em>(Morrissey </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>160 Cal. 390, 395 [117 P. 438] ; <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>209 Cal. 251, 255 [287 P. 99] ; <em>Lindley </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>49 Cal.App. 631, 633 [194 P. 85].) The jurisdiction of the court does not depend upon the preservation of the proof of service but upon the fact that service has been made. <em>(Sichler </em>v. <em>Look, </em>93 Cal. 600, 608 [29 P. 220]; <em>In re Newman, </em>75 Cal. 213, 220 [16 P. 887, 7 Am.St.Rep. 146].)  Since the affidavit recites that the papers were \u201cdeposited in the mail\u201d in Ventura, addressed to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys at their offices in Santa Barbara, it will be presumed that they were received by the addressees in the regular course of mail. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 24; <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Coast Cons. Oil Co., </em>84 Cal.App.2d 250, 254 [190 P.2d 214].) Such assumption has not been denied by plaintiffs or their attorneys; in fact, it was confirmed during the oral argument when, in response to a question, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded that all the papers above mentioned were received in his office on the day following the date of mailing in Ventura.  Since the papers were deposited in the mail in Ventura and received by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in due course of mail the presumption is that they passed through the post office at Ventura whether they were deposited in the post office itself, in a letter box on the street, or in a mail chute in an office building, or were delivered to a letter carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 strained technical objection that the affidavit of service is so defective as to deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear the motion, because it recited that the papers were deposited in the mail rather than in the post office, is just too tenuous and unsubstantial to appeal to this court. All documents required by law to support the motion for a change of venue to the proper county were placed in the United States mail, they were timely received by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, and for aught that appears in the record they were deposited in the post office. There is no evidence to the contrary. The record does not show that the objection urged in this court was made in the court below. Had the objection been there made defendants would have had an opportunity to apply for leave to file an amended affidavit of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The court had jurisdiction to act and it was error to deny the motions. Defendants\u2019 affidavits of merits and of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>residence in Ventura County were not denied in any particular. It was therefore their right, \u201can ancient and valuable right,\u201d to have the cases tried in that county. <em>(Lyons </em>v. <em>Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., </em>20 Cal.2d 579, 584 [127 P.2d 924, 141 A.L.R. 1173] ; <em>Goossen </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 44, 47 [170 P.2d 104].)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Furthermore, if there had ever been any validity in plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the proof of service is insufficient by reason of the use of the term \u201cmail\u201d instead of \u201cpost-office,\u201d the objection has been waived. Plaintiffs did not appear specially to object to the service or the proof of service but made a general appearance and resisted the motion. The record does not indicate that their counsel questioned either the service or the proof of service. The settled statement in each ease on which the appeal comes to this court recites: \u201cThe said motion was resisted by Edw. W. Schramm, Esq., of the' firm of Robertson, Schramm, Raddue <em>&amp; </em>Parma. That no evidence, either oral or documentary, was introduced by plaintiff in support of his opposition to said motion. \u2019 \u2019 Since it does not appear that plaintiffs resisted the motions on the ground that proof of service was defective they waived the right to contest the jurisdiction of the court to hear the motion. <em>(Lacey </em>v. <em>Bertone, </em>33 Cal.2d 649, 652 [203 P.2d 755, 757] and eases cited.) In that case the statutory service of an order to show cause why an injunction should not issue was not made, but it was held that the party enjoined waived the lack of proper and timely service by making a general appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The order denying the motion for change of venue in each case is reversed with direction to grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Moore, P. J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
