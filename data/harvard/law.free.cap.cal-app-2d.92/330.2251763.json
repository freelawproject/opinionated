A hole or depression developed in front of the bench. Plaintiff, a woman 70 years of age stepped into it, fell and suffered a fracture of the femur. Plaintiff instituted the present action naming the city, the bench company and the insurance companies as defendants. The insurance companies demurred on the ground that no action will lie against an indemnity insurance company on its bond until final judgment has been obtained against the assured, which demurrer was sustained.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Question : <em>Can plaintiff, as one of the general public, maintain a suit against the defendant insurance companies on their undertaking with defendants California Bench Company and city of Los Angeles without first procuring a judgment against the city and/or defendant California Bench Company?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">This question must be answered in the negative, and is governed by these rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">1. An intent to make an obligation inure to the benefit of a third party must clearly appear in a contract of insurance and if any doubt exists it should be construed against such intent. <em>(Van DerHoof </em>v. <em>Chambon, </em>121 Cal.App. 118, 131 [8 P.2d 925].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">2. In the absence of a provision in the contract of insurance or ordinance pursuant to which the contract is issued making the obligation inure to the benefit of a third party, it is a condition precedent to any action against the insurer that a final judgment be obtained against the assured. <em>(Girard </em>v. <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co., </em>66 Cal.App.2d 483, 489 [152 P.2d 509]; <em>Van DerHoof </em>v. <em>Chambon, supra. </em>See, also, <em>Criss </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>105 W.Va. 380 [142 S.E. 849, 850].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Applying the foregoing rules to the facts of the instant case there is not any language in the ordinance or in the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>of insurance here involved providing that the insurance shall inure to the benefit of plaintiff or to the public generally. Therefore, under rule (1) <em>supra, </em>the undertaking did not inure to plaintiff's benefit and she was not entitled to maintain an action against defendant insurance companies under rule (2), <em>supra, </em>until she had obtained a final judgment against one of the assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Since she had not obtained such a judgment the complaint as amended failed to state a cause of action against either insurance company. Hence the demurrer was properly sustained. This result is fair and equitable to all parties concerned since it is presumed that a judgment obtained against the city or the bench company will be paid and defendant insurance companies will abide by the terms of their contract and reimburse the insured for their loss, thus avoiding the necessity of the insured\u2019s instituting an action to enforce the obligation created by the insurance policy and saving defendant insurance companies the expense of defending unnecessary litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Milliron </em>v. <em>Dittman, </em>180 Cal. 443 [181 P. 779], and other cases relied on by plaintiff are factually distinguishable from the instant case for the reason that in such cases either the bond or an ordinance pursuant to which it was given specifically provided that it be conditioned to inure to, and be for the protection of, anyone who should sustain any damage or injury. Such was not the situation in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Moore, P. J., and Wilson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 4, 1949.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\">In her brief plaintiff has waived the allegation in her pleading that the bond inures by its terms to the benefit of all persons suffering loss or damage as a result of the maintenance and installation of said bench, and consents to a decision as if the complaint alleged a bond in the language of the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
