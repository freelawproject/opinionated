J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANG\">Having been convicted by the court without a jury of eight violations of the Corporate Securities Act (Stats. 1917, p. 673; 2 Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 3814) appellant demands a reversal of the judgments on two grounds, to wit, (1) the evidence is insufficient and (2) the act as construed by the trial court violates due process of law and equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">The Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">It was charged that about September, 1947, appellant sold certificates of \u201cbeneficial interest in title to property, profits and earnings, more particularly described as a one-half interest in ownership and profits of a fresh fruit and vegetable juice bar, a business to be operated for profit . . . and a 10 per cent interest in the profits of any additional juice bars to be operated for profit and known as Fountain of Youth, without having first applied for and received ... a permit so to do.\u2019\u2019 The eight counts are substantially identical. In two of them the interest sold was less than half. The domicile of each business was at a separate location. The attention of each investor was attracted by an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation, except in the case of the victim named in count II and he was introduced by his father to appellant about 30 days after the father had made his own investment. In each instance appellant entered into a limited partnership agreement in form similar to that on the margin</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>hereof<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with appellant as a general partner and the investor as a limited partner, to operate a juice bar at a designated location, the latter to receive a share in the profits and an interest in the business. In one instance (count VIII) the investor was to receive a share in the profits only and that agreement was in form not one of a limited partnership but merely a receipt dated December 17, 1946, for $50 \u201cfor % <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>profits in following accounts, statement and check in payment to be made starting once a week December' 29.\u201d This is followed by a list of the names and addresses of 23 several concerns. Appellant\u2019s failure to issue a certificate of limited partnership to him may explain the meager sum of $500 received as contrasted with the $2,500 to $3,800 taken from the parties named in the first seven counts. In no instance did a purchaser recover a substantial part of his investment. Two or three received small sums for \u201csalary.\u201d Under most of the agreements no juice bar was opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Applicable Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The issuance of the certificate of a limited partnership in a manner not authorized by the Civil Code (\u00a7\u00a7 2478, 2501)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is one of the acts denounced by the Corporate Securities Act which provides in section 2(a), paragraph 7, that \u201cthe word \u2018security\u2019 shall include any stock, bond . . . certificate of interest or participation, certificate of interest in a profit-sharing agreement . . . .beneficial interest ... or earnings. . . .\u201d  Whether any particular instrument is. a security must be determined by its own contents and language No definition has yet been formulated that will apply to every case. Courts must look through form to the substance and determine whether the transaction contemplates the conduct of an enterprise by persons other than the investor who is to share in its profits and finally in its proceeds.  An interest in such an enterprise is a security which under the act is not to be sold by the issuer without his first having obtained a permit from the Corporation Commissioner. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daven</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>port, </em>13 Cal.2d 681, 684 [91 P.2d 892].) A security has been defined as an instrument which creates a present right to a present or a future participation in either the income, profits or assets of a business carried on for profit. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>102 Cal.App. 29, 36 [282 P. 813].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Section 3 of the act forbids the sale by a \u201ccompany\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of any security without first having obtained from the commissioner a permit, and section 18 makes a violation of section 3 a felony. Section 2(a) also makes \u201cpartnerships of every kind\u201d a \u201ccompany,\u201d whereby they are included within the inhibition of section 3.  Not only is a partnership included as a \u201ccompany,\u201d but an individual is also when he sells or negotiates for the sale of a security of his own issue. (Corporate Securities Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00a72(a), par. 6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 132, 136 [177 P.2d 586].) The purpose of the act is to protect the public against the purchase of worthless securities and to this end the Legislature made the individual liable as a \u201ccompany\u201d when he is the issuer. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>219 Cal. 522, 525 [27 P. 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">It follows that appellant was liable as a \u201ccompany\u201d when he sold the certificate of interest as an individual (count VIII) as well as when he sold the partnership interests (counts I to VIII) and issued certificates therefor. Having, as general partner, sold an interest in seven limited partnerships and in a business of which he was sole proprietor (count VIII) without first having obtained permits to do so, his guilt is clearly established. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodson, supra.) </em>The latter decision is a convincing precedent. On the investor\u2019s answering Woodson\u2019s advertisement, the latter stated that he had a lease on a ranch which was to be operated by a club with members and that he desired to sell one-fifth interest therein. On his payment of $2,000 the purchaser was to receive 20 per cent interest in all transactions of Woodson and a monthly salary of $300. At the same time he should receive Woodson\u2019s note for $2,000 and a certificate of limited partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ship showing the investor to be the special partner and Wood-son as the general partner. Notwithstanding Woodson\u2019s protestations and his ingenious efforts to conceal the true nature of his agreement the court held it to be a violation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Appellant\u2019s sales do not materially differ from those of Woodson or of Dutton (see 41 Cal.App.2d 866, 869 [107 P.2d 937].) Theirs were not ordinary commercial transactions. Neither were they investors lending money at specified rates. Their contracts were of the same character as those of the victims named in the first seven counts herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The evidence of the interests sold by appellant is the written contracts of special partnerships; they were offered for sale to the public by advertisements in newspapers; they were sold to constituents of the public; they evidenced the investors\u2019 rights to participate in the profits and assets of the partnerships; and the profits were to be realized by means of the efforts of others and not through the buyers\u2019 industry or skill. The sales in every case were initiated by an \u201cadvertisement\u201d which is forbidden to the same extent as is a direct offer to sell. (Corporate Securities Act, par. 8, \u00a7 2(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Appellant\u2019s Authorities</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The authorities cited by appellant in support of his contention that the judgments are not supported by the evidence or by a reasonable interpretation of the act <em>(People v. Davenport, </em>13 Cal.2d 681 [91 P.2d 892] ; <em>Buttrick </em>v. <em>Seines, </em>209 Cal. 567 [289 P. 616] ; <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Leidecker, </em>216 Cal. 604 [15 P.2d <em>514]; Creasey Corp. </em>v. <em>Enz Bros. Co., </em>177 Wis. 49 [187 N.W. 666] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>2 Cal.App.2d 370 [36 P.2d 40]) are readily distinguishable by their facts. None of them parallels the Woodson or the Dutton decisions. Neither are their facts similar to those at bar. Davenport was accused of selling securities \u201cin the form of a series of agreements\u201d for the sales of properties, the deferred payments to bear seven per cent interest. <em>Buttrick </em>v. <em>Seines </em>was prosecuted under the act as it read in 1917 and before an individual issuer was required to secure a permit. <em>Staples </em>v. <em>Leidecker, </em>decided in 1932, involved a preorganization agreement, made and accepted upon the condition that the corporation would with reasonable diligence procure a permit. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Steele </em>the contract provided that the investor should work. In the instant action seven contracts provided that the work should be done by appellant and the investor\u2019s only return was to be a percentage of the profits while the eighth in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>vestor (count VIII) was to do nothing but receive the \"return from the half interest\u201d of a juice bar business.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">No Violation op Due Peooess</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The contention that the right of due process of law and of equal protection of the law are violated by the act as applied has been completely answered by <em>People </em>v. <em>Eisman, </em>78 Cal.App. 223, 249 [248 P. 716]. The court there held that while it is true that the act burdens honest business, such burden is for the very good and only reason that \"under its forms dishonest business may not be done.\u201d To defeat the latter the state cannot rely upon its own declarations of policy or upon the mere promises of operators. Conditions must be imposed and their performance enforced notwithstanding inconveniences caused to honest men. For sovereignty to abandon its watch-care of society and to confess its inability to guard honest men against the plunderers because, forsooth, an occasional good citizen might be inconvenienced, would be to signify its utter helplessness to protect the very men who constitute the state. <em>(Merrick </em>v. <em>N. W. Halsey &amp; Co., </em>242 U.S. 568, 585 [37 S.Ct. 227, 61 L.Ed. 498]; <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>189 Cal. 446, 449 [209 P. 34].) The Corporate Securities Act was conceived for the purpose of providing a procedure \"for the enforcement of constitutional safeguards to the purchasing public. \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>Not only is it a bulwark against fraudulent practices of those who seek to gain from the ruin or expense of others but is a companionate guide for honest brokers and investors in the issuance and sale of securities to, and purchases by, the public. <em>(Daugherty </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>1 Cal.2d 298, 305 [34 P.2d 1005]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kuder, </em>93 Cal.App. 42, 50 [269 P. 198, 630].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Appellant quotes generously from <em>People </em>v. <em>Pace, </em>73 Cal.App. 548, 561 [238 P. 1089], in support of his claim that the act violates the Fourteenth Amendment. That decision does not apply. The securities Pace sold were his in bona fide ownership and were sold for his own personal benefit. Moreover, subdivision 3 of section 2(c) of the act was amended after the reversal of <em>People </em>v. <em>Pace. </em>Later decisions upheld the new provisions which require the individual owner of securities to obtain a permit before offering them for sale. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Claggett, </em>130 Cal.App. 141 [19 P.2d 805]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shafer, </em>130 Cal.App. 74 [19 P.2d 861] ; <em>Black </em>v. <em>Solano Co., </em>114 Cal.App. 170 [299 P. 843].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The Corporate Securities Act is not unconstitutional in any sense. It deprives no one of his right to acquire, own or sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>property, but merely constrains conduct for the purpose of protecting the public against speculative schemes and plans for piracy, fraud and unjust enrichment. The prevention of loss or injury to the innocent by the ruthless will of the enemies of society or of the archaic-minded is an obligation of the state whose judgment is supreme. <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Geiger-Jones Co., </em>242 U.S. 539, 551 [37 S.Ct. 217, 61 L.Ed. 480] ; <em>Barnhill </em>v. <em>Young, </em>46 F.2d 804, 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">McComb, J., and Wilson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 7, 1949.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Exhibit six is the articles of copartnership with B.
