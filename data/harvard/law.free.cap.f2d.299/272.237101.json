No. 415,726 filed March 12, 1954, entitled \u201cImprovements, In Protected Storage Battery And Method.\u201d No claim has been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The invention of the appealed claims has as its object the elimination of \u201cslow\u201d short circuits in storage batteries \u201cdue to the presence of substances which are electrical conductors located on the surfaces of * * * [such] batteries <em>and in electrical contact with the [battery] terminals.\u201d </em>[Our emphasis.] Appellant\u2019s object is achieved in the following manner (we quote from his brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cHe first cleans the top wall and all parts thereon to remove the electrically conductive solutions, grease, dirt and other foreign matter. Following connection of the leads to the external circuit he applies an adherent continuous coating of dielectric material <em>onto the top wall and parts thereon, </em>except for the vent plugs and a short radial distance therefrom. * * * <em>said coating completely encapsulates all parts on the top wall </em>and provides a continuous impenetrable barrier which prevents the electrically conductive solutions from contacting metallic parts of the battery.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Claim 30 is representative and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">\u201c30. A protected storage battery comprising an insulated casing having a top wall, terminal posts projecting above said top wall, cable attachments secured to said terminals, and a continuous adherent coating formed on said top wall and over the exposed surfaces of said terminal posts and cable attachments, said coating being constituted by a solid dielectric material, whereby discharge of the battery due to formation of a conductive film on the top wall of the casing and in contact with said posts is obviated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">The sole reference relied on is: McLean 1,801,282 April 21, 1931.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The McLean specification begins by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-16\">\u201cThis invention relates to electric batteries and more particularly batteries having exposed terminals or connections. Where corrosive electrolytes are employed in such batteries and are <em>spilled or creep over the terminals and connections, </em>these become corroded, and more or less trouble ensues.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">It is then stated by McLean that \u201ccorrosion and incrustation\u201d may interfere with proper functioning, and the accidental placement of \u201cmetal or a tool\u201d across terminals may result in the short circuiting, of the storage battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-18\">The McLean specification states further that to provide a \u201cbattery which would be exempt from such difficulties, and at the same time * * * [avoid] * * * radical change of form\u201d one should proceed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-20\">\u201cThe exposed current-carrying parts are coated with a coating * * * which sets to an adherent condition, and which may be made up of material affording a non-corrosion protective coat. Advantage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ously at the same time the property of electrical insulation may be provided by requisite selection of material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">*\u2022***\u2022\u25a0**</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cIn accordance with the present invention however, a definite coating of sufficient toughness and body may be provided, to give a permanent character irrespective of temperatures to which the battery may be exposed in the course of use, and not only may <em>the surfaces liable to corrosion from the creeping electrolyte be adequately protected </em>and the life and utility of the terminals correspondingly prolonged, but at the same time by reason of its insulative property, <em>the coating may protect against accidental short circuiting from contact with metallic articles which might happen to be placed on top of the battery.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The McLean coating clearly does not \u201cencapsulate all parts on the top wall\u201d of the battery and this is the only real point of difference from applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The board analyzed appellant\u2019s arguments and commented thereon as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s coating differs structurally from McLean\u2019s in that the terminals, all metal appurtenances <em>and </em>the top wall in the immediate vicinity thereof are coated with a continuous adherent film of dielectric material. This continuous film of coating material provides a positive seal at all live connections and has no edges or discontinuities through which electrolytic solutions can permeate or creep beneath in the immediate vicinity of live connections. Thus, applicant\u2019s coating provides a positive, effective mechanical and electrical insulation barrier to prevent electrolytic solutions from contacting live connections, thereby preventing a short circuit of the battery. The unexpected result indicative of invention brought about by the applicant is a battery protected against short circuit on the top wall thereof, a condition previously unobtainable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201c * * * Appellant assumes that the electrode coating of McLean will extend barely to the surface of the top wall of the battery and that there will be gaps between the dielectric coating and the dielectric of the top wall of the battery. Considering the patentee\u2019s stated purpose of preventing corrosion, we do not think that appellant\u2019s view is justified. We do not see that any person of ordinary skill in this art, or even a layman, would fail to protect the entire exposed surface of the electrodes by carrying * * * [McLean\u2019s] dielectric coating into sealing contact with the dielectric top wall of the storage battery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">The step of cleaning the surface to be coated [recited in claims 34-37] is so much the usual practice that we would regard its omission as being indicative of poor mechanical practice. The process claims, therefore, cover merely the application of coating by the most obvious procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">We believe that the above-stated position of the board is entirely sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">Appellant has very ably presented his arguments concerning the inappositeness of the McLean reference\u2019s disclosure. However, we find the conclusion inescapable that McLean was concerned with the identical problem, only in its broader aspects, which concerns appellant. We find this conclusion supported by McLean\u2019s specification which, as quoted above, states in effect that one of the problems toward a solution for which his invention was directed was that encountered from the <em>spilling </em>of electrolytes over the <em>terminals and connections. </em>In view of such a disclosure, McLean clearly intended to provide, as does appellant, \u201ca continuous impenetrable barrier which prevents * * * electrical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ly conductive solutions from contacting metallic parts of the battery.\u201d If he did not quite say so in\u00bbso many words, one of ordinary skill would know, from what he does say, that this would have to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">So far as the record before us shows, it appears to be <em>new </em>with appellant to \u201cencapsulate all parts on the top wall\u201d of a storage battery. No doubt appellant\u2019s <em>claimed invention </em>is useful.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the issue for our consideration is the <em>obviousness </em>of appellant\u2019s claimed invention, for unless it would not have been obvious, it cannot be patented, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The broad concept of encapsulating assembled conductive members by means of an insulating, corrosion resistant material was not first conceived by appellant. We judicially note that it was well known at the time of appellant\u2019s invention to so encapsulate conductive members which would otherwise be attacked by corrosive fluids. We further judicially note that cleaning a surface prior to coating of such surface, be it even with household paint, is a common procedure to assure adherence of the coating compound to the coated surface. We agree with the solicitor that as to this aspect of appellant\u2019s invention: \u201c[a skilled person would find it] obvious to extend the coating for the conductive parts in McLean over part or all of the top wall of the battery to provide maximum protection against leakage of liquids to the conductive parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Claim 33 calls for the coating to be of polymerized chloroprene. The board stated, and it is not contested, that this substance had \u201cknown dielectric properties.\u201d We do not consider the limitation to be material. Similarly, inasmuch as appellant has not argued the criticality of the limitations in claims 36 and 37 that the \u201ccoating\u201d be in \u201csolution\u201d form, we do not consider these limitations material. Furthermore, McLean\u2019s coating was in solution form. It is conventional to apply coatings in such form.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">In view of the foregoing, we feel that, as provided in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, \u201cthe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which such subject matter pertaine[d].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">. The issue of lack of utility was raised in the examiner\u2019s Final Rejection and again in his Answer. The Board of Appeals, while affirming \u201cthe rejection * * \u00ab for the reasons stated by the examiner,\u201d did not expressly comment on this utility issue. The board\u2019s basis for affirming the examiner, while not entirely clear from its first decision, did appear, from its decision on appellant\u2019s Request for Reconsideration, to be based on the <em>obvious </em>nature of appellant\u2019s claimed invention in view of the McLean reference and the knowledge of \u201ca person of ordinary skill in the subject art.\u201d Since we feel that appellant\u2019s invention would be obvious to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains, we shall consider the utility question only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The examiner stated in his Answer that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">The claim is fully met excepting that the coating of McLean does not cover the \u201ctop wall\u201d. It is [the] position of the examiner that this coating on the top wall does not add to the protective action and that McLean obtains just as good a result as does applicant when the patentee coats all the exposed leads. Thus, it is held that the additional \u201ctop wall\u201d cover <em>has no utility. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-15\">This rejection combined the \u201cmet by McLean\u201d and \u201clack of utility\u201d rejections made by the examiner in his Final Rejection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-16\">We know of no statutory ground for dissecting appellant\u2019s coating and thereafter considering the <em>utility </em>of each segment in the light of the odd idea that if a patent were issued \u201cthe public might be put to expense in purchasing an article for which there is no real need,\u201d as the examiner put it in his Final Rejection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-17\">If one skilled in the art of encapsulating conductive elements of batteries might not consider it necessary, as in fact it is <em>not necessary, to </em>encapsulate the entire top wall of a McLean-type battery to achieve appellant\u2019s desired results, this fact, by itself, would not negate the \u201cutility\u201d of appellant\u2019s invention. Considerations such as obtaining \u201cjust as good a result\u201d are, however, pertinent in considering the <em>obviousness </em>of the claimed invention; it is on this basis that we decide this case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
