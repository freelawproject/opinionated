J.</author>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Maternal grandmother (Frederiksen) appeals from a judgment in a consolidated proceeding to establish paternity, guardianship and custody of Jeremy, the three-year-old son of Frederiksen\u2019s deceased daughter (Andrea). We review <em>de novo, </em>ORS 19.415, and reverse the judgment as to the guardianship and custody of Jeremy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Jeremy was bom in 1995. His mother, Andrea, and his father never married. Andrea resided with her mother, Frederiksen, during the latter half of her pregnancy and until her death in 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frederiksen is 45 years old, married, and manages an apartment house. She is also a certified day care provider. According to Frederiksen, she essentially \u201cmothered\u201d her daughter Andrea and Andrea\u2019s two children, Jordan and Jeremy, until Andrea\u2019s death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Frederiksen testified that she and Andrea were \u201cjoint caretakers\u201d of Jeremy and that she and Jeremy had developed a \u201cvery close, loving relationship\u201d before her daughter\u2019s death. Even before Andrea\u2019s death, Frederiksen regularly fed and bathed Jeremy, took him to the doctor, played with him and took him shopping and other places. During the period between Jeremy\u2019s birth and Andrea\u2019s death, Frederiksen and Jeremy were separated only briefly when Frederiksen resided out of state for two or three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Dr. Bimey, a psychologist engaged to evaluate the relationship between Jeremy and Frederiksen, described Jeremy as a \u201cvery comfortable child\u201d who was emotionally connected and clearly bonded to Frederiksen. Bimey opined that the bonding had occurred before Andrea\u2019s death and that, because Frederiksen had also been a primary caretaker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201cAndrea\u2019s death may not have had as significant an impact on Jeremy as would otherwise be the case.\u201d He also testified that Jeremy\u2019s bonding with Frederiksen provided a sense of security in Jeremy\u2019s life and had served to lessen the traumatic impact of his mother\u2019s death. Birney concluded that, \u201cif Jeremy was moved from Frederiksen\u2019s home, there was a better than 50% chance that Jeremy\u2019s emotional development and adult adjustment would be compromised, in terms of difficulty in forming relationships later in life and in anxiety in the child at the time of disruption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Until just before Andrea\u2019s death, father had not acknowledged paternity of Jeremy and had provided no formal support for the child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Father has been arrested for driving while revoked and assaulting a police officer and, at the time of the hearing, was on probation for possession of a controlled substance. Evidence indicated that father used methamphetamine in front of another one of his sons. Father testified that he had been treated for his drug addiction at Serenity Lane and claimed to be \u201cclean and sober\u201d since that treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The testimony about father\u2019s contact with Jeremy before Andrea\u2019s death is conflicting. Witnesses called by Frederiksen described father\u2019s contact as intermittent and indicated that father paid little attention to Jeremy before Andrea\u2019s death. Father characterized his relationship with Andrea as a \u201ccome and go type thing\u201d and indicated that he spent \u201can average of 50% of the overnights with Andrea give or take.\u201d Father testified that, before Andrea\u2019s death, he took Jeremy out \u201ca couple of times.\u201d Camberg, the mother of another of father\u2019s children, testified that father is \u201can excellent\u201d father to her son. However, she also recalled an incident in which father \u201cbeat her up\u201d in front of that child and had to be taken to jail. Father and his son by Camberg share a room in father\u2019s parents\u2019 home. Father\u2019s testimony did not reveal whether he planned any other living arrangements if he were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>awarded custody of Jeremy. Father testified that, if given custody of Jeremy, he first planned to take Jeremy on a month-long vacation to Mexico.* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to father, he hoped to have a \u201csignificant other\u201d babysit Jeremy while he was at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">On appeal, Frederiksen contends that, even under the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d standard, the court erred in awarding custody to father. When she filed her brief in this court, Frederiksen did not assign error to the trial court\u2019s use of the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d standard, <em>see Hruby and Hruby, </em>304 Or 500, 748 P2d 57 (1987), in its determination of custody. However, in <em>Sleeper and Sleeper, </em>328 Or 504, 982 P2d 1126 (1999), and <em>Moore and Moore, </em>328 Or 513, 982 P2d 1131 (1999), decided after the trial in this case and after the filing of Frederiksen\u2019s brief, the Supreme Court held that the legislature, in amending ORS 109.119(2)(a), intended that courts use the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard in resolving custody disputes between a biological parent and a person with child-parent relationship with the minor child whose custody is at issue. Accordingly, because we review <em>de novo, </em>we apply the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard in determining whether Jeremy\u2019s custody should be with father or with Frederiksen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The trial court found that \u201c[Frederiksen] has bonded with the child.\u201d Our review of the record convinces us not only of the correctness of that finding but that, indeed, a veiy strong child-parent relationship exists between Jeremy and Frederiksen and that that relationship preexisted Jeremy\u2019s mother\u2019s death. We also conclude that Jeremy\u2019s relationship with Frederiksen has provided a sense of security necessary to Jeremy\u2019s emotional development and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Our extensive review of the record also convinces us that father was generally indifferent emotionally toward Jeremy before mother\u2019s death. We base that determination on father\u2019s failure to acknowledge or participate in a determination of paternity until just before Andrea\u2019s death, his failure to pay some form of formal support, and his sporadic or barely intermittent contact with Jeremy during the first two- and-a-half years of Jeremy\u2019s life. We also find that father\u2019s criminal histoiy, his violence against the mother of his other child, and his living situation demonstrate that he lacks the ability to provide the kind of stabilizing and nurturing environment Jeremy needs, particularly now after the loss of bis mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Finally, Bimey testified that, because of the strong bond between Frederiksen and Jeremy and the security that relationship provides to Jeremy, removing Jeremy from Frederiksen\u2019s ftdl-time care would cause Jeremy significant anxiety and would negatively impact Jeremy\u2019s emotional development even into adulthood. Nothing in the record refutes Birney\u2019s assessment, and we agree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">It does appear that father, with the death of Jeremy\u2019s mother, is now intent on having a father-son relationship with Jeremy. However, after considering the entire record and weighing the factors outlined in ORS 107.137(2) as applicable here, we conclude that it is in Jeremy\u2019s best interest that he be placed in Frederiksen\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Judgment as to father\u2019s paternity affirmed; reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment granting Frederiksen\u2019s petitions for guardianship and custody of Jeremy. On remand, the trial court shall determine father\u2019s child support obligation and reasonable parenting time for father.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> On appeal, Frederiksen does not challenge the finding on paternity. Although father appeared and was represented in the proceedings below, he has not filed a brief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> Although Andrea and her children occupied a separate apartment at some point, the record indicates it was an adjoining apartment that shared a common entry door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> Jordan is Andrea\u2019s child from another relationship. After Andrea\u2019s death, Jordan lived with his paternal grandparents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> There is testimony in the record that father had provided automobiles for Andrea to drive, although she did not have a driver\u2019s license. A witness called by father- testified that she saw Andrea with cash that the witness believed had been given to Andrea by father. Father testified that he wrote checks for $250 to $300 per month to Andrea. However, father failed to bring the canceled checks to the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> We have reviewed father\u2019s testimony in an attempt to determine what living arrangements father intended to provide for Jeremy. There is nothing in father\u2019s testimony about that, only that he and his son with Camberg share a room in father\u2019s parents\u2019 home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> Generally, in determining the best interests of the child for custody purposes, we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201c(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201c(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201c(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201c(d) The abuse of one parent by the other; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">\u201c(e) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child.
