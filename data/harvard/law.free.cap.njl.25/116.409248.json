To maintain the action, the words must be either actionable <em>per se, </em>or, \u25a0as to thQ three first counts, actionable by reason of their being spoken of the plaintiff in his office or business as \u2022superintendent or director, or both, of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The general rule is, that-where a person is charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the commission of a crime, or where the imputation affects him in his office, profession, or business, the action may be maintained without proof of special damage. 1 <em>Starkie on Slander </em>10.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Then 1. As to the words, \u201c 1 know enough ho has' done to send him to the penitentiary,\u201d are they actionable <em>per se? </em>In <em>Brooker </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>5 <em>Johns. </em>188, the court held that \u201cin case the charge, if true, will subject the party charged to an indictment for a crime involving moral turpitude, or subject him to -an infamous punishment, the words will be themselves actionable.\u201d This rule was recognised subsequently in <em>Widrig </em>v. <em>Oyer, </em>13 <em>Johns. </em>124; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Stilwell, </em>13 <em>Johns. </em>275 ; <em>Vanness </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>19 <em>Johns, </em>367 ; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 <em>Hill </em>22; <em>Andres </em>v. <em>Koppenh\u0153ffer, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>225; and <em>Ludlam </em>v. <em>McCuen,, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>12. In <em>Walmsley </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>6 <em>Modern </em>200, words were said to be actionable <em>per se </em>which charge some scandalous crime; in <em>Mayne </em>v. <em>Digle, </em>1 <em>Freeman </em>16, that they must be such as impute to the party an offence for which he may be indicted ; in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>696, that they must endanger life or subject to infamous punishment; and in <em>Onslow </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>3 <em>Wilson </em>177, that they must contain an express imputation of some crime liable to punishment; some capital offence or other infamous crime or misdemeanor*</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Now, upon the authority of these cases, I think the words are actionable <em>per se ; </em>for, as was said by Denman, C. J. in <em>Read </em>v. <em>Ambridge, </em>6 <em>Car. &amp; Payne </em>308, the question is, what the defendant meant to make other people-believe; and see 1 <em>Starkie on Slander </em>46-7. The words,- \u201c I know enough he has done to send him to the penitentiary,\u201d undoubtedly were meant to convey the impression that the plaintiff was guilty of a crime or crimes for which he might be indicted, convicted, and sent to the state prison. A crime or crimes involving moral turpitude, and punishment by imprisonment in the state prison,, is con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sidered infamous. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Dowdney, </em>2 <em>Moody &amp; Robeson </em>119 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>5 <em>Barr </em>372.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In <em>Curtis </em>v. Curtis, 10 <em>Bingham </em>477, it was held that the words, you have committed an act for which I can transport you;\u201d were actionable <em>per se ; </em>for, said Tindall, C. J., I cannot see how any one who had heard that the defendant was able to transport the plaintiff could form any other supposition than that the plaintiff had been guilty of a crime. In <em>Downids </em>- <em>case, Cro. Eliz. </em>62, the words were, \u201cif you had your deserts, you had been hanged before now,\u201d and held actionable. So the words, \u201cyou have done things with the company for which you ought to be hanged, and I will have you hanged before the first of August.\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Roose, </em>3 <em>Mee. de Welsby </em>191. This disposes of the demurrer, as to the second, third, and fourth counts, for the words charged are substantially the same in each, and being actionable <em>per se </em>are also actionable when spoken in relation to the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">2. The words, \u201c he has sold the property of the company, and pocketed the money,\u2019\u2019alleged to have been spoken of the plaintiff in his capacity of director and superintendent of the company, with the innuendo that he had been guilty of fraudulently disposing of the property of said company, and applying the proceeds thereof to his own use, form the subject matter of the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">It is quite well settled that words spoken of a person in his office, business, or employment, imputing a want of integrity, of credit, of common honesty, are actionable. 1 <em>Starkie on Slander </em>127; <em>McCuen </em>v. Ludlam, 2 <em>Harr. </em>12; and any lawful employment, or situation of trust, lucrative or confidential, is within the rule. The words spoken imply that the plaintiff had been guilty of a breach of trust, had acted dishonestly, had fraudulently sold- and applied the proceeds of the company\u2019s property to his own use. Such, I think, is the clear purport of the words; so, I think, they were intended to be understood; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>such would be tbe impression they would naturally make on tlie minds of those to whom they were spoken. I do not think we are bound to tax our ingenuity to find the mildest possible construction that can be put upon the words, even before verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">I am of opinion the demurrer should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">G seen, C. J., and Ogden, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
