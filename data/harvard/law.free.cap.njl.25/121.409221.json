I shall not undertake to go through them, but shall content myself with noticing one subject, embraced in several exceptions, \u201ewhich must, in my opinion, decide the cause, and which, therefore, renders it unnecessary to notice the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The action was in trespass, for breaking and entering' a certain mill of plaintiffs, and breaking down and removing from it certain shafting and gearing, fastened and attached to the floor, walls, and ceilings. The declaration .contained several counts, to which there was a plea of not guilty, and pleas of freehold in the defendants, and of property in the shafting and gearing, upon which issues were taken. After proving that the mill and other property belonged to one Daniel Holsman, who died seized of it, leaving Catharine Holsman, his widow; Daniel Hols-man, Maria Holsman, Eliza B. Holsman, and Julia Hols-man, infants under the age of twenty-one, and Catharine Ann, who intermarried with Clement B. Barclay, and Margaretta, who intermarried with James Barclay, his children and heirs, plaintiffs offered in evidence a deed for said property, purporting to be made by said Catharine Holsman, as widow and as guardian of the infant heirs, by virtue of an order of the chancellor, and by the two Barclays and their wives, to the plaintiffs, bearing date November 1, 1850, before the acts complained of were committed. It appeared that Mrs. Holsman was the guardian of the said infants, appointed by the Orphans Court, bxit no order of the chancellor recited in the deed, or other authority to sell the interest of the infants, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>produced. To the reception of this deed, defendants\u2019 counsel objected, on the ground that no authority from the chancellor to sell was shown. But the deed was admitted, and a bill of exceptions sealed. It does not appear by this hill whether it was received as a valid conveyance of the infants\u2019 right to the property or not, and had nothing appeared to show that it was relied on as sufficient evidence of the title, and as evidence of the possession of the whole interest in the property, inasmuch as it was clearly admissible as a valid conveyance of those who were of age, there would, perhaps, have been no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u2022 But it further appears that the judge charged the jury, \u201cthat if the plaintiffs had no interest there beyond a nalsed possession, tbe amount of their recovery should be graduated by one scale, if their possession was coupled with an interest in the estate, real and personal, or either, it should be graduated by another scale. The present plaintiffs claim to have been there in possession through Mr. Barclay, atid that they were the owners of the soil and mill and property, and also of the shafting and gearing. A deed and bill of sale or confirmation have been offered in evidence to show the rights of the plaintiffs. The two seem to carry out what Mr. Barclay and Mr. Pennington have testified was the contract of sale. The possession of the property alleged to be conveyed by these papers has passed from the representatives of the estate to the plaintiffs. Neither the grantors, nor any party claiming under them, have impugned that title, and it is sufficient for this case to say, that a stranger to the transaction, without estate in or claim of property, cannot step forward, either as a friend of the orphan children, or as a protector of the rights of the administratrix, or as a champion for creditors, and by objection, without assailing proof, lawfully impeach that sale, or the <em>prima facie </em>evidence to be drawn from the instruments of writing which tend to establish it.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>This part of the charge was excepted to, and the judge was requested, on the part of the defendants to charge that, as to the real estate, there is no evidence of the title to four sixths thereof, being the portions of the children who wore mmol\u2019s at the time of the execution of the deed to plaintiffs, having been transferred to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs\u2019 deed for the same being inoperative and void as to such four fifths part thereof \u201d ; but the judge refused so to charge, and his refusal was excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It thus appears,- as well by what the judge did charge as by what he refused to charge, that the deed was received and submitted to the jury as evidence of title in the plaintiffs to the whole of the property purporting to be therein conveyed. In this there was, in my opinion, error. The guardian had no right to sell or make a deed for the property of her wards without an older of the Orphans Court or the chancellor ; and a deed made by virtue of such an order cannot legally be given in evidence without producing the authority. A guardian is entitled to the possession of his ward\u2019s land, and may transfer that possession or lease the land without any order, but he can convey no title to the freehold, otherwise than as the statutes authorize. The deed received purported to be made by virtue of an order of the chancellor, which is authorized by the act of 1845 <em>(Rev. Stat. </em>550). The sale is required, by that act, to be reported to and approved by the chancellor before a conveyance shall be executed; so that the special authority to sell.is just as necessary to be shown -as in the case of a sale by an executor or a sheriff. A deed made by one having no title by virtue of a naked power, is inoperative and void, unless made in pursuance of the power, and the power must be shown. <em>Den </em>v. Lambert, 1 <em>Green </em>182; <em>Den </em>v. <em>Despreauce, 7 Halst. </em>182; <em>Den </em>v. <em>Philhower and </em>Sowers, <em>Court of </em>Errors, <em>June T. </em>1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The effort, on the part of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, was to get rid of this difficulty, by insisting that, as possession</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>was shown to have been delivered by authority of the guardian to the plaintiffs, and as possession without a title would have been sufficient to enable them to maintain trespass against wrongdoers, the admission of the deed was not an error so affecting the merits of tire case as to justify a reversal for that reason. But the question of possession was in controversy, and the deed was submitted to the jury as evidence on that point; and not only so, but they were correctly told, that if plaintiffs\u2019 possession was coupled with an interest in the estate, real and personal, or In either, their recovery would be graduated accordingly. If tbe title to four sixths of the pro perty remained in the infants, the plaintiffs, as mere possessors, were not entitled to damages to the full value of tho property injured. As owners of the reversion, the infants were entitled to an action for the injury done to the property of a permanent nature amounting to waste, from which no act of the guardian precluded them. 2 <em>Sound. </em>252 <em>n. 7 </em>; <em>Potts </em>v.

He died intestate, leaving a widow and six children, four of whom were minors at the time the grievances complained of were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The proofs established that, on the 16th of September, 1850, Mr. Barclay, the son in law of Mrs. llolsman, in behalf of her, of himself, mid of others interested in the estate, made a contract for a sale to Todd, Mackey, and Rafferty of the premises called the home mill, for the price of SIS,000, and that he received on such behalf the sum of \u00a72000 on account; and tliat the interest on the balance of the purchase money was to commence on the first day of Kovember then ensuing, and the purchasers to be entitled to the rents and use of the property from Rovember ; that at the time of the negotiations for the sale and purchase, the premises were in the occupancy of the plaintiffs in error, as tenants of the representatives of Daniel llolsman, deceased ; that before the contract was completed they were informed that a sale was contemplated, to which they replied, that there would be no difficulty about <em>the </em>possession; and that when told that the sale to the plaintiffs below had been concluded, they said there would bo no difficulty about the possession; also, that it had been mutually arranged that they should hold the premises until the first of Rovember.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">It likewise was shown tliat Mr. Barclay, on the first day oi Rovember, called at the office of the defendants be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>low, in Paterson, received the rent then payable, and informed their clerk that their term in the premises was at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The deed which was objected to bears date the first of November, 1850, was acknowledged on the twenty-second of the same month, and was delivered at or about that time. It was recorded on the 6th of December.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On the 25th of November, Mr. Barclay went to the premises in company with the plaintiffs below, and gave to them, as their owners, full and actual possession of the dif \u2022ferent parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On the 30th of November, the defendants below, with a \u25a0large company of men and several teams, went upon the premises, and with strong arm took down from the building the gearing and shafting provided therein for working the mill, earned it away, and disposed of it as they saw fit. Those acts constituted the trespass complained of in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">As the plaintiffs below had been put iiito actual posses- ' sion of all the premises, as the purchasers thereof, by Mr. Barclay, representing in himself one share of the estate, and acting as agent for his mother in law in her own right and as guardian of the minor children of Daniel Holsman, deceased, and also as agent of James Barclay and his wife, it was not essential for the support of the action that they should produce evidence of a legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u25a0 Proof of naked possession is sufficient to support a recovery against a <em>tortfeasor. </em>This court are to infer, from the verdict of guilty, that the jury were satisfied that the plaintiffs below were lawfully in possession of the premises, and that the tenancy of the defendants had been properly terminated before the alleged trespass was committed by them. If the deed was erroneously admitted in evidence, or an undue importance was given to it in the charge of the judge, the injury therefrom to the defendants below could only have been in the assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In an action of <em>disseisin, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 possession, alone and without deed, is evidence enough, unless more is made requisite by proof on the defendant\u2019s part. 7 <em>Conn. </em>298; C.

Barclay and his wife, who is a daughter of the intestate, and by James Barclay and his wife, also a daughter of the intestate. All these were of full age; and hence the instrument, when proved, was competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>evidence of the transfer of their rights in the premises to the plaintiffs below, and was properly admitted before the- jury. The deed, however, was also claimed by the plaintiffs to be sufficient <em>prima facie </em>proof of a conveyance to them of the estates of the minor children in the premises. It purported, on its face, to have been executed by Mrs. Holsman, in a relative capacity also, to wit, as guardian of the minor children of Daniel Holsman,.deceased. It seems to have been prepared with much care, and the recitals therein set forth at large, that regular proceedings had been taken before the chancellor of this' state, under a law approved March 19th, 1845, entitled, \u201cAn act relating to the sale and disposition of the real estate of infants. \u2019 The recitals are full as to all the proceedings, including a confirmation thereof by the chancellor, preliminary to and necessary for a legal transfer of the title-of the infants.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The execution of -the instrument by Mrs. Holsman, in her capacity of guardian, was sufficiently proved, and nothing appeared upon the face of the deed showing, it to be irregular or void.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">It was contended, in behalf of the defendants below, that the instrument furnished- no evidence whatever of a valid conveyance of the - estates of the minors, because it was not accompanied with the proper proofs of the proceedings before the chancellor, upon which it rested. The deed was given to the jury without qualification or limit as to its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The judge charged the jury, that in an action of trespass, if a plaintiff had no interest in the premises beyond a naked possession, the amount of his recovery should he graduated by one scale, but if his - possession' was coupled with an interest in the estate, real and personal, or in either, it should be graduated by another scale; and further, that the plaintiffs in this case claimed to have been in possession through Mr: Barclay, and that they were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>owners of tlie mill and property, and also of tlie shafting, &amp;e., which had been taken down by the defendants, and removed, or, in other words, that they were in possession under claim of title; and he told them that a stranger, without estate in or claim of property, cannot by objection, without assailing proofs, lawfully impeach th <em>e prima facie </em>evidence to he drawn from the instruments of writing which tended to establish the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The jury were also instructed by the court, that those conveyances, accompanied by the testimony of Mr. Barclay and of Mr. Pennington, as to the contract for a sale, and followed by the actual possesion given on the 25th of November, were sufficient proofs to support a recovery of damages for the invasion of the freehold, and any injury done to it, and for the removal and'conversion of tho shafting and articles which were forcibly taken from the premises on the 30th of November, unless the defendants, upon the issue of <em>libermn tenem&amp;ntwm, </em>had shown a better title to the same; and also, that their verdict would conclude the matter of damages for taking away the machinery, &amp;c., as no other parties could maintain an action against the defendants for the alleged trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">These instructions of the judge were excepted to, and errors have been assigned upon the exceptions. lie thereupon was requested to charge the jury, that there was no evidence that the title to four sixths of the real estate (the portions of the infants) had been transferred to the plain tiffs, the deed for the same being inoperative and void as to such four sixths parts. The judge refused to make such charge, and sealed a bill of exceptions thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The charge and the refusal to charge relate to matters so connected that they may appropriately be considered to gether.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">It is proper to bear in mind, as we progress, that the defendants below offered no proof of title upon the issue of <em>liberum tenementum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In the first place, as the possession of the entire .estate had been passed over to the plaintiffs below by the guardian of the infants and by her agent, can she maintain an action against the defendants below for any of the acts complained of in the declaration in this suit ? or can those \u25a0 minors, when at majority, maintain such an action <em>1 </em>They cannot support trespass because it is a possessory action, the possession of the premises being in the plaintiffs alone, given and held under at least an alleged contract for the-purchase thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Although the heirs may have the freehold in law, being-out of .possession they shall not have trespass. 6 <em>Com.

Were the defendants below entitled to the instructions which the judge declined giving ? or, in other words, had they a right upon the evidence as it stood before the jury, to impeach the title or right; upon which the actual and sole possession of the plaintiffs rested ?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The verdict guilty establishes that the defendants below were fraudulent wrongdoers, trespassers without excuse; yet, as such, they here complain, that the judge refused to direct the jury to mitigate their punishment, because the plaintiffs had not shown a technical and complete paper title for the premises invaded lawfully put in their possession by the former owners thereof, and intruded upon by the defendants without pretence of authority or color of justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">In 18 <em>Conn. </em>243, <em>Branch </em>v.

The plaintiff had full possession of the building at the time of the trespass, claiming to be the owner thereof, through a purchase from the members of the association. His bill of sale, or deed, was not signed by all the members, and the defendants sought to diminish the damages by that defect of title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The case was brought before the Supreme Court for review. In examining it, Ellsworth, J., says, \u201cWe now come to a question of a different character. It is said the court should have charged the jury, that if the deed was not signed by each person who was at the time, or had been, a member of the company, the plaintiff could not recover the whole damages against a wrongdoer. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>why not.?

The plaintiff claimed title to the <em>locus in quo </em>through the proprietors of common lands. He offered no deed in evidence, but relied upon certain votes and proceedings of the proprietors, to whom the township was granted by Massachusetts, in <em>1774.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The defendants set up no title, but they objected to the plaintiff\u2019s title: first, on account of an alleged illegality in the proceedings under which the plaintiff claimed; secondly, they contended .that if the proceedings were . legal, they were insufficient to pass title to lands.</p>\n<author id=\"b152-8\">Teuney, j.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9m\">in delivering the opinion of the court, after going over the points presented, adds, \u201c But the defendant does not stand in such, a relation to the propraetors or to the plaintiff as to authorize the technical objections on which he relies. The plaintiff is bound only to slnny that the land was in his possesion, either actual or constructive, at the time of the alleged trespass, and this rightfully against the defendant. The defendant is a stranger to the transactions between the plaintiff and the proprietors; has no rights to be affected whether they stand or fall; no claim to the land or to the trees cut by him has he presented. His acts are equally a trespass .whether the land or its possession passed from the proprietors to the plaintiff or not; and in an action like tliis the wrongdoer cannot set up a title in a third person without showing some authority or right dei'iv\u00e9.d from the owner to justify his acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\"><em>1 Zab.

He also showed, by parol, that he had agreed for the purchase of the remaining eighth, had paid a part of the consideration, and had gone into possession of that share under the agreement ; but it appeared that the deed for the undivided eighth part was not made until after the accident. The evidence was objected to. The court, in deciding the case in error, say, \u201cIt was contended, upon the argument, that the evidence of the parol agreement to purchase, and possession under it, was not competent to prove the seizing of the plaintiff. It was incumbent upon him to prove not only that he had an interest in the premises, but such an interest as entitled him to <em>damages; </em>and as he claimed damages to the full amount of the property destroyed, it was necessary for him to establish a legal right to recover that amount. Although the evidence offered did not prove a strictly legal estate in the plaintiff in the one eight part of the premises, yet, for the purposes of this action, and as against the defendants below as wrongdoers, it was competent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Again. \u201c The party who had the strictly legal estate could kot maintain an action himself or join the plaintiff in an action for the injury, as he was out of possession under the agreement.\u201d \u201c The loss was entirely the plaintiff\u2019s, and no recovery could bo had for the one eighth of the value of the buildings burned, except by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The plaintiffs below in the case before us were not bound in support of their action, as against wrongdoers, to prove any title beyond the presumption arising from their possession. They saw fit, however, to go further, and to show that their possession was under a valid agreement to purchase, partly executed by a payment of a portion of the consideration money, and also to show that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>was continued under color of a legal title. They produced in evidence a deed, valid on its face, executed by proper parties, purporting to act in the premises under authority of law. Such testimony was sufficient, in my judgment, for the purposes for which it was employed. The plaintiffs below, as the case appears before us, would have been compelled to bear any loss which might happen from accident between their entry ipto possession under the agreement for purchase and a valid deed, and they should be entitled to any benefit which might accrue in the interval. But suppose that they had gone a step further, and had attempted to show the proceedings in the Court of Chancery, and a material variance had appeared between the exemplification of those proceedings and the recitals in their deed, should the defendants, without pretence of possession of title, or privity with the persons from whom the legal title was to be derived, have reaped an advantage from the variance, and on that account have been mulcted in less damages for their wilful trespasses <em>% </em>If not, the production of the evidence of those proceedings with the deed,- would have been to no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">From a careful review of the cause, I am of ojfinion that the exceptions urged by the defendants below, which have been examined, were not well taken, and that the judge of the Circuit Court did not err in his charge, nor in his refusal to charge, as required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The numerous other errors assigned have been examined by me, but none of them present sufficient grounds for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In my opinion, the judgment below should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Sajke <em>case. </em>\u2014 2 <em>Dutch. </em>525.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
