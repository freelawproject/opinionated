This power of attorney was filed April 10, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">The estate in San Francisco consisted of $2,000, in the hands of Joseph Rothschild.

Counsel cited sections 1383 and 1386, Code of Civil Procedure, the first of which provides in substance that when letters have been granted to any other person than the surviving husband or wife, child, father, mother, brother or sister of the intestate, any one of them who is competent may obtain the revocation of the letters and be entitled to the administration; and the latter of which provides that \u201cthe surviving husband or wife, when letters have been granted to a child, father, brother or sister of the intestate, or any of such relatives, when letters have been granted to any other of them, may assert his prior right and obtain letters of administration, and have the letters before granted revoked,\u201d and claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that when letters are once granted only the persons above named could apply for their revocation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">On behalf of the petition for revocation, section 1365, Code of Civil Procedure, was cited, to the effect that letters could only be granted to some one or more of the persons mentioned in that section, and that relatives of the deceased are \u201centitled to administer only when they are entitled to succeed to his personal estate, or some portion thereof\u201d; and that the administrator did not come within subdivision 7 of that section, giving the right to administer to \u201cthe next of kin entitled to share in the distribution of the estate,\u201d petitioner and his sister being the only heirs of decedent. Counsel further contended that under section 1379, Code of Civil Procedure, the administrator, not being entitled to letters in his own right, could only have been appointed \u201cat the written request of the person entitled, filed in the court,\u201d and that no such written request had been filed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">Joseph Rothschild, for petitioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">William H.
