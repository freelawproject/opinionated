Fenner was named as executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">On petition filed by Mr. Fenner, on October 13, 1881, the will was admitted to probate, he appointed executor thereof, and letters testamentary thereon issued to him, on October 28, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-10\">The executor died on April 22, 1883, while still acting as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-11\">On May 26, 1883, Grace L. Riddle, a daughter of the testator, filed a petition signed by Samuel H. Dwinelle, as her attorney, and verified by her, setting forth the facts, and praying for the appointment of David McClure as administrator of the estate with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-12\">On June 8, 1883, an order was made as prayed for by the petitioner appointing Mr. McClure, and on August 13, 1883, letters of administration with the will annexed were issued to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-13\">On December 17, 1884, Mr. McClure filed a petition for an order to sell certain real property belonging to the estate, and on January 28, 1885, an order of sale was made accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-14\">A sale was had pursuant to such order, and on April 8, 1885, Mr. McClure filed his return and account of sales, together with a petition for the confirmation thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>On April 23, 1885, a purchaser (J. C. Johnson) filed written objections to such confirmation, on the ground that the sale was not legally made, in this:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-3\">1. That no petition in writing had ever been filed by David McClure, signed by him or by his counsel, for his appointment as administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-4\">2. That there was no administrator of the estate, and that the sale was without authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">3. That no bond was required in the order of sale,- or ever given by Mr. McClure upon the sale, and that his original bond was only $3,500, while the amount bid for the property was $32,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">The facts were correctly stated in the grounds of contest. Proceedings de novo were accordingly commenced, and new letters issued to David McClure May 29, 1885.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">F. J.

There is no petition on file here signed by David McClure or by his counsel. Grace Biddle\u2019s application that David McClure be appointed is not sufficient, as the person to whom letters are issued must apply by his own petition, signed by himself or his counsel: Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1371, 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The order of June 8, 1883, had no proper basis as required by the foregoing cited sections, and it must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">2. An additional bond should have been provided for in the order of sale of the real \"estate: Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The objections to the confirmation of the sale are sustained; they cannot now be cured by amendment; there being no petition, there is nothing to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
