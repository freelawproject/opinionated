Cooney. The ground specified in the notice of motion to strike out was, among other grounds, first, that the cost bill \u201cwas not filed or served within five days after the decision and judgment of the court was made, and the order admitting the will to probate was made and entered.\u201d The opinion of the court is directed solely to this first ground, and the facts supporting that ground are fully set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-6\">M.
