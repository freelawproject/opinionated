Upon the filing of said petition and showing made, and in accordance with the prayer of the petition, the said Robert Stevenson was appointed special administrator, and upon the same day, to-wit: November 21, 1882, letters of special administration were issued to him by the clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">Thereafter, Maurice B. Blake filed a petition in the matter of the estate, to have a will of decedent admitted to probate, upon a copy of said will and of the probate thereof by a Wisconsin court (all duly authenticated); and after due proceedings the same was so admitted to probate upon June 5, 1883, and said M. B. Blake was appointed administrator with the will annexed of the estate of said decedent, and thereupon qualified on June 9, 1883. On July 17, 1883, the said administrator, Blake, filed a petition praying that a citation issue against the aforesaid Robert Stevenson, directing him to render an account of his special administration of said estate. Upon this petition citation was issued against Stevenson, returnable on July 26, 1887; citation was served, and on the return day the prayer for an account was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">On August 3, 1883, an \u201cAccount of Robert Stevenson, Special Administrator,\u201d was filed, showing that he received the sum of $385 rents from James W. Hart, collector for the \u201cStevenson Block,\u201d and that he paid out $133.45, leaving a balance amounting to $251.55; and with this account was filed a detailed account by the aforesaid James W. Hart, the agent and collector of all the rents for the owners of the said \u201cStevenson Block.\u201d On August 7, 1883, there were filed by the administrator, Blake, \u201cExceptions to Account of Special Administrator,\u201d contesting the said account filed August 3, 1883, on the grounds, first, that Stevenson has not charged himself with all the property of the estate coming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to his hands, for that on or about August 15, 1877, in decedent\u2019s lifetime, he collected, as her agent, a large sum of money and also other personal property, and an interest (undivided) in a parcel of real property, distributed to her as heir of one Andrew J. Stevenson, deceased; that large sums were afterward received as her agent in her lifetime, for rents of realty and interest and dividends on moneys and stocks; that said Stevenson never fully accounted to her for any of such property so received by him as aforesaid; that the amount of Stevenson\u2019s indebtedness cannot be stated, but is believed to exceed $20,000, and he has not accounted for any of it; second, the item for attorney fees of special administration is excessive; and prayed that the account presented be not allowed, but that said Stevenson be compelled to charge himself with the amount of his indebtedness and with all property that should be in his hands, or the proceeds of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-3\">The facts proved before the court, and which led to the opinion in the case, can be best given as they were presented in the \u201cFindings and Decision on Account of Special Administrator,\u201d drawn in conformity with the opinion and filed January 17, 1884, viz.: 1. That about August 15, 1877, said Robert Stevenson, as agent of said Margaret Armstrong, the decedent, took possession of the sum of $24,618.80 one-eighth interest in the lands and premises known as \u201cStevenson Block,\u201d and certain mining stocks, jewelry and furniture, distributed to her as one of the heirs of the late Andrew J. Stevenson, deceased. 2. That none of the said property so received by him is accounted for in his account as special administrator; but that the jewelry had been given to said Stevenson by the decedent; that the mining stocks had been, after rendition of the account, delivered to the administrator, Blake, and since the latter\u2019s qualification he has been in possession of the interest in the realty and of the household furniture. 3. That on August 15, 1877, there remained in Stevenson\u2019s hands, out of said amount of $24,618.80, the sum of $15,000 ($9,618.80 having been previously disbursed to his principal); and that said money was held and retained by him in a fiduciary capacity, upon the understanding that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>he should loan out the same upon interest for the benefit of his principal, the aforesaid decedent, and account to her therefor. 4. That, without notice to his principal, and in violation of his duties as agent, he mingled the said sum of $15,000 with his own funds, and never kept them separate therefrom; that he did not loan out the money for her to others, but used it in all respects as his own, employing it in hazardous mining and stock speculations in his own behalf, by which means it was ultimately lost. 5. That he never paid to his principal any part of said $15,000, or the interest thereon, except the interest to October 1, 1878. 6. That no demand for an accounting of said moneys was ever made upon him by his principal, or refused by him; that he never informed her of the mingling and using of said moneys with his own, and such intermingling and use were never ratified by her, the said principal. 7. That from the fifteenth day of August, 1877, aforesaid, up to the date of his principal\u2019s death, viz.: October 4, 1882, he held and managed the property collected and received as aforesaid, as her agent, together with the rents, income and dividends thereof; and that he has not entered any of the said rents or dividends, or the disbursements connected therewith, in his account aforesaid, but has specified them in an exhibit filed in the estate September 21, 1883. 8. That for a considerable period the rents and dividends received by him were not paid over to his principal, but allowed to accumulate, and on January 1, 1881, there had so accumulated and remained unpaid net rents and dividends amounting in all to the sum of $11,727.67, with interest; that thereafter he paid over the current rents and dividends up to May 1, 1882, but subsequently there accumulated and remained unpaid in his hands, from net rents and dividends, the sum of $1,004.75. 9. That the same facts existed as to the rents and dividends, so received by him as aforesaid, as existed with reference to the principal and original moneys and property which came into his possession, as found in and by the third and fourth findings above. 10. That his principal died, and he, after petitioning therefor, was appointed the special administrator of her estate and duly qualified, and at and after such qualification he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>possessed of sufficient property to have realized and taken into his possession, as such special administrator, at least the sum of $1,004.75, aforesaid. 11. That after his qualification as special administrator he. received and disbursed the moneys set forth in his account filed herein, and afterward paid over the balance therein stated to the administrator of the estate, M. B. Blake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-3\">And, as conclusions of law, the court found: 1. That the indebtedness of said Stevenson to said decedent was not, nor any part of it, barred by section 339, Code of Civil Procedure, or the statute of limitations; 2. That the account should not be settled as rendered, but the said Robert Stevenson, as such special administrator, should be charged with the various sums of money and accumulations received by him, as set out in the findings of fact, with interest; and that a decree should be entered against him settling his account at a total balance of $37,218.74, due the estate of Margaret Armstrong, deceased, from him as special administrator thereof.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">Alfred Wheeler, attorney for special administrator (Stevenson) ; afterward B.

Allen, attorney for Frederick James Armstrong, an heir at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\">M. C. Blake, attorney for Maurice B. Blake, the administrator with the will annexed, for the \u201cExceptions.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-7\">COFFEY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyW\">In the matter of the application for the settlement of the account of Robert Stevenson, as special administrator of the estate of Margaret Armstrong, deceased, the special administrator had no right to use the funds of the decedent as his own, nor to mingle them with his own funds, without clear authorization from her. It was his duty to keep them separate and intact and free from any liability such as he incurred in the use of his own moneys. He should have pursued with exactitude the instructions given as to them, or show that his act was ratified, with full knowledge on the part of the decedent of the nature of that act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The evidence shows that the authority was to \u201cloan out\u201d the money, which seems to me to mean that he was to invest for her and to account therefor, and not to borrow it for his own purposes. Mrs. Armstrong reposed confidence in him to judiciously invest her funds, and this confidence was abused when he placed himself in the position of a debtor to her, without fully advising her of the risk she ran, and affording her an opportunity of knowing that he was subjecting her funds to hazard, and depriving her of the means of averting catastrophe to her fortune. He should show that he did so, in order to avoid responsibility for the loss his conduct caused to her. Occupying a fiduciary relation, the statute of limitations cannot avail as a defense; at least, not unless or until a demand and refusal are shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Lapse of time is no bar to a trust clearly established. Prevost v. Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481, 5 L. Ed. 311. Is this trust clearly established! I think so. See extract from letter, page 48, transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cIt leaves a balance in your favor of $15,000, besides what has accumulated since the estate was fixed up, which I will loan out at about 9 per cent, being the best I can do at present.\u201d -:i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Clearly, the ordinary meaning of language will not bear the strain that \u201cloan out\u201d means he will borrow for himself, appropriate to his own use, treat as a personal account. It must be interpreted that he will invest it for her account. He was to \u201cloan out,\u201d not to borrow. He had no other instructions. He did not advise her of the risk to .which he was subjecting her funds, nor of his mingling the funds with his own indiscriminately: See vol. 2, Trans., p. 70. Mrs. McLean testifies that her sister, Margaret, wanted her brother, Robert, to \u201clay out\u201d the money. She reposed in him great trust and confidence, which he was bound to use with the utmost discretion. He did not advise her of the hazardous nature of his use of the money, nor of his own failing condition (vol. 2, Trans., pp. 62, 69-70,77, 78, 80, 85, 86). The evidence is by no means clear, is very vague and unsatisfactory, as to the extent of Mr. Hunter\u2019s or of Mrs. Armstrong\u2019s knowledge of the facts in time to retrieve conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>quences of Robert\u2019s conduct (vol. 2, Trans., 89, 87%, 103, 104). Altogether, he failed in his duty to protect her interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">Robert Stevenson was the trustee of Margaret Armstrong; his trusteeship has never been revoked; and the statute of limitations cannot operate in his favor. He is clearly liable for loss. His account should not be allowed as rendered, except the item for attorney\u2019s fee, a charge properly and necessarily incurred. Let findings be prepared in conformity with the text of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Decision in the Principal Case was affirmed by the supreme court of California in 69 Cal. 239, 10 Pac. 335, where it is held that a special administrator, who is individually indebted to the decedent, must charge himself in his account with the amount of such indebtedness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
