Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after defendant was sentenced to death for robbing and shooting two putative confederates in a drug trafficking scheme, one fatally. He was found guilty by a jury of two counts of robbery (\u00a7 211), one count of attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 664) and one count of first degree murder with a special circumstance, i.e., murder in the commission of a robbery (former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (c)(3)(i), as enacted by Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7 9, pp. 1257-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>1258, repealed by Prop. 7 of the initiative measure approved by the voters Nov. 7, 1978). Allegations that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of one of the robberies, the attempted murder, and the murder were found to be true. (\u00a7 12022.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">After careful review of each of defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm the judgment on the guilt phase and the special circumstance finding. However, we reverse the judgment on the penalty phase because (1) the trial court failed to give a reasonable doubt instruction regarding evidence of other criminal activity, and (2) the trial court failed to limit admissibility of criminal activity to evidence that demonstrates the commission of an actual crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Defendant became acquainted with Bruce Bartulis (the robbery and murder victim) and Ronald Rose (the robbery and attempted murder victim) in September of 1977. Rose and Bartulis, who were in the construction business, began building some houses adjacent to defendant\u2019s home in Newport Beach, California. The three men became friendly after defendant allowed the builders to use an electrical outlet located on his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On the first day of November 1977, defendant offered Rose and Bartulis an opportunity to participate in a large cocaine purchase, proposing that they invest $25,000 and promising them a return of five times their investment. Rose and Bartulis accepted, and, on November 2, Rose cashed a check for $10,000 and gave the money to defendant. On several occasions thereafter, defendant prodded them \u201cto come up with the rest of the money.\u201d Rose subsequently gave defendant a check for $1,500, but eventually told defendant that they could not deliver any more cash and asked him either to use the amount they had given him or to return the money. Defendant agreed to use the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">In late November or early December 1977, defendant indicated to Rose and Bartulis, who had told defendant of their difficulties in obtaining insulation for the houses they were constructing, that he knew where they could obtain some stolen insulation, since \u201chis brother was a part of this deal.\u201d In fact defendant has no brother. Defendant told the builders that they would have to pick up the insulation in Fresno, where it was being stored in a warehouse. Rose and Bartulis agreed to buy some of the insulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">On the morning of December 7, 1977, defendant informed Rose that the insulation was available to be picked up that night in Fresno. Rose had notarized and given defendant a promissory note for $25,000, which rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>resented the balance of the $25,000 Rose and Bartulis had committed themselves to in the cocaine deal as well as payment for the insulation. Defendant told Rose that they should meet him that evening at a gasoline station just off the freeway, and instructed him to \u201cget as much cash together as [he] could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Rose obtained between $3,500 and $5,000 in large-denomination bills. With that in hand, he and Bartulis drove to Fresno in Rose\u2019s 1977 Ranchero. Rose had an unloaded .44 magnum pistol in the vehicle, with some ammunition behind one of the seats. They checked into a motel designated by defendant and then went to the gasoline station at the appointed time. Within half an hour, defendant arrived, accompanied by his girlfriend, Sharon Col-man.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Colman had been living with defendant since October and was acquainted with Rose and Bartulis. That day she had flown from Newport Beach to Fresno. She then called defendant, who had flown to Sacramento, and arranged to have him pick her up at the airport in Fresno. Defendant arrived at the airport about 11 p.m., driving a Toyota he had borrowed from his mother (who resided in Sacramento). He told Colman that they were going to meet Rose and Bartulis at a gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Defendant and Colman met Rose and Bartulis at the gas station about 11:30 p.m. Defendant directed the builders to follow him to where they would meet his brother. They followed as defendant and Colman drove north on Highway 99. In the course of the drive, they stopped at an open gasoline station, where defendant used the restroom. When he came out, he walked over to the Ranchero and borrowed a book of matches. The four then continued their trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Eventually, defendant exited the freeway and the vehicles stopped in a vacant area off the road and just east of the off-ramp. Defendant got out of the Toyota and walked over to the driver\u2019s side of the Ranchero (which was parked alongside). While Colman sat in the Toyota listening to the radio, the three men talked for a while, drank some beer and smoked a marijuana cigarette. At one point, defendant re-entered his car on the passenger side, continuing his conversation with Rose and Bartulis. The tenor of the conversation was not angry. A few minutes later, defendant again exited the car and stood next to the Ranchero. Defendant leaned inside the driver\u2019s window. Suddenly Colman heard shots being fired. She saw gunflashes and, as defendant withdrew his arm from a window, saw a gun in his hand. She heard the driver, Bartulis, moaning; defendant silenced him by striking him over the head with the gun. Defendant leaned Bartulis forward and extracted his wallet, then went around to the other side of the Ranchero and did the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>same to Rose. In the course of this search, he complained that he could not find the money they were supposed to have. He returned to the Toyota with the two wallets and two handguns (the one he had used in the shooting and another) and handed them to Colman. Defendant had Colman open the trunk of the car, from which he took a can of gasoline. He then poured the gasoline over the Ranchero and its occupants and set them ablaze.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Rose was still alive. After being shot, Rose had \u201cplayed possum\u201d while being searched and even while gasoline was poured over him. As with the shooting, he did not actually see defendant do either of these things. He did recall that defendant was alone at the window on the driver\u2019s side, that the shots came from the direction in which defendant was standing, and that he heard a male voice close to him while his body was being searched. When he was set afire, Rose jumped out of the Ranchero and tried to shed his burning clothing. Defendant, who had run back to the Toyota and begun to turn it around, saw Rose running away. Complaining to Colman that Rose \u201cwasn\u2019t dead,\u201d defendant drove at Rose and hit him, in the process cracking the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Defendant and Colman drove to Sacramento. He was calm, though somewhat disturbed at not knowing whether Rose was dead. He lamented several times that he had been unable to find the money that Rose was supposed to have had with him. (The wallets, which Colman handed over to defendant in the car, contained only $120 to $150.) Defendant also commented that his gun \u201cwas too big of a calibre because he was too close.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Upon reaching Sacramento, the pair went to the home of defendant\u2019s mother. Defendant went to his mother\u2019s room and told her he had been to a \u201cdisco\u201d dance and that on the way home the windshield had been cracked by some gravel thrown up by a truck. He assured her he would \u201ctake care of it\u201d that day. A short time later, hearing voices downstairs, defendant\u2019s mother came downstairs to investigate. Though she had originally thought her son was alone, she saw a woman (presumably Colman) with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Meanwhile, two Madera County Deputy Sheriffs proceeding along Highway 99 on a routine patrol noted a glow in the sky which turned out, on closer inspection, to be three fires just off the freeway. The deputies ran to Rose and covered him, extinguishing the flames. Rose had suffered five gunshot wounds and bums over 65 percent of his body. When he was taken to the hospital, it was not thought that he would live.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In the Ranchero, Bartulis was found dead, with a bullet wound in the heart. He appeared to have been shot in the left side of the chest and the wound indicated that a large\u2014.44- or .45-calibre\u2014bullet was used. Two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>bullet holes were observed in the Ranchero, and a spent .45-calibre shell was found on the ground near the vehicle. The deputies also found a jacket containing badly burned currency showing $100 denominations.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The day after the killing, Colman flew to Fresno. Defendant remained in Sacramento for a few days. While Colman was in Fresno, defendant told her on the telephone that he had had a friend call the hospital and learned that Rose was in \u201creally bad condition,\u201d that he \u201cdidn\u2019t remember a lot of things\u201d and \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk or anything.\u201d Defendant visited Colman in Fresno and then they rejoined each other in Los Angeles; from there they drove to Salt Lake City, where Colman had relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">On December 14, 1977, a warrant issued for defendant\u2019s arrest; an arrest warrant was also apparently issued for Colman. Colman later left Salt Lake City, apparently in the latter part of December 1977, and returned to Sacramento in the car defendant had borrowed from his brother-in-law. Defendant arranged to have Colman stay at a motel in Sacramento and await contact from a friend of his. Instead, Colman took the opportunity to turn herself in, despite defendant\u2019s expression of confidence that \u201cshe would not be dumb enough to cross him or call anybody about it, because if he was in a situation where he couldn\u2019t get to [her], that he would have somebody else that could.\u201d Defendant was apprehended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on March 17, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The defense was alibi. Defendant primarily sought to persuade the jury that Colman and Rose and defendant\u2019s erstwhile friend, Richard Graybill (who aided police in their efforts to apprehend defendant) were involved in a conspiracy to fix defendant with the blame for the shootings, which were purportedly committed by Graybill and Colman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rose\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, it was suggested in argument, might be explained by a desire to avoid the necessity of paying off the $25,000 note or to avoid criminal liability for shooting Bartulis himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Defendant admitted knowing Rose and Bartulis. With regard to the cocaine deal, he testified that he set up a meeting for certain individuals interested in consummating such a transaction, using a large barbecue party as a \u201cfront.\u201d These individuals, including Rose and Bartulis, had expressed interest in using defendant\u2019s South American \u201csource\u201d and his \u201ctransportation supplies\u201d to bring cocaine into the country. Defendant did not attend the meeting himself, but understood that there were six shares taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>investors at $35,000 a share. Richard Graybill was the \u201ccoordinator\u201d of the deal, though the money was ultimately to go to defendant\u2019s source in Peru (whom he refused to name). After putting up $10,000 in \u201cfront money,\u201d Rose and Bartulis had difficulties and were unable to come up with the remaining $25,000. Because he had vouched for them as being \u201ccool\u201d to the other participants (essentially \u201cco-signed for them\u201d) defendant agreed to lend them $25,000 in exchange for a promissory note and the use of their contractor\u2019s license. When Rose indicated to defendant that part of their business difficulties stemmed from the unavailability of insulation, defendant told Rose that Graybill was in the building supply business in Fresno and put Rose in contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Defendant testified that he was at a business meeting and then a disco in Sacramento on the night the killing took place, though he refused to divulge the identities of the people at the meeting. Graybill came to the motel in Sacramento where defendant\u2019s meeting was taking place and asked to borrow his (defendant\u2019s) mother\u2019s car. Defendant lent him the car and, at about midnight, drove Graybill\u2019s Cadillac from the motel to a disco and then home. Graybill, accompanied by Colman, returned the Toyota with a damaged windshield between 4:30 and 5 in the morning, without explanation. Defendant had the windshield replaced the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">When he left the state after the killing, defendant, assertedly, had already agreed with Graybill to \u201cride the beef for him,\u201d since defendant \u201chad been to prison\u201d and Graybill \u201chad some very bad enemies\u201d from his prior narcotics dealings. They decided defendant should go to Salt Lake City to \u201clet things cool off\u201d while Graybill negotiated on his behalf to give himself up and plead guilty to second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">I. <em>Guilt Phase.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We first review the claims of error relating to the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">A. <em>Defendant waived the public defender\u2019s conflict of interest in representing him at his preliminary hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Defendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing, since his counsel, the public defender, had represented Colman at an earlier stage. This contention is without merit. The record reflects that defendant knowingly waived any objection to the conflict, <em>after </em>his motion for substitution was granted based on his own assertion that a conflict existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>At a hearing on his motion for a continuance of the preliminary hearing on June 21, 1979, the public defender represented to the court, for the record, in defendant\u2019s presence, that he had explained to defendant that his office had represented Colman, and that \u201cwe did talk to her [and] ... did have information from her.\u201d He had further explained, he said, that defendant could, if he wished, \u201cdeclare a conflict,\u201d but that defendant had indicated that he wished to be represented by the public defender \u201cat these stages of the proceeding.\u201d Counsel noted that defendant might still wish to \u201cdeclare\u201d a conflict before the preliminary hearing. Defense counsel\u2019s remarks later in the hearing indicate that defendant had been encouraged to and expected to retain other counsel in the future. Defendant remained silent throughout. He was indeed represented by the public defender at the preliminary hearing. Later, however, on October 30, 1979, defendant moved for substitution of his counsel, declaring as his reason the public defender\u2019s conflict of interest. The next day, the court heard the motion and relieved the public defender and appointed new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Defendant\u2019s silence in the courtroom on June 21, 1979, in the face of his counsel\u2019s representations, does not show an unambiguous and knowledgeable waiver of the right to effective counsel as contemplated by our decisions; an effective waiver, under these decisions, must be express and understanding, in response to specific advice by the court regarding the potential conflict and the right to new counsel if a conflict exists. (See <em>In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 878-879 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 765, <em>11A </em>[73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106, 34 A.L.R.3d 454]; <em>In re Johnson </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 325, 334-335 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Angulo </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 514, 518-519 [148 Cal.Rptr. 517]; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(5th Cir. 1975) 517 F.2d 272, 278 [requiring advice as to dangers of conflict and a narrative response by defendant].) However, defendant\u2019s failure to move to set aside the information under section 995, after his substitution motion was granted, bars him from raising on appeal his challenge to the conduct of the preliminary hearing. (\u00a7 996; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pompa-Ortiz </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 519, 529 [165 Cal.Rptr. 851, 612 P.2d 941]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 866, 870 [64 Cal.Rptr. 313, 434 P.2d 609]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Palacios </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 566, 571-572 [68 Cal.Rptr. 137].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942] for the proposition that \u201c[sjection 996 does not express an absolute mandate, however, and cases may arise in which a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>may properly attack his indictment for the first time on appeal. Section 996, like the general rule that errors not objected to at trial cannot be raised on appeal, rests upon waiver. Thus, if the circumstances do not show a waiver, a defendant may challenge the indictment on appeal even though he did not raise the point by a motion under Penal Code section 995.\u201d ( {Id., at p. 23.) The circumstances of this case, however, <em>do </em>show a waiver. Although defendant points to the fact that his motion for substitution of counsel was in propria persona and attempts to suggest that the conflict of interest was \u201coverlooked by the experienced trial counsel and the court itself,\u201d the record establishes beyond any doubt that, after his motion for substitution was granted on October 31, 1979, defendant knew the public defender had a conflict of interest owing to its prior representation of Colman, which entitled defendant to new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In his reply brief, defendant argues that the record does not show whether he was informed that in the course of its representation of Colman, the public defender\u2019s office entered into an agreement with Colman whereby she told the prosecution her story under an informal testimonial immunity arrangement. This possibility makes no difference. What was important to defendant\u2019s understanding of the conflict was the knowledge that Colman had given information about the crimes to her public defender in the context of an attorney-client relationship, and this posed possible problems in cross-examining Colman.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Though it may seem anomalous to conclude that there was no valid waiver of defendant\u2019s right to counsel by his silence at the June 21, 1979, hearing, but that his silence <em>after </em>the substitution motion was granted did constitute a waiver, the record shows that at the latter time defendant knew all that the requirement of an express waiver is designed to assure that he knows. Accordingly, no reason appears for interfering with the normal operation of section 996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">B. <em>The trial court\u2019s error in refusing to order disclosure of any agreement between the prosecution and Colman \u2019s attorney in exchange for Colman \u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">During the trial, defense counsel stated on several occasions that the prosecution and Colman\u2019s attorney had entered into some agreement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Colman\u2019s testimony. The trial court concluded that any agreement not communicated to Colman was irrelevant to the issue of her credibility. Thus, it prevented defense counsel from examining the prosecution and Colman\u2019s attorney about the existence and terms of any such agreement. Defendant contends that this ruling deprived him of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The prosecution has a duty to disclose all substantial material evidence favorable to an accused, including evidence relating to the credibility of a material witness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruthford </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 399, 406 [121 Cal.Rptr. 261, 534 P.2d 1341].) \u201c[Suppression of substantial material evidence bearing on the credibility of a key prosecution witness is a denial of due process . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 408.) Since a witness\u2019s credibility depends heavily on his motives for testifying, the prosecution must disclose to the defense and jury any inducements made to a prosecution witness to testify and must also correct any false or misleading testimony by the witness relating to any inducements. <em>(Giglio </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 150, 154-155 [31 L.Ed.2d 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 763]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Westmoreland </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 32, 43 [129 Cal.Rptr. 554].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In this case, according to the testimony of Colman\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor, no inducements to testify were communicated by them to Col-man in any manner, except that her attorney advised Colman to \u201chave faith and trust\u201d in her (the attorney) and testify. Colman testified that she had been charged along with defendant in connection with the murder, but was now free on her own recognizance. She confirmed that her preliminary hearing had been continued numerous times. Colman further indicated in response to cross-examination that she was \u201cexpecting that they would take into consideration that [she was] willing to cooperate.\u201d (In fact, the charges against Colman were dismissed shortly after the trial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Therefore, the present case differs from <em>People </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, supra, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 32, in which the prosecutor knew that the witness\u2019s response to a question whether he had been offered the opportunity to plead guilty to a lesser offense was false. Despite his knowledge of the witness\u2019s misleading answer, the prosecutor in <em>Westmoreland </em>remained silent and failed to correct the testimony. Here, there was no attempt to mislead the jury into believing that the witness testified without any expectation of leniency. Col-man candidly admitted that she expected her willingness to cooperate to be taken into consideration by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">However, defendant argues that the prosecution and a witness\u2019s attorney should not be permitted to insulate a witness from any agreement entered into in exchange for testimony. He insists that some notion of the possibility of leniency was communicated to Colman. Furthermore, her ignorance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>possible conditions on its availability might have induced her to testify in a manner calculated to satisfy the prosecution. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 438 [116 Cal.Rptr. 133] [use of witnesses\u2019 testimony violated due process when the testimony was given in exchange for an immunity that was conditioned on the testimony\u2019s consistency with the witnesses\u2019 pretrial statements to police].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">We find the reasoning of the <em>Westmoreland </em>court persuasive on this issue: \u201c[Wjhenever the <em>district attorney </em>offers one of several persons accused of complicity in the same criminal offense the opportunity to plead guilty to a lesser offense or <em>engages in discussions with his attorney concerning the possibility of </em>leniency, and later the accused appears as a prosecution witness at the trial of the other defendants, both the witness and the district attorney are subject to the accusation that offers of leniency were made in exchange for favorable testimony. If such a charge is made at the trial, and if there is a conflict in the evidence on this issue, it is up to the jury to resolve the conflict and then to judge the credibility of the prosecution witness accordingly. To hold otherwise would lead to post-trial charges and countercharges <em>and, what is worse, could pave the way to the type of double talk which ultimately could lead to the circumvention of the disclosure mies which have evolved to insure a fair trial to all persons accused of crime.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>58 Cal.App.3d at p. 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In context, it seems clear that the \u201cdouble talk\u201d condemned by the <em>Westmoreland </em>court referred to precisely the same kind of allegedly \u201cundisclosed\u201d promise to a witness\u2019s attorney at issue in this case. As <em>Westmoreland </em>recognized, unless the defense attorney is permitted to discover the contents of the arrangement between the prosecutor and the witness\u2019s attorney, the defense cannot effectively challenge the witness\u2019s statement that his testimony is not being given in return for favored treatment. If disclosure is not required, the defense will never learn whether the terms of the agreement itself suggest that the witness must have had some inkling of the arrangement\u2014as would be the case, for example, if the promised leniency were dependent on the witness\u2019 testifying in a particular manner.  Consequently, when an accomplice testifies for the prosecution, full disclosure of any agreement affecting the witness is required to ensure that the jury has a complete picture of the factors affecting the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Moreover, the \u201ctactical\u201d device of keeping a prospective prosecution witness in the dark about the terms of a deal that has been negotiated with his counsel suffers from an even more fundamental flaw than an impairment of defense discovery rights. As Justice Fleming pointed out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brunner </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 908, 913-914 [108 Cal.Rptr. 501], one of the principal dangers that arises whenever an accomplice testifies in exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>for an expected benefit is that the \u201cwitness may be so influenced by his hopes and fears that he will promise to testify to anything desired by the prosecution in order to obtain a grant of immunity. Because the satisfaction of the prosecution is the [witness\u2019s] ticket to freedom, the prosecutor, by dangling the promise of immunity, can put the words he wishes into the [witness\u2019s] mouth. This danger is especially grave when the witness knows he is expected to give particular testimony, absent which he will not receive the promised immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">It is true that, unlike <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 438, a witness who is kept ignorant of the terms of the bargain that his attorney has arranged with the district attorney does not know for certain that favorable treatment depends on his testifying in a particular manner. At the same time, however, unless the witness is informed both of the terms of the agreement <em>and that his receipt of the benefit cannot be denied so long as he testifies fully and truthfully at the criminal trial, </em>the witness cannot help but believe that his own treatment will depend on how \u201cwell\u201d he does\u2014from the prosecution\u2019s perspective\u2014in testifying against his accomplice. Consequently, a prosecutor\u2019s insistence that the witness not be informed of the terms of the bargain has the inevitable tendency to lead the witness to color his testimony, so as to receive the most favorable treatment from the prosecutor. No legitimate public interest is served by such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Accordingly, the trial court erred when it held that any agreement not communicated to Colman was irrelevant to the issue of her credibility. The defense counsel is entitled to discover the terms of any agreement for lenient treatment negotiated on behalf of a prosecution witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Despite the errors in this regard, however, reversal of the judgment of guilt or the special circumstance finding is not warranted. When the prosecution fails to disclose evidence favorable to the defense, \u201c[t]he defendant must make a showing of substantial materiality and even after this showing is made reversal is not required if the prosecution establishes [that] the failure to disclose was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruthford, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 409.) While the defense should have been given a fuller opportunity to discover evidence that might have permitted a stronger attack on Colman\u2019s credibility, closing arguments on both sides demonstrate that the jury was made well aware of the possible impact of Colman\u2019s expectation of leniency on her credibility. The prosecutor noted that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t make any sense if she came in here and testified unless she were hoping for consideration . . . that\u2019s why she\u2019s testifying.\u201d Defense counsel emphatically brought home to the jury the potentially coercive effect of the prosecution\u2019s tactics, declaring that \u201cthey\u2019re holding a murder charge over her head to testify, and she\u2019s singing like a bird, the tune that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>call.\u201d In this situation, the jury could properly assess Colman\u2019s credibility even without testimony on a specific agreement between her attorney and the prosecution. (Cf., <em>In re Wright </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 788, 816 [144 Cal.Rptr. 535] [possible perjury by prosecution witness would not have had such an effect on witness\u2019 credibility as to make a verdict of not guilty reasonably probable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Furthermore, the evidence against defendant with respect to the charged offense was overwhelming. While Colman was an important prosecution witness, the key witness against defendant was Ronald Rose, the victim who miraculously survived despite being shot, set on fire and run over by a car. Given Rose\u2019s testimony, and the considerable amount of corroborating evidence, the jury verdict as to guilt and the special circumstance allegation was virtually a foregone conclusion. Under the circumstances, there was no prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">C. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in preventing the defense from eliciting from Colman her \u201cprofessional background\u201d as a prostitute and that her reason for flying to Fresno was to ply her trade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Prior to Colman\u2019s testimony, the prosecution made a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent the defense from eliciting from Colman on cross-examination testimony regarding alleged acts of prostitution, and to exclude certain nude photographs of Colman, apparently taken by defendant. Defendant\u2019s counsel opposed the motion, contending that evidence of prostitution was admissible both \u201cto show the financial situation of the parties who are cohabiting\u201d and \u201cto show her specific reason for going to Fresno,\u201d and supporting admission of the photographs to show \u201cwhat the relationship was\u201d and, possibly, suggest a motive for bias. The trial court granted the motion <em>in limine. </em>The trial court subsequently reaffirmed both rulings when the defense claimed that the prosecution had \u201copened [the] door\u201d for admission of such evidence by once characterizing Colman\u2019s relationship with defendant as \u201cliving as man and wife,\u201d which, defense counsel complained, \u201cleaves the image of a rather platonic, nice situation, which is certainly a long way from the truth of what the pictures very aptly represent.\u201d Defendant now claims that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting cross-examination of Colman with regard to her activities as a prostitute. (He does not challenge the ruling excluding the nude photographs.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Permitting the defense to elicit testimony from Colman that she engaged in acts of prostitution had an obvious potential for embarrassing or unfairly discrediting her. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 765.) The degrading impact of such questions has long been recognized. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Crandall </em>(1899) 125 Cal. 129, 134 [57 P. 785].) The question faced by the trial court, then, in decid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>was whether the patent prejudicial impact of permitting such questioning was substantially outweighed by its probative value. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) In opposing the motion, the defense suggested two ways in which Colman\u2019s testimony might be relevant. Defense counsel first suggested that it might be admissible to show the \u201cfinancial situation\u201d of Colman and defendant, but he quickly disclaimed any intention of \u201cgo[ing] into [Colman\u2019s] life history.\u201d Defense counsel limited himself to trying to persuade the court that he should be allowed to elicit from Colman expected testimony that her purpose in flying to Fresno on the day of the murder was \u201cto work the streets\u201d there in order to preclude any inference by the jury that she went to Fresno pursuant to any common scheme with defendant. The prosecutor pointed out, however, that he had already indicated in his opening statement that Colman\u2019s presence in Fresno to meet defendant was a \u201cpure coincidence.\u201d (In his closing argument, the prosecutor reiterated that it was a \u201csheer coincidence\u201d that Colman was there.) On this basis, the trial court concluded that, if the testimony were relevant at all, its prejudicial effect would \u201cfar outweigh\u201d its probative value, and, accordingly, it granted the motion <em>in limine </em>under Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Defendant\u2019s present claims that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding inquiry regarding Colman\u2019s activities as a prostitute and her purpose in going to Fresno, are based on reasons other than those advanced by defense counsel at trial. He suggests that the defense should have been allowed to elicit Colman\u2019s testimony as to why she went to Fresno in an attempt to show that she did <em>not </em>actually go there for purposes of prostitution\u2014but rather, to meet defendant or, as suggested in defendant\u2019s reply brief, to meet Richard Graybill. Defendant\u2019s argument appears to rest on nothing more than a speculative possibility that, by vigorous cross-examination, defense counsel might have succeeded in breaking down the witness and exposing her story of going to Fresno for prostitution as a fabrication. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Alfaro </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 414 [132 Cal.Rptr. 356].) Certainly, it appears from the arguments on the motion that defense counsel had not thought of trying to break down Colman\u2019s story (nor is it apparent from the record how he learned what her testimony would be); indeed, he seemed perfectly satisfied with that explanation and only wanted the jury to hear it too. In any event, if it was possible that Colman had another reason for going to Fresno that could have been discovered by cross-examination, defendant failed to apprise the court of this, and, in light of the obvious prejudicial effect of the expected testimony, the trial court cannot be faulted for excluding it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 328, 344-345 [11 Cal.Rptr; 65, 359 P.2d 433]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 722, 728-731 [87 Cal.Rptr. 554]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lancaster </em>(1957) 148 Cal.App.2d 187, 195-196 [306 P.2d 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The second possible ground suggested by defendant for admitting testimony about Colman\u2019s acts of prostitution must be rejected for the same reason. He asserts that if her activities as a prostitute were directed by defendant, acting as her \u201cpimp,\u201d then that might have been a motive for giving biased, untruthful testimony, since \u201cmany prostitutes have strong feelings of resentment and outrage against [their pimps].\u201d This ground of asserted relevance rests upon a speculative generalization about the relationships between prostitutes and pimps, which the trial court might well have deemed insufficient by itself to outweigh the certain prejudice that would result from admission of the testimony. Defense counsel\u2019s momentary flirtation with the notion that the testimony might be relevant to show the \u201cfinancial situation\u201d of Colman and defendant was surely not the same thing as suggesting that Colman had a motive for bias in her \u201coutrage\u201d against defendant. It is noteworthy in this regard that, though the prosecutor stressed that the People did not \u201cseek to prohibit the defendant from any relevant testimony regarding their relationship ...\u201d and the court stated, in essence, that its assessment of the relevancy of Colman\u2019s activities might change depending upon defendant\u2019s other testimony, the defense made no attempt to show by defendant\u2019s testimony that the relationship between him and Colman before and at the time of the killing was anything but amicable. Moreover, since the ground asserted for admitting the testimony was not raised before the trial court, it may not be considered now for the first time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d at pp. 729-731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">D. <em>The trial court did not err in admitting a tape recording of a telephone conversation between defendant and Richard Graybill while defendant was a fugitive.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Defendant contends that the admission into evidence of a tape recording of a telephone conversation between him and Richard Graybill, while defendant was a fugitive, violated his constitutional rights to freedom from unreasonable searches, privacy, and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The facts were established at a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. (\u00a7 1538.5.) In December 1977, Graybill learned that Colman (who had lived with Graybill until she moved in with defendant) was being sought by police. A short time later, he received a telephone call from defendant. Graybill informed the Madera County Sheriff\u2019s office of the call, and agreed to try to lure defendant into a position where he could be captured. Defendant remained in telephone contact with Graybill, sometimes calling him at home and other times by prearrangement at various public telephones (in order to minimize the chances of the calls being traced). In January 1978, upon the advice of a detective, Graybill recorded a telephone conversation with defendant on his tape recorder. The tape (which was also Graybill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>property) was subsequently admitted (in its entirety, by stipulation) against defendant at the trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Defendant asks us to reconsider our holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 349 [105 Cal.Rptr. 138, 503 P.2d 594], which upheld against a Fourth Amendment challenge the admissibility of tape recordings of conversations, on the telephone and in-person, surreptitiously made by associates of the defendant who were acting at the direction of law enforcement officers. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 358-361; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>White </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 745 [28 L.Ed.2d 453, 91 S.Ct. 1122]; <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 293 [17 L.Ed.2d 374, 87 S.Ct. 408].) He criticizes as \u201cunpersuasive\u201d the rationale of cases, including <em>Murphy, </em>upholding the admissibility of such recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Murphy </em>and the United States Supreme Court decisions upon which it relies emphasize that a defendant has no constitutionally protected expectation that his confidant will not reveal a conversation to the police, and the recording merely corroborates and assures the accuracy of the confidant\u2019s later testimony. Defendant counters that, as a practical matter, it is the witness\u2019s testimony which merely \u201csupplements\u201d the tape in most such situations. He points out that, without the tape, Graybill\u2019s credibility might have been such that the jury would not have believed this recounting of the conversation. An apt response to this argument is contained in Justice Harlan\u2019s opinion in <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 427 [10 L.Ed.2d 462, 83 S.Ct. 1381]: \u201cStripped to its essentials, petitioner\u2019s argument amounts to saying that he has a constitutional right to rely on possible flaws in the agent\u2019s memory, or to challenge the agent\u2019s credibility without being beset by corroborating evidence that is not susceptible to impeachment. For no other argument can justify excluding an accurate version of a conversation that the agent could testify to from memory. We think the risk that petitioner took in offering a bribe to [the agent] fairly included the risk that the offer would be accurately reproduced in court, whether by faultless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>memory or mechanical recording.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 439 [10 L.Ed.2d at p. 471], fn. omitted; quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">More fundamentally, defendant objects to characterizing as merely a case of misplaced trust a situation in which an associate of the accused acts at the direction of the state. The point made in <em>Murphy </em>and the federal precedent is that the accused in such a case is not a passive victim of a government intrusion into his zone of privacy; rather, he has, by taking a companion into his confidence, in essence extended his zone of privacy to embrace the companion as to any confidences so disclosed. There is simply no constitutional principle that prohibits the recipient of a confidence from breaching the trust reposed in him not to disclose it to others, including the police. <em>Murphy </em>is in accord with settled federal statutory law (tit. HI, Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (2)(c) and (d)), as well as applicable California statutes. (\u00a7 633.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We see no reason to reconsider it now.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finally, defendant objects to admission of the tape recording under the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Hitch </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 641 [117 Cal.Rptr. 9, 527 P.2d 361]. The recording begins in midsentence and Graybill admitted that he did not turn the tape recorder on until perhaps 15 seconds after the conversation had begun. Defendant contends, by analogy to <em>Hitch, </em>that the deputy who advised Graybill to record the telephone conversation had a duty to assure that the entire conversation was recorded, so that the recording could not be used in a misleading manner. Defendant failed to make this objection in the trial court, though, so it may not now be considered by us. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 106, 114-115 [104 Cal.Rptr. 217, 501 P.2d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">E. <em>The trial court correctly admitted photographs of the murder victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Defendant complains that certain photographs depicting the charred remains of the murder victim in the Ranchero were unduly gruesome and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>should not have been admitted in light of their limited probative value. (7a) \u201cAdmission of photos of victims lies within the discretion of the trial court unless their probative value is clearly outweighed by their prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 233, 253 [162 Cal.Rptr. 1, 605 P.2d 830].) Here the trial court clearly understood its duty to weigh the photographs\u2019 relevance against their tendency to prejudice the jury (compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772, 801 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892]), and it excluded one of the four proffered photographs of the victim in the Ranchero as cumulative. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Haskett </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 859 [180 Cal.Rptr. 640, 640 P.2d 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 553, 576-577 [180 Cal.Rptr. 266, 639 P.2d 908].) We have reviewed the remaining photos and find no abuse of discretion in their admission. Defendant contends that they would have been cumulative on the issue of malice to the undisputed testimony regarding the burning of the Ranchero and the victim\u2019s body. Even so assuming, we cannot say the trial court was wrong in apparently accepting the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the position of the body in the vehicle might help the jury evaluate testimony that defendant extracted the victims\u2019 wallets and searched them and a potential issue of self-defense based on the presence of Rose\u2019s revolver in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">F. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting defendant to be impeached by three prior felony convictions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court improperly allowed him to be impeached by the unduly cumulative admission into evidence of all <em>three </em>of his prior burglary convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The trial court properly applied the test for admission of prior convictions for impeachment outlined in <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at pages 451-454, and did not abuse its discretion in admitting the three essentially contemporaneous convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The first factor under <em>Beagle </em>is whether a conviction reflects adversely on the defendant\u2019s honesty or veracity. It is settled that burglaries accomplished with larcenous intent (as reflected in defendant\u2019s conviction records) may be used for this purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 717, 721 [183 Cal.Rptr. 414]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keating </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 172, 180 [173 Cal.Rptr. 286].) Further, we think the fact that defendant was convicted for burglaries in three counties more or less contemporaneously is suggestive of an ambitious premeditated dishonesty of which the court could reasonably conclude the jury ought to be aware. The other factors also point to admission. The convictions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201ccomparatively recent,\u201d in 1976, while the instant offenses took place in 1977. There is no suggestion that the burglaries involved the sort of assaultive conduct that was central to the instant offenses, that is, they do not \u201cpresent a close analogy to the current charges.\u201d And, finally, defendant was not deterred from testifying, so the fourth factor identified in <em>Beagle </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We are not insensitive to the concern expressed by defendant that the admission of all three burglary convictions may well have depicted him to the jury as an \u201chabitual offender.\u201d However, defendant did not object on the ground of cumulativeness, arguing only about the dissimilarity of the prior offenses to the present offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 114-115.) Consequently, we are unprepared to say that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting all three prior burglary convictions, especially in view of the contemporaneity of the convictions, which might be seen as shedding light on the extent of defendant\u2019s dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">G. <em>The trial court correctly ruled that defendant had no right to refuse to testify regarding assertedly \u201ccollateral\u201d areas during cross-examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. During cross-examination, the prosecutor interrogated him extensively on his alibi and on his version of the circumstances surrounding the cocaine deal in which Bartulis and Rose were alleged participants. He refused to answer a number of these questions, initially on Fifth Amendment grounds and later, after the trial court informed him that the privilege did not apply, on the ground that he would be killed if he answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Conceding that he waived most of the protection of the privilege in taking the stand <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saddler </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 671, 679 [156 Cal.Rptr. 871, 597 P.2d 130]), defendant nonetheless contends that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination was not properly limited to matters covered in the direct examination, but ranged far afield. Defendant refused to answer questions about the bank account into which he deposited $6,200 on the day Rose gave him $10,000 (which defendant testified he passed on to Graybill through Colman); the identities of associates with whom he met in Sacramento on the night of the murder; the source of the cocaine supply; its manner of delivery; the identity of the smuggler; the origin of the men in pinstripe suits that defendant testified provided \u201csecurity\u201d for his barbecue; whether the men carried machine guns; the identities of other attendees of the party; whether the cocaine transaction was completed; the means of delivery of the cocaine; its means of distribution; the location of the promissory note from Rose between the date of the murder and its delivery to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>defense counsel; and the extent of defendant\u2019s personal knowledge of how murder \u201ccontracts\u201d are put out.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Examination of the questions which defendant refused to answer discloses that virtually all of them sought detailed information about the grandiose cocaine deal that defendant testified to on direct, with an evident and proper purpose of exposing the story as an extravagant fabrication. Other questions also came within the broad scope of permissible cross-examination. The prosecution certainly had a right to inquire about the identities of participants in the meeting in Sacramento, who were supposed witnesses to defendant\u2019s alibi. Similarly, since there was a dispute between Rose\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the reasons for Rose\u2019s issuance of the $25,000 promissory note, testimony concerning what happened to it while it was in defendant\u2019s custody was relevant. Finally, the question regarding defendant\u2019s knowledge concerning death \u201ccontracts\u201d properly arose out of Colman\u2019s testimony that defendant told her that if Rose lived, \u201che would have to try to get a contract on him.\u201d \u201cAlthough the permissible scope of cross-examination in California is restricted to the scope of the direct examination (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 772, subd. (d), 761; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 1204), when a defendant \u2018takes the stand and makes a general denial of the crime with which he is charged the permissible scope of cross-examination is very wide.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(pPeople </em>v. <em>Saddler, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">H. <em>The erroneous instruction on the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a robbery was harmless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court gave the jury an erroneous instruction on the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a robbery (former \u00a7 190.2, subd. (c)(3)(i)), which failed to apprise the jury of all the facts that must be proved to establish the existence of the special circumstance. At the time of the killing, on December 7, 1977, section 190.2 provided: \u201cThe penalty for a defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be death or confinement in the state prison for life without possibility of parole in any case in which one or more of the following special circumstances has been charged and specially found ... to be true . ...

The trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part: \u201cIf you find the Defendant in this case guilty of murder of the first degree, you must then determine if the murder was committed under the following special circumstance: the murder was willful, deliberate and premeditated, and was committed during the commission or attempted commission of robbery in violation of Section 211, Penal Code, [ft A special circumstance must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, [t] If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether a special circumstance is true, it is your duty to find that it is not true.

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 721 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tanner </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 948, 956-957 [157 P.2d 465] [erroneous instruction that intent did not matter for crime of arson was harmless since first degree murder verdicts showed finding of specific intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that the special circumstance which it was supposed to find true or untrue was that \u201c[t]he murder was <em>willful, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>deliberate and premeditated and </em>was committed during the commission or attempted commission of robbery. ...\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant urges, however, that the subsequent instruction\u2014\u201c[t]o find the special circumstance ... it must be proved: that the murder was committed while the Defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of a robbery\u201d\u2014might have suggested to the jury that is all that must be proved, resulting in a perceived conflict in the instructions. No real occasion for confusion existed, though. The latter instruction does not say that <em>only </em>the fact that the murder was committed in the commission of a robbery must be proved; it merely reiterates the need for a finding that the murder was so committed. In finding that the special circumstance allegation was true, the jury specifically found \u201cthat the murder of Bruce P. Bartulis was willfull <em>[sic], </em>deliberate and premeditated, and was personally committed by [defendant] during the commission or attempted commission of the crime of robbery. ...\u201d Moreover, the prosecutor in his. closing argument accurately informed the jury in this regard: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to determine whether the special circumstance is true or not. The special circumstance alleged is that the murder was willful, deliberate and premeditated, and it was committed during the commission or attempted commission of a robbery, [f] Now, in order, of course, to find that special circumstance, you have to find what is called premeditation. . . .\u201d It is ordinarily presumed that jurors are intelligent persons capable of understanding and correlating all jury instructions that are given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 312, 323 [152 Cal.Rptr. 407]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Romo </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 976, 990 [121 Cal.Rptr. 684].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Defendant is correct, though, when he complains that the jury was not apprised by the instructions that the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a robbery also required proof that (1) he was \u201cpersonally present\u201d when the murder was committed, (2) he \u201cphysically aided or committed\u201d the killing, and (3) he did so \u201cwith intent to cause death.\u201d Nevertheless, this error was harmless because the jury necessarily resolved each of the foregoing issues adversely to defendant. As previously noted, the jury\u2019s special finding expressly states that the murder \u201cwas personally committed by [defendant] . . .,\u201d and the jury also found to be true the allegation that defendant \u201cpersonally use[d] a firearm\u201d in the commission of the murder. These findings necessarily reflect the jury\u2019s conclusions that defendant was personally present during the commission of the murder and that he \u201cphysically aided or committed\u201d the killing. Despite the lack of a proper instruction, the jury\u2019s explicit findings that defendant \u201cpersonally committed\u201d the murder, and used a firearm in doing so, render fantastic, not merely \u201cimprobable,\u201d defendant\u2019s speculation that the jury might have believed that Colman did the shooting and defendant was merely a passive accomplice who armed himself later during the asportation of the victims\u2019 wallets.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Finally, though the first degree murder verdict does not by itself show that the jury determined that defendant intended to cause Bartulis\u2019s death, since it may have been based on a felony-murder theory, the special finding that the murder was willful, deliberate and premeditated does. Those terms were defined in the instructions on first degree murder:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThe word \u2018willful,\u2019 as used in this instruction, means intentional, [f] The word \u2018deliberate\u2019 means formed or arrived at or determined upon as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations for and against the proposed course of action. The word \u2018premeditated\u2019 means considered beforehand, [t] If you find that the killing was preceded and accompanied by a clear, deliberate <em>intent </em>on the part of the defendant <em>to kill, </em>which was the result of deliberation and premeditation, so that it must have been formed upon pre-existing reflection and not under a sudden heat of passion or other condition precluding the idea of deliberation, it is murder of the first degree, [f] The law does not undertake to measure in units of time the length of the period during which the thought must be pondered before it can ripen into an <em>intent to kill </em>which is truly deliberate and premeditated. The time will vary with different individuals and under varying circumstances, [f] The true test is not the duration of time, but rather the extent of the reflection. A cold, calculated judgment and decision may be arrived at in a short period of time, but a mere unconsidered and rash impulse, even though it includes an <em>intent to kill, </em>is not such deliberation and premeditation as will fix an unlawful killing as murder of the first degree, [f] To constitute a deliberate and premeditated killing, the slayer must weigh and consider the question of killing and the reasons for and against such a choice and, having in mind the consequences, he decides to and does kill.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, to commit a \u201cwillful\u201d murder, the actor must possess an intent to kill. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 716, 730 [336 P.2d 492].) It has been held that a determination that a killing was deliberate and premeditated is not the equivalent of a finding of malice. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 731-733; <em>People </em>v. <em>Horn </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 290, 298 [115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 722.) Here, though, we are concerned only with intent to kill. That a jury verdict of willful, deliberate and premeditated murder necessarily embraces such a finding was recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>\u201cIn <em>Sedeno, </em>the trial court erred in failing to give an instruction <em>sua sponte </em>on involuntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity. (10 Cal.3d at p. 720.) Such an instruction would have required the jury to specifically determine whether the accused had acted without an intent to kill and malice. <em>The error was harmless as to the question of the intent to kill because the jury had received instructions on second degree murder without </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>an intent to kill and had specifically and necessarily rejected that theory by returning a verdict of first degree murder. (Id., </em>at p. 721.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 335-336 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">I. <em>The trial court was not required to instruct the jury sua sponte concerning the \u201cincidental robbery\u201d theory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Defendant argues that the special circumstance finding must be reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury sua sponte that the special circumstance of murder \u201cin the commission of a robbery\u201d does not apply to a murder accompanied by an \u201cincidental\u201d robbery, as was held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 61-62 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]. It was not conceivable in this case that the jury might have found evidence to support a finding that the victims\u2019 wallets were taken only to hide their identities. On the facts presented here, <em>Green\u2019s </em>\u201cincidental robbery\u201d doctrine cannot properly be characterized as a general principle of law \u201cclosely and openly connected with the facts before the court\u201d from which a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to instruct could arise. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 52 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279]; <em>People </em>v. <em>St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 720.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">J. <em>Defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Defendant raises several unrelated contentions concerning claimed ineffectiveness of his trial counsel during the guilt phase of his trial.  To establish constitutionally inadequate representation, defendant must show that defense counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and that (1) counsel\u2019s acts or omissions resulted in the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense, or (2) it is reasonably probable that a determination more favorable to defendant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s failings. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].) He has not succeeded in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">We have already concluded that the error in instructing the jury on the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a robbery was harmless. Consequently, defense counsel\u2019s failure to bring the correct instruction to the attention of the court did not withdraw a potentially meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Anticipating a holding that his failure to move to set aside the information under section 995 barred his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>preliminary hearing (as indeed we have concluded, <em>ante), </em>defendant contends that reasonably competent counsel would have made such a motion. The record shows that defendant, with knowledge of the conflict, chose to be represented at the preliminary hearing by the public defender, and sought other counsel only at a later stage. Even assuming that defendant\u2019s silence at the June 21, 1979, hearing is not sufficient to constitute an effective waiver, we cannot exclude the strong possibility that counsel simply decided as a tactical matter that nothing would be served by going through another preliminary hearing (particularly in light of the strength of the evidence upon which defendant was held to answer) and bringing about further delay of the trial.  Where tactical considerations might explain counsel\u2019s omission, and the record does not illuminate its basis, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is more appropriately made in a petition for habeas corpus. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Defendant also challenges his counsel\u2019s asserted failure to adequately cross-examine Colman. He suggests that his counsel demonstrated his incompetence by failing to suggest to the court valid grounds for admitting testimony about Colman\u2019s activities as a prostitute and her reasons for going to Fresno on the day of the murder. Again, it appears that tactical reasons might well explain the attorney\u2019s decision not to assert the grounds now suggested. For example, a tactical reason certainly can be inferred for counsel\u2019s failure to seek to extract from Colman testimony that her real reason for flying to Fresno was to meet defendant pursuant to a plan to kill Rose and Bartulis. In any case, evidentiary objections (and, inferentially, arguments in support of the admission of evidence) are generally matters of tactics properly reviewed by habeas corpus. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 814, 828 [163 Cal.Rptr. 601, 608 P.2d 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">During his cross-examination of Colman, defense counsel asked her if she were testifying with the knowledge that everything she said that day could be used against her. Colman responded that she knew her attorney would be there to represent her when she went to court in February. Defendant now claims that his counsel should have asked Colman whether she gave the prosecution a statement under an informal agreement that \u201cthe statement could never be used against her and in the prosecution of her,\u201d notwithstanding her testimony at the preliminary hearing that she had not been promised any immunity by the district attorney\u2019s office. Defendant\u2019s argument appears to be based on a faulty premise that if Colman repeated essentially the same story at the trial as she did in her statement for the prosecutor, the trial testimony could not be used against her. There is nothing in the record to support such an interpretation of the purported agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Finally, defendant contends that competent counsel would have cross-examined Colman more closely about what might have happened to the gasoline can which she and Rose testified defendant emptied over the Ranchero and its occupants. Colman testified that she did not see it when defendant returned to the car, and no can was found at the scene. Moreover, the gas cap of the Ranchero was found lying in the trunk, leading investigators at first to believe that the gasoline poured into the passenger compartment might have been siphoned out of the gas tank. A siphon hose was evidently found in the vicinity. Again, the record does not preclude a possible tactical reason for not pursuing the question further. By accepting Colman\u2019s lack of an explanation for the discrepancy, defense counsel preserved an occasion for argument to the jury against the credibility of Colman\u2019s story and in favor of the existence of some alternative explanation: \u201cGas cans don\u2019t disappear. . . . [|] [The police] did find that the siphoning hose and the gas cap of the pickup was off. I expect that the siphon hose is very significant and the gas cap being off, and those are an indication of the premeditation by whom ever [sic] was there.\u201d In any event, it is impossible to determine from the record whether any further cross-examination might have extracted any different testimony from the witness, who claimed, simply, that she did not know what happened to the can. Again, the proper avenue for reviewing this claim of inadequacy, based on matters of tactical choice, is habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">II. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">At the penalty phase proceedings, all of the evidence introduced by the prosecution related to the aggravating factor of other \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d (Former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Richard Graybill, defendant\u2019s former friend, testified about three incidents that allegedly fell into this category: (1) the \u201cCW murder plan,\u201d a plan fabricated by the police and Graybill, in which defendant ostensibly agreed to return to California to kill a person who had \u201csnitched\u201d on Graybill in the past; (2) the \u201csolder plan,\u201d in which defendant told Graybill that he intended to obtain money some time in the future by borrowing $45,000 against a load of solder he had stolen and thereafter killing the people who loaned him the money; and (3) the \u201cindustrial burglary plan,\u201d in which defendant asked Graybill to help him rob a supply shop and told Graybill that he\u2014defendant\u2014would kill the security guard. In addition to Graybill\u2019s testimony, the prosecution introduced two letters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>written by defendant from the Utah jail, in which defendant ostensibly solicited criminal acts against (1) an accountant and (2) four witnesses who were to testify for the prosecution in this case, including defendant\u2019s own mother. The prosecution presented no other evidence at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In his closing argument, the prosecution stated that the jury should consider, as aggravating factors warranting imposition of the death penalty, both this evidence of other criminal activity and \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the present offense.\u201d (Former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (a).) Defense counsel presented no evidence in mitigation, but asked the jury to re-examine its verdict of guilt and give defendant the benefit of any lingering reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">A. <em>The trial court had no duty to give a clarifying instruction on what is meant by \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the present offense\u201d as a factor in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Former section 190.3 provided that \u201c[i]n determining the penalty the trier of fact shall take into account any of the following factors if relevant: [t] (a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The jury was accordingly instructed: \u201cIn determining which penalty is to be imposed on the Defendant, you shall consider all the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial of this case, except as you may hereafter be instructed, [f] You shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the following factors if applicable: [if] (a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor assured the jurors that \u201cit\u2019s perfectly proper and appropriate for you to consider the horrible manner in which the Defendant executed one victim and tried to execute the other.\u201d A little later, he told them: \u201cNow with regard to the circumstances of the crime, as I say, you can consider the manner in which the crime was executed; you can consider the fact that the Defendant shot down a 26 year old victim, Bruce Bartulis, who was in the prime of his life. You can consider that the man\u2019s life was snuffed out for money . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Without citation to authority, defendant suggests that the trial court had a sua sponte duty to give the instruction on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the present offense\u201d a clarifying gloss to inform the jury that its penalty determination must not be based on facts that are \u201ccommon to all homicides.\u201d Permitting the consideration of such factors, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>argues, may result in \u201cirrational\u201d decisions based on the jurors\u2019 \u201cemotional reaction to the facts of death alone.\u201d The jury\u2019s decision, defendant insists, \u201cshould be made on the basis of the unique characteristics of the case before the court . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument reveals a basic misunderstanding of the process by which the law supposes the jury will determine the appropriate penalty. The factors outlined in the death penalty statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> guide the jury in answering basically two questions: (1) is it the \u201ccommunity\u2019s belief that [the crime is] so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death?\u201d (quoting <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 153, 184 [49 L.Ed.2d 859, 880-881, 96 S.Ct. 2909] (plur. opn.)); and (2) if so, are there nevertheless \u201caspects of the defendant\u2019s character and record . . . which may call for a less severe penalty?\u201d (Gillers, <em>Deciding Who Dies </em>(1980) 129 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1, 56, quoting <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 605 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 990, 98 S.Ct. 2954] (plur. opn.).) While the penalty determination is ultimately dependent on the individual circumstances of a case, the fact that the defendant\u2019s crime was to kill another human being cannot comprehensibly be withdrawn from the jury\u2019s consideration in determining how \u201cgrievous an affront to humanity\u201d was committed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">If defendant is arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s comments encouraged the jury to give <em>inordinate </em>attention to the victim\u2019s youth and the \u201chorrible manner in which the Defendant executed one victim and tried to execute the other,\u201d then that argument, too, must be rejected on the ground that defendant waived any such objection by his failure to object and seek an admonition when the comments were made. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 34.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>B. <em>The trial court erred in failing to give a reasonable doubt instruction in regard to evidence of other \u201ccriminal activity. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the trial court instructed the jury that, in determining which penalty to impose on the defendant, it should take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors enumerated in former section 190.3, including subdivision (b): \u201cThe presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The criminal activity to be considered under this provision does not include \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding . . . .\u201d (Former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The jurors were not told that they could consider evidence of other criminal activity (former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (b)) only if they found \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that defendant had engaged in such activity. This omission was error under <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 53-55, 60-62 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanworth </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 820, 840-841 [80 Cal.Rptr. 49, 457 P.2d 889]. Before determining the scope and effect of this error, however, it is necessary to determine what conduct the jury may have considered to be other \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under former section 190.3, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">C. <em>Other \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under former section 190.3, subdivision (b) must demonstrate a violation of a penal statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">In his closing argument at the penalty phase, the prosecutor presented those aggravating factors set forth in former section 190.3 that provided the basis on which he believed the jury should return a verdict of death. With respect to former section 190.3, subdivision (b), the prosecutor told the jury it could consider evidence of three separate incidents of other \u201ccriminal activity.\u201d These incidents and the evidence upon which they were based are: (1) the tape recording of a telephone conversation between defendant and Graybill, admitted during the guilt phase, in which defendant agreed to execute a plan with Graybill to murder \u201cCW\u201d (Don Hunsucker) (hereafter \u201cCW Murder Plan\u201d); (2) the penalty phase testimony of Graybill that defendant asked him to help in the burglary of a supply shop in San Jose, during which defendant would kill the security guard (\u201cIndustrial Burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Plan\u201d); and (3) a letter introduced at the penalty phase, written to Bill Moyes by defendant while in a Utah jail awaiting extradition to California, in which defendant sought the apparent murder of four people who later testified against defendant at trial\u2014Rose, Graybill, Colman, and defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In addition to these three incidents, the prosecutor introduced at the penalty phase evidence of: (1) another letter written by defendant while in the Utah jail awaiting extradition to California, in which defendant asked Bill Moyes to abduct, beat, and threaten \u201cthe accountant\u201d to obtain $15,000; and (2) the testimony of Graybill that defendant told him that upon release from prison he would use a truck load of solder he had stolen as collateral for a $45,000 loan and would then kill the people who lent him the money (\u201cSolder Plan\u201d). While the prosecutor did not argue to the jury that these incidents constituted evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> he had previously served notice on defendant that this was the basis upon which he would introduce this penalty phase evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Defendant contends that many of these alleged activities could not properly be considered by the jury as evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b), because the evidence presented did not demonstrate the commission of actual crimes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In answer, respondent asserts that evidence of other criminal activity need not amount to an actual crime in order to be admissible as an aggravating factor. Accordingly, we first address the issue of what conduct may properly be considered as other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Defendant relies on the language and implicit rulings of past cases, decided before the enactment of the 1977 death penalty statute, to support his contention that evidence of other \u201ccriminal activity\u201d admitted pursuant to former section 190.3, subdivision (b), must demonstrate the actual commission of a crime. The People argue that the Legislature\u2019s choice of ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>minology\u2014specifically, \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d rather than \u201cprior crimes\u201d or \u201cother crimes,\u201d the language of relevant past judicial decisions\u2014demonstrates that evidence of other criminal activity need not amount to the actual commission of a crime to be admissible as an aggravating factor under the statute. The legislative history does not support respondent\u2019s position that the Legislature intended to depart from the precedent of these decisions. Rather, as we discuss below, the history of former section 190.3, subdivision (b), demonstrates only that the Legislature\u2019s choice of terms was intended to be sufficiently broad to include crimes for which the defendant has not been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">It was not until 1957 that separate procedures were established to determine guilt and penalty in death penalty cases. (Stats. 1957, ch. 1968, \u00a7 2, pp. 3509-3510, amending \u00a7 190, as amended by the Amendments to the Codes 1873-1874, ch. 508, pp. 457-458.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Former section 190.1, establishing these procedures, provided in relevant part: \u201cEvidence may be presented at the further proceedings on the issue of penalty, of the circumstances surrounding the crime, of the defendant\u2019s background and history, and of any facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">This provision was interpreted to include defendant\u2019s \u201cprior\u201d or \u201cother\u201d crimes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d at pp. 647-648 [\u201cother crimes\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robillard </em>(1960) 55 Cal.2d 88, 100 [10 Cal.Rptr. 167, 358 P.2d 295, 83 A.L.R.2d 1086] [\u201cprior crimes\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bentley </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 458, 460-461 [24 Cal.Rptr. 685, 374 P.2d 645] [\u201ccrimes\u201d committed after the murder]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Pike </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 70, 94-95 [22 Cal.Rptr. 664, 372 P.2d 656] [\u201canother offense\u201d] [each of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>cases basing this interpretation of former \u00a7 190.1 on the language of the statute]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 105, 129 [32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412] [\u201cprior crimes\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at pp. 143-144 [\u201ccriminal acts\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 805, 815-817 [48 Cal.Rptr. 371, 409 P.2d 211] [\u201cother crimes,\u201d \u201cother offenses\u201d]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Tolbert </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 790, 813 [76 Cal.Rptr. 445, 452 P.2d 661] [\u201cprior crimes\u201d] [each case relying on the above-noted prior case law interpreting section 190.1 to permit proof of other crimes during the penalty phase].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury about the elements of all of the crimes that may have been introduced at the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tahl </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 719, 736-738 [56 Cal.Rptr. 318, 423 P.2d 246]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nye </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 356, 367 [78 Cal.Rptr. 467, 455 P.2d 395].) However, the court had to instruct the jury that it could \u201cconsider evidence of other crimes only when the commission of such other crimes is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanworth, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 840; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>McClellan </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 793, 804-805 [80 Cal.Rptr. 31, 457 P.2d 871], and cases cited therein.) Evidence of other crimes could be introduced in the penalty phase even if the defendant had not been convicted of the crimes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 815-816; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ketchel </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 503, 542 [30 Cal.Rptr. 538, 381 P.2d 394]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tahl, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 734; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nye, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 366-367.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In the absence of a waiver (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d at pp. 646-647), the admissibility of evidence of other crimes uniformly depended on whether the evidence was competent and relevant (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry, supra, 61 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 144-145, and cases cited therein), and, most significant to the present discussion, sufficient to demonstrate the commission of actual crimes. While the latter requirement was never articulated as such, it is clear from the evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d deemed properly admissible under former section 190.1.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Evidence that defendant planned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>or intended to commit another crime was held admissible under former section 190.1 as relevant to defendant\u2019s state of mind, demonstrating a lack of guilt or remorse, but not as evidence of another crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tahl, supra, 65 </em>Cal.2d at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The status and procedures of the California death penalty subsequently underwent substantial change, most of which is irrelevant to our present discussion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In 1977, the Legislature enacted the death penalty statute which is under our present scrutiny. (Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7\u00a7 4-14, pp. 1256-1262.) The 1977 statute provides in relevant part: \u201c\u00a7 190.3. If the defendant has been found guilty of murder in the first degree, and a special circumstance has been charged and found to be true ... the trier of fact shall determine whether the penalty shall be death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. In the proceedings on the question of penalty, evidence may be presented by both the people and the defendant as to any matter relevant to aggravation, mitigation, and sentence, including, but not limited to, the nature and circumstances of the present offense, the presence or absence of other criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or which involved the expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>or implied threat to use force or violence, and the defendant\u2019s character, background, history, mental condition and physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u201cHowever, no evidence shall be admitted regarding other criminal activity by the defendant which did not involve the use or attempted use of force or violence or which did not involve the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence. As used in this section, criminal activity does not require a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201cHowever, in no event shall evidence of prior criminal activity be admitted for an oifense for which the defendant was prosecuted and was acquitted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201cIn determining the penalty the trier of fact shall take into account any of the following factors if relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201c(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">This language underwent several changes prior to its adoption. Respondent contends that these changes evidence a legislative intent that former section 190.3 \u201cgo beyond\u201d former section 190.1 to include what might not amount to a crime per se. We disagree. Rather, these changes merely demonstrate a legislative intent to include crimes for which a capital defendant has not been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">As originally drafted, section 190.3 of Senate Bill No. 155 (introduced in the Senate on Jan. 19, 1977) provided in pertinent part: \u201cIn the proceedings on the question of penalty, evidence may be presented by either the people or the defendant as to . . . the defendant\u2019s <em>prior criminal activity </em>.... In determining the penalty the trier of fact shall take into account any of the following factors if relevant: (a) The presence or absence of <em>prior criminal activity </em>by the defendant.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The section was subsequently amended in the Senate, on March 10, 1977, to render admissible only evidence of defendant\u2019s <em>\u201cprior convictions </em>. . . <em>for felonies </em>involving the use or threat of force or violence against the person of another.\u201d (Italics added.) As amended March 24, 1977, this evidence was characterized as <em>\u201csignificant prior criminal </em>activity,\u201d defined as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>\u201ca conviction for a felony </em>involving the use or threat of force or violence against the person of another.\u201d (Italics added.) The bill passed the Senate in this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Following the passage of Senate Bill No. 155 in the Senate, section 190.3 was amended in the Assembly to delete any requirement of a felony conviction and to refer simply to <em>\u201ccriminal activity </em>by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence.\u201d (As amended Apr. 13, 1977, italics added.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The section was subsequently amended in the Assembly, on April 28, 1977, to add: \u201cHowever, no evidence shall be admitted regarding <em>other criminal activity </em>by the defendant which did not involve the use or attempted use of force or violence or which did not involve the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence. As used in this section, <em>criminal activity does not require a conviction. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) On May 9, 1977, the Assembly finally amended section 190.3 to add: \u201cHowever, in no event shall evidence of prior criminal activity be admitted for an offense for which the defendant was prosecuted and was acquitted.\u201d Senate Bill No. 155 was passed in this form on August 11, 1977, over the Governor\u2019s veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">This legislative history demonstrates a refinement of the term \u201ccriminal activity\u201d to include more than a capital defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, but not so broad as to include offenses for which the defendant has been acquitted.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While the term is clearly meant to include misdemeanor as well as felony offenses involving the use or attempted use of force or violence, or the expressed or implied threat to use force or violence, the legislative history does not indicate an intent to include nonoffenses for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>which the defendant could not even be tried. The inclusion of nonoffenses as \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under former section 190.3 would allow the prosecutor unfettered discretion in the selection of evidence to present to the penalty phase jury and would render superfluous the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201ccriminal\u201d to modify \u201cactivity.\u201d Accordingly, the only reasonable interpretation is that the statute limits admissibility to evidence that demonstrates the commission of an actual crime, a requirement easily verified under the definitional guidelines established by legislative bodies in this and other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Significantly, this court has consistently applied this interpretation not only in pre-1977 cases, but also in our review of death penalty cases tried under the 1977 legislation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 935, 962-963 [171 Cal.Rptr. 679, 623 P.2d 240] [possession of deadly weapons by jail inmates; violation of \u00a7 4574]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 868, 885 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813] [arson for hire; \u00a7 653f]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782] [1978 death penalty initiative; attempted robbery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We therefore conclude that evidence of other criminal activity introduced in the penalty phase pursuant to former section 190.3, subdivision (b), must be limited to evidence of conduct that demonstrates the commission of an actual crime, specifically, the violation of a penal statute.  In light of this conclusion, we consider whether a number of incidents, relied on by the prosecution as instances of \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d properly qualified as an aggravating factor under former section 190.3, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(a) <em>\u201cCW Murder Plan.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The prosecutor told the jury that it could consider as evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b), \u201cthe matter of the CW Murder Plan. That is to say, the plan whereby Mr. Gray-bill, acting in cooperation with law enforcement people, attempted to lure the defendant back to California by a scheme wherein the defendant was planning to go ahead and murder someone.\u201d As noted earlier, this evidence of a feigned scheme in which Graybill asked defendant to murder \u201cCW\u201d was contained in a tape recording of a telephone conversation between defendant and Graybill, admitted during the guilt phase at defendant\u2019s request. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The People concede \u201cthat since Graybill was a feigned accomplice or the equivalent, appellant\u2019s agreeing to come to Fresno to commit a murder for Graybill, a murder neither Graybill nor the authorities were going to permit, did not constitute a crime.\u201d Respondent correctly interprets applicable law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the \u201cCW Murder Plan\u201d was improperly presented to the jury as evidence of other criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">(b) <em>\u201cThe Solder Plan.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">At the penalty phase, Graybill testified that defendant had told him that upon his release from prison he would use a truck load of solder he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>had stolen as collateral for a $45,000 loan and would then kill the people who had lent him the money. The prosecutor had previously notified defendant and the trial court that he would introduce evidence of this plan at the penalty phase as evidence of other criminal activity. (Former \u00a7 190.3, subd. (b).) In his argument to the jury, however, the prosecutor appeared to be arguing that this plan was part of the circumstances of the instant crime. (Former \u00a7 190.3,.subd. (a).)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">The prosecution\u2019s assertion that this evidence comes within the circumstances of the instant crime is simply without factual support in the record. Moreover, as respondent concedes, this evidence fails to demonstrate the commission of a crime. Accordingly, the evidence was inadmissible under either subdivision (a) or subdivision (b) of former section 190.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">(c) <em>\u201cIndustrial Burglary Plan. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Graybill testified at the penalty phase that defendant had asked him to help in the burglary of a supply shop in San Jose. When Graybill expressed concern about the shop\u2019s security guard, defendant said not to worry, that he would kill the guard. The prosecutor told the jury that it could consider as evidence of other criminal activity under former section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>190.3, subdivision (b) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s indication to Mr. Graybill that during a proposed burglary in San Jose, he would remove the potential danger of the security guard by killing him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">While not characterized as such by the prosecution, this evidence could constitute a criminal solicitation in violation of section 653f, subdivision (a) and/or (b),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>if </em>\u201cproved by the testimony of two witnesses, or of one witness and corroborating circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 653f, subd. (d).) However, since Graybill\u2019s testimony alone is insufficient to prove the commission of the crime, this evidence was improperly admitted by the trial court, and therefore improperly considered by the penalty jury, as evidence of other criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">(d) <em>Letter seeking apparent murder of four prosecution witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The prosecution introduced into evidence at the penalty phase copies of two letters (exhibits 19 and 20) written by defendant while incarcerated in the county jail in Salt Lake City, Utah before being returned to California to face trial. Attached to the copies of the letters were photocopies of the envelopes in which the original letters had been contained, bearing defendant\u2019s name and address as the return addressee. Since defendant had been classified as an escape risk and a dangerous inmate, his letters were opened by a jail employee and photocopied before being mailed. Only one of the two letters presented during the penalty phase was explicitly characterized by the prosecutor to the jury as evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b). This letter (exhibit 20) contained apparent solicitations of the murders of Rose, Colman, Graybill, and defendant\u2019s mother, Barbara Hollingshead. Solicitation of murder is a crime under section 653f, subdivision (b), even though the solicitation is made by a person who is outside of California (\u00a7 778b). Defendant\u2019s second letter (exhibit 19), discussed below, though not explicitly referred to by the prosecution as evidence of other criminal activity, solicited the kidnaping, beating, and extortion of \u201cthe accountant\u201d in violation of section 653f, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Section 653f, subdivision (d), requires that a criminal solicitation be \u201cproved by the testimony of two witnesses, or of one witness and corroborating circumstances.\u201d This requirement \u201chas been regarded as requiring at least one witness who gives \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018direct\u2019 evidence of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that are incompatible with innocence, and corroborating evidence of circumstances which, independent of the direct evidence, tend to show guilt. [Citations.]\u201d (2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 856, p. 803.) Here, the testimony of the only witness, an employee of the Utah County jail, was limited to establishing the authenticity of the copies of defendant\u2019s letters.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The authenticity of a writing is a preliminary fact that must be proven before proffered evidence is admissible. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 403, subd. (a)(3).) Since the county jail employee\u2019s testimony was solely limited to establishing this preliminary fact, it cannot constitute positive or direct evidence of defendant\u2019s alleged criminal solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In this case, however, we do have \u201cthe testimony ... of one witness and corroborating circumstances\u201d as required by section 653f, subdivision (d). The introduction of defendant\u2019s jailhouse letter (exhibit 20) effectively rendered defendant \u201ca witness\u201d within the meaning of the provision, who provided direct \u201ctestimony\u201d about the crime of solicitation. The purpose of section 653f, subdivision (d) is to guard against convictions for solicitation based on the testimony of one person who may have suspect motives. The danger that the statute guards against is not present, however, when the accused himself provides evidence of the alleged crime and independent circumstances corroborate this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Examination of the letter\u2019s content shows that defendant\u2019s letter on its face is somewhat ambiguous as to the conduct it solicits.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>external factors serve as sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the letter constituted a solicitation of murder. At the time the letter was written, defendant was incarcerated in a Utah jail awaiting extradition to California to stand trial for the attempted murder of Ron Rose and the murder of Rose\u2019s friend and companion, Bruce Bartulis. Since Rose would be able to testify about these events in detail, defendant had a strong motive to kill Rose, more specifically, to succeed at what he had previously attempted. As Colman testified, defendant had expressed an intent to \u201cget a contract\u201d on Rose if he lived. Defendant also had strong motives for killing the others listed in his letter. Graybill, a long-time friend of defendant, and Colman, defendant\u2019s girlfriend and companion at the time of the murders, had both decided to cooperate with law enforcement and the prosecution in an effort to arrest and convict defendant. As previously noted, Colman cooperated with law enforcement notwithstanding defendant\u2019s statement to her that \u201cshe would not be dumb enough to cross him . . . because if he was in a situation where he couldn\u2019t get to [her], that he would have somebody else that could.\u201d Finally, Hollingshead, defendant\u2019s mother, was at home when defendant arrived with Colman after the commission of the crimes. Perhaps as defendant feared, Hollingshead\u2019s testimony at trial contradicted that of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It was therefore clearly in defendant\u2019s interests to eliminate all of these witnesses before they had a chance to testify at his trial. The fact that the proposed victims were all potential witnesses against defendant in the imminent capital trial, combined with the evidence of defendant\u2019s earlier threats against some of these same witnesses, provided adequate independent corroboration to satisfy the requirements of section 653f, subdivision (d). In light of defendant\u2019s apparent motive, the letter\u2019s directions to \u201cknock out,\u201d \u201cnail\u201d and \u201cblast\u201d these witnesses tend to support the conclusion that defendant was seeking their murder. This evidence also supports the requisite element of specific intent to kill or express malice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bottger </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 974, 980-982 [191 Cal.Rptr. 408]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 465, 472 [120 Cal.Rptr. 840].)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We next address defendant\u2019s challenges to the admissibility of both his letters. Defendant first asserts that the letters are inadmissible because (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the copies of both letters were so illegible that they could not properly be authenticated (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1400) and therefore did not constitute relevant evidence (id., \u00a7 350); and (2) alternatively, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 412) by his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the admission of his letters on the ground that their illegibility caused their probative value to be outweighed by their prejudicial effect. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352). These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In determining the admissibility of a \u201cwriting\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 250) based on its legibility, the writing \u201cneed not be completely intelligible ... as long as enough is intelligible to be relevant without creating an inference of speculation or unfairness.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Demery </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 548, 559 [163 Cal.Rptr. 814].)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">While reproduction of defendant\u2019s letters rendered some words in both letters illegible, these words are few and their meaning not critical for understanding either letter. All of the pages of each letter are included, and defendant\u2019s handwriting is generally legible. We do not consider it significant that the trial court clerk, in reading the letters aloud to the jury, omitted certain words that appear to be legible, since copies of both letters were distributed to each juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In exhibit 20, the illegible words are primarily limited to the physical descriptions of Colman, Rose and Rose\u2019s wife. No illegible words are contained in the letter\u2019s references to Graybill or Hollingshead, nor are any contained in the directions about what is to be done to each proposed victim. (See fn. 30, <em>ante.) </em>The illegible words constitute less than 2 percent of exhibit 20. (Cf., <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephens </em>(1953) 117 Cal.App.2d 653, 661 [256 P.2d 1033] [approximately 50 percent of tape recordings unintelligible].)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Similarly, the illegible words in exhibit 19 constitute less than 10 percent of the letter. While some of these words are contained in defendant\u2019s directions about what to do to the \u201caccountant,\u201d their omission does not affect the letter\u2019s clear meaning. (See fn. 32, <em>post.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">We therefore conclude that the illegible aspects of exhibits 19 and 20 did not create any \u201cinference of speculation or unfairness\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Demery, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at p. 559) that may have adversely affected their authentication under Evidence Code section 1400. Nor did their admission unduly prejudice defendant under Evidence Code section 352 as a result of their illegibility. In failing to object to the admission of the letters on this ground, defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not deny defendant effective assistance of counsel.

This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Under Penal Code section 2600, California prisoners retain the civil rights of free persons, including the right to privacy, except to the extent that restrictions are necessary to insure institutional security and public safety. <em>(De Lancie </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 865, 868 [183 Cal.Rptr. 866, 647 P.2d 142]; cf. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Loggins </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 907, 915 [187 Cal.Rptr. 575, 654 P.2d 758] [right to freedom of press]; <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 396, 413 [40 L.Ed.2d 224, 240, 94 S.Ct. 1800] [under federal constitutional law, censorship of prisoner mail justified only if it furthers an important governmental interest (such as security, order, and rehabilitation) unrelated to suppression of expression].) Defendant contends that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy concerning letters sent from prison, relying heavily on the Court of Appeal opinion in <em>De Lancie </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>which was superseded by our subsequent opinion (31 Cal.3d 865) in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In <em>De Lancie, </em>we held that, in the absence of any security interest, conversations between pretrial detainees and visitors could not be monitored solely to gather evidence to be used at their upcoming trials. We expressly declined to base our decision on federal or state constitutional grounds, finding it sufficient to rest it on section 2600, which provides generally that a person imprisoned in state prison may \u201cbe deprived of . . . only such rights, as is necessary in order to provide for the reasonable security of the institution . . . and ... the public,\u201d and section 2601, which designates certain retained civil rights, including the right \u201c[t]o have personal visits.\u201d We reasoned that pretrial detainees are entitled to at least the same protection. (31 Cal.3d at pp. 871-872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">However, the statutes upon which <em>De Lancie </em>rests, and article I, section 1 of the California Constitution, were inapplicable to the Utah jail in which defendant was detained. Defendant suggests that evidence obtained in a manner that would not be proper in California, even if valid under federal law and the law of the state where it was obtained, should be excluded in California courts. We rejected the same argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 640 [159 Cal.Rptr. 818, 602 P.2d 738], holding that the purposes of the exclusionary rule would not be served by such an extraterritorial application. Since the seizure in that case was legal where it occurred, and no California law enforcement personnel participated, exclusion would have \u201cserve[d] no deterrent effect in either jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 656.) Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>did the other accepted purpose of the rule, the preservation of judicial integrity, require exclusion, since \u201c[ujnlike the situation that arises when a seizure contrary to California law occurs in this state, the venture [by police in the other state] [was] not lawless, and the government [was] therefore not profiting from illegal conduct or acting as a law-breaker.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Defendant\u2019s claim that the inspection of his letters violated the Fourth Amendment is also without merit. Defendant\u2019s letters were inspected for security reasons pursuant to regulations that authorized such inspections without notice to the prisoner if there were affirmative indications that he was dangerous or presented an escape risk. Such inspections are generally acknowledged to be reasonable. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hearst </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 563 F.2d 1331, 1345; compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinkley </em>(D.C. Cir. 1982) 672 F.2d 115, 130-132 [inspection by guard of prisoners\u2019 papers violated Fourth Amendment because not in accord with established institutional practice, and excerpts that captured the guard\u2019s attention did not suggest a threat of criminal activity or implicate \u201cspecial considerations peculiar to the penal system\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">However, defendant claims that jail officials lulled him into a \u201csense of pseudoprivacy,\u201d by informing that his outgoing mail would not be inspected. Accordingly, defendant argues that the official\u2019s subsequent intrusion violated the Fourth Amendment under our holding in <em>North </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 301 [104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d 1305, 57 A.L.R.3d 155],</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">It is undisputed that defendant was not informed that his outgoing mail was being read. Moreover, the manual prepared for inmates by one of the jail officials, which summarized the jail rules and regulations, apparently stated without qualification that outgoing mail was not monitored. However, the regulations apparently provide that, while outgoing mail is not ordinarily monitored, it may be inspected (without notice to the detainee) if there is some affirmative indication that the inmate presents a security problem. The jail administrative officer explained that defendant\u2019s letters were read because he was classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d and an \u201cescape risk.\u201d Furthermore, he testified that defendant asked him whether outgoing mail was monitored, and the administrator replied that \u201cunder normal conditions\u201d it was not. The administrator nonetheless reminded defendant of an occasion when the jail captain had testified in a homicide case regarding the contents of a letter written from jail. For a definitive answer to his question, the officer referred defendant \u201cto his rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The officer\u2019s answers to defendant\u2019s questions about the monitoring of mail were ambiguous. Although he told defendant that mail was not nor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>mally monitored, he also told him that it was sometimes read. However, if defendant actually followed up on the officer\u2019s referral \u201cto his rules and regulations,\u201d then it appears he may have been aware of the jail\u2019s policy to monitor a detainee\u2019s mail if there were affirmative indications that the detainee presented a security problem. We therefore decline to characterize the jail administrator\u2019s statements to the defendant as giving rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. Additionally, although the prisoner\u2019s manual apparently did misrepresent the jail\u2019s monitoring policy, there was no evidence adduced at the suppression hearing that defendant ever perused, or even was aware of, the manual. Therefore, we cannot conclude that defendant had a reasonable subjective expectation that the contents of his letters would remain private.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Notwithstanding the lack of any evidence of bad faith or that the inspections exceeded in any way their proper scope under the regulations, defendant asks us to characterize the inspections as unreasonable because he may have been inadvertently misled to believe that his letters would pass unread. <em>North, </em>upon which defendant relies, did not so hold; there we condemned a \u201cdeliberate\u201d scheme to \u201csecretly exploit [] marital confidences ... for the sole purpose of gathering possibly incriminating evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) (8 Cal.3d at p. 312; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jardine </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 907, 914 [172 Cal.Rptr. 408]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Suttle </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 572, 578 [153 Cal.Rptr. 409].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Once the properly limited inspections revealed defendant\u2019s attempt to have witnesses killed, there was nothing to prevent the prosecutor (who was appropriately informed of the contents of the letters) from introducing them at the penalty phase of defendant\u2019s trial. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Baumgarten, supra, </em>517 F.2d at p. 1028 [\u201cplain view\u201d doctrine justified copying and dissemination of letter to law enforcement officials after proper \u201cscanning\u201d of letter]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinkley, supra, </em>672 F.2d at p. 131.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>\n                   Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor properly relied on defendant\u2019s letter (exhibit 20) as evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">(e) <em>Letter soliciting extortion of the \u201caccountant. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">As mentioned earlier, exhibit 19 consists of a letter written by defendant while in a Utah jail awaiting extradition to California.

However, this letter does not comply with section 653f, subdivision (d), which requires that criminal solicitation be proved \u201cby . . . one witness and corroborating circumstances. \u201d While introduction of the letter rendered defendant a \u201cwitness,\u201d there is no corroborating evidence of circumstances independent of the defendant\u2019s direct evidence that tend to show guilt. Therefore, exhibit 19 was improperly admitted in the penalty phase as evidence of other criminal activity.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">D. <em>The jury\u2019s improper consideration of several incidents of alleged other criminal activity, and the trial court\u2019s failure to give a reasonable doubt instruction, were prejudicial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"> We have identified two significant errors in the penalty phase: (1) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it could not consider evidence of other criminal activity under former section 190.3, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>division (b), unless it found that such activity had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 53-55, 60-62); and (2) the prosecution\u2019s erroneous reliance, as instances of such \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d on a number of incidents\u2014the \u201cCW Murder Plan,\u201d the \u201cSolder Plan,\u201d the \u201cIndustrial Burglary Plan,\u201d and defendant\u2019s letter soliciting extortion of the accountant\u2014which were not actual crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In determining prejudice and reversible error at the penalty phase, we agree with Justice Broussard\u2019s refinement of the traditional test in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 21. The lead opinion abides by the traditional test that \u2018\u201cany substantial error occurring during the penalty phase of the trial . . . must be deemed to have been prejudicial. \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 105, 135-137 [32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 412]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hines </em>[(1964)] 61 Cal.2d [164], 168-170 [37 Cal.Rptr. 622, 390 P.2d 398].)\u201d (33 Cal.3d at p. 54.) In his concurring opinion, Justice Broussard suggested that \u201csubstantiality\u201d \u201cshould imply a careful consideration whether there is any reasonable possibility that an error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Applying this test to the facts of this case, we conclude that reversal of the penalty judgment is required.  First, we consider the trial court\u2019s failure to confine \u201ccriminal activities\u201d to evidence demonstrating the commission of an actual crime. If former section 190.3, subdivision (b) had been properly interpreted and applied, Graybill\u2019s entire testimony at the penalty phase would have been excluded because the evidence with respect to all three incidents related by Graybill\u2014the \u201cCW Murder Plan,\u201d the \u201csolder plan,\u201d and the \u201cIndustrial Burglary Plan\u201d\u2014was insufficient to establish any actual, completed crime. The prosecution relied on these incidents at the penalty phase to demonstrate defendant\u2019s alleged casual attitude toward killing and his readiness to resort to murder in a variety of settings. This is precisely the sort of evidence that is likely to have a significant impact on the jury\u2019s evaluation of whether defendant should live or die. Since there is a reasonable possibility that the improper introduction of the alleged misconduct affected the jury\u2019s verdict, its admission must be deemed prejudicial to the defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 54-55 [plur. opn.], p. 63 [cone. opn. by Broussard, J.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The second error\u2014the failure to give a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction-tainted <em>all </em>of the other crimes that could properly have been considered by the jury as aggravating factors under section 190.3, subdivision (b). Past cases have frequently found such error prejudicial (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>McClellan, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 793, 806) and that would appear to be particularly true in this case in which the prosecution\u2019s penalty phase evidence rested so heavily on other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Respondent suggests that the evidence of the most serious \u201cother crime\u201d presented at the penalty phase \u2014 the letter written by defendant from a Utah prison apparently soliciting the murder of four prosecution witnesses \u2014 was so overwhelming that the absence of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d instruction could not possibly have made a difference. It is not clear, however, that such an error may properly be dismissed on that basis.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Moreover, in this case there was evidence in the record from which defense counsel could have argued that there was at least a reasonable doubt whether defendant was actually serious about going through with the elaborately constructed scheme set forth in the letter. In response to defense counsel\u2019s questioning on cross-examination, Graybill, the prosecution witness who was defendant\u2019s long time friend, acknowledged that defendant was \u201cprone to exaggerating these things [i.e., planned criminal acts].\u201d In addition, the jailhouse letter itself indicates that the described plan was not to be immediately put into operation but instead that Moyes, the recipient of the letter, was to bring it with him when he visited defendant in jail. Although the jury could, of course, have nonetheless found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was in fact guilty of solicitation of murder, defendant was at least entitled to have the issue properly presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The judgment is affirmed on the guilt phase and finding of special circumstances.

Its extremely thorough treatment of defendant\u2019s many contentions, particularly those relating to the penalty phase, somehow obscures the fact that this is one of the clearest cases for reversal of the penalty that we have come across: (1) the trial court admitted a good deal of prejudicial evidence which did not qualify as \u201ccriminal activity\u201d under the Penal Code; and (2) with respect to those incidents which did qualify, it failed to give a reasonable doubt instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>As long as I have pen in hand, I feel compelled to express the hope that if, at a retrial, the prosecution again elects to offer the letters from the Utah jail, it will do a better job of proving the \u201crules and regulations\u201d which supposedly apprised defendant that outgoing mail was subject to being monitored.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-11\">All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The defense also presented a witness who testified that on the day after the killing he saw a person unlike defendant in appearance boasting about having been involved in or having seen a shootout in Fairmead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Section 996 provides: \u201cIf the motion to set aside the indictment or information is not made, the defendant is precluded from afterwards taking the objections mentioned in Section 995.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We note that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barboza </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 375 [173 Cal.Rptr. 458, 627 P.2d 188], we held as a \u201cjudicially declared rule of criminal procedure\u201d that the contract between Madera County and the public defender there, which in essence deducted funds spent for other appointed counsel from the public defender\u2019s budget, \u201ccontained] inherent and irreconcilable conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 381.)

This determination, which can be routinely made based on the pretrial notice by the prosecution of the evidence it intends to introduce in aggravation (\u00a7 190.3), should be made out of the presence and hearing of the jury. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 402.) Once the trial court has determined what evidence is properly admissible as other criminal activity (id., \u00a7 310), \u201cthe prosecution should request an instruction enumerating the particular other crimes which the jury may consider as aggravating circumstances in determining penalty. . . .

Whether such other criminal activity has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt is then a question of fact for the jury. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 312.)

This rule recognizes that a defendant for tactical considerations may not want the penalty phase instructions overloaded with a series of lengthy instructions on the elements of alleged other crimes, perhaps because he fears that such instructions could result in the jury placing undue significance on such other crimes rather than on the central question of whether he should live or die. In light of these tactical considerations, a defendant who has not requested an instruction on the elements of the alleged other crimes may not complain on appeal.

In all other situations than the penalty trial the evidence must be narrowed down to the point at issue; in the penalty trial the evidence consists of a multitude of matters pertaining to the defendant [citation] enabling the jury to make \u2018a complete and careful analysis of that person as a human composite of emotional, psychological and genetic factors.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 168-169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Justice Tobriner continued: \u201cThe isolation of the determination of the death penalty in the penalty trial, which proceeds without standards for the jury, plus the expansion of the subject-matter of the trial, which has reached very wide margins, gives to the jury an undefined task performed upon a showing of a mass of material. As a result the jury may conceivably rest the death penalty upon any piece of introduced data or any one factor in this welter of matter. The precise point which prompts the penalty in the mind of any one juror is not known to us and may not even be known to him. Yet this dark ignorance must be compounded 12 times and deepened even further by the recognition that any particular factor may influence any two jurors in precisely the opposite manner, [f] We cannot determine if <em>other </em>evidence before the jury would neutralize the impact of an error and uphold a verdict. Such factors as the grotesque nature of the crime, the certainty of guilt, or the arrogant behavior of the defendant may conceivably have assured the death penalty despite any error. Yet who can say that these very factors might not have demonstrated to a particular juror that a defendant, although legally sane, acted under the demands of some inner compulsion and should not die? We are unable to ascertain whether an error which is not purely insubstantial would cause a different result; we lack the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>criteria for objective judgment, [t] Thus, <em>any </em>such substantial error in the penalty trial may have affected the result; it is \u2018reasonably probable\u2019 that in the absence of such error \u2018a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached.\u2019\u201d (Id., at p. 169.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In numerous decisions since <em>Hines, </em>this court has adhered to the rule that \u201cany substantial error\u201d at the penalty phase of a capital case requires reversal and a remand for new penalty trial. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Varnum </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 808, 814-815 [59 Cal.Rptr. 108, 427 P.2d 772] [error found \u201csubstantial\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 406, 421-422 [78 Cal.Rptr. 186, 455 P.2d 122] [error did not constitute \u201csubstantial error\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">It is true, of course, that unlike the death penalty statute in effect at the time of <em>Hines, </em>the 1977 and 1978 death penalty laws\u2014responding to the constitutional mandate set forth in a number of intervening United States Supreme Court decisions (e.g., <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 153 [49 L.Ed.2d 859, 96 S.Ct. 2909])\u2014set forth numerous \u201cfactors\u201d to be considered by the jury in its penalty deliberations. (See \u00a7 190.3.) While these factors do provide some direction and \u201cguideposts\u201d to the sentencing jury, it is important not to exaggerate the difference in the scope of jury discretion under the current statutes and that under the old law. Although section 190.3 places limits on the \u201caggravating\u201d factors that the jury may consider in arriving at its decision (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 772-776 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782]), the United States Supreme Court has made it clear that the jury must be free to consider <em>any </em>mitigating evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s character or background that the defendant proffers in his behalf. (E.g., <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 604 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 989-990, 98 S.Ct. 2954]; <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 104 [71 L.Ed.2d 1, 102 S.Ct. 869].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Furthermore, the current statute does not purport to tell the jury how much importance to place on each of the various listed factors or how to weigh one factor against another. In the final analysis, each juror is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>required to make a judgment drawn from the juror\u2019s own personal values as to whether, in light of the circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s character and background, the defendant deserves to live or die. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 538-545 [220 Cal.Rptr. 637, 709 P.2d 440].) For these reasons, it remains true that \u201c[t]he precise point which prompts the [death] penalty in the mind of any one juror is not known to us and may not even be known to him.\u201d <em>(Hines, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d at p. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Justice Broussard\u2019s recasting of the <em>Hines </em>formulation\u2014which has yet to gain a majority view\u2014may be appropriate for some contexts, so long as the fundamental concerns that prompted the <em>Hines </em>decision are kept in mind in applying the standard. Since there is no way of knowing the set of values which each juror brings to the penalty determination, this court must be extremely cautious in dismissing an error at the penalty trial as \u201charmless.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is also important to recognize that the Broussard formulation is not the only test for evaluating whether a penalty phase error is a \u201csubstantial\u201d one. In her concurring opinion in <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>455 U.S. at page 119 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 14], Justice O\u2019Connor observed that the federal precedents interpreting the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment <em>(Woodson </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 280 [49 L.Ed.2d 944, 96 S.Ct. 2978]; <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586) \u201crequire us to remove any legitimate basis for finding ambiguity concerning the factors actually considered by the [trier of fact in imposing the death penalty].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">A majority of this court adopted this formulation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 879 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813]. There, a death sentence was reversed as a result of the trial court\u2019s penalty phase instruction which inaccurately told the jury that it must not be influenced by sympathy or pity for the accused. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 878; see CALJIC No. 1.00.) \u201cBy directing the jury not to be swayed by sympathy or pity, ... the court in effect told the jury not to give any weight to the bulk of the evidence proffered by the defendant. Thus, the instruction may very well have eliminated any chance Easley had to escape the death penalty.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 880.) Those conclusions were buttressed by the acknowledgement that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>court \u201csignificantly misled the jury with respect to the fundamental nature of its sentencing task\u201d by precluding consideration of sympathy at the penalty phase, and by \u201ceffectively requiring] the jury to disregard much of the evidence which Easley had presented at the penalty phase.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">These principles\u2014along with Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s <em>Eddings </em>formulation\u2014 were applied a few months later in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 163 [203 Cal.Rptr. 122, 680 P.2d 1081]. As in <em>Easley, </em>the trial court had instructed the jurors in the language of CALJIC No. 1.00 and had failed to instruct that they could consider \u201cany aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or background in determining whether death was the appropriate penalty.\u201d <em>(Lanphear, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 166.) In holding that retrial of the penalty phase was \u201cconstitutionally mandated,\u201d the court observed that \u201cwe may not affirm a judgment of death in the face of ambiguity which may have misled the jury as to its proper function.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">These identical errors were considered recently in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512. Using reasoning similar to that used in <em>Lanphear, </em>a majority of this court held that \u201cthe ambiguous tension between these instructions and defendant\u2019s right to sympathetic consideration of all the character and background evidence he presented requires reversal of the penalty judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 538, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Of course, not every penalty phase error may be \u201csubstantial\u201d enough to create \u201cambiguity which may have misled the jury as to its proper function.\u201d However, an error may still be \u201csubstantial\u201d even if it is not possible to conclude with relative certainty that a jury would have reached a different result in the absence of the error. Given the unique function a penalty jury serves and the factors it assesses in making its determination, such a mechanistic approach to assessing prejudice should be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Justice Broussard\u2019s <em>Robertson </em>standard applied in the lead opinion appears flexible enough to accommodate such concerns with respect to the admission of and instructions on other criminal activity evidence. However, the \u201cany ambiguity\u201d test of <em>Easley </em>and the federal precedents might also be appropriate for certain kinds of errors. What is important is that we not lose sight of <em>Easley, Lanphear </em>and <em>Brown </em>in fashioning a workable standard that will be applicable in all cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Even before <em>Hines, </em>a number of decisions had adopted a similar approach to the penalty phase prejudicial error question. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 105, 137 [32 Cal.Rptr. 4, 383 P.2d 12] [\u201c[I]t necessarily follows that any substantial error occurring during the penalty phase of the trial, that results in the death penalty, since it reasonably may have swayed a juror, must be deemed to have been prejudicial. This rule of law has been hinted at, if not decided, in prior cases. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Linden </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 1, 27 [338 P.2d 397], it was said that error and misconduct at the penalty trial \u2018implicitly invites reversal in every case. Only under extraordinary circumstances can the constitutional provision . . . save the verdict.\u201d\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 137, 154 [37 Cal.Rptr. 605, 390 P.2d 381] [\u201cTo attempt to assess the effect of error in this legal vacuum is to superimpose one untestable surmise upon another. We must not pile conjecture upon conjecture and posit the decision of life or death upon a pyramid of guesses. Hence we must conclude that in view of the nature of this kind of trial, the above errors necessarily caused prejudice.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Chief Justice Roger Traynor observed in his monograph on harmless error: \u201cPerhaps the most dangerous risk inheres in errors that relate to the issue of penalty in a capital case. A jury has absolute discretion in arriving at a verdict of death; there are no standards to guide it. In consequence an appellate court cannot possibly determine what factors influenced a jury to impose the death penalty. Any error, unless it related only to the proof of some fact otherwise indisputably established, might have tipped the scales against the defendant. Hence, an error in the penalty phase of a capital case usually compels reversal. \u201d (Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error (1970) pp. 72-73.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b115-9\">FEINERMAN (Robert), J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Adh\">I concur in affirming the judgment on the guilt phase and the special circumstance finding. I respectfully dissent from the reversal of the judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the penalty phase. In my opinion, there is no reasonable possibility that any errors committed during the penalty phase of defendant\u2019s trial affected the jury\u2019s penalty determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The defendant committed a deliberate and monstrous murder for monetary gain and attempted to execute a second victim. After defendant\u2019s arrest, he planned the murder of the second victim and three other prosecution witnesses\u2014Richard Graybill, a longtime friend, Sharon Colman, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, and Barbara Hollingshead, defendant\u2019s mother. No mitigating circumstances were presented on behalf of the defendant. The evidence in aggravation presented to the jury in the penalty phase regarding defendant\u2019s character and background overwhelmingly demonstrated that the defendant was the personification of evil. Furthermore, the defendant admitted that he was involved with others in cocaine trafficking and had shot a man in Mexico.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">To state, as the majority has, that defendant\u2019s jailhouse letters containing directions to \u201cknock out,\u201d \u201cnail,\u201d and \u201cblast\u201d four prosecution witnesses is \u201csomewhat ambiguous as to the conduct it solicits\u201d is specious reasoning. Ambiguity cannot be properly determined in a vacuum. Considering the terms \u201cknock out,\u201d \u201cnail,\u201d and \u201cblast\u201d separately, as isolated words, each term may appear ambiguous. Considering them together in the circumstances in which they were used, their meaning is chillingly clear. Logic, common sense and the realities of everyday life compel the conclusion that when \u201cA,\u201d a murderer and drug dealer, solicits \u201cB\u201d to \u201cknock out,\u201d \u201cnail\u201d or \u201cblast\u201d \u201cC,\u201d whose testimony will result in \u201cA\u2019s\u201d conviction, \u201cA\u201d wants \u201cC\u201d dead. Any other conclusion is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The majority\u2019s argument that there was a reasonable doubt whether the defendant was \u201cactually serious\u201d about going through with his scheme to kill the prosecution witnesses is unconvincing. The defendant was a determined and vengeful survivalist. When he wrote Exhibit 20, defendant was lodged in a jail in Utah and was awaiting extradition to California to stand trial for the attempted murder of Ron Rose and the murder of Rose\u2019s friend, Bruce Bartulis. Graybill and Colman had decided to cooperate with law enforcement and Hollingshead, defendant\u2019s mother, was at home when the defendant arrived with Colman after the commission of the crimes. Mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>festly, it was in the defendant\u2019s best interests to eliminate all of these witnesses before they had a chance to testify against him at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Although the jury may have erroneously considered certain incidents of purported other criminal activity, those events (i:e., the \u201cCW Murder Plan,\u201d the \u201cSolder Plan,\u201d the \u201cIndustrial Burglary Plan,\u201d) were of relative minor significance compared to the other incidents which the jury could properly consider as other criminal activity (i.e., defendant\u2019s letters soliciting the murder of four prosecution witnesses, including his own mother, defendant\u2019s admission that he had shot a man in Mexico and defendant\u2019s admission that he had been involved with others in cocaine trafficking). A search for the golden fleece of the \u201cperfect trial\u201d is inevitably doomed to failure. \u201c\u2018[A] defendant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one,\u2019 for there are no perfect trials.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 223, 231 [36 L.Ed.2d 208, 215, 93 S.Ct. 1565].) It is also important to recognize that \u201cextreme justice is often injustice.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">I recognize that the highest standard of care must be utilized in reviewing the record in the penalty phase of a capital case. It is an awesome responsibility to be part of a process that can result in the taking of a human life. But we also have a concomitant responsibility to society as a whole. As Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo stated in <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Mass. </em>(1934) 291 U.S. 97 at page 122 [78 L.Ed. 674, 687, 54 S.Ct. 330, 90 A.L.R. 575], \u201cBut justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a filament. We are to keep the balance true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Given the backdrop of a record that highlights the fact that not one scintilla of evidence in mitigation was introduced on behalf of the defendant in the penalty phase, I do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that the minor incidents improperly admitted as other criminal activity or the omission of a reasonable doubt instruction as to those incidents properly considered as other criminal activity could have made a difference in the jury\u2019s verdict in the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Mosk, J., concurred in this disposition only.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 20, 1986. Mosk, J., Lucas, J., and Panelli, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Second District, Division Five, assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> Defendant testified on both direct and cross-examination, as part of his alibi, that he was involved with others in cocaine trafficking, and testified on cross-examination that he had shot a man in Mexico.
