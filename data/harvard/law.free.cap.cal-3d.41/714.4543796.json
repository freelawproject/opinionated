J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-J\">principal question presented by this appeal is whether the trial court, in a prosecution for the sale of unqualified securities, erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>in instructing the jury that certain \u201cCorporation Promissory Notes\u201d were \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Law. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 25000 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Joseph and Dennis Figueroa appeal from a judgment of conviction for one count of selling unqualified securities. (\u00a7\u00a7 25110, 25540.) The jury dead: locked on thirteen additional counts, eight alleged against Joseph and five against Dennis. Thereafter, a mistrial was declared on those counts, and they were dismissed with the understanding that they could be considered by the court for restitution purposes. Both appellants were given terms of probation with conditions including restitution, a suspended county jail term, and community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Only the facts relating to the count on which appellants were convicted are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In mid-March of 1979, Arlo Kurrle responded to an advertisement which ' had appeared in the San Jose Mercury News. The ad stated \u201cSolar &amp; Energy Business. Partner wanted with $7,000 or more. Active or nonactive.\u201d Kurrle called one of the two phone numbers listed in the ad and spoke to Joseph Figueroa, who described an existing insulation business and his desire to expand into solar energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Kurrle met Joseph and his son, Dennis, the following day. The Figueroas told Kurrle about Figueroa Insulation &amp; Energy Co., Inc. (Insulation) of which Dennis was president. The new solar energy business would also be a corporation.\" Kurrle learned about two other businesses, Figueroa Financial Insurance Services, Inc. (Insurance) and Figueroa Business &amp; Financial Consultants (Financial).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Joseph and Dennis proposed that Kurrle invest $10,000 in their business. The money was to be used for the purchase of insulation equipment and the installation of telephones used to solicit loan customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">At the first meeting, Kurrle and Joseph discussed whether Kurrle was to be active in the business. Kurrle expressed interest in having a direct role, possibly in the sales or management areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">A few days later, Kurrle called Joseph and agreed to lend the company $10,000. There was no discussion about what form Kurrle\u2019s investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>would take, but Kurrle \u201cwas thinking in terms of a loan . . . that would be documented. \u201d During the conversation, Joseph told Kurrle that he would be an officer in one of the Figueroa corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Over the next four weeks, Kurrle paid the money to the Figueroas in five separate installments evidenced by five 2-year notes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notes were to earn 10 percent interest annually. Kurrle had the option to take payment in cash or shares of the company. The fourth loan installment, for $2,500, constituted the basis for the charge on which the Figueroas were eventually convicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Kurrle made that loan by giving the Figueroas a check payable to Dennis. The loan was witnessed by a \u201cCorporation Promissory Note\u201d from Insulation which was signed by Dennis. In relevant part it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201cApril 27th, 1979</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">Corporation Promissaroy [s/cl Note $2,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">For the Value Received, on or Before 24 months after date, without grace The Figueroa Insulation &amp; Energy Company, Inc., promises to pay to the order of Mr. Arlo Kurrle, of San Jose, California or at his home or office, [t] The sum of $2,500 two thousand dollars &amp; Five Hundred at the rate of 10% per Cent annum until paid. ... [f] ... Its [szc] agreed and understood, that this corporation note is all due an [sz'c] payable in 24 months from date of this note and its |&gt;zc] further agreed and understood, that <em>interest </em>is to be paid annual [szcl each year, but all due and payable April 27th, 1981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Kurrle began working in the Figueroa office sometime in early April, shortly after making the first loan installment. He was made secretary/treasurer of Financial and Insulation and worked primarily for Joseph and Financial, updating loan source lists and contacting potential lenders. He also accompanied Dennis on sales calls for Insulation and developed a demonstration kit used by Dennis in his presentations. Kurrle stayed with the business for about four months. Although the trial testimony does not indicate whether he was ever repaid, the probation report and restitution order strongly suggest that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">The first claim raised by appellants is that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to specify in its instructions what burden of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>must be met to establish that the sale was exempted from qualification. Since Justice King\u2019s opinion in the Court of Appeal correctly analyzes and resolves this issue, this court adopts that part of his opinion as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">It is noteworthy that the Attorney General concedes that the Court of Appeal\u2019s resolution of this issue is correct and that the judgment of conviction must be reversed on this basis. With appropriate deletions and additions,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that analysis follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">[Section 25110 makes it unlawful \u201cfor any person to offer or sell in this state any security in an issuer transaction . . . unless such sale has been qualified under section 25111, 25112 or 25113 . . . <em>or unless such security or transaction is exempted under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 25100) of this part.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Sections 25100 through 25105 specify securities and transactions which are exempted from qualification under the Corporate Securities Law. The statute upon which appellants relied was section 25102, subdivision (e), which exempts from the provisions of section 25110 \u201c[a]ny offer or sale of any evidence of indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, and any guarantee thereof, in a transaction <em>not involving any public offering. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">[f] Section 25163 provides \u201c[i]n any proceeding under [the Corporate Securities Law], the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.\u201d Since appellants claimed they came within a private offering exemption to section 25110, they bore the burden of proving [that fact]. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 550, 566-567 [151 Cal.Rptr. 146] [state did not bear burden of proving lack of private offering exemption in prosecution under section 25110]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 575, 585-586 [62 P.2d 592].) Joseph\u2019s proposed instruction therefore was partially erroneous, as it placed the burden on the state to disprove any exemptions.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> [The trial court properly placed] this burden of proof on the Figueroas, but [did] not define the quantum or degree of that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The court is required to instruct the jury on both the assignment <em>and the magnitude </em>of burdens of proof. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 502.) Section 502 presents four degrees of burdens of proof: \u201cthat a party raise a reasonable doubt concerning the existence or nonexistence of a fact or that he establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a preponderance of the evidence, by clear and convincing proof[,] or by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Evidence Code section 501 provides \u201c[ijnsofar as any statute, except section 522, assigns the burden of proof in a criminal action, such statute is subject to Penal Code section 1096. \u201d<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> The Law Revision Commission comment on Evidence Code section 501 notes that \u201cwhere a statute allocates the burden of proof to the defendant on any [issue other than insanity] relating to the defendant\u2019s guilt, the defendant\u2019s burden ... is merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The issue of the defendant\u2019s precise burden of proving he or she comes within an exemption to the securities registration law is one of first impression in California.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335], [this] court discussed the degrees of burdens of proof which may be placed on a defendant in a criminal case. (3) \u201c[W]hen there is placed upon an accused the burden of interjecting a factual contention which, if established would tend to overcome or negate proof of any element of the crime charged as otherwise established by the People, the accused need only raise a reasonable doubt as to the existence or nonexistence of the fact in issue.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 963.) Examples of such instances include unconsciousness and alibi defenses. <em>([Ibid.]) </em>On the other hand, defendants may be required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence defenses \u201cwhich raise factual issues collateral to the question of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence and do not bear directly on any link in the chain of proof of any element of the crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 964.) Among such instances are entrapment defenses and challenges to testimony as being hearsay or that of an accomplice. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 964-968.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Jefferson\u2019s Evidence Benchbook makes a similar distinction on the defendant\u2019s burden of proof. \u201cOn any issue of defendant\u2019s guilt that is in the nature of an affirmative defense, the burden of proof assigned to defendant shall be merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt; . . . [o]n a guilt issue other than whether defendant committed the criminal acts charged, the burden of proof assigned to defendant may be fixed at proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (2 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Bench-book (2d ed. 1982) \u00a7 45.1, p. 1640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">An exemption defense to a prosecution under the state securities law is an affirmative defense which is not \u201ccollateral\u201d to the defendant\u2019s guilt. Unless the Legislature provides otherwise, the defendant\u2019s burden of proof is merely to raise a reasonable doubt that the offering did not require registration. Here the trial court erred by refusing to instruct on this degree of the defendants\u2019 burden of proof.<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The court\u2019s error was compounded by its instruction which said \u201c[i]t is unlawful for any person to offer or sell in this state any security unless such sale has been qualified or <em>unless such security has been exempted with the California Corporations </em>Commissioner. \u201d (Italics added.) This instruction [gave] the erroneous impression that the Figueroas had to apply for and receive a formal exemption from the Corporations Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The jury deliberated two days and deadlocked on three related charges [involving Kurrle] where the only defense [permitted to go to the jury] was a private offering exemption.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> During deliberations, the jury requested copies of the instructions on exemptions. This was a close case and it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendants would have occurred had appropriate instructions been given. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) [End of excerpt from Court of Appeal opinion.] As the Attorney General concedes, reversal of the conviction is required on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The principal question presented in this case is whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the promissory notes involved in the Kurrle transactions were \u201csecurities\u201d under the Corporate Securities Law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At trial, the defense offered evidence, some of which was admitted and some of which was excluded, on the question of whether securities were involved in the Kurrle transactions. (See <em>post, </em>at p. 740.) The defense also proffered an instruction which purported to guide the jury in determining this question. That instruction was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Over defense objection, the trial court charged the jury that \u201cthe promissory notes received by Arlo Kurrle are securities as defined in section 25019 of the Corporate Securities Act.\u201d The trial court did not read the section 25019 definition to the jury, nor did it elucidate further on the meaning of the term. Ironically, this instruction followed one which told the jury that one of the elements the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt was whether \u201ca security in an issuer transaction\u201d was involved in the section 25110 counts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The district attorney relied fully on the court\u2019s charge. During the first of her two closing arguments, she stated: \u201cWith respect to the issue of securities. <em>Again, that\u2019s another issue that\u2019s going to be taken out of your hands. </em>You don\u2019t have to make the determination about whether those limited partnerships involved in counts one, two and three in Figueroa Diversified Investments was a security or not. His honor is going to instruct you that as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>a matter of law those are securities, [if] His honor will also instruct you that the limited partnerships involved in counts four and five ... are securities. But that\u2019s another matter that\u2019s not within your purview, you don\u2019t have to decide that, it\u2019s been decided for you. [if] <em>With respect to counts six, seven, eight and nine the promissory notes that were received by Mr. Kurrle, his honor will also instruct you that those are securities, as a matter of law. The law says and you have to accept it. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The precise issue raised by the trial court\u2019s actions is whether the giving of the challenged instruction was tantamount to a directed verdict on the \u201csecurity\u201d element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">It has long been recognized that a trial judge \u201cmay not direct a verdict of guilty no matter how conclusive the evidence.\u201d <em>(Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 395, 408 [91 L.Ed. 973, 985, 67 S.Ct. 775]; accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 564, 572-573 [51 L.Ed.2d 642, 651-652, 97 S.Ct. 1349]; <em>Sparf and Hansen </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1895) 156 U.S. 51, 105 [39 L.Ed. 343, 362, 15 S.Ct. 273]; cf. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 510, 524 [61 L.Ed.2d 39, 51, 99 S.Ct. 2450]; <em>Bollenbach </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1946) 326 U.S. 607, 615 [90 L.Ed. 350, 355-356, 66 S.Ct. 402].) Only recently, a plurality of the Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle, observing that \u201c[t]he Court consistently has held that \u2018a trial judge is prohibited from entering a judgment of conviction or directing the jury to come forward with such a verdict . . . regardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction.\u2019\u201d <em>(Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 73, 84 [74 L.Ed.2d 823, 832, 103 S.Ct. 969], quoting <em>Martin Linen Supply, supra, </em>430 U.S. at pp. 572-573 [51 L.Ed.2d at p. 652].)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The prohibition against directed verdicts \u201cincludes perforce situations in which the judge\u2019s instructions fall short of directing a guilty verdict but which nevertheless have the effect of so doing by eliminating other relevant considerations if the jury finds one fact to be true.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hayward </em>(D.C. Cir. 1969) 420 F.2d 142, 144.) As one panel of the Fifth Circuit has stated, \u201c[N]o fact, not even an undisputed fact, may be determined by the judge.\u201d <em>(Roe </em>v. <em>United States </em>(5th Cir. 1961) 287 F.2d 435, 440, cert, den. (1961) 368 U.S. 824 [7 L.Ed.2d 29, 82 S.Ct. 43]; accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Musgrave </em>(5th Cir. 1971) 444 F.2d 755, 762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sandstrom </em>illustrate these principles well. In <em>Sandstrom </em>the jury was instructed that \u201c\u2018[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\u2019\u201d (442 U.S. at p. 517 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 46].) The court held, by a seven-to-two vote, that the jurors \u201ccould reasonably have concluded that they were directed to find against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>defendant on the element of intent.\u201d (442 U.S. at p. 523 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 50].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In <em>Johnson </em>the instruction was that \u201c \u2018every person is conclusively presumed to intend the natural and necessary consequences of his act.\u2019\u201d (460 U.S. at p. 78 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 829].) The high court unanimously condemned this instruction as error of constitutional magnitude. Four justices expressed the view that it was the \u201cfunctional equivalent of a directed verdict\u201d on the issue of intent (460 U.S. at p. 84 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 832] (plur. opn.)), while four others believed that any instruction which \u201cremove[d] an issue completely from the jury\u2019s consideration\u201d would require reversal <em>(id., </em>at p. 95 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 839] (dis. opn.)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This court has read <em>Johnson </em>as standing for the proposition \u201cthat at least eight justices of the United States Supreme Court . . . agree that a jury instruction which . . . take[s] an issue completely from the jury\u201d is reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539, 554.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The rule prohibiting verdicts directed against an accused emanates from the guarantee of due process and the right to a jury trial. Due process \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of <em>every fact </em>necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\u201d <em>(In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 364 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375, 90 S.Ct. 1068]). It requires the state to prove \u201c\u2018every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 524 [61 L.Ed.2d at p. 51], quoting <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 197, 215 [53 L.Ed.2d 281, 295, 97 S.Ct. 2319].)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The right to a jury trial reflects the framers\u2019 \u201cfundamental decision about the exercise of official power\u2014a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges.\u201d <em>(Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 145, 156 [20 L.Ed.2d 491, 500, 88 S.Ct. 1444].) As Chief Judge Aldrich of the First Circuit has observed, \u201cthe jury, as the conscience of the community, must be permitted to look at more than logic. . . . If it were otherwise there would be no more reason why a verdict should not be directed against a defendant in a criminal case than in a civil one. The constitutional guarantees of due process and trial by jury require that a criminal defendant be afforded the full protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a jury unfettered, directly or indirectly. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Spock </em>(1st Cir. 1969) 416 F.2d 165, 182; see also <em>Caba\u00f1a </em>v. <em>Bullock </em>(1986) 474 U.S. -, - [88 L.Ed.2d 704, 715, 106 S.Ct. 689, 696]: \u201c[A] jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand if the instructions provided the jury do not require it to find each element of the crime under the proper standard of proof, [citation]. Findings made by a judge cannot cure deficiencies in the jury\u2019s finding as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant resulting from the court\u2019s failure to instruct it to find an element of the crime. [Citation.]\u201d)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The California cases are generally in accord with these explanations. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shavers </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 886 [75 Cal.Rptr. 334], the court found reversible error in an instruction which charged that if the jury found the accused guilty of robbery \u201cit is robbery in the first degree.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 888.) \u201cWhere a plea of not guilty has been entered, the trial judge may not direct a verdict of guilty even though the prosecution\u2019s case is strong and the defense does not present a substantial evidentiary case. [Citation.] The judge may <em>comment </em>on the evidence [citation] but may not <em>instruct </em>the jury that as a matter of law some element of the crime charged has been adequately proved.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 888-889, italics in original.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">This court, relying on the foregoing United States Supreme Court authority, has also condemned procedural devices which are analogous to a directed verdict. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 551 [failure to instruct on element of intent]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Roder </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 491, 496 [189 Cal.Rptr. 501, 658 P.2d 1302] [instruction on presumption of guilty knowledge in receiving stolen property prosecution].) As the <em>Garcia </em>court observed, \u201c[t]he reasoning of the [high court] opinions . . . would invalidate any instruction . . . which would permit the state to circumvent the requirement that it prove every fact necessary for conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation].\u201d (36 Cal.3d at p. 551; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 821, 828 [22 Cal.Rptr. 465, 372 P.2d 297] [error to instruct that \u201cevidence in this case\u201d is such that defendant is either guilty of first degree murder or innocent altogether since such an instruction removes possibility of conviction on lesser included offenses].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Cases from the federal circuits are more numerous on the subject. Two cases involving federal securities violations hold that it is error to charge the jury that a particular instrument is a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(5th Cir. 1983 (en banc)) 718 F.2d 1317; <em>Roe </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>287 F.2d at p. 440 [\u201c[A]s a matter of law, the evidence of these transactions, if credited, would constitute the sale or delivery of an \u2018investment contract,\u2019 hence a \u2018security\u2019 .... But the if in \u2018if credited\u2019 is a big one. By its very nature, it is the peculiar facts of the setting which turns the offer from a mere sale of property into a sale of a security. That means that the trier of fact . . . must determine the issue. . . .\u201d].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>718 F.2d 1317, is particularly instructive not only because it contains an extensive discussion of the issue, but because it is an en banc decision which was preceded by an opinion by a three-judge panel which had reached a contrary result. (700 F.2d 163, rehg. granted 700 F.2d at p. 181.) For these reasons, it is discussed in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Johnson was a trader in precious metals who was rehired by his former employer for the purpose of resuscitating a failing company. Johnson\u2019s primary task was to demonstrate to company auditors that the company was solvent so that a public stock offering could be made. To this end, he travelled to Dallas and obtained a \u201cGold Certificate Contract\u201d from a businessman contact. The certificate purported to assign Johnson and the company a substantial quantity of gold. Johnson returned to California with the certificate and presented it to company auditors. They were unable to verify the existence of the gold represented in the contract. Shortly thereafter, the company declared bankruptcy. Johnson was subsequently charged with, im ter alia, the interstate transportation of a falsely made security knowing it was not authentic. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">One of Johnson\u2019s defenses was that the certificate was not a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the federal statute. The trial court nevertheless refused an instruction defining the term and instructed the jury that the gold contract was a \u201csecurity.\u201d The jury found Johnson guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The court of appeals reversed. It held that the trial judge \u201cwas no more entitled to refuse to allow the jury to decide whether the Gold Certificate was a security than he would have been permitted to refuse to charge on whether the Certificate was falsely made or whether Johnson acted knowingly. Knowledge that the Gold Certificate was false or forged was, of course, also an essential element of the crime. But submission of this element to the jury does not excuse the failure to submit a different element: whether, regardless of Johnson\u2019s subjective belief or knowledge, the Gold Certificate was a security.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>718 F.2d at p. 1323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Although <em>Johnson </em>was a case in which the \u201csecurity\u201d element of the charge was hotly contested, the court frankly acknowledged the necessity of submitting that question to the jury even when it was not seriously open to dispute. \u201c[Wjhether a tangible document or thing meets a statutory definition . . . depends upon the probative value of evidence <em>even when the evidence seems so clear as to leave no room for fool\u2019s questions.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 1324, italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Several other circuit court decisions hold that it is error to instruct the jury that an essential element of the offense has been established.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> On the other hand, as the <em>Johnson </em>majority frankly conceded (718 F.2d at p. 1323, fn. 17), there is also a substantial body of federal authority to the contrary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The latter cases appear to rely on one or both of the following two premises: (1) that the evidence at trial leaves little doubt as to whether a particular element of the offense has been established, and (2) that the challenged instruction is within the trial court\u2019s province because the issue that it resolves is purely a question of law. The Attorney General maintains that either of these premises justifies an instruction like the one given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The first premise is clearly unsupportable. If a judge were permitted to instruct the jury on the basis of assertedly \u201cundisputed\u201d evidence that a particular element had been established as a matter of law, the right to a jury trial would become a hollow guarantee. As the court in <em>Konda </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>166 Fed. at page 93 observed, \u201can accused person has the same right to have 12 laymen pronounce upon the truth or falsity of each material averment in the indictment, if the evidence against him is clear and uncontradicted, as he unquestionably would have if it were doubtful and conflicting. Inasmuch as jurors are rightly trusted, in close and difficult cases, to maintain the peace and dignity of organized society, surely they may be relied on in the plain and simple ones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">As to the second premise, the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact, Judge Rubin\u2019s comments in <em>Johnson </em>are fitting: \u201cThis distinction is at best elusive. There is no categorical distinction between \u2018legal\u2019 and \u2018factual\u2019 questions, for in every case application of a legal principle turns on the presence of particular facts. A contemporary author has aptly explained why the \u2018law\u2019 and \u2018fact\u2019 distinction misses the mark in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\u201c \u2018There is considerable misunderstanding in the minds of the general public regarding provisions making a jury the judge of fact and not of law. This misunderstanding is attributable in large part to the inaccuracy of the general rule that juries decide <em>only </em>the facts. This is an inaccurate expression because it leaves the impression that juries are not judges of the law at any time or in any sense. Juries are always judges of the law in the sense that juries must pass on the manner and the extent in which the law expounded by the judge fits the facts brought out in the evidence. This process requires juries to perform the legal function of interpretation and application. In die absence of express authority, however, juries are not judges of the law in determining what principle of law is applicable to the evidence.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>[H] S. McCart, Trial by Jury 116-17 (1965) (emphasis in original). <em>Hence, although attempting to separate \u2018fact\u2019 from \u2018law\u2019 may sometimes be useful, particularly when a statute or a federal rule turns on the differentiation, it is not the issue here. The issue is the role of the jury in the trial guaranteed to the accused.\u201d </em>(718 F.2d at p. 1321, second italics added, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Attorney General, seizing on this \u201claw/fact\u201d distinction, points to a \u201clengthy and settled\u201d body of case law which assertedly holds that the question of what constitutes a security is one of law reserved exclusively to the trial court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Skelton </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 691, 712-713 [167 Cal.Rptr. 636], cert. den. (1981) 450 U.S. 917 [67 L.Ed.2d 343, 101 S.Ct. 1361]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1961) 192 Cal.App.2d 414, 418 [13 Cal.Rptr. 260]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rankin </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 150, 160 [337 P.2d 182], cert. den.

However, only four cases, <em>McCalla, Dutton, Marvin </em>and <em>Skelton, </em>squarely hold that the court may instruct the jury that a particular instrument is a security within the meaning of the state corporate securities laws.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, as will become apparent, none of these holdings withstands scrutiny under more modern concepts of due process and the right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The origins of the holding appear in <em>McCalla. </em>There, the appellant argued that the trial court erroneously prevented him from demonstrating that his counsel had advised him that an investment certificate issued to an investor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>was not a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act. The appellate court rejected this argument, adhering to the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse. (63 Cal.App. at pp. 793-796.) In so doing, the court approved the trial court\u2019s instruction that the certificate was a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the state securities law. The court cited no authority for its conclusion and did not appear to recognize the constitutional implications of its holding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><em>Dutton </em>came 17 years after <em>McCalla, </em>but failed to fill the analytic void. There, the court recognized that the instruction withdrew \u201cfrom the jury the question as to whether certain documents introduced into evidence were securities\u201d (41 Cal.App.2d at p. 872), but found no error in view of the state constitutional provision permitting the court to \u201cinstruct the jury on the law applicable to the facts of the case.\u201d (Former art. VI, \u00a7 19, repealed Nov. 8, 1966.) \u201cIn view of the definition of the term \u2018security\u2019 as set forth in section 2 of the Corporate Securities Act, there can be no doubt that as a matter of law the people\u2019s exhibits in question constituted securities and the court was authorized to so advise the jury.\u201d (41 Cal.App.2d at p. 873.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">One year later came <em>Marvin. </em>It followed closely in McCalla\u2019s and <em>Dutton\u2019s </em>wake, making no waves of its own. It also failed to analyze the question in any great detail. Noting only that there was no dispute that the documents involved came within the \u201csecurity\u201d definition, the Court of Appeal concluded that \u201c[i]t was therefore within the province of the trial court to instruct the jury that the documents . . . constituted securities as a matter of law.\u201d (48 Cal.App.2d at p. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Though it came nearly four decades after <em>Marvin, Skelton </em>merely repeated the \u201crules\u201d which its predecessors had enunciated. Relying on <em>Dutton </em>and on the principle that whether a particular document is a security is to be determined on a case-by-case basis <em>(People </em>v. <em>Syde </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 765, 768 [235 P.2d 601]), the court held that there had been no error in the giving of such an instruction. (109 Cal.App.3d at pp. 713-714.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Inexplicably, none of these cases addressed the due process and jury trial rights which are arguably violated by such an instruction. That omission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>particularly surprising in view of the fact that the rule prohibiting directed verdicts was enunciated as early as 1895 by the Supreme Court in <em>Sparf and Hansen </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>156 U.S. 51. Perhaps the courts in <em>McCalla, Marvin, </em>and <em>Dutton </em>may be forgiven for failing to address the issue because of the relative age and/or obscurity of that case. However, the <em>Skelton </em>court could not rely on this excuse. By 1980, when that case was decided, the rule had been soundly reaffirmed by the high court two times\u2014 in <em>Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>and <em>Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>\u2014and the basis for the rule reaffirmed twice more in <em>Winship </em>and Sandstrom.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Moreover, in light of the analysis in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>718 F.2d 1317 and other cases, the two premises discussed above <em>(ante, </em>p. 730) are questionable ones upon which to sustain the trial court\u2019s instruction.  In many criminal cases, the prosecution\u2019s evidence will establish an element of the charged offense \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d Similarly, in many instances, the accused will not seriously dispute a particular element of the offense. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 554, 556.) However, neither of these sometime realities of trial practice justifies the giving of an instruction which takes an element from the jury and decides it adversely to the accused. Such an instruction confuses the roles of judge and jury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In addition, if the \u201claw/fact\u201d distinction that the foregoing cases espouse is at all valid, it can only be in a very limited sense.  As the <em>Johnson </em>majority observed, \u201cThe definition of a security is a matter of law. It is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>judge\u2019s duty to instruct the jury concerning that definition: the way in which a security is identified. Whether a particular piece of paper meets that definition, however, is for the jury to decide. Of course, the question whether a generic type of document, such as a traveler\u2019s check or an equipment lease, may come within the reach of the statute\u2019s prohibition is one of law. [Citations.]\u201d (718 F.2d at p. 1321, fn. 13.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">For all of these reasons, the trial court\u2019s instruction here cannot stand. Instead of permitting the jury to find for itself that the note given Kurrle was a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of section 25019, the trial court removed that issue from the jury and directed a finding on it. This was error, particularly since it was not a foregone conclusion that the note given to Kurrle <em>was </em>a \u201csecurity\u201d under the statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To understand this point, it is necessary to examine the meaning of that term as it is used in section 25019.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The list of instruments which come within the statutory definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d <em>(ante, </em>fn. 9) is an expansive one. However, the cases have adhered to the principle that substance governs over form. \u201c[A] literal interpretation [of the statute] has been uniformly eschewed when to do so would appear to exceed any legitimate legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schock </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 379, 384-385 [199 Cal.Rptr. 327]; <em>Leyva </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 462, 473 [210 Cal.Rptr. 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Thus, the \u201ccritical question\u201d the courts have sought to resolve in these cases is whether a transaction falls within the regulatory purpose of the law regardless of whether it involves an instrument which comes within the literal language of the definition. In <em>Silver Hills Country Club </em>v. <em>Sobieski </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 811, 813-816 [13 Cal.Rptr. 186, 361 P.2d 906, 87 A.L.R.2d 1135], for example, the court pursued that inquiry with respect to the sale of country club memberships even though the transaction involved a \u201cbeneficial interest in title to property\u201d which was listed in the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The court engaged in a similar analysis in <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Ehrmantraut </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 127, 139 [167 Cal.Rptr. 595, 615 P.2d 1383], which involved the sale of the stock of an executive placement firm, even though \u201cstock\u201d is one of the instruments listed in section 25019. (28 Cal.3d at pp. 132-133, 137-138; see also <em>id.., </em>at p. 139 [\u201cBona fide agreements for the sale of services providing for profit sharing have been held not to come within the act, although profit sharing agreements, like stock, are included in the broad definition of security in section 25019\u201d] ,)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The California decisions involving instruments designated as \u201cnotes\u201d are consistent with this principle.  Over 40 years ago, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 681 [91 P.2d 892], this court observed that \u201cit plainly was not the legislative intent that \u2018every\u2019 note or evidence of indebtedness, regardless of its nature and of the circumstances surrounding its execution, should be considered as included within the meaning and purpose of the act.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 686.)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>In at least two cases, notes have been held to qualify as securities because the transaction falls within the regulatory purpose of the law. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(1930) 106 Cal.App. 442 [290 P. 131], upheld in <em>In re Leach </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 536, 546 [12 P.2d 3], the Court of Appeal held that undersecured notes on real property were \u201csecurities\u201d on the ground that they were \u201cunload[ed] upon a trusting public ... for a consideration far in excess of their reasonable value\u201d and, therefore, did not \u201cprotect the public against the imposition of [an] unsubstantial scheme . . . .\u201d (106 Cal.App. at p. 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Walberg </em>(1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 286 [69 Cal.Rptr. 457], the court found that unsecured, interest-bearing promissory notes which were issued for loans solicited to refurbish a hotel were \u201csecurities.\u201d The court relied in part on the fact that the scheme \u201cwas quite as dangerous to investors as the typical blue-sky promotion of mining stocks and royalties.\u201d (I<em>d., </em>at p. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">These cases underscore the fact that the corporate securities laws do not contain an \u201call-inclusive formula by which to test the facts in every case. And the courts have refrained from attempting to formulate such a test. Whether a particular instrument is to be considered a security within the meaning of the statute is a question to be determined in each case. In arriving at a determination the courts have been mindful that the general purpose of the law is to protect the public against the imposition of unsubstantial, unlawful and fraudulent stock and investment schemes and the securities based thereon. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Syde, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d at p. 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Some 25 years ago, this court in <em>Silver Hills Country Club </em>v. <em>Sobieski, supra, 55 </em>Cal.2d 811 introduced the concept of \u201crisk capital\u201d as a way to determine whether a transaction involves a \u201csecurity.\u201d \u201cSection 25008 defines a security broadly to protect the public against spurious schemes, however ingeniously devised, to attract risk capital. . . . [f] . . . [The] objective [of the Corporate Securities Law] is to afford those who risk their capital at least a fair chance of realizing their objectives.\u201d <em>(Silver Hills, supra, 55 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Cal.2d at pp. 814-815; accord <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Ehrmantraut, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at p. 139.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Thus, for example, \u201cwhere the investor receives adequate collateral, no risk capital is contributed to the managerial efforts of the promoter and such business transaction does not come within the Corporate Securities Law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schock, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at p. 386; see, e.g., <em>Hamilton Jewelers </em>v. <em>Department of Corporations, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.3d at p. 336 [offer of sale of diamond with right to return it for full purchase price plus 5 percent interest not a security since no \u201crisk capital\u201d placed with the jeweler; diamond itself served as adequate collateral].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The inadequacy of collateral, however, is not the only factor. As <em>Silver Hills </em>notes, \u2018\u201ca passive position on the part of the investor\u2019 \u201d is also a factor relevant to whether a security is involved. (See 55 Cal.2d at p. 815, quoting Dahlquist, <em>Regulation and Civil Liability Under the California Corporate Securities Act </em>(1945) 33 Cal.L.Rev. 343, 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">This factor was the focus of this court\u2019s analysis in <em>People </em>v. <em>Syde, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d 765. <em>Syde </em>involved agreements between a promoter and parents for the production of films featuring their children. The contracts called for the payment of specified sums over the period of rehearsals and guaranteed the cast members a percentage of the gross receipts upon the sale or distribution of the film.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In analyzing whether the film contracts were \u201csecurities,\u201d the court explained, \u201c[i]t is settled that the Corporate Securities Law was not intended to afford supervision and regulation of instruments which constitute agreements with persons who expect to reap a profit from their own services or other active participation in a business venture. Such contracts are clearly distinguished from instruments issued to persons who, for a consideration paid, stipulate for a right to share in the profits or proceeds of a business enterprise to be conducted by others; and the court will look through form to substance to discover whether in fact the transaction contemplates the conduct of a business enterprise by others than the purchasers, in the profits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>or proceeds of which the purchasers are to share. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Syde, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d at pp. 768-769.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Applying these facts, the court held that the contracts did not constitute securities. \u201cThe artist invested in returns from his training and actual participation in the production of a film if profits were realized from a sale thereof. It was not contemplated that he was to play the passive role of an investor only. True the direction in the production and the marketing of the film lay exclusively in the management of the defendants. But the film from which the artist was to profit could not be produced without his actual participation as a member of the cast.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Coster </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1188 [199 Cal.Rptr. 253], employed a similar analysis, reaching a contrary conclusion on its facts. There, the notes given the investors provided both a fixed return and a percentage of the gross company income. The court found that the transaction came within the purpose of the securities law since \u201cthe latter payment obviously depended on the success of the business\u201d (151 Cal.App.3d at p. 1195), which \u201cdefendant managed, controlled and operated. ...\u201d (Id., at p. 1194.) \u201c[T]he investors had no authority in its conduct; the profit on their investments depended solely on defendant\u2019s expertise, skill, and honesty. . . . [T]hey may be described as \u2018relatively uninformed\u2019 regarding the operation of defendant\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The Attorney General contends that the foregoing cases are inapposite since they involved \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d rather than \u201cpromissory notes.\u201d  He claims that evidence of an investor\u2019s active participation in a business is irrelevant where the instrument is denominated a \u201cpromissory note\u201d since on its face a promissory note contemplates a guaranteed rate of return of both principal and interest. Thus, he argues, an investor\u2019s participation in the business, even if substantial, cannot affect the investment and the transaction should be subject to securities regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">This argument is without merit. The return on any investment which has not been secured with adequate collateral depends on the success of the business. This is true whether the investment contemplates a percentage of the profits or a fixed return. When an investor entrusts money or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>consideration to a promoter through any arrangement but retains substantial power to affect the success of the enterprise, he has not \u201crisked capital\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Law. In such transactions, that law should not govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Moreover, a rule which brings an undersecured \u201cpromissory note\u201d within the ambit of the Corporate Securities Law simply because it guarantees a fixed return would be illogical in situations where the note is part of a transaction which contemplates substantial investor participation. Such a rule would place undue emphasis on the label attached to a particular instrument, ignoring the dictate that the courts must look to the substance of the transaction to determine whether protection of the securities laws is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">There is an additional consideration. Many \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d\u2014instruments which concededly permit consideration of investor participation in determining whether they constitute \u201csecurities\u201d\u2014contemplate both a variable and a fixed return. The investment contracts in <em>Coster, </em>for example, purported to give the investor a 20 percent \u201cfixed\u201d return on principal and 1 percent of the gross company income. (151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1191-1192.) Both kinds of return, as well as a recoupment of principal, depended on the success of the business, which in turn depended upon the efforts of the promoter. It would be illogical to permit consideration of evidence of investor participation in that instance to determine whether the transaction should be subject to securities regulation while forbidding it in a promissory note transaction simply because the promised return in the latter is to take the form of interest at a \u201cfixed\u201d rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Finally, at least one case involving a promissory note has looked to investor participation in determining whether a note was a \u201csecurity.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Schock, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 379 involved fractional interests in promissory notes and related deeds of trust. In concluding that the notes were \u201csecurities,\u201d the court relied on the fact that the \u201cinvestors possessed no real knowledge <em>or control </em>over the [business]. The <em>passive role occupied by the investors </em>compelled full reliance on [defendant\u2019s company] for the success or failure of the common enterprise.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 388, fn. 6, italics added;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> accord <em>Leyva </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at pp. 472-475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>It is evident from the foregoing analysis that Kurrle\u2019s participation in appellants\u2019 business was relevant to the issue of whether the \u201cCorporation Promissory Note\u201d was a \u201csecurity.\u201d Therefore, not only was it improper for the court to take the issue from the jury, but consideration of that evidence, by the jurors was essential to determine that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">For example, it is noteworthy that appellants\u2019 initial offering through the newspaper ad contemplated \u201c[ajctive or nonactive\u201d partners. From the time of their first meeting, Kurrle\u2019s active participation in the Figueroa businesses was encouraged. Kurrle not only talked to Joseph with the idea of \u201cgetting involved in the company actively, possibly in the sales area or management area,\u201d but Joseph made it clear that he would be made an officer in at least one of the corporations \u201cimmediately or fairly immediately\u201d after he invested. Eventually, Kurrle did begin working in the office. He became secretary/treasurer of Financial and Insulation, was a signatory on the company bank accounts, had a telephone listing, as \u201cArlo Kurrle, Financial Consultant,\u201d and obtained a business license. The work he did for Joseph and Financial consisted of updating loan source lists and contacting potential lenders under a \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d arrangement with Joseph. He also developed a demonstration kit used by Dennis in his sales presentations and accompanied Dennis on calls.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">It may be, of course, that these aspects of Kurrle\u2019s participation were mere \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and that in fact, the success of his investment was never intended to depend on his \u201cprofessional or managerial skill [or the] authority corresponding with his responsibility . . . .\u201d <em>(Coster, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at p. 1194.) The record does suggest that appellants had no real intention of employing Kurrle\u2019s talents in managing any of the three companies and that they contemplated that only <em>their </em>skill and services would determine the fate of the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">However, resolution of this question was for the jury in the first instance, not for the trial court. That resolution was further complicated by the court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence regarding Kurrle\u2019s contemplated participation in the business. Thus, in the event of a retrial, the trial court should permit such evidence. It should also, at a minimum, instruct the jury in the statutory definition of a \u201csecurity.\u201d Should appellant request additional instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tions on the \u201cinvestor passivity\u201d factor, the trial court should give an appropriate instruction to conform to the evidence presented.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201cPut simply, the right to be tried by a jury of one\u2019s peers finally exacted from the king would be meaningless if the king\u2019s judges could call the turn.\u201d <em>(United. States </em>v. <em>Spock, supra, </em>416 F.2d at p. 181, fn. omitted, citing <em>Bushell\u2019s Case, </em>124 Eng. Rep. 1006 (C.P. 1670).) On the issue of whether a \u201csecurity\u201d had been offered or sold to Kurrle, the trial judge did not confine himself to instructing the jury about abstract legal principles or commenting on the evidence. He usurped the jury\u2019s province and applied the law to the facts as he understood them. The court\u2019s instruction erroneously removed an element of the section 25110 charge from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In addition, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that appellants were required only to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the offering was exempted from the qualifications requirement of section 25110. The court compounded that error by instructing that it was unlawful to offer or sell any security unless the security had been \u201cexempted with the Commissioner of Corporations.\u201d These errors require reversal of the judgment. On retrial, the trial court should permit evidence of Kurrle\u2019s participation in appellants\u2019 businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., Grodin, J., and Takei (Taketsugu), J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\">All further statutory references are to the Corporations Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-12\">It is not clear in which of the companies Kurrle believed he was investing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Four of the additional charges against Joseph and three of the additional charges against Dennis involved loans made by Kurrle.

Although the appellate court noted that the trial court \u201cwas authorized to determine as a matter of law and to instruct the jury regarding the legal effect of the terms of the challenged \u2018option to purchase oil and gas lease assignment\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 587), it was careful to point out that <em>\u201c[t]he court did not do so. </em>It was very cautious, very clear and very fair in instructing the jury regarding the effect of the instruments which are involved on this appeal.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\"><em>Howey </em>involved a civil proceeding brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission to restrain the sale of investment contracts involving shares in a citrus grove business. No instruction of the kind challenged here was involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The entirety of the court\u2019s \u201canalysis\u201d is as follows: \u201cThe trial court . . . charged the jury that the certificate which appellants caused to be issued ... is a \u2018security\u2019 within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act, and refused to give an abstract definition of the word \u2018security\u2019 in the language of the statute. This was the proper course to pursue. Whether the certificate constituted a \u2018security\u2019 under the conceded facts of the case was a question of law for the court and did not involve any question of fact whatever. The requested instruction would have left it to the jury to determine as a question of fact what the court rightfully disposed of as a question of law for its sole determination.\u201d (63 Cal.App. at pp. 792-793.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Although the Attorney General does not mention it, the recent appearance of <em>People </em>v. <em>Feno </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 719 [201 Cal.Rptr. 513] on the scene is significant. There, the Court of Appeal reversed a section 25110 conviction on the ground that the instructions erroneously gave the jury the impression that the accused had the burden of proof to show that the transaction did <em>not </em>involve a security. \u201cBy characterizing all joint ventures as \u2018exempt\u2019 the court necessarily assumed the joint venture interests . . . <em>were </em>securities. <em>The court erred in so assuming rather than instructing the jury to decide whether those interests were securities within the meaning of section 25019.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 728, second italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>majority notes, there are two \u201chistorical exceptions\u201d to this principle. (718 F.2d at p. 1324.) The first is that an accused facing a prosecution for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions is not entitled to have the jury decide whether the questions were \u201cpertinent\u201d to the congressional inquiry. <em>(Sinclair </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>279 U.S. at p. 298 [73 L.Ed. at p. 700].) <em>Sinclair </em>has been both criticized and limited to its facts in recent times. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The second exception is that an accused facing a perjury charge for testifying falsely as to a \u201cmaterial\u201d matter (cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 118) is not entitled to have the question of \u201cmateriality\u201d decided by the jury. (See <em>Sinclair, supra, </em>279 U.S. at pp. 298-299 [73 L.Ed. at p. 700]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sagehorn </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 138, 153 [294 P.2d 1062].)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">As counsel for Joseph notes, the continuing validity of these rules may be doubtful in light of <em>In re Winship, supra, </em>397 U.S. 358, and <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>460 U.S. 73. In any event, like the majority in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>this court is \u201creluctant to expand <em>Sinclair\u2019s </em>sweep at the expense of the accused\u2019s right to interpose the jury between himself and the judge.\u201d (718 F.2d at p. 1324.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s final argument is that an instruction like the one given here is essentially a proper comment on the evidence, since it does not tell the jury \u201cwhat facts it should find, but only states the legal characterization of the particular undisputed state of facts.\u201d In the context of this case, the argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Whatever the bounds of appropriate judicial comment, the present instruction went far beyond them. At no time did the trial court indicate that it was merely expressing an opinion on the state of the evidence or that the jury would have the final say on whether the Kurrle note was a \u201csecurity.\u201d As both parties clearly understood, the issue was no longer for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Justice Reynoso\u2019s concurrence is critical of the \u201cextended analysis\u201d which we undertake in reaching this conclusion. He would prefer that today\u2019s holding be based on the premise that the instruction in issue \u201cdepended on questions of fact . . . .\u201d (Cone, opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">This premise is simply a recasting of the old \u201claw/fact\u201d distinction which ignores the due process and jury trial rights implicated in the giving of such an instruction. Moreover, adoption of that premise would lead to a case-by-case determination as to whether instructions of the type given here were permissible. Since today\u2019s opinion should guide not only the trial judge in this case on retrial but also trial and appellate judges throughout this state, some guidelines\u2014and analysis\u2014beyond the facts of this case are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">It also bears noting that instructions like the one given here may not always constitute prejudicial error. While reversal of the judgment for the error discussed in Part II of this opinion renders it unnecessary to decide what standard of prejudice should be used to assess the trial court\u2019s instruction, today\u2019s opinion should not be read as compelling a reversal in every case in which similar instructions were given.
