J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">The Regents of the University of California (University) petitions for review of a decision by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB or the Board). The Board found that housestaif,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who are paid by the University while participating in residency programs at clinics, institutes or hospitals owned or operated by the University, are \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of Government Code section 3562, subdivision (f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA or the Act) (\u00a7 3560 et seq.). Therefore, they are entitled to collective bargaining rights. This court must review the propriety of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Prior to July 1, 1979, Physicians National Housestaif Association (PNHA) chapters representing housestaif at the Irvine, San Francisco and Davis campuses participated in meet-and-confer sessions with representatives of diiferent hospital administrations. During this period, PNHA also received payroll dues deductions from its members\u2019 paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">In 1978, the California Legislature enacted HEERA, which extended collective bargaining rights to employees of the University of California, Has<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>tings College of the Law and the California State University.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 3560, subd. (b).) Shortly after HEERA became effective (July 1, 1979), the University notified PNHA that it did not consider housestaff to be \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the Act. It then ceased making payroll deductions from housestaff salaries to pay PNHA dues. On July 20, 1979, PNHA responded by filing an unfair labor practice charge against the University, alleging that the University had violated section 3571, subdivisions (a) and (b) and section 3585, by refusing to make such deductions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">A hearing before a PERB hearing officer ensued. The evidence consisted of the following:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The University operates medical schools at five of its campuses: Los Angeles (UCLA), San Diego (UCSD), San Francisco (UCSF), Irvine (UCI) and Davis (UCD). Through its medical schools, the University provides residency training programs in most medical specialty and subspecialty areas and operates hospitals at which housestaff gain clinical experience. Other hospitals, both public and private, are also affiliated with these medical schools. Many housestaff rotate through these hospitals during the course of their training.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In the spring of 1979, approximately 4,500 housestaff were participating in University residency programs. Approximately 2,000 of them were on the University payroll. The others were paid by the affiliated institutions at which they served.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In order to participate in a University residency program, an individual must have graduated from medical school with a doctor of medicine (M.D.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>degree. To qualify to practice medicine in California and in most other states, such an individual must complete at least one year in an approved residency program. In California, he or she must also obtain a \u201cphysician\u2019s and surgeon\u2019s certificate\u201d from the Board of Medical Quality Assurance. Until receipt of such a certificate, housestaff may practice medicine only under an approved residency program. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2065.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Most residency programs take between two and six years to complete, depending upon the specialty. The programs are structured so that housestaff rotate through different hospital services relevant to their specialty. Upon successful completion of a residency, an individual receives a certificate entitling him or her to take a specialty board examination leading to board certification in a particular specialty. Board certification is not a requirement for specialty practice, but attests to the physician\u2019s competence in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Board certification requires participation in a training program approved by the Liaison Committee on Graduate Medical Education (LCGME). LCGME sets standards for residency programs, reviews programs for compliance and grants accreditation to programs which meet those standards. In order for University residency programs to acquire LCGME approval, they must comply with the general requirements contained in an LCGME document entitled \u201cEssentials of Accredited Residencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">On April 9, 1980, the PERB hearing officer concluded that housestaff are not employees under HEERA and recommended that PNHA\u2019s unfair labor practice charge be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">PNHA filed exceptions to the proposed decision. On February 14, 1983, PERB rendered a written decision adopting the hearing officer\u2019s findings of facts and making additional factual findings. The Board found that the educational objectives were subordinate to the services housestaff perform and coverage of housestaff under HEERA would further the purposes of the Act. Based on these findings, the Board concluded that housestaff are \u201cemployees.\u201d It further held that the University had violated HEERA by refusing to make payroll deductions. The Board issued a cease and desist order and directed the University to reimburse PNHA for the dues lost during the period for which the University made no payroll deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">This matter is before the court on the University\u2019s petition for a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The first question to be resolved is whether HEERA precludes housestaff from being considered employees under the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201c\u2018The fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.]\u2019\u201d <em>(T. M. Cobb Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 273, 277 [204 Cal.Rptr. 143, 682 P.2d 338].) In determining such intent, the court turns first to the words of the statute. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[W]here . . . the language is clear, there can be no room for interpretation.\u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Pac. Mutual L. Ins. Co. </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 344, 353-354 [139 P.2d 908].)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he board may find student employees whose employment is contingent on their status as students are employees only if the services they provide are unrelated to their educational objectives, or, that those educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform and that coverage under this chapter would further the purposes of this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 3562, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Although the statute is silent on the subject of housestaff, it clearly leaves open the possibility that such persons may come within it. As the words of the statute make clear, the Legislature intended that PERB determine whether a particular student qualifies as an employee under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The legislative history which accompanied the passage of HEERA supports this conclusion. HEERA was enacted by Assembly Bill No. 1091 during the 1977-1978 session. When that bill was first introduced, subdivision (f) contained no reference to students. That provision simply defined \u201cemployees\u201d as \u201cany employee\u201d except managerial and confidential employees. (Assem. Bill No. 1091 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 24, 1977.) This section was subsequently amended to exclude \u201cmanagerial, and confidential employees, and employees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and who work less than 10 hours per week.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1091 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) May 23, 1977. )</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">However, the bill was not passed in this form. On the Senate side, an amendment was passed which eliminated the distinction between student employees based on the number of hours worked. That amendment, which was enacted into law, prescribed a case-by-case assessment of the degree to which a student\u2019s employment is related to his or her educational objectives. The determination of student employee status was expressly left to PERB. (Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1091 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 7, 1978. ) Although this amendment arguably made the status of housestaff more uncertain, it is clear that they were not eliminated from coverage under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>When this statutory history is considered in conjunction with a Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion prepared while the bill was pending, the conclusion is inescapable that the Legislature did not intend to exclude housestaff from coverage under the Act. The Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion was prepared at a time when subdivision (f) contained the exclusion for students employed less than 10 hours per week. The opinion concluded that \u201c[wjhile this [exclusion] indicates an intention to cover students who are employees under some circumstances, it does not resolve the essential issue imposed by the [NLRB] as determining the coverage of student employees.\u201d (Ops. Cal.Legis. Counsel, No. 7522 (May 28, 1978) Housestaff Physicians, p. 3.) The opinion also noted that \u201c[generally speaking, the provisions of A.B. 1091 parallel those of the National Labor Relations Act [NLRA], as amended (Sec. 151 et seq., Title 29, U.S.C.). The [NLRB] ... has concluded that interns and residents are \u2018primarily students\u2019 rather than \u2018employees\u2019 and thus are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act (St. Clare\u2019s Hospital [(1977) 229 NLRB 1000 [95 LRRM 1180]]; and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center [(1976) 223 NLRB 251 [91 LRRM 1398]]). ... [1] <em>We think that in the absence of any more definitive statements in A.B. 1091, the courts would conclude that a similar construction is intended under A.B. 1091 </em>to that given the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act . . . .\u201d (Ops.Cal.Legis. Counsel, No. 7522, <em>supra, </em>at p. 2, italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The Legislature responded to this opinion by amending subdivision (f) to <em>include </em>a \u201cmore definitive statement\u201d as to the status of student employees. That action strongly suggests that the Legislature intended to promulgate a new standard for determining this issue rather than to follow NLRB precedent and deny housestaff employee status.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That action also indicates that the Legislature did not intend to foreclose the issue of housestaff organizational rights. Instead, its creation of a statutory standard distinct from NLRB precedent was intended to permit PERB to make an independent determination of the status of housestaff.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The dissent contends that the Legislature\u2019s amendment was intended to incorporate NLRB precedent into the Act and deny housestaff employee status. This argument requires a comparison of the NLRB precedent with the statutory language ultimately adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The NLRB first addressed the issue of housestaff status in <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center </em>(1976) 223 NLRB 251 [91 LRRM 1398]. Over a strong dissent, the NLRB held that housestaff were not employees under the NLRA, since they \u201care primarily engaged in graduate educational training\u201d and thus are in \u201can educational rather than an employment relationship [with the hospital].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1400 [223 NLRB at p. 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In arriving at that determination, the NLRB focused primarily on the purpose of housestaff participation in such programs. The Board paid little attention to the actual services performed by them. It found that housestaff participate in such programs to gain an education, not to earn a living, and that their selection of programs is primarily motivated by the quality of the training they will receive, rather than the amount of compensation. Further, it noted that while housestaff do perform much unsupervised patient care, this is merely a part of the training they must receive to develop practical skills. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1400 [223 NLRB at p. 253],)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Member Fanning vigorously dissented from the majority\u2019s approach. He argued that the fact that \u201chospitals are instructed to view the primary purpose of housestaff programs as educational has no bearing on whether the housestaff ultimately <em>performs a service for compensation </em>. . . <em>(Cedars-Sinai, supra, </em>91 LRRM at p. 1403 [223 NLRB at p. 256].) Nor did Fanning find any relevance in \u201cthe fact that an individual desirous of becoming an orthopedic surgeon chooses a residency program based on its quality and the opportunity for extensive training.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1404 [223 NLRB at p. 257].) \u201cThat is,\u201d Fanning observed, \u201cnot a unique approach in any field of endeavor, particularly professional ones.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Instead, Fanning thought the Board\u2019s inquiry should focus on the services <em>actually performed </em>by housestaff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Member Fanning was not alone in his criticism of his colleagues\u2019 ruling. (See, e.g., Drake, <em>Labor Problems of Interns and Residents: The Aftermath of Cedars-Sinai </em>(1977) 11 U.S.F. L.Rev. 694; Maute, <em>Student-Workers or Working Students? A Fatal Question for Collective Bargaining of Hospital House Staff </em>(1977) 38 U.Pitt. L.Rev. 762, 767, 772, 786 [hereafter <em>Student-Workers or Working </em>Students]; see generally <em>Scholars or Working Stiffs, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>supra, </em>12 Pacific L.J. 1127.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions chose not to follow the <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>majority. (See, e.g., <em>House Officers, etc. </em>v. <em>U. of Neb. Med. Ctr. </em>(1977) 198 Neb. 697 [255 N.W.2d 258, 261-262]; <em>City of Cambridge and Cambridge Hospital House Officers Association </em>(1976) 2 MLC 1450, 1458-1459 (Mass. Labor Cases).)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">One year after <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>was decided, the NLRB addressed the issue again in <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>(1977) 229 NLRB 1000 [95 LRRM 1180], noting that it \u201cmay not have been as precise as [it] might have been in articulating [its] views\u201d in <em>Cedars-Sinai. </em>(95 LRRM at p. 1181 [229 NLRB at p. 1000], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In these decisions the Board basically adopted a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test, which gave paramount consideration to the students\u2019 subjective intent in participating in housestaff programs. <em>\u201cOur conclusion that housestaff are \u2018primarily students \u2019 rather than employees connotes nothing more than the simple fact that </em>when an individual is providing services at the educational institution itself as part and parcel of his or her educational development <em>the individual\u2019s interest in rendering such services is more academic than economic.\" (St. Clare\u2019s, supra, </em>95 LRRM, at p. 1184 [229 NLRB at p. 1003], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In <em>St. Clare\u2019s, </em>the NLRB also observed that <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>fit within its prior decisions which had classified students into four general categories. (95 LRRM at p. 1181 [229 NLRB at p. 1000].) Two of these categories concern commercial employers and are inapplicable here. The other two categories involved students employed by their own educational institutions either (1) in a capacity <em>unrelated </em>to their course of study <em>(id., </em>at p. 1182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>[229 NLRB at p. 1001]), or (2) in a capacity <em>directly related </em>to their educational program <em>(id., </em>at p. 1183 [229 NLRB at p. 1002]). Both of these categories of students are denied collective bargaining rights. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1182-1183 [229 NLRB at p. 1002].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">After reviewing the various categories of students and noting that house-staff fall within the latter category, the NLRB reaffirmed its conclusion that housestaff are not entitled to collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. \u201cSince the individuals are rendering services which are directly related to\u2014 and indeed constitute an integral part of\u2014their educational program, they are serving primarily as students and not primarily as employees.\u201d <em>(St. Clare\u2019s, supra, </em>95 LRRM at p. 1183 [229 NLRB at p. 1002], fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">It is true, as the University notes, that subdivision (f) uses the \u201crelated/ unrelated\u201d classification scheme that <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>created. However, that is where any similarity between <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>and the present statute ends. While <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>held that both categories of students were per se, <em>not entitled </em>to collective bargaining rights under the NLRA, HEERA <em>expressly </em>permits PERB to find students in both categories <em>entitled </em>to collective bargaining rights in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Under HEERA, the Board may find students who are employed in a capacity <em>unrelated </em>to their course of study to be \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the Act and therefore entitled to collective bargaining rights. Further, PERB may find students who are employed in a capacity <em>related </em>to their educational program entitled to such rights depending on a case-by-case evaluation of (1) whether their educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform, and (2) whether coverage under HEERA would further the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Thus, in defining \u201cemployees\u201d under HEERA, the Legislature specifically rejected the NLRB rulings. Under the NLRB precedent, the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>inquiry is whether the student\u2019s objectives are primarily academic. Under HEERA, even if PERB finds that housestaff are motivated by \u201ceducational objectives,\u201d it may nevertheless classify them as \u201cemployees\u201d if their objectives are \u201csubordinate to the services they perform\u201d and if granting collective bargaining rights would further the purposes of the Act. It is, therefore, clear that instead of denying collective bargaining rights to student employees of public educational institutions, the Legislature intended to permit PERB to grant such rights in situations not permitted under NLRB precedent. If, as the dissent suggests, the Legislature had intended to retain NLRB precedent, it could have easily done so by adopting the language of the NLRA verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The dissent attempts to recast the language of subdivision (f) in order to read it as <em>incorporating </em>the NLRB decisions. With all due respect, this attempt fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The crux of the dissent\u2019s position focuses on \u201c10 rather colorless words\u201d of subdivision (f) (dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 641), which comprise the standard which PERB must apply in determining whether housestaff may be granted collective bargaining rights. Those 10 words declare that students may be classified as \u201cemployees\u201d if \u201cthose educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform . . . .\u201d The dissent argues that those 10 words can be reduced to 2\u2014\u201cprimary purpose.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 641.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The dissent is correct in noting that when the statute refers to <em>\u201cthose </em>educational objectives\u201d it means <em>the student\u2019s </em>educational objectives. This meaning becomes clear when the phrase is read in context with the passage immediately preceding it, which states that PERB may find that \u201cstudent employees . . . are employees ... if the services <em>they </em>provide are unrelated to <em>their </em>educational objectives . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">However, the dissent\u2019s analysis of the phrase immediately following this one is severely flawed. The dissent argues that the clause \u201care subordinate to the services they perform\u201d means the student\u2019s <em>interest </em>in performing those services must be greater than his or her interest in obtaining an education. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 640.) Under this view, in order to qualify as an \u201cemployee\u201d under HEERA, a student\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in performing services must outweigh his or her interest in obtaining an education.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Such an interpretation is improper because it attempts to judicially redraft the Legislature\u2019s language. Surely, this court is not free to rewrite a statute merely because the Legislature has used what some members of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>think are \u201c10 rather colorless words.\u201d (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 847 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">This interpretation, moreover, is not what the Legislature intended. Subdivision (f) makes clear that PERB should determine in each case whether \u201c[the student\u2019s] educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The dissent argues that this language cannot be applied as written because it would require PERB to \u201c \u2018balance\u2019 apples and oranges.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 639.) That is to say, a student\u2019s \u201csubjective\u201d educational objectives cannot be \u201cbalanced\u201d against the \u201cobjective\u201d \u201cservices they perform.\u201d From this premise, the dissent takes a gargantuan leap and concludes that PERB may look only to the students\u2019 subjective balancing as to which aspect of the students\u2019 job <em>they </em>believe is more important. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 640.) The dissent then takes another leap and states that the <em>University\u2019s </em>subjective balancing of these factors is also a determinative factor. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The dissent cites absolutely no authority for this latter proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">While applying the Legislature\u2019s command may be difficult, that is no excuse for disregarding it altogether. The Legislature has clearly <em>not </em>instructed PERB to confine its inquiry to the students\u2019 state of mind. Moreover, nothing in the language of subdivision (f) even <em>hints </em>that the <em>University\u2019s </em>subjective perceptions of the functions of housestaff duties should be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The Legislature has instructed PERB to look not only at the students\u2019 goals, but also at the services they actually perform, to see if the students\u2019 educational objectives, however personally important, are nonetheless subordinate to the services they are required to perform. Thus, even if PERB finds that the students\u2019 motivation for accepting employment was primarily educational, the inquiry does not end here. PERB must look further\u2014to the services actually performed\u2014to determine whether the students\u2019 educational objectives take a back seat to their service obligations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">This interpretation is the only one which remains true to the statutory language. Moreover, it makes sense in light of the events surrounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>passage of HEERA. As noted above, the housestaff issue was clearly on the mind of the Legislature when it enacted this provision. The NLRB had just rendered two controversial decisions on the issue. In those decisions a majority of the Board concentrated primarily on the students\u2019 motivation for entering into housestaff programs. The NLRB dissenter thought the focus should be confined to the services they actually perform, disregarding as irrelevant their motive for taking such jobs. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 609-611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Subdivision (f), as enacted, represents a compromise between the majority and dissenting opinions expressed in the NLRB decisions. HEERA took a middle road, requiring both factors to be considered. It is not the prerogative of this court to act as a super-legislature and alter that legislative choice merely because it may be unwise. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 463 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Another provision of HEERA corroborates the conclusion that housestaff were not excluded, per se, from the benefits of collective bargaining. Section 3562, subdivision (o)(l) defines a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d as a person engaged in work (i) predominantly intellectual and varied in character, (ii) involving the consistent exercise of discretion, (iii) impossible to standardize with respect to output, and (iv) requiring knowledge of an advanced type acquired through a course of specialized intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higher learning or a hospital. A professional employee is also defined as an individual who has completed the courses of specialized intellectual instruction and study described in clause (iv) above and is performing related work under the supervision of a professional person to qualify to become a professional employee. (\u00a7 3562, subd. (o)(2).) Housestaff fit precisely within this definition. The fact that housestaff so clearly fall within the definition of professional employee reinforces the view that the Legislature did not intend housestaff to be excluded under the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>It is noteworthy that at the time HEERA was enacted the vast majority of decisions from other jurisdictions had concluded that housestaff are employees within the meaning of their respective collective bargaining statutes. (See, e.g., <em>House Officers, etc. </em>v. <em>U. of Neb. Med. Ctr., supra, </em>255 N.W.2d 258; <em>Regents of Univ. of Mich. </em>v. <em>Michigan Emp. Rel.

Rather, it left that determination to PERB. Under subdivision (f), the Board determines whether students are employees under the Act by assessing whether the educational objectives are subordinate to the services students perform and whether according them collective bargaining rights would further the purposes of the Act. Since PERB made such a finding here, the only remaining issue is whether there is substantial evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201c[T]he relationship of a reviewing court to an agency such as PERB ... is generally one of deference.\u201d <em>(Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 1007, 1012 [175 Cal.Rptr. 105], citing <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 488, 495 [60 L.Ed.2d 420, 426, 99 S.Ct. 1842]; accord <em>Moreno Valley Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 191, 196 [191 Cal.Rptr. 60].) Such deference is mandated by HEERA itself. \u201cThe findings of the board with respect to questions of fact, including ultimate facts, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, are conclusive.\u201d (\u00a7 3564, subd.

If there is a plausible basis for the Board\u2019s factual decisions, we are not concerned that contrary findings may seem to us equally reasonable, or even more so.

As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201cTo be sure, the requirement for canvassing \u2018the whole record\u2019 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>order to ascertain substantiality does not furnish a calculus of value by which a reviewing court can assess the evidence. Nor was it intended to negative the function of the Labor Board as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect. Nor does it mean that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>(Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Bd. </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 474, 488 [95 L.Ed. 456, 467-468, 71 S.Ct. 456].)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">PERB\u2019s review of the evidence revealed that the patient care services performed by housestaff were an important part of the hospital\u2019s overall service delivery. The Board also found that although housestaff did receive educational benefits in the course of their programs, this aspect was subordinate to the services they performed. The Board made this determination based on (1) the substantial quantity of time housestaff spend on clinical activities and direct patient care, (2) the nature of the procedures housestaff perform with little or no supervision, (3) the professional guidance they provide for interns, medical students and other hospital employees such as nurses and technicians, (4) the extensive indicia of employment that characterize housestaff as employees rather than students, and (5) the extent of the educational benefit and training received by housestaff. A review of the record demonstrates that the Board\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">There was abundant testimony that housestaff provide valuable patient-care services. From their first year of residency, housestaff are immersed in all aspects of direct patient care. They perform physical examinations, obtain patients\u2019 medical histories, develop treatment plans, prescribe drugs, administer dangerous drugs which nurses are not permitted to administer, and perform various operations and procedures. First-year residents normally write all orders for patient treatment and prescriptions. Housestaff are also required to supervise other hospital personnel such as nurses and technicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Some of the procedures performed by housestaff\u2014in most cases with no attending physician present\u2014include bone marrow biopsies, intubation, running of respirators, drawing blood, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administering barium enemas, upper GI\u2019s (evaluations of the intestinal tract), IVP\u2019s (evaluations of the urinary tract), bone marrow aspirations, and placement of catheters. Also, housestaff perform procedures in life-threatening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>situations without the presence of attending physicians, including open chest massage and placement of pacemakers and chest tubes.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Housestaff also deliver babies. They are often called upon to perform Caesarean sections, forcep deliveries and emergency D and C\u2019s (dilation and curettage). In many instances, these procedures are performed in the absence of an attending physician.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Residents are also assigned to outpatient clinics where they treat patients with minor problems and admit patients who require more extensive treatment to the hospital. Attending physicians are rarely consulted in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In the course of providing direct patient care, entry-level residents are supervised by more senior housestaff who generally operate with little or no supervision. In general, a resident is given as much independent patient-care responsibility as he or she is able to handle. In some cases, a patient may be admitted and discharged from the hospital without ever seeing an attending physician. Housestaff are generally the sole physicians providing nighttime care when many emergency medical situations arise since attending physicians are rarely in the hospital at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Housestaff also work very long hours. An 80- or 100-hour week is not uncommon. More than 75 percent of that time is usually spent in direct patient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The remaining time is spent in didactic, or instructional, activities. These activities consist of lectures, weekly \u201cgrand rounds\u201d during which cases are discussed with faculty, and \u201cattending rounds\u201d during which housestaff visit patients with an attending physician or the chief resident. In some specialties, a portion of the resident\u2019s time is set aside for intensive classroom, instructional or research activity. Since patient care is their primary responsibility, it is not uncommon for housestaff to be absent from didactic activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The extensive indicia of employment status also weigh in favor of the Board\u2019s findings. Housestaff are paid with monthly payroll checks from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>which federal and state income taxes are withheld.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In 1979, annual salaries ranged from $15,100 to $21,800. Housestaif receive annual step and cost of living increases. They complete personnel forms, signing as \u201cemployees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Housestaif receive several fringe benefits including paid vacations and medical coverage. Their medical malpractice and workers\u2019 compensation insurance is paid for by the University. On the other hand, housestaif are not included in the University\u2019s retirement system and do not receive life insurance or state unemployment insurance benefits. However, these facts do not detract from other evidence which strongly indicates employee status.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In addition, most indicia of student status are lacking, an omission which provides further support for PERB\u2019s conclusion. Although housestaif are eligible for financial aid, they pay no tuition or student fees. They do not take University examinations. They receive no grades. They do not complete registration forms processed by the registrar\u2019s oifice. They receive no degrees after they have completed their residencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The \u201cEssentials of Accredited Residencies\u201d (hereafter Essentials), which set forth general requirements with which the University residency programs must comply (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 606), also support the Board\u2019s finding. Hospitals in which approved residency programs operate must be conducted \u201cprimarily for the welfare of the patient. . . . <em>\u00a1T]he educational program is supplementary to the primary purpose of the hospital, i. e., the care and management of patients </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The Essentials encourage hospitals to enter into contracts with residents for the purpose of determining salary, hours, working conditions and fringe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>benefits. \u201cIt is inappropriate that house officers be expected to assume increasing responsibility for patient care, while not at the same time participating effectively in communications which contribute ultimately to policy-making decisions. The intern and resident must be integrated into the medical staff as true colleagues in order that effective programs of medical education and patient care be carried out.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Since the University must comply with the Essentials to retain accreditation, these statements cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The University argues that residency programs are primarily of an educational nature. It contends that (1) housestaff participate in the residency programs in order to further their educational development, (2) residency programs are developed by the various departments of the different medical schools to ensure that educational objectives predominate, (3) clinical service and the various tasks and duties required of housestaff are of an educational value, (4) the programs include participation in various didactics such as grand rounds, lectures and efforts to keep informed of the latest medical literature, and (5) clinic service is required by the Essentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The fact that housestaff obtain an educational benefit from providing direct patient-care services does not mean services are subordinate to educational objectives. Such services are undertaken for a patient\u2019s welfare. Obviously, patient demands are such that services must be performed without regard to whether they will provide any educational benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Many services housestaff perform become routine and do not have a continuing educational value. That housestaff must continue to perform them supports PERB\u2019s conclusion that the \u201ceducational\u201d side of the scale is subordinate to the \u201cservices\u201d side.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Also, housestaff do not administer procedures on patients simply to \u201cpolish their skills.\u201d Rather, their day-to-day routine, like that of regular physicians, is dictated almost entirely by the exigencies of injury and disease. In short, although housestaff obviously receive intensive professional training through their work, there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform. In light of that substantial evidence, this court must defer to PERB.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The next step in determining whether housestaff are employees under subdivision (f) is to assess the Board\u2019s finding that granting collective bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>gaining rights to housestaff would further the purposes of HEERA. This determination necessarily involves questions of fact and policy. It is also necessary to bear in mind PERB\u2019s expertise in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In enacting HEERA, the Legislature found that the people of this state \u201chave a fundamental interest in the development of harmonious and cooperative labor relations between the public institutions of higher education and their employees.\u201d (\u00a7 3560, subd. (a).) The Legislature also found that it would be \u201cadvantageous and desirable\u201d to grant collective bargaining rights to higher education employees. (See <em>id,., </em>subd. (b).) As the Legislature declared, \u201c[i]t is the purpose of this chapter to provide the means by which relations between each higher education employer and its employees may assure that the responsibilities and authorities granted to the separate institutions ... are carried out in an atmosphere which permits the fullest participation by employees in the determination of conditions of employment which affect them.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).) \u201cIt is the further purpose of this chapter to provide orderly and clearly defined procedures for meeting and conferring and the resolution of impasses, and to define and prohibit certain practices which are inimical to the public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 3561, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Board found and the record demonstrates that there are substantial employment concerns which affect housestaff, particularly in the area of wages, hours and working conditions. Salaries, vacation time, fringe benefits and hours are manifestly amenable to collective negotiations and have a direct and primary impact on the employment relationship of housestaff with the University. The Board concluded that according housestaff collective bargaining rights would further the purposes of the Act because it would enable them to participate fully in the determination of employment conditions which affect them. Further, the interest of developing \u201charmonious and cooperative labor relations\u201d would be advanced since a viable mechanism for resolving their differences would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">PERB also suggested that denying housestaff collective bargaining rights would have serious ramifications in the public health care field.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, PERB found that according collective bargaining rights to housestaff would provide a viable mechanism for resolving disputes and minimize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>potential for strikes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Lastly, PERB recognized that the quality of patient care is no doubt affected by the conditions under which housestaff are required to render services, and that bargaining over such matters as hours and working conditions may result in higher quality health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Given PERB\u2019s expertise in this area and the reasonableness of its conclusions, deference to PERB\u2019s finding is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The University asserts that if collective bargaining rights were given to housestaff the University\u2019s educational mission would be undermined by requiring bargaining on subjects which are intrinsically tied to the educational aspects of the residency programs. This \u201cdoomsday cry\u201d seems somewhat exaggerated in light of the fact that the University engaged in meet-and-confer sessions with employee organizations representing house-staff <em>prior </em>to the effective date of HEERA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Moreover, the University\u2019s argument is premature. The argument basically concerns the appropriate scope of representation under the Act. (See \u00a7 3562, subd. (q).) Such issues will undoubtedly arise in specific factual contexts in which one side wishes to bargain over a certain subject and the other side does not. These scope-of-representation issues may be resolved by the Board when they arise, since it alone has the responsibility \u201c[t]o determine in disputed cases whether a particular item is within or without the scope of representation.\u201d (\u00a7 3563, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The University also argues that permitting collective bargaining for housestaff may lead to strikes. However, it is widely recognized that collective bargaining is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism which diminishes the probability that vital services will be interrupted. (See <em>San Diego Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 8-9, 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Finally, the University argues that the brief tenure of housestaff\u2019s relationship with the University undermines the conclusion that coverage would further the purposes of the Act. The University acknowledges that many other individuals whose relationship with the University is of short duration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>have been accorded employee status with full bargaining rights. Housestaff should not be treated differently. As the record demonstrates, housestaff in certain residency programs may be employed by the University for up to six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Since there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that educational objectives are subordinate to the services performed by house-staff and granting collective bargaining rights to them will further the purposes of the Act, the Board\u2019s conclusion that housestaff are employees must be affirmed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The HEERA does not preclude housestaff from being considered employees. The Legislature specifically intended that PERB determine whether students are employees under the Act by assessing whether the educational objectives are subordinate to the services students perform and whether according them collective bargaining rights would further the purposes of the Act. Here, the Board\u2019s determination to that effect is supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, the Board properly concluded that housestaff are employees under HEERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The Board\u2019s decision is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Board for reconsideration of its remedy in light of the defunct status of PNHA. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., and Reynoso, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b548-9\">LUCAS, (Campbell), J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AjM\">I respectfully but emphatically dissent. My review of the record convinces me that respondent Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) abused its discretion in this case, by failing to follow the governing statute, Government Code section 3562, subdivision (f) (hereafter subdivision (f)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority opinion compounds this error by mischaracterizing the legislative history and plain meaning of subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(f), thereby improvidently converting this into a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d case when the basic issue actually is whether PERB even understood the Legislature\u2019s directive concerning the factual inquiry PERB was to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In effect, the majority and PERB have concluded that, rather than conducting a bona fide residency program, the University has established its program as a device for procuring a cheap source of skilled medical labor to work in its hospitals. That conclusion, of course, stands the whole idea of university teaching hospitals and residency programs on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In the following portions of this opinion, I shall trace the origins of subdivision (f) and discuss what it really means, on its face. I shall show that the Legislature reacted to the problem of how to define \u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of HEERA by adopting, in subdivision (f), a definitional provision that parallels that contained in the National Labor Relations Act but more fully specifies how PERB is to determine whether student employees of the University are entitled to collective bargaining. More particularly, I shall explain that when the Legislature confronted this issue in 1978, it faced, with respect to housestaif, two approaches to the problem, respectively reflected by the majority and dissenting opinions in the NLRB\u2019s <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>decision. The majority approach was to focus upon the undisputed primary purposes of housestaif in pursuing a residency program; the dissenting approach was to draw upon the undisputed responsibilities and indicia of employment that housestaif bear. The Legislature chose the NLRB majority approach, and fashioned subdivision (f) so as to well-nigh compel PERB to find housestaif not to be employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Somehow, PERB did not get the message. It pursued the same approach as the dissent in the <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>case, and focused upon indicia of employment, deeming it irrelevant that this case involved housestaif at <em>University </em>hospitals, maintained and operated for teaching purposes. The result is a decision that not only ignores the statutory language but also presents a picture of the University\u2019s housestaif program as untrue to its and its students\u2019 purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">While my opinion chiefly treats the fundamental statutory question, it concludes with an explanation of what I perceive to be the proper disposition of this case. That disposition is to issue a writ of mandate directing PERB to vacate its decision and issue a new decision applying the statute as the Legislature intended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The National Background</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Students or Employees? Undisputed Facts, Flexible Law</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">An initial review of events outside of California is necessary to provide perspective for understanding the majority opinion\u2019s misperception of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The question whether housestaff are entitled to collective bargaining rights was hotly contested in several jurisdictions before the enactment of HEERA in 1978. The battle, however, involved primarily questions of statutory interpretation and semantics, because the congeries of facts considered by various courts and labor boards were generally consistent if not fungible with each other and, for that matter, with the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">For example, in the two leading decisions holding housestaff \u201cstudents\u201d rather than \u201cemployees\u201d and thereby denying them collective bargaining <em>(Cedars-Sinai Medical Center </em>(1976) 223 NLRB 251 [91 LRRM 1398] (hereafter Cedars) and <em>Pa. Ass\u2019n of Int. &amp; Res. </em>v. <em>Albert Einstein Med. Ctr. </em>(1976) 470 Pa. 562 [369 A.2d 711] (hereafter <em>Pennsylvania)), </em>the undisputed record disclosed that housestaff shared the same attributes and conditions that PERB here found dispositive\u2014extensive time spent in clinical activities and direct patient care; performance of medical procedures with little or no \u201cattending\u201d supervision; guidance given to other housestaff, medical students, and hospital personnel; and \u201cindicia of employment\u201d such as stipends paid, workers\u2019 compensation insurance provided, and federal income tax withheld. (Compare <em>Cedars, </em>223 NLRB at p. 252 (maj. opn.), and pp. 255-256 (dis. opn.), and <em>Pennsylvania, </em>369 A.2d at p. 714, with maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 617-619.) Conversely, in the two leading decisions granting housestaff the right to bargain <em>(Regents of Univ. of Mich. </em>v. <em>Michigan Emp. Rel. Com\u2019n </em>(1973) 389 Mich. 96 [204 N.W.2d 218] (hereafter <em>Michigan) </em>and <em>House Officers, etc. </em>v. <em>U. of Neb. Med. Ctr. </em>(1977) 198 Neb. 697 [255 N.W.2d 258] (hereafter <em>Nebraska), </em>the record included not only similar facts but also undisputed evidence of many of the elements upon which the University relies in the present case\u2014most significantly, that housestaff\u2019s <em>purpose </em>in pursuing a residency program was educational and that the extensive and demanding patient care activities that dominated the program subserved an educational function. (Compare <em>Michigan, </em>204 N.W.2d at pp. 225-226 and <em>Nebraska, 255 </em>N.W.2d at pp. 260-261 with maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The dispositive factor in these conflicting decisions thus was not the factual record developed concerning \u201cthe facts of housestaff life.\u201d These are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>essentially universal, and all of the aforementioned cases concurred that housestaff, as a practical matter, are <em>both </em>students and employees. The cases holding in favor of collective bargaining expressly so stated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and those holding to the contrary were forced to concede effectively as much.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where the cases ultimately divided was in the emphasis the determining tribunal placed upon the \u201cstudent\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d factors in construing and applying the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">Here too, the prior cases discussed above had something in common. In each jurisdiction, the determination whether collective bargaining would appertain revolved around application of a statute that granted such rights to \u201cemployees\u201d without further defining what that term meant except in very broad and inclusive terms. The upshot of this statutory situation was that in Michigan and Nebraska, courts holding in favor of housestaff and against the universities had a relatively easy task in justifying their decisions as to employee status under the governing statutes. The majority opinion here has quoted the <em>Michigan </em>court\u2019s expression on the subject <em>(ante, </em>p. 614, fn. 13); the <em>Nebraska </em>court\u2019s reasoning was very similar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On the other hand, the <em>Pennsylvania </em>court, when faced with applying a statute that defined \u201cpublic employee\u201d as \u201cany individual employed by a public employer\u201d (see 369 A.2d at p. 714), divided four to three in favor of Temple University when it held that housestaff were not such employees. Like the NLRB in <em>Cedars, </em>the <em>Pennsylvania </em>majority conceded that house-staff possessed numerous \u201cemployee\u201d attributes but focused upon house-staff\u2019s own <em>purpose </em>in serving as such, and concluded that since the young physicians and medical school graduates (interns) \u201cat Temple University <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>[were] at Temple not for the primary purpose of obtaining monetary remuneration, but rather to fulfill educational requirements,\u201d they should not be considered employees under the enabling act. (369 A.2d at pp. 714-715.) This holding evoked vociferous dissents, not to the court\u2019s characterization of housestaff\u2019s purposes but rather to its reliance on them in interpreting and applying the statute. While conceding, at least arguendo, that house-staff\u2019s personal and professional purposes were educational, the dissenters deemed this irrelevant. In their view, the extensive indicia of employment to which the majority also had alluded should have been dispositive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The dissenting position in <em>Pennsylvania </em>paralleled that of dissenting NLRB Member Fanning in <em>Cedars. </em>(See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 610; see also <em>post, </em>pp. 641-642.) And the <em>Cedars </em>majority likewise employed a mode of analysis quite similar to that of the <em>Pennsylvania </em>court, which followed it. <em>Cedars, </em>however, deserves further discussion, for reasons that will soon become apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The governing statute in <em>Cedars </em>was section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (hereafter the NLRA or the Act), 29 United States Code section 152(3), which provides in relevant part that \u201cThe term \u2018employee\u2019 shall include any employee . . . unless this [Act] explicitly states otherwise . . .,\u201d and then proceeds to list some of the Act\u2019s few explicit exceptions. In short, as the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cThe Act provides broadly that \u2018employees\u2019 have organizational and other rights. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. Section 2(3) defines \u2018employee\u2019 in general terms, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) . . . .\u201d <em>(NLRB </em>v. <em>Yeshiva University </em>(1980) 444 U.S. 672, 681, fn. 12 [63 L.Ed.2d 115, 125, 100 S.Ct. 856].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The exceptions listed in section 2(3) do not, on their face, include house-staff. In <em>Cedars, </em>the NLRB nonetheless found and held that housestaff were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>not employees in the legal sense of the Act\u2014principally because of the purpose of the residency program and the purpose of housestaff in participating in it. Those factors led the NLRB, in its own words, to \u201cfind that interns, residents and clinical fellows are primarily engaged in graduate educational training at Cedars-Sinai and that their status is therefore that of students rather than of employees.\u201d (223 NLRB at p. 253.) The NLRB\u2019s specific findings concerning the nature and purpose of the residency programs, and the purposes of housestaff in pursuing them, merit quotation here at length for purposes of further allusion later:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u201cThe record shows that the medical education and training of a physician involves a progression from classroom and laboratory education in the basic and clinical sciences, through an internship, and usually then to a period of more advanced training in a specialty or subspecialty of medicine. It is the purpose of internship and residency programs to put into practice the principles of preventive medicine, diagnosis, therapy, and management of patients that the medical school graduate learned in medical school.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u201cFrom the foregoing and the entire record, we find that interns, residents, and clinical fellows are primarily engaged in graduate educational training at Cedars-Sinai and that their status is therefore that of students rather than of employees. They participate in these programs not for the purpose of earning a living; instead they are there to pursue the graduate medical education that is a requirement for the practice of medicine. An internship is a requirement for the examination for licensing. And residency and fellowship programs are necessary to qualify for certification in specialties and subspecialties. While the housestaff spends a great percentage of their time in direct patient care, this is simply the means by which the learning process is carried out. It is only through this direct involvement with patients that the graduate medical student is able to acquire the necessary diagnostic skills and experience to practice his profession. The number of hours worked or the quality of the care rendered to the patients does not result in any change in monetary compensation paid to the housestaff members. The stipend remains fixed and it seems clear that the payments are more in the nature of a living allowance than compensation for services rendered. Nor does it appear that those applying for such programs attached any great significance to the amount of the stipend. Rather their choice was based on the quality of the educational program and the opportunity for an extensive training experience. The programs themselves were designed not for the purpose of meeting the hospital\u2019s staffing requirements, but rather to allow the [housestaff] to develop, in a hospital setting, the clinical judgment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the proficiency in clinical skills necessary to the practice of medicine in the area of [their] choice. . . . The \u2018Essentials,\u2019 which describe the standards for approved internships and residencies, indicate that the primary function is educational. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u201cIn sum, we believe that interns, residents, and clinical fellows are primarily students. We conclude, therefore, that they are not employees within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the Act. Accordingly, no question affecting commerce exists concerning the representation of \u2018employees\u2019 of the Employer within the meaning of Section 9(c) of the Act, and we shall dismiss the petition herein.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 251, 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Within six months after filing its <em>Cedars </em>decision, the NLRB further explained its rationale. In <em>Kansas City General Hospital and Medical Center </em>(1976) 225 NLRB 108 [92 LRRM 1379] (hereafter <em>Kansas City General Hospital)), </em>the board had dismissed another housestaff representation petition, relying on <em>Cedars, </em>but had included language to the effect that the hospital employer was not an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined in the Act, because its housestaff were not \u201cemployees\u201d under section 2(3). A New York trial court picked up this reference and held that since the NLRB was now saying that private hospitals were not \u201cemployers\u201d\u2014defined in the Act in an interlocking way with other terms so as to establish, inter alia, the NLRB\u2019s federally preemptive range of jurisdiction over labor representation decisions\u2014then the <em>states </em>could regulate that subject with respect to housestaff in private hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The NLRB closed this \u201cloophole\u201d by filing a \u201cRevised Decision and Order\u201d in <em>Kansas City General Hospital, </em>nunc pro tunc, in which it deleted the language about \u201cemployers\u201d and reiterated <em>Cedars\u2019 </em>finding that house-staff\u2019s nonemployee status was dispositive. In addition, the NLRB\u2019s revised, four-to-one opinion (the earlier decision had been rendered by a three-member panel) further recharacterized <em>Cedars </em>as having held that to extend collective bargaining to housestaff would be antithetical to the policies and purposes of the NLRA (which <em>Cedars </em>actually had never explicitly held). I quote the concluding paragraph of the NLRB\u2019s revised opinion: \u201cTurning to the preemption question, we believe that it has now become necessary for us to state explicitly that which is, in our view, implicit in the Board\u2019s Decision in <em>Cedars-Sinai; </em>that is, at the risk of being somewhat repetitious, that the majority of this Board intended by its decision therein to find Federal preemption of the health care field to preclude States from exercising their power to regulate in this area. It is our judgment that the Congress, in passing the 1974 health care amendments, simply made a determination that residents, interns, and fellows, <em>inter alia, </em>were not super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>visors within the meaning of the Act, but left the question as to whether they were \u2018employees\u2019 entitled to collective-bargaining rights for resolution by the Board in the exercise of its discretion. Having exercised its discretion in <em>Cedars-Sinai, </em>by finding residents, interns, and fellows to be primarily students and not \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of the Act, the Board confirmed, in our view, that it has not put hospital residents and interns beyond the reach of national labor policy, but has rather held that to extend them collective-bargaining rights would be contrary to that very policy.\u201d (225 NLRB at p. 109 (fn. omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">From the standpoint of administrative functions and effects, this recharacterization of <em>Cedars </em>was accurate. In <em>Board </em>v. <em>Hearst Publications </em>(1944) 322 U.S. 111 [88 L.Ed. 1170, 64 S.Ct. 851], the Supreme Court explained that by defining employees only generally in the Act the Congress had entrusted to the NLRB resolution of whether particular employees fell within that statutory definition, and that in performing this function the NLRB was not limited by state law concepts but rather was supposed to apply and vitalize \u201cfederal legislation, administered by a national agency [and] intended to solve a national problem on a national scale.\u201d (Id., at p. 123 [88 L.Ed. at p. 1180]; <em>see id., </em>at pp. 120-124, 130-132 [88 L.Ed. at pp. 1178-1181, 1184-1185].) On the other hand, Member Fanning\u2014again the sole dissenter\u2014was also correct in noting that the NLRB had gone about its business in an awkward way. (See <em>Kansas City General Hospital, supra, </em>225 NLRB at p. 109 (dis. opn.).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>I pause at this point to make two general comments about the significance of the <em>Cedars </em>decision to the national housestaff-university contest over collective bargaining and about <em>Cedars\u2019 </em>relationship to the NLRB\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>St. Clare\u2019s Hospital &amp; Health Center </em>(1977) 229 NLRB 1000 [95 LRRM 1180] <em>(St. Clare\u2019s). </em>The majority opinion has seriously underestimated <em>Cedars\u2019 </em>importance in both contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">First, the majority opinion notes that <em>Cedars </em>was not an enthusiastically received decision in all quarters. <em>(Ante, </em>p. 610.) That is true, and <em>Cedars\u2019 </em>interpretation and application of the NLRA is certainly an interesting topic for academic debate. However, that holding is now final: not only was <em>Cedars </em>repeatedly reaffirmed by the NLRB (e.g., in <em>Kansas City General Hospital), </em>it later was judicially upheld as not clearly erroneous and therefore unreviewable under the NLRA, in <em>Physicians Nat. House Staff Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fanning </em>(D.C. Cir. 1980) 642 F.2d 492 [57 A.L.R. Fed. 577] (en banc), cert. den. (1981) 450 U.S. 917 [67 L.Ed.2d 342, 101 S.Ct. 1360], The result of this condition of federal law is that, according to one of our informed amici, 64 percent of the 1,554 hospitals which today sponsor residency programs in the United States are controlled by that decision, and their housestaff accordingly are denied collective bargaining unless the hospitals agree to engage in it voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Second, a proper understanding of the NLRB\u2019s position concerning housestaff\u2019s status as \u201cemployees\u201d vel non under the NLRA requires that <em>Cedars </em>and its rationale not be disregarded in favor of the <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>decision. <em>Cedars </em>was and is the seminal and dispositive interpretation of the Act concerning housestaff. It also was the case in which the NLRB rendered its findings of fact concerning housestaff\u2019s predominantly educational objectives and the educational purposes of residency programs, some of which I have quoted above. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 629-630.) In contrast, <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>was an opinion rendered upon denial of a motion for reconsideration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>NLRB used as a vehicle for expounding how Cedars\u2014at least in the majority\u2019s view\u2014had been consistent with prior NLRB decisions concerning student employees. (See <em>St. Clare\u2019s, </em>229 NLRB at pp. 1000, 1003.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Moreover, while <em>Cedars </em>had been decided by a four-to-one majority, <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>drew not only a renewed dissent from Member (now Chairman) Fanning, but also a special concurrence from another member, Jenkins. He stated, \u201cI concur, on the basis of <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>and <em>Kansas City General Hospital, </em>in the result reached by the majority, but in very little of their additional reasoning. . . . [I]t is necessary that I disassociate myself from the majority decision, except in result.\u201d (Id., at pp. 1004-1005 (cone, opn.).) And in fact, the <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>majority opinion disclosed that yet another NLRB member, Murphy, \u201cis sympathetic to Member Jenkins\u2019 concurrence because she agrees that the decisions in <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>and <em>Kansas City General Hospital </em>[remainder of citation omitted] adequately set forth the Board\u2019s reasoning. However, under the circumstances of this case, she joins the majority herein.\u201d (Id., at p. 1000, fn. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">I do not by these comments mean to suggest that <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>was not a significant decision by the NLRB concerning student employees. It was, and it underscored the second rationale to <em>Cedars \u2019 </em>exclusion of housestaff from the Act\u2019s category of covered employees that the NLRB had articulated in <em>Kansas City General Hospital </em>(namely, that collective bargaining by student employees who \u201care serving primarily as students and not primarily as employees\u201d is incompatible with the policies and purposes of the Act). <em>(St. Clare\u2019s, </em>229 NLRB at p. 1002; see also <em>id., </em>at pp. 1003-1004.) What I do mean to stress is that <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>was a reaffirmation as well as an \u201cexpansion\u201d of <em>Cedars, </em>and that <em>Cedars </em>remained (and remains) at least as important as <em>St. Clare\u2019s, </em>if not more so, to our understanding of the NLRB\u2019s treatment of housestaff that preceded the enactment of HEERA in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In fact, as will shortly be seen, Cedars\u2014as well as its parallel and discordant state court counterparts discussed hereinabove\u2014constitutes an immensely significant element of the legislative history and meaning of the statute at issue in this case, subdivision (f). The extent of this significance has been \u201chidden in plain sight\u201d throughout the six years during which this case has been pending\u2014hidden in a verbal \u201criddle\u201d (to use the Court of Appeal\u2019s term) that has eluded all of us but which, upon a few moments critical and dispassionate analysis, becomes clear. I proceed now to the principal topic at hand, the California legislative solution to the Universityhousestaff controversy over collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The Legislature\u2019s Mandate: Partial Rejection of <em>St. Clares </em>But Codification of <em>Cedars </em>for Housestaff</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In 1977, one year after <em>Cedars </em>and about the time that <em>Pennsylvania </em>and <em>Nebraska </em>were being handed down, the ongoing national contest over collective bargaining for housestaff moved to California. In that year the Legislature began the process of enacting HEERA, a new collective bargaining statute for the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and California State University. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, \u00a7 3560, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">This was to be, apparently, the first such statute in the United States directed solely at higher education employers and employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its enactment presented both the University and its housestaff\u2014the most \u201coverworked and underpaid\u201d student employees\u2014with the opportunity to seek enactment of a definition of covered \u201cemployee\u201d that would reduce the uncertainty of outcome that had attended decisions in other jurisdictions, with their general and uninformative definitional statutes. And given the prior cases, there could have been no doubt that the wording of the definition would prove critical: it could reasonably be anticipated\u2014as proved to be so\u2014that the ultimate factual record in any quasi-judicial or judicial proceeding about housestaff\u2019s dual identity as students and employees would closely resemble those developed and applied in <em>Cedars </em>and its state-court counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The majority opinion to some extent traces the legislative history of the enactment that ultimately emerged after a year and a half of lobbying and amendment, and purports to analyze the statute and its legislative history in light of the NLRB case law. <em>{Ante, </em>pp. 607-612.) The conclusion reached is that the Legislature did not intend to exclude or preclude housestaff from coverage under HEERA. <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 608, 617.) But this analysis is incomplete and therefore misleading. An informed appraisal of the very materials considered in the majority opinion yields the same conclusion that a plain but discriminating reading of the statutory language compels: that the Legislature resolved the question of housestaff status in favor of the University\u2019s (and the NLRB\u2019s) position, by enacting in subdivision (f) a definition of \u201cemployee\u201d designed to preordain the result of this administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The original version of subdivision (f), introduced by Assemblyman Berman on March 24, 1977, was a virtual copy of the definition of employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>that had been applied in the <em>Cedars </em>case (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3); fn. 6 <em>ante). </em>(Assem. Bill No. 1091 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 24, 1977.) On May 23, 1977, the bill was amended in the Assembly in a fashion that, on its face, pointed more heavily in favor of housestaff\u2019s position: the bill\u2019s only exclusions from the omnibus and circular definition of \u201cemployees\u201d were altered from simply \u201cmanagerial and confidential employees\u201d to refer specifically to \u201cemployees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and who work less than 10 hours per week . . . .\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 1091 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) May 23, 1977.) Clearly, this exclusion evinced a negative pregnant in favor of housestaff, because their herculean work week certainly exceeds 10 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Three days after introduction of this amendment, the NLRB filed its decision denying the motion for reconsideration in <em>St. Clare\u2019s. </em>I have already explained the significance of that case and placed it in context <em>(ante, </em>pp. 632-633). There, the NLRB explains that: \u201cThe rationale for dismissing such petitions [as this] is a relatively simple and straightforward one. Since the individuals are rendering services which are directly related to\u2014and indeed constitute an integral part of\u2014their educational program, they are serving primarily as students and not primarily as employees. In our view this is a very fundamental distinction for it means that the mutual interests of the students and the educational institution in the services being rendered are predominantly academic rather than economic in nature. Such interests are completely foreign to the normal employment relationship and, in our judgment, are not readily adaptable to the collective-bargaining process. It is for this reason that the Board has determined that the national labor policy does not require\u2014and in fact precludes\u2014the extension of collective-bargaining rights and obligations to situations such as the one now before us.\u201d (229 NLRB at p. 1002 (fn. omitted).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>One year later, Senator Carpenter received a Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion concerning whether the still extant 1977 version of subdivision (f) would cover housestaff. I quote the relevant portions of the Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the provisions of A.B. 1091 parallel those of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended (Sec. 151 et seq., Title 29, U.S.C.). The National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency which administers the National Labor Relations Act, has concluded that interns and residents are \u2018primarily students\u2019 rather than \u2018employees\u2019 and thus, are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act <em>(St. Clare\u2019s Hospital and Health Center and the Committee of Interns and Residents, </em>229 NLRB No. 158, 1977-78 CCH NLRB Para. 18,201; and <em>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, </em>223 NLRB No. 57, 1975-76 CCH NLRB Para. 16,690; see, however, H.R. 2222 which would amend the National Labor Relations Act to cover such interns and residents, and Report No. 95-980, House of Representatives, 95th Congress, Second Session wherein the majority of a committee reporting on the bill concludes that housestaff are employees).[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cWe think that in the absence of any more definitive statements in A.B. 1091, the courts would conclude that a similar construction is intended under A.B. 1091 to that given the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (see <em>Estate of Simpson, </em>43 Cal.2d 594, 600).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cIn this connection, however, it should be noted that A.B. 1091 in its definition of \u2018employee\u2019 specifically excludes employees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and who work less than 10 hours per week, thus implying that employees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and work more than 10 hours per week are employees under the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cWhile this indicates an intention to cover students who are employees under some circumstances, it does not resolve the essential issue imposed by the National Labor Relations Board as determining the coverage of student employees. The Board in the <em>St. Clare\u2019s Hospital </em>case, <em>supra, </em>stated as follows: \u2018Since the individuals are rendering services which are directly related to\u2014and indeed constitute an integral part of\u2014their education [szc] program, they are serving primarily as students and not primarily as employees. In our view this is a very fundamental distinction for it means that the mutual interests of the students and the educational institution in the services being rendered are predominantly academic rather than economic in nature. Such interests are completely foreign to the normal employment relationship, and in our judgment, are not readily adaptable to the collective-bargaining process. It is for this reason that the board has determined that national labor policy does not require\u2014and in fact precludes\u2014the extension of collective-bargaining rights and obligations to situations such as the one now before us.\u2019 (1977-78 CCH NLRB Para. 18,201 at page 30,212.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cThus, the inclusion of students as employees without making any distinction between those employed merely for economic reasons and those employed as a part of the educational program does not resolve the question concerning the status of interns and residents, and, in construing A.B. 1091, we think it more probable that the courts would follow the construction given similar provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d (Ops.Cal.Legis. Counsel, No. 7522 (May 24, 1978) Housestaff Physicians, pp. 2-4.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The majority opinion infers that the next and ultimate version of subdivision (f) was written and enacted in response to this Legislative Counsel Opinion, and states that consideration of the statutory history \u201cin conjunction with [the] Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion\u201d creates an \u201cinescapable . . . conclusion\u201d concerning the Legislature\u2019s intentions regarding housestaff coverage under HEERA. <em>(Ante, </em>p. 608.) I concur. I also concur with the majority opinion that the question how the Legislature responded to the challenge laid down by its counsel\u2019s opinion may\u2014indeed must\u2014be answered by ascertaining the intent of the Legislature from the very language it used, aided to the extent necessary by consideration of the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>history. (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 607, 609.) Where I differ with the majority opinion\u2014 diametrically\u2014is in what the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of this statute is, generally and concerning housestaff in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The relevant language of subdivision (f) reads thus:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cThe board may find student employees whose employment is contingent on their status as students are employees <em>only if[ </em>1] the services they provide are unrelated to their educational objectives, or, [2(a)] that those educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform and [2(b)] that coverage under this chapter would further the purposes of this chapter.\u201d (Italics and bracketed numbers added.) This is quite a complex verbal formula, and comprehension of its plain meaning requires that one take it a step at a time; hence my bracketed division of the sentence. I proceed to explain and interpret the words of the statute, harmoniously together but with reference to the separate clauses I have indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">First, clause [1], which in context provides that PERB may find student employees to be \u201cemployees\u201d if the services they provide are unrelated to their educational objectives. This is a variant of the scheme of the NLRA as discussed in <em>St. Clare\u2019s. </em>Recall two things. First, under the NLRA\u2019s definitional section, 29 United States Code section 152(3), employees are defined only generally\u2014and in virtually the exact language used in subdivision (f) before our \u201cstudent\u201d portion\u2014and the NLRB does the rest of the defining in its discretion, balancing various factors such as its perception of the demands of \u201cthe national labor policy.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 607-608, 610; <em>Physicians Nat. House Staff Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fanning, supra, </em>642 F.2d at pp. 496-497.) Second, in <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>the NLRB declared that students employed by their schools \u201cin a capacity unrelated to their course of study\u201d were to be denied collective bargaining. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 10.) The plain meaning of clause [1] of subdivision (f) thus is a qualified partial rejection of this approach. Presumably conscious of the Legislative Counsel\u2019s expectation that the courts\u2014including if necessary this court\u2014would construe subdivision (f) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>much as the NLRB had construed 29 United States Code section 152(3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Legislature here empowered PERB and the courts to deviate from the <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>dictum and bring student employees who provide services to their campus unrelated to their educational objectives into subdivision (f)\u2019s legal definition of employees entitled to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In short, subdivision (f) as a whole parallels 29 United States Code section 152(3) in general, but with respect to students whose employment is unrelated to their studies (e.g., cafeteria workers at UCLA majoring in physics) it <em>permits </em>the PERB to deviate from NLRB precedent <em>{St. Clare\u2019s </em>and its antecedents) if it so chooses, in its informed discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Having thus clarified clause [1], I turn to the more critical portion of subdivision (f), my clause [2(a)]. It is this portion of subdivision (f) that was addressed, at least inter alia, to housestaif, and which governs this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Like clause [1], clause [2(a)] was enacted in direct response to the Legislative Counsel\u2019s advice to its client that the status of housestaif under Assembly Bill No. 1091 could not be definitively resolved without making explicit \u201cdistinction^] between those employed merely for economic reasons and those employed as a part of the educational program . . . .\u201d (Ops. Cal. Legis. Counsel, <em>supra, </em>p. 3.) The Legislature took up this challenge, and did resolve the distinction, in a novel and sophisticated fashion. Clause [2(a)] empowered PERB to deviate from NLRA precedents, and find that students employed in capacities related to their studies are employees for purposes of HEERA, but <em>\u201conly\u201d </em>if PERB first found as a matter of fact that their \u201ceducational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform\u201d (and then also concluded \u201cthat coverage under this chapter would further the purposes of this chapter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Now, what is the meaning of the legal standard set down to guide and govern PERB in making its necessary determination of fact? This is the \u201criddle\u201d which the Court of Appeal came very close to solving, and which PERB and the majority opinion have studiously ignored in their treatment of the central problem of this case. What does it mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The majority opinion implies that the statute charged PERB with performing a balancing test between the relative weight of educational objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>and services performed. <em>(Ante, </em>p. 618.) That is not quite the whole story. One cannot \u201cbalance\u201d apples and oranges without first calibrating the scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Finally, the majority suggests that the correct test requires PERB to look further than the students\u2019 own motivation for accepting employment, and must examine \u201cthe services actually performed\u2014to determine whether the students\u2019 educational objectives take a back seat to their service obligations.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 614.) This analysis represents the crucial difference between the majority\u2019s position and my own: I believe that HEERA assigns <em>primary </em>weight to the students\u2019 own educational objective and purpose in performing the services involved. If the Legislature wanted PERB to concern itself with the educational program itself, and with the question whether it was being properly achieved, the Legislature would have said so. The majority effectively has rewritten HEERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We return then to the plain language of the statute: \u201cthose educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform.\u201d Whose educational objectives? Obviously, the students\u2019 educational objectives: the immediate antecedent of \u201cthose educational objectives\u201d is \u201ctheir educational objectives,\u201d which is used in clause [1] to refer to the educational objectives of the students. What does \u201csubordinate\u201d mean? When used as part of a comparative adjectival phrase contrasting two disparate things, it means, either \u201cplaced in or belonging to a lower order or rank\u201d or, more aptly, \u201cof less importance; secondary. \u201d (Random House College Diet. (rev. ed. 1982) p. 1309.) And how can educational objectives be subordinate to services performed when these are apples and oranges? The answer is, only subjectively, in the contemplation and intention of the students (and in the purposes of their University).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In other words, clause [2(a)] empowered PERB to find that students who are performing services related to their educational objectives are \u201cemployees\u201d under HEERA only if those students\u2019 educational objectives (in so performing services) are of less importance to them (or to the University) than the services they perform. But if the students\u2019 educational objectives in performing services are primary (not secondary) among the students\u2019 (or the University\u2019s) purposes, PERB may not find those students to be employees under HEERA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>This could well be called a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test. And such a test, while difficult to unravel semantically from the Legislature\u2019s 10 rather colorless words, was and is nothing new to the national housestaff-teaching hospital contest over collective bargaining rights. It was\u2014and it is\u2014the test that decided <em>Cedars </em>and <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and evoked such howls of protest from the dissenters and the law reviews. That test is what the Legislature adopted in HEERA as the standard PERB should apply in evaluating whether the University\u2019s housestaff were to be entitled to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">I have quoted above the majority opinions in <em>Cedars </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>as they utilized this approach to determine that housestaff were not employees under a statute that facially covered all \u201cemployees.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 627, 629-630.) But as is often so in legal matters, among the most articulate exponents of a legal rationale that may be difficult to justify under the words of a statute being applied were the dissenters and the law review critics. I shall now let some of them explain the meaning of clause [2(a)] of subdivision (f) just as I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>Cedars, </em>dissenting Member Fanning decried the majority\u2019s reliance on three factors which he thought should not have borne the dispositive weight the majority gave them. These were: (1) the statement in \u201cThe Essentials of Accredited Residencies,\u201d promulgated by the Liaison Committee on Graduate Medical Education, \u201c\u2018that the primary function is educational\u2019\u201d; (2) the NLRB\u2019s finding \u201c\u2018[n]or does it appear that those applying for [housestaff] programs attached any great significance to the amount of the stipend\u2019\u201d; and (3) the majority\u2019s finding that housestaff\u2019s \u201c\u2018choice [of program] was based on the quality of the educational program and the opportunity for an extensive training experience. . . (223 NLRB at pp. 256-257.) Mr. Fanning criticized the majority\u2019s reliance on these factors: (1) \u201cBecause the hospitals are instructed to view the primary purpose of house-staff programs as educational has no bearing on whether the housestaff ultimately <em>performs a service for compensation </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 256 (fn. omitted).) In other words, the primary purpose of the residency program may be educational not service, but the housestaff are still literally employees. (2) \u201cIn the cases before us, there is some support for the proposition that ... the primary value attached to an individual residency or subspecialty is the quality of the institution providing that program, and the opportunity of exposure to a wide range of medical experience.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 257.) In other words, the primary purpose of the housestaff may be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>obtain high quality clinical education. (3) \u201cI fail to perceive how the fact that an individual desirous of becoming an orthopedic surgeon chooses a residency program based on its quality and the opportunity for extensive training bears relevance to the question whether, having done so, he or she is an \u2018employee\u2019 under the Act.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>There are those who may agree with this point, but they do not include the California Legislature: its enactment required that PERB give this factor paramount significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">I turn now to a law review comment cited in the majority opinion. (Maute, <em>Student-Workers or Working Students? A Fatal Question for Collective Bargaining of Hospital House Staff </em>(1977) 38 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 762, cited <em>ante, </em>p. 610.) Criticizing both the <em>Cedars </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>decisions, it commenced as follows: \u201cThis Note examines the practical and economic realities of the house staff-teaching hospital relationship. Research directed at this relationship indicates that house staff provide substantial and essential services to the hospitals. In exchange for these services they are paid size-able \u2018stipends\u2019 and are given benefits which are normally associated with employee status. <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>and [Pennsylvania] are criticized for allowing the primary purpose for affiliation to negate such strong indicia of employment.\u201d {Id., at p. 763.) And at the final point page cited in the majority opinion, the note concluded, \u201cBoth the <em>Cedars-Sinai </em>and [Pennsylvania] decisions focused upon primary purpose for affiliation as a legal fiction which fails to account adequately for the realities of the house staff-teaching hospital relationship. Although educational considerations are undoubtedly important in the selection of a hospital, the terms and conditions of the relationship fit within the classical definition of employment. . . . Initial motivations for the relationship should not negate factors which are strongly indicative of an employment relationship. ...\u201d {Id., at p. 786.) This may or may not be sound advice to a legislature, but the legislative history and language of subdivision (f) establish that the California Legislature rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Another law review comment cited in the majority opinion was written in contemplation of this very case itself. <em>(Scholars or Working Stiffs, supra, </em>12 Pacific L.J. 1127.) I shall allude to portions of that comment to conclude my analysis of clause [2(a)] and also explain, briefly, the significance of clause [2(b)].</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">After reviewing <em>Cedars, St. Clare\u2019s, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nebraska, </em>and a Massachusetts Labor Commission case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the note presents the following summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cThe differing outcomes of these decisions hinged on the use of the primary purpose test. In those states where a resident\u2019s subjective motivation was either ignored or accorded slight weight, housestaff were found to be employees within the meaning of the state\u2019s public employment statute. Conversely, the NLRB and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court employed the primary purpose test and held its result to supersede all other factors in importance. Housestaff selection of a particular residency program primarily because of the educational benefits it offered was held to indicate an academic relationship regardless of what other employment indicia existed.\u201d (12 Pacific L.J. at p. 1137.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Having thus described the test imparted by clause [2(a)] of subdivision (f), the comment proposed that PERB disregard it. \u201cThe application of Section 3562(f) to the housestaff situation involves a determination of whether housestaff educational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform for the hospital and whether granting housestaff collective bargaining rights would further the purposes of HEERA. In arriving at a decision, PERB should disregard the primary purpose test used by the NLRB, as have the majority of the courts and administrative agencies across the nation. The test has been criticized as virtually meaningless and leads to absurd results if carried to its logical conclusion: two persons working side by side in the same profession may have different motivations for working for a particular employer, but if the interest of one is primarily pecuniary and the interest of the other predominantly educational, the primary purpose test would lead to calling one an employee and the other a student. . . .\u201d (12 Pacific L.J. at p. 1143 (fns. omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">This passage evokes two questions. First, as a factual matter, how often could one expect to find a person who has gone through four years of college and four years of medical school (an intern), or who also has a license to practice plus one to six years\u2019 clinical experience (a resident) working an eighty- or one hundred-hour week to earn between $15,000 and $21,800 a year (see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 605, 618-620) because his or her \u201cmotivatio[n] for [so] working ... is primarily pecuniary\u201d? The answer to this question in this case is \u201cnever,\u201d according to the PERB hearing officer\u2019s summary of the testimony which I quoted above (see <em>ante, </em>p. 640, fn. 14). Second, as a legal matter, how could PERB \u201cdisregard the primary purpose test\u201d after the Legislature, drawing upon the experience of the NLRB and the state courts, had crafted that test into 10 words mandating and limiting the factual inquiry PERB was to perform?</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">An answer to the second question is suggested by the Pacific Law Journal comment\u2019s next sentences. It proposes that PERB utilize \u201ca balancing test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>to weigh\u201d housestaff\u2019s and the University\u2019s purposes, together with \u201cindicia of student status,\u201d against \u201cindicia of employee status[,] the treatment of housestaff as employees . . . and agency principles of master-servant.\u201d (12 Pacific L.J. at pp. 1143-1144 (fns. omitted).) There are several serious problems with this suggestion. First, one cannot \u201cbalance\u201d or \u201cweigh\u201d housestaff and University <em>purposes </em>and student or employee indicia\u2014either objectively <em>or </em>subjectively. Second, subdivision (f) requires PERB to consider \u201ceducational objectives . . . [and] services . . . performed]\u201d not \u201ceducational objectives and indicia of student or employee status.\u201d In other words, the comment was proposing that PERB \u201cbalance\u201d the factors debated by the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Cedars </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>under statutes that did not define \u201cemployee,\u201d in disregard of the express definitional language the Legislature had enacted for PERB in response to those (and other) decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">I now turn briefly to clause [2(b)] of subdivision (f), starting with a quotation from <em>Scholars or Working Stiffs, </em>presenting the author\u2019s view of how the Legislature responded in clause [2] of subdivision (f) to <em>St. Clare\u2019s.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u201cIn Section 3562(f), the California Legislature explicitly rejected <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>broad general category of students \u2018whose services are directly related to their educational program\u2019 and divided this classification into two distinct groups: (1) that group of students who perform services which are directly related, but whose educational objectives are subordinate to those services; and (2) that group of students who perform services which are directly related, but whose educational objectives predominate over those services. Coverage under HEERA is to be given to the first group of students if it promotes the purposes of HEERA. . . .\u201d (12 Pacific L.J. at p. 1139 (fns. omitted).)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">This analysis comprehends the plain meaning of clause [2]\u2019s words\u2014but <em>not </em>their full origins and consequent legal significance. The author has failed to read <em>Cedars </em>and <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>closely when analyzing the structure and content of subdivision (f), and has failed to consider <em>Kansas City General Hospital </em>at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As the note says, \u201cCoverage under HEERA is to be given to th[is] . . . group of students if [PERB concludes] it promotes the purposes of HEERA.\u201d And that is an issue that was not specifically addressed in <em>Cedars, </em>which made only findings of ultimate fact about housestaff\u2019s primary purpose. But it <em>was </em>addressed, from the standpoint of the NLRA, in <em>Kansas City General Hospital </em>and again in <em>St. Clare\u2019s. </em>There, the NLRB \u201cadded\u201d a rationale to <em>Cedars </em>and explicitly stated that extending coverage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>NLRA to housestaff would <em>not </em>promote the purposes of the Act. (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 630-631, 635, 637.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Thus we see the true nature and meaning of the legislative compromise wrought by subdivision (f). Clause [1] allowed PERB to deviate from the NLRB\u2019s approach to collective bargaining rights for student-employees of the University who are working unrelated to their educational program. But clauses [2(a)] and [2(b)] were written to confine PERB\u2019s evaluation of housestaff (and other \u201crelatedly employed\u201d students) in such a manner that housestaff would have to leap two potentially insuperable hurdles to qualify as employees under subdivision (f). Of course, there was always the possibility that PERB or the courts would interpret the purposes of HEERA as sufficiently distinct from those of the NLRA to permit the \u201cpolicy\u201d hurdle to be crossed. (But see <em>The Outlines of HEERA, supra, </em>31 Hastings L.J. at p. 564.) But the \u201csubordinateness\u201d hurdle, which comes first, involves a question of fact. Only by ignoring the full meaning of clause [2(a)] and hence the legal import of the facts found by its hearing examiner and purportedly adopted in whole could PERB find housestaff met that qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">By this time, the reader should perceive how profoundly Part II of the majority opinion has failed to analyze the question it purports to address (the meaning of the statute and the intent of the Legislature concerning housestaff). The majority opinion observes, \u201c[i]t is noteworthy that at the time HEERA was enacted the vast majority of decisions from other jurisdictions had concluded that housestaff are employees within the meaning of their respective collective bargaining statutes\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 616), without explaining how those statutes differed from subdivision (f) and why. The majority opinion states that while the statutes did differ, \u201cmany of the factors which led to the conclusion that housestaff are employees are similar to those which are appropriately considered under a subdivision (f) analysis\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 616)\u2014without explaining what factors were involved or how they are even <em>relevant. </em>And so the majority opinion concludes its analysis of the statute and declares that \u201cthe only remaining issue is whether there is substantial evidence to support [PERB\u2019s finding]\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 617). As I will explain, the majority found that substantial evidence existed to support PERB\u2019s decision, but neither the majority nor PERB used the correct statutory standard with which to weigh and consider that evidence. Accordingly, both their decisions are fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">This concludes my analysis of the statutory language and legislative history, except for one other point about the intent of the Legislature concerning housestaff.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The majority opinion states that subdivision (o) of Government Code section 3562\u2014HEERA\u2019s definition of \u201cprofessional employee,\u201d hereafter subdivision (o)\u2014<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\"corroborates the conclusion\u201d that the Legislature intended to allow PERB to reach housestaff under subdivision (f). <em>(Ante, </em>p. 615.) But in its decision, PERB did not address the applicability of subdivision (o). The reason for this omission requires full explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Subdivision (o) was modeled directly on, and is effectively identical to, section 2(12) of the NLRA, 29 United States Code section 152(12). This section of the Act comes into play chiefly in conjunction with section 9(b) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b)), which limits the NLRB\u2019s discretion in determining the appropriate collective bargaining unit by specifically providing \u201cThat the Board shall not (1) decide that any unit is appropriate ... if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit . . . .\u2019\u2019In HEERA, subdivision (o) serves a similar function: Government Code section 3579, which controls PERB\u2019s determination of appropriate bargaining units, provides that \u201cThere shall be a presumption that professional employees and nonprofessional employees shall not be included in the same representation unit. However, the presumption shall be rebuttable . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3579, subd. (b).) The former chairperson of PERB has suggested that although \u201cHEERA\u2019s treatment of professional and nonprofessional employees thus appears to differ from NLRA treatment of the subject, . . . the differences between HEERA and NLRA treatment of professional employee units may be more apparent than real. ...\u201d <em>(The Outlines of HEERA, supra, </em>31 Hastings L.J. at p. 577, fn. 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In any event, there is no material difference between HEERA\u2019s subdivision (o) and its NLRA counterpart.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And under the NLRA, \u201csubdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(o)\u201d has been conclusively adjudicated not to provide any support for housestaif\u2019s position that they should be found \u201cemployees.\u201d That issue was decided in <em>Cedars, </em>where the NLRB held that since housestaif were not \u201cemployees\u201d under a standard later codified in clause [2(a)] of subdivision (f), \u201cwe find no merit in [housestaif\u2019s] contention that they are employees based on Sec. 2(11) and (12) of the Act, which defines the terms \u2018supervisor\u2019 and \u2018professional employee,\u2019 respectively.\u201d <em>(Cedars, </em>223 NLRB at p. 253, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Member Fanning\u2019s dissent on this issue was as emphatic as any part of his opinion, if not more so. (See <em>id., </em>at pp. 257-259 (dis. opn.).) But it remained a minority position. In <em>Physicians\u2019 Nat. House Staff Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fanning, supra, </em>a closely divided United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, en banc, held inter alia that the NLRB had correctly interpreted the statute. <em>(Id., </em>642 F.2d at p. 497.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. And that will probably be the last word from the federal courts on the matter, unless the NLRB someday changes its own position. For the overall holding of the court of appeals was that judicial review of the NLRB\u2019s interpretation and application of the Act in <em>Cedars </em>was not within federal jurisdiction, \u201cbecause the issue did not come within the exception to the non-reviewability of representation decisions established by <em>Leedom </em>v. <em>Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The last quotation comes directly from PERB\u2019s decision. That is the reason why PERB did not and could not rely upon subdivision (o). I quote again from the PERB decision (this time rejecting the University\u2019s position that <em>Cedars </em>and <em>St. Clare\u2019s </em>should be followed in applying subdivision</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">(f))~</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">\u201cThe construction of similar or identical provisions of the NLRA may be used to guide interpretation of HEERA. See, e.g., <em>San Diego Teachers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 1 [154 Cal.Rptr. 893]; <em>Firefighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 608, 616 [116 C.R. 507.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Proper Disposition of This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">With the meaning and intent of subdivision (f) clarified, it remains only to explain how the Legislature\u2019s scheme went awry.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">PERB\u2019s hearing officer made detailed findings of evidentiary facts concerning the nature and conduct of the residency program, including both its \u201cstudent\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d attributes. Predictably, they closely paralleled the facts presented in the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Cedars. </em>(See 223 NLRB at pp. 251-253; <em>id., </em>at pp. 255-257 (dis. opn.).) However, there was one major difference between this case and <em>Cedars. </em>This case involved the University as the employer, and hospitals that were founded and maintained for the very purpose of enabling the University to conduct a postgraduate medical teaching program.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The hearing officer then made his proposed findings of ultimate fact and conclusions of law, while dealing with the contentions of the parties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">As the majority opinion states, \u201cPERB rendered a written decision adopting the hearing officer\u2019s findings of facts and making additional factual findings.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 605.) These findings are set forth in PERB\u2019s decision and are similar to the analysis presented in the majority opinion. (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 618-621.) They are truly remarkable. PERB ignored the findings of fact it had \u201cadopted,\u201d and took the Pacific Law Journal comment\u2019s suggestion one step further. Recognizing that it could not balance indicia of employment and student (University) purposes, objectively or subjectively, PERB did neither. Instead, it simply emphasized the one side of the \u201cbalance\u201d that the statute does not address (indicia of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">When dealing with the Essentials, PERB gave weight only to the statements therein concerning employment indicia and to the portion reiterating that an accredited <em>hospital\u2019s </em>primary purpose is patient care. That, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>course, is a truism for all hospitals, as the Essentials recognize. But what of the further statement in the Essentials that the primary purpose of the residency program is educational\u2014the standard to which the University\u2019s residency program must adhere and perhaps the best evidence of the University\u2019s purposes? PERB deemed it \u201cnot . . . relevant to the Board\u2019s inquiry,\u201d on grounds that the Essentials were \u201cnot concerned with the statutory question of whether housestaff are \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of HEERA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">That is just what Member Fanning, in sole dissent, had said in <em>Cedars. </em>(See <em>ante, </em>p. 641.) But given the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the <em>Cedars </em>majority approach in subdivision (f), the Essentials\u2019 directive that residency programs\u2019 primary purpose is educational was critically relevant, in that it demonstrated the educational objectives of the University, its hospitals, and its students (housestaff).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In short, PERB did not do any balancing at all. Instead, it found, in conclusionary fashion, that the University\u2019s residency program was a fiction: an enterprise designed for educational purposes but conducted in a fashion only to serve the patient community. I quote the decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">\u201c[T]he record demonstrates that the educational benefits housestaff derive from their activities are incidental and therefore subordinate to the primary health care services they provide the patients.\u201d Thus, PERB ignored subdivision (f)\u2019s terms\u2014which speak of \u201ceducational objectives,\u201d not \u201ceducational benefits derived,\u201d and services students \u201cperform,\u201d not \u201cprovide to patients\u201d\u2014and it also ignored the undisputed evidence of the students\u2019 own purposes and educational objectives (see <em>ante, </em>p. 640, fn. 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Similarly, PERB found that \u201cthe educational objectives <em>of the residency program </em>are subordinate to the delivery of services housestaff provide.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The board clearly misapplied the correct test, which would require determination of the <em>students\u2019 </em>educational objectives. In addition, PERB mischaracterized the test as involving \u201cthe educational objectives <em>underlying their [the students] duties </em>(italics added), but nothing in the statute allows their \u201cduties\u201d to control or modify their educational objectives. PERB likewise referred to and used as a factor \u201cemployment characteristics,\u201d but indicia of employment are irrelevant to the students\u2019 own educational objectives or even the nature and extent of the services they actually perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>What then is the proper disposition of this case? It is to grant the University\u2019s petition for writ. That petition is not a petition for writ of review, but actually a petition for writ of mandate. (See <em>Tex-Cal Land Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>ALRB </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 335, 350 [156 Cal.Rptr. 1, 595 P.2d 579].) And since we here are reviewing a final, quasi-adjudicative administrative decision, this may well be considered a petition for writ of administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. (Compare <em>Saleeby </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 547, 560-561 [216 Cal.Rptr. 367, 702 P.2d 525]; see also Gov. Code, \u00a7 3564, subd. (c) [applying the Code of Civil Procedure\u2019s writ provisions to this proceeding \u201cexcept where specifically superseded herein.\u201d].) But in any event, PERB has clearly abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, namely subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">I therefore would grant the University\u2019s petition and issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring PERB to set aside its decision and render a new decision that contains findings applying the statute as it was written to the facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Lucas (Malcolm), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On May 1, 1986, the dissenting opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u201cHousestaff\u201d is a shorthand term used to describe medical interns, residents and clinical fellows.

The associations then formed a new systemwide organization, the California Association of Interns and Residents (CAIR), which now functions as the umbrella organization for housestaff associations in the University system. On January 14, 1985, CAIR moved for an order substituting it as the real party in interest in place of PNHA, on the ground that CAIR is its successor in interest. The University did not oppose the motion, and this court granted it on April 4, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b529-13\">The evidence is discussed in greater detail in Part HI of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Legislative Counsel\u2019s opinion continued: \u201cIn this connection, however, it should be noted that A.B. 1091 in its definition of \u2018employee\u2019 specifically excludes employees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and who work less than 10 hours per week, thus implying that employees who are students on the same campus where they are employed and work more than 10 hours per week are employees under the bill.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cWhile this indicates an intention to cover students who are employees under some circumstances, it does not resolve the essential issue imposed by the [NLRB] as determining the coverage of student employees. The board in the <em>St. Clare\u2019s Hospital </em>case, <em>supra, </em>stated as follows: [H] \u2018Since the individuals are rendering services which are directly related to\u2014 and indeed constitute an integral part of\u2014their education program, they are serving primarily as students and not primarily as employees.

This court may not consider those letters in determining legislative intent, as they simply reflect the motives and understandings of individual legislators. (See <em>San Mateo City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 850, 863 [191 Cal.Rptr. 800, 663 P.2d 523].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The Board summarized its findings as follows: \u201c[Housestaff] participate in these programs not for the purpose of earning a living; instead they are there to pursue the graduate medical education that is a requirement for the practice of medicine. . . . While the house-staff spends a great percentage of their time in direct patient care, this is simply the means by which their learning process is carried out. It is only through direct involvement with patients that the graduate medical student is able to acquire the necessary diagnostic skills and experience to practice his profession. The number of hours worked or the quality of care rendered to the patients does not result in any change in monetary compensation paid to the housestaff members. The stipend remains fixed and it seems clear that the payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>are more in the nature of a living allowance than compensation for services rendered. Nor does it appear that those applying for such programs attached any great significance to the amount of the stipend. Rather their choice was based on the quality of the educational program and the opportunity for an extensive training experience. The programs themselves were designed not for the purpose of meeting the hospital\u2019s staffing requirements, but rather to allow the student to develop in a hospital setting, the clinical judgment and proficiency in clinical skills necessary to the practice of medicine in the area of his choice. The \u2018Essentials,\u2019 which describe the standard for approved internships and residencies, indicate that the primary function is educational. Moreover, the tenure of the housestaff member at Cedars-Sinai is closely related to the length of the student\u2019s training program; thus few interns, residents, or clinical fellows can expect to, or do, remain to establish an employment relationship with Cedars-Sinai following the completion of their programs.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1400 [223 NLRB at p. 253].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Among the factors Fanning found relevant were that (1) housestaff perform many services without supervision; (2) they work long shifts when their \u201cteachers\u201d are not present; (3) the hospital charges fees for the services they perform; (4) Federal taxes are withheld from their pay; (5) they get sick leave, vacation pay, etc.; (6) the hospital is vicariously liable for their actions; and (7) they receive \u201cno degree, <em>no </em>grades, [and] <em>no </em>examinations\u201d for their services. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 1402-1403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">From the patient\u2019s perspective, Fanning noted, the primary interest is undoubtedly the services performed\u2014not the educational value of them. Furthermore, the hospital is able to provide \u201c\u2018competent medical care regularfly,] routinely, or in emergencies as often as [needed]. <em>This would not be possible without either an adequate number of interns and residents or a very large staff of full-time physicians.

The NLRB had earlier reissued an opinion in <em>Kansas City General Hospital &amp; Medical Center </em>(1976) 225 NLRB 108 [93 LRRM 1362], which it modified to conform to its ruling in <em>Cedars-Sinai. </em>Originally, <em>Kansas City </em>had stated in dictum that hospitals were not \u201cemployers\u201d under the NLRA. Since that ruling had led one state court to conclude that state regulation of private hospitals was not preempted by federal labor law, the NLRB changed its position in the subsequent <em>Kansas City </em>ruling. Relying on the logic of <em>Cedars-Sinai, </em>the NLRB held that hospitals are indeed \u201cemployers\u201d under the NLRA\u2014subject to federal regulation and preempting local regulation\u2014even though housestaff are not \u201cemployees.\u201d Thus, the NLRB concluded, hospitals and housestaff are within the reach of national labor policy, but \u201cto extend to [housestaff] collective-bargaining rights would be contrary to that very policy.\u201d (93 LRRM at p. 1364 [225 NLRB at p. 109].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\">As the NLRB explained, \u201cThe rationale for dismissing such petitions [as this] is a relatively simple and straightforward one.

In our view this is a very fundamental distinction for it means that the mutual interests of the students and the educational institution in the services being rendered are predominantly academic rather than economic in nature.

The dissent would have the court read HEBRA as requiring PERB to reach a \u201cpreordained result\u201d on the housestaff issue. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 634.) Thus, under the dissent\u2019s view, this issue would seem to be purely one of law and PERB would have no duty to resolve any factual inquiry into the nature of what housestaff actually do. However, the dissent later claims that PERB should actually determine whether housestaff\u2019s \u201ceducational objectives are subordinate to the services they perform.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 639.) It is not clear what purpose could be served by this factual inquiry if the result is truly \u201cpreordained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The dissent argues that since the language of subdivision (o) in HEERA is essentially identical to the language of the NLRA (see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(12)), the NLRB\u2019s rejection of similar arguments under that provision is dispositive of the issue here. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 645-647.) But NLRB decisions\u2014even if judicially upheld (see dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 647)\u2014are not binding upon PERB, especially in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Cedars-Sinai's holding that housestaff are not \u201cprofessional employees\u201d under NLRA section 2(12) was specifically linked to a NLRB finding that housestaff were not \u201cemployees\u201d generally under section 2(3). In fact, the Board\u2019s analysis of the issue consisted of no more than a one-sentence conclusory footnote to its opinion: \u201cAs we have found, for the reasons stated above, [housestaff] are not employees within the meaning of the Act, we find no merit in Petitioner\u2019s contention that they are employees based on Sec. 2(11) and (12) of the Act, which defines the terms \u2018supervisor\u2019 and \u2018professional employee\u2019 respectively.\u201d (91 LRRM at p. 1400, fn. 4.) As noted above, under HEERA, whether housestaff are \u201cemployees\u201d generally is not so clear, and PERB has determined that they are. Since that determination is a plausible one, the logic of the NLRB decisions, even if applicable, would <em>support </em>the conclusion that they are \u201cprofessional employees\u201d as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The reasoning of <em>Regents-Michigan, supra, </em>204 N.W.2d 218, is illustrative. There, a group of interns and residents organized an association and attempted to bargain with University of Michigan Hospital administrators. When the hospital refused to bargain, the association filed a petition for representation with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC). MERC found that housestaff were employees under the Michigan Public Employees Relations Act (PERA).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed MERC\u2019s finding. (204 N.W.2d at p. 224.) The court noted that PERA created only one exception from its coverage for classified civil service workers. \u201cIf the Legislature had intended to exclude students/employees from the operation of PERA, they could have written such an exception into the law.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The court relied on the following factors: (1) a portion of housestaff\u2019s compensation is withheld for the purposes of federal and state income tax and social security coverage; (2) housestaff receive fringe benefits, including health coverage; (3) compensation is paid by university checks drawn from a university account; (4) housestaff spend over three-quarters of their time providing patient care services; and (5) housestaff are entrusted with many responsibilities that medical students are not, including writing of prescriptions, running outpatient clinics, admitting and discharging patients and performing operations and surgical techniques under little or no supervision. (204 N.W.2d at p. 225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The court concluded that \u201c[ijnterns, residents and postdoctoral fellows are both students and employees. The fact that they are continually acquiring new skills does not detract from the findings of the MERC that they may organize as employees under the provisions of PERA. Members of all professions continue their learning throughout their careers. For example, fledgling lawyers employed by a law firm spend a great deal of time acquiring new skills, yet no one would contend that they are not employees of the law firm. \u201d (204 N.W.2d at p. 226.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">For example, many of the cases cited considered such factors as: the kinds of services housestaff must perform; the amount of time spent performing such services compared to the time spent in formal instruction; the performance of such services without supervision; the obligation to accept assignments regardless of their educational value; the fact that hospitals bill for services provided by housestaff; the inability of hospitals to provide the same level of care without housestaff labor; the manner in which housestaff are compensated; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the treatment of such compensation under tax laws.

In such cases, the Board has historically excluded the students from units which include nonstudent employees, and have not afforded them the privilege of being represented separately. The Board has reasoned that in these situations employment is merely incidental to the students\u2019 primary interest of acquiring an education, and in most instances is designed to supplement financial resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">\u201cAs in the first category, the students\u2019 motive for seeking employment cannot be deemed educational in the sense that it directly enhances their education, and thus in terms of their employment responsibilities they, too, must be considered \u2018primarily employees.\u2019 However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>since their status as employees is in most instances directly related to their continued enrollment at the educational institution, their relationship to the bargaining unit is normally viewed as transitory. It is primarily for this reason that the Board generally excludes students from bargaining units of full-time employees at their own educational institutions.\u201d (229 NLRB at p. 1001.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">(2) Here is the opinion\u2019s discussion of a notable problem with bargaining by housestaff, again explaining (as in the quotation in text) their exclusion as grounded in the national labor policy, and thus, like <em>Kansas City General Hospital, </em>\u201cadding\u201d a rationale to <em>Cedars\u2019 </em>dispositive finding of fact that housestaff\u2019s educational objectives are the predominant reason for their pursuing the employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cThe subject of hours, for example, is of particular relevance when speaking of house-staff. Residents and interns work notoriously long hours. From a strictly educational standpoint, such hours may be necessary in order to provide the students with as broad an experience as possible. Also, it may be educationally desirable for a particular student not only to prepare the diagnosis of a patient, but to administer the treatment as well. Unfortunately, medical emergencies do not always conveniently occur between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Thus, the flexibility which medical educators need to schedule shifts, assignments, transfers, etc., in an educationally sound fashion could become bargainable should the housestaff be afforded collective-bargaining privileges.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1003.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">This legislation was later defeated in the House, with \u201c[opponents of the bill staffing] their agreement with the NLRB\u2019s position that collective bargaining was inappropriate for house staff because their relationship with their hospitals was primarily an educational one.\u201d <em>(Physicians Nat.

However, managerial, and confidential employees shall be excluded from coverage under this chapter.
