Defendants unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was seized during an unreasonable, warrantless search of the apartment. As will appear, we hold that the limited \u201cwalk-through\u201d search was conducted under exigent circumstances excusing the officer from first obtaining a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Defendants Tamborino and Smith are charged with possessing cocaine for the purpose of sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351). Asserting that the evidence supporting the charge was unlawfully obtained, defendants moved to suppress that evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i)) and to dismiss the information <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 995). The trial court, in resolving these motions, considered the transcript of the preliminary hearing and the testimony of one of the arresting officers. The court concluded that the search was lawful and denied defendants\u2019 motions. Defendants (petitioners here) seek a writ of mandate to review and set aside those rulings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">On November 12, 1983, Officer Klein, a Newport Beach police officer with four years\u2019 experience, received a radio call reporting a robbery at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>particular address; a victim was believed to be injured and bleeding. No description was given of either the robber or his victim/victims. Klein and a fellow officer drove to the location and observed some blood spots outside the building and on the walkway outside defendant Tamborino\u2019s apartment. A neighbor, Alvino Johnson, confirmed that an injured person was inside the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Klein knocked on the door to the apartment and loudly identified himself as a police officer. Receiving no response, Klein waited a minute or two and knocked again. The officers heard some sounds of movement inside the apartment. Believing that the situation required prompt action, Klein kicked in the door. He then saw defendant Tamborino in the living room walking toward the front door. He was wearing a bathrobe, was barefoot, and had quite a bit of blood on his head, neck and hands. He was holding his head and seemed to be bleeding from the right side of his face, although not profusely.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Officer Klein testified that at that point he was not sure whether Tamborino was a suspect or a victim and that, for his own safety, he brought Tamborino out of the apartment and handc\u00fc\u00edfed him. After determining that the wound did not appear serious, Klein immediately reentered the apartment. His main concern was to determine whether there were any other injured persons inside; he did not stop to ask any questions of Tamborino or to \u201ctry[]\"to figure out what had happened at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">As he walked through the apartment, Officer Klein observed, in plain view on the living room coffee table, cocaine residue (\u201ca white powdery residue ... in line forms\u201d) and some narcotics paraphernalia. He also noticed some marijuana, a weighing scale and a substance used as a \u201ccutting agent\u201d for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Klein brought Tamborino back into the apartment and questioned him. According to Tamborino, his assailant had come to the apartment, asked for Joe (evidently Tamborino\u2019s roommate, codefendant Smith), and attacked Tamborino with a knife. (A bloody knife was found on the living room sofa.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Paramedics were called to attend to Tamborino. Smith arrived soon thereafter, and the officers asked both men to consent to a house search, which was refused. Officer Klein called narcotics officers to the scene to assist in the investigation and he informed Smith that he would be detained while a search warrant was sought. A narcotics officer likewise told Smith that \u201cI was going to petition for a search warrant and was going to call the on-call weekend D.A.\u201d Smith thereupon gave his consent to a search \u201cbecause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>[they] were going to find it anyway.\u201d The officers soon found several small bindles of cocaine under Smith\u2019s mattress. In the meantime, Tamborino had also given his consent to a search after learning that the officers were in the process of obtaining a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">II. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Defendants do not challenge the propriety of Klein\u2019s action in kicking in their apartment door after receiving no response to his knock,  They do contend, however, that Klein should not have entered after confronting Tamborino because Klein had no articulable reason to believe that additional injured persons (or suspects) remained in the apartment. We reject the argument, believing that under the facts presented here, the trial court could reasonably find that in light of the exigencies of the situation, the officer\u2019s limited intrusion into defendants\u2019 apartment was justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">We have held that during a lawful search of the premises for suspects, police officers may seize contraband found in plain sight during the search. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Block </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 239, 243 [103 Cal.Rptr. 281, 499 P.2d 961].) In <em>Block, </em>we observed that \u201cthe reasonableness of an officer\u2019s conduct is dependent upon the existence of facts available to him at the moment of the search or seizure which would warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate. [Citation.]\u201d (P. 244.) We further explained that in determining whether the officer acted reasonably, \u201cdue weight must be given not to his unparticularized suspicions or \u2018hunches,\u2019 but to the reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in the light of his experience; in other words, he must be able to point to specific and articulable facts from which he concluded that his action was necessary. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Defendants contend that the present search was invalid because Officer Klein could point to no specific or articulable facts indicating that a second victim or suspect might be present in the apartment. But the observation of Tamborino, wounded and bleeding, coupled with the earlier report of a robbery, constituted \u201carticulable facts\u201d that reasonably could have led the officer to decide that an immediate, brief search of the apartment was warranted to determine whether additional persons were present at the crime scene. Officer Klein had no prior information indicating that only <em>one </em>victim was involved in the robbery, and in light of the situation he confronted, ordinary, routine common sense and a reasonable concern for human life justified him in conducting a walk-through search truly limited in scope to determining the presence of other victims. Nothing in the record suggests that the officer had any hidden additional motive, such as searching for drugs or contraband, in conducting the search, and the trial court\u2014after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>specifically questioning the officer on this point\u2014was satisfied that the officer had no such ulterior motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The general principles surrounding warrantless entry were summarized by the United States Supreme Court as follows: \u201cWe do not question the right of the police to respond to emergency situations.  Numerous state and federal cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment does not bar police officers from making warrantless entries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid. Similarly, when the police come upon the scene of a homicide they may make a prompt warrantless search of the area <em>to see if there are other victims </em>or if a killer is still on the premises.\u201d <em>(Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 385, 392 [57 L.Ed.2d 290, 300, 98 S.Ct. 2408], italics added, fns. omitted.) Although <em>Mincey </em>involved the search of a homicide scene, comparable principles would govern a search of the scene of a robbery involving a wounded victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The California courts are in full accord with the foregoing emergency exception to the warrant requirement. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 755 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1] [search for additional wounded persons]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 374, 378 [303 P.2d 721]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keener </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 73, 77 [195 Cal.Rptr. 733]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dickson </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 1046, 1062-1063 [192 Cal.Rptr. 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">As an appellate court recently stated, \u201cThere is no ready litmus test for determining whether a particular situation negates the constitutional requirement of a warrant. [Citation.] In each case the claim of exigent circumstances must be evaluated on its particular facts. Where there is reasonable cause to believe additional suspects or potential victims are in a residence, a warrantless entry is permissible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keener, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d 73, 77.)  Under the particular facts of the present case, we conclude that the discovery of one wounded victim afforded reasonable cause to enter and briefly search for additional victims. Although unhurried reflection might have led another officer to conclude that Tamborino should have been questioned before even a superficial search was conducted, Officer Klein could reasonably have concluded that he did not enjoy that luxury, and that immediate action was warranted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Here, two different trial judges (for purposes of defendants\u2019 motions under \u00a7\u00a7 995 and 1538.5) by necessary implication ruled that Officer Klein reasonably believed that other victims might be present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The finding that the officer indeed entertained such a <em>subjective </em>belief was a factual determination which we must accept in light of the substantial evidence supporting it. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 596-598 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961].) Although the separate question whether the officer\u2019s belief was <em>objectively </em>reasonable is a question of law for this court <em>{id., </em>at p. 598), given the exigency presented here and our reluctance to second guess split-second decisions of officers faced with potentially dangerous situations, we conclude that the officer acted reasonably in this case. Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, our holding does not signal a retreat from past rulings or a departure from established principles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We simply hold that because the officer reasonably could have concluded\u2014on the basis of articulable facts\u2014that he was acting in an emergency situation, his immediate and limited response to the reasonably perceived exigency did not violate constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In view of our conclusion, we do not reach the People\u2019s alternative contention that defendants\u2019 eventual consent to a search of their apartment cured any illegality arising from the initial entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The peremptory writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Mosk, J., Broussard, J., and Reynoso, I., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>GRODIN, J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AXW\">I agree with the dissent that a police officer who finds a victim at the location of a suspected residential burglary should ordinarily speak with that person before barging into the house on suspicion that there may be another victim within, and that his failure to do so may have an important bearing in assessing the prosecution\u2019s claim of exigent circumstances. I do not read the majority opinion as establishing any different proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">On the other hand, failure to make inquiry may be reasonable when the risk of delay appears to be substantial, as where human safety is at stake, and where the circumstances are such as to cast doubt upon the reliability of the response. Here, the officer testified that he was uncertain whether Tamborino was a victim or suspect\u2014a circumstance clearly creating doubt as to the reliability of response\u2014and that he was wounded and bleeding, holding his head. Though the trial court commented that Tamborino was \u201cobviously\u201d a victim, because of his attire, that court also found nonetheless that the officer\u2019s conduct was reasonable under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">On the peculiar facts of this case, I agree with the trial court, and consequently with the majority. It may be \u201cobvious\u201d in the cool reflection of hindsight that Tamborino was a victim, but the trial court impliedly found that the police officer\u2019s contrary view was in good faith and that, under all the circumstances, his actions were reasonable. Given the urgency of the situation as reasonably perceived by the officer, I believe it is appropriate to give him the benefit of the doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The event may not have been a pajama party, but then it cannot always be assumed that burglars will come to a burglary properly attired for the task.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">After we granted a hearing in this case, counsel for defendants moved to dismiss on the ground of mootness, observing that the trial court had dismissed the case in reliance upon the now-vacated Court of Appeal opinion, which had ordered the challenged evidence suppressed. Accepting the People\u2019s theory that the trial court had no jurisdiction to dismiss in reliance upon an appellate opinion which was not yet final, we denied defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">As stated in a concurring opinion by now Chief Justice Warren Burger while with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, \u201cthe business of policemen and firemen is <em>to act, </em>not to speculate or meditate on whether the report is correct. People could well die in emergencies if the police tried to act with the calm deliberation associated with the judicial process.\u201d <em>(Wayne </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1963) 318 F.2d 205, 212 (conc, opn.).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Although, as the dissent points out, the trial court did find that \u201cTamborino obviously could not be a suspect because [he] was wearing a robe,\u201d the court made no finding as to whether the officer subjectively believed or disbelieved that Tamborino was either a suspect or victim and, of course, the trial court ultimately concluded that the officer reasonably believed that he was faced with an exigent situation and acted properly under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The cases relied on by the dissent are each distinguishable and do not require officers investigating serious offenses to interrogate wounded persons before entering the premises to look for additional victims in all circumstances. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Carney </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 597, 612-613 [194 Cal.Rptr. 500, 668 P.2d 807], the officers were investigating an uncorroborated tip regarding drug activities inside a motor home. No exigent circumstances existed which would justify an immediate entry. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Peck) </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 645 , 650-651 [111 Cal.Rptr. 565, 517 P.2d 829], the officers, investigating a possible burglary, interviewed the resident of the subject apartment, who explained that he had lost his key and was required to enter through a window. After the apartment manager confirmed that the suspect was indeed a tenant of the apartment, the officer nonetheless entered and found narcotics. This court properly invalidated the entry. Finally, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dugger </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 603 F.2d 97, 98, the officers were investigating a <em>fistfight </em>involving only two men. After interviewing the first victim/participant, they followed a blood trail to the apartment of the second man. The officers confronted and questioned him, but continued to search his apartment \u201cfor other occupants.\u201d Under these facts, the court properly concluded that the search exceeded the scope of the exigency once the second victim had been found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\">In the tort arena, \u201ccourts have been compelled to recognize that an actor who is confronted with an emergency [i.e., a sudden or unexpected event or combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action] is not to be held to the standard of conduct normally applied to one who is in no such situation. . . . Under [emergency] conditions, the actor cannot reasonably be held to the same accuracy of judgment or conduct as one who has had full opportunity to reflect, even though it later appears that the actor made the wrong decision, one which no reasonable person could possibly have made after due deliberation. The actor\u2019s choice \u2018may be mistaken and yet prudent. \u2019 [11] . . . The conduct required [however] is still that of a reasonable person under the circumstances, as they would appear to one who was using proper care, and the emergency is to be considered only as one of the circumstances. An objective standard must still be applied, and the actor\u2019s own judgment or impulse is still not the sole criterion. The actor may still be found to be negligent if, notwithstanding the emergency, his acts are found to be unreasonable. The \u2018emergency doctrine\u2019 is applied only where the situation which arises is sudden and unexpected, .and such as to deprive the actor of reasonable opportunity for deliberation and considered decision.\u201d (Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 33, pp. 196-197.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b850-6\">BIRD, C.

I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>The majority hold that the presence of an injured victim at the scene of a reported robbery, without more, justifies a sweep search of the robbery victim\u2019s dwelling without his consent and without any information as to whether other injured persons are present. The majority do not even require the police to <em>ask </em>an otherwise alert and conscious crime victim whether other injured persons are inside before invading the privacy of his home. Such a complete lack of respect for a crime victim\u2019s privacy rights cannot be justified by either the \u201ccommon sense\u201d or the \u201cconcern for human life\u201d rationales that my colleagues set forth. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In the area of Fourth Amendment guarantees, the courts have a vital obligation in warrantless search cases to ensure that citizens\u2019 rights are not unreasonably invaded by police activity. As this court has recognized, \u201c \u2018We are not dealing with formalities. The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. <em>Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. </em>This was not done to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade [] privacy in order to enforce the law. ... We cannot be true to that constitutional requirement and excuse the absence of a search warrant without <em>a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sirhan </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 710, 738 [102 Cal.Rptr. 385, 497 P.2d 1121], original italics, quoting <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948) 335 U.S. 451, 456 [93 L.Ed. 153, 158, 69 S.Ct. 191], italics added; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Block </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 239, 244 [103 Cal.Rptr. 281, 499 P.2d 961], citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 21-22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cSearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable.\u201d <em>(Mincey </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 385, 390 [57 L.Ed.2d 290, 298, 98 S.Ct. 2408].)

The dispatch call indicated that the robbery victim was bleeding and standing on the third floor landing of the apartment building. When the officers arrived on the scene, they saw blood spots directly below the third floor landing and on the landing outside the door of petitioner\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">A neighbor advised the officers that the injured victim was inside the apartment. After knocking and announcing their presence, the officers waited one to two minutes, and, receiving no response, kicked in the door. They then saw petitioner walking barefoot towards the front door. He was bleeding from his head and was clad only in a bathrobe which had blood on it.

Instead, without petitioner\u2019s consent, Officer Klein \u201csweep searched\u201d the apartment for other victims. Throughout this incident Tamborino remained fully capable of answering any questions the officers might have had about the robbery. Indeed, they learned details about it when they interrogated <em>him\u2014after </em>sweep searching the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The majority attempt to justify the police action in this case under an exception to the warrant requirement first recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 374 [303 P.2d 721], <em>Roberts </em>permits authorities to make warrantless searches of premises to the extent <em>\u201creasonably necessary </em>to determine whether a person [is] actually in distress somewhere in the [dwelling].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 378-379, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\"><em>Roberts </em>is one of the few \u201cspecifically established and well-delineated exceptions\u201d <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 357 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 585, 88 S.Ct. 507]) that the courts have engrafted upon the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against warrantless searches and its counterpart in article I, section 13, of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dickson </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 1046, 1059-1061 [192 Cal.Rptr. 897].) These exceptions recognize that there may be situations in which compliance with the warrant requirement is impossible or impracticable and in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the demands of legitimate law enforcement override an individual\u2019s privacy interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The <em>Roberts </em>exception permits a warrantless search only when it is <em>\u201creasonably necessary </em>to determine whether a person [is] actually in distress somewhere in the [dwelling]. \u201d <em>(Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at pp. 378-379, italics added.) To validate a search under this exception, the police must show that (1) their perception that an emergency existed was an objectively reasonable one <em>(id., </em>at p. 377) and (2) the action they took in response to that emergency reasonably appeared necessary under the circumstances. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 378-379; <em>People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at pp. 244-245.) This second requirement is nothing more than an application of the general principle that police action taken in response to any emergency must be no more intrusive upon constitutionally protected rights than the emergency requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In the instant case, the police action satisfied neither prong of this two-part test. As petitioner concedes, a sufficient emergency existed to justify kicking open the door, but once the officers found Tamborino, any urgent need to search for victims ended. Secondly, even assuming that an emergency continued after the officers observed Tamborino, the sweep search was not \u201cnecessary.\u201d Petitioner could have provided the police with information about additional victims for whom they claimed they were searching.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">When the police encountered Tamborino, he was dressed in a manner which clearly indicated that he was a resident of the dwelling. His injuries signaled that he was a victim of the reported robbery. At this point, \u201cthe exigency end[ed], [and] the warrant requirement reemerge[d]. \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Keener </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 73, 78 [195 Cal.Rptr. 733]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Frazier </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 690, 694 [139 Cal.Rptr. 573].)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The police had absolutely no articulable factual basis for believing that other persons were inside the apartment. The dispatcher\u2019s report did not indicate multiple victims. Tamborino\u2019s neighbor gave no indication that more than one victim was involved in the robbery. In short, there was nothing more than the ever-present <em>possibility </em>that other victims might be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>This court has repeatedly held that the \u201cmere possibility\u201d that other persons may be inside a residence is insufficient to justify a warrantless residential search. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carney, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 612; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Peck) </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 645, 650 [111 Cal.Rptr. 565, 517 P.2d 829]; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 305, 313-314 [102 Cal.Rptr. 161, 497 P.2d 505]; accord, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dugger </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 603 F.2d 97, 100, fn. 5.) As this court recognized in <em>Dillon </em>in the analogous context of a warrantless search incident to an arrest, \u201cThere is, of course, always the possibility that some additional person may be found inside a house outside of which an arrest took place. But the mere possibility of additional persons in the house without more, is not enough to provide probable cause to search the whole premises for additional suspects, once the suspect whom the officers had sought was arrested.\u201d (7 Cal.3d at p. 314.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">No different result should obtain when the only apparent crime victim is safely in police custody and no reason for sweeping the residence for additional victims or suspects appears. To sanction sweep searches in such instances justifies police action based on nothing more than \u201cunparticularized suspicions or \u2018hunches\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 244) which, ironically, the majority concede is insufficient. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 923.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Today\u2019s majority in one breath pay lip service to these well established principles, but virtually undermine them in the next. They hold the government no longer need articulate a factual basis for a warrantless residential intrusion. Instead, we are told that \u201cordinary, routine common sense\u201d and \u201cconcern for human life\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 923) are adequate justifications for police action even though the record is devoid of such objective factual bases. Now \u201chunches\u201d or \u201csuspicions\u201d are adequate for such a search, provided the officer takes care to characterize them as an exercise in \u201croutine common sense.\u201d The sanctioning of such semantic games seriously undermines formerly inviolable constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The majority\u2019s subversion of the rule requiring specific articulable facts in support of exigent circumstances marks the beginning of a new era of warrantless searches in this state. A review of prior state and federal decisions illustrates this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Carney, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 597, the court was faced with a warrantless sweep search of a motor home. The police had commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>surveillance of the appellant\u2019s motor home after they received a tip that narcotics dealing was being conducted inside. The officers observed a youth leave the motor home, approached him, confirmed their suspicions, and asked the youth to return to the motor home and ask the appellant to come out. Once this was done, the police arrested the appellant and subsequently searched the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">This court held that the search of the motor home<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> could not be justified under the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d doctrine, which permits a search of premises without a warrant for additional subjects under certain limited circumstances. The police had failed to establish that they had a reasonable belief based upon specific, articulable facts that persons other than the accused were inside the motor home. (34 Cal.3d at pp. 612-613.) The court recalled that in <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at page 314 \u201cwe held that the mere possibility that others might be inside the house based on the fact more than one person lived there was insufficient to support a protective sweep search.\u201d <em>(Carney, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The most significant feature of <em>Carney </em>is its observation that \u201c[if] the officers had been truly concerned for their safety, it would have been elementary for them to have asked the [informant] who had just left the motor home how many people were inside. . . . This is not to say, of course, that had the [informant] stated defendant was alone, the officers would have been required to trust his response. ... In any event, any response would simply have been another factor for the officers to consider in determining whether there was reasonable cause under the totality of the circumstances to believe others were inside the motor home.\u201d (34 Cal.3d at p. 613 and fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The fact that these factors led the court in <em>Carney </em>to reject the government\u2019s \u201cprotective sweep\u201d justification for its warrantless search illustrates how far today\u2019s majority stray from recognized principles governing warrantless searches of dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Peck), supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 645, police officers responded to a burglary call at an apartment building. A resident of the apartment complex reported seeing a person crawling through the rear window of a neighboring apartment. Arriving at the scene, police went to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>apartment accompanied by the manager of the complex. With pistols drawn, the police knocked on the door and yelled \u201csheriff\u2019s department. \u201d Peck opened the door, stepped onto the porch, and stated that he lived there, a fact which the manager confirmed. Peck explained that he was locked out and needed to enter through the window. When the officer asked if he could \u201ctake a look,\u201d Peck stepped back and the officer entered and found marijuana. (10 Cal.3d at p. 648.) This court unanimously held the search invalid and excluded the evidence. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 650-651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The Attorney General in <em>Peck </em>advanced three arguments, similar to those advanced here, to justify the warrantless search. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 650.) First, the state argued, Peck himself might have been the burglar. This court found those suspicions dispelled by the manager\u2019s confirmation that Peck lived in the apartment. Next, the Attorney General argued, there may still have been a burglar in the apartment of which Peck was unaware. The court rejected this claim, however, since Peck had explained that <em>he </em>was the unidentified man who had entered through the rear window. Finally, the state asserted, a burglar may have been holding Peck hostage. The court rejected this reasoning as well, since Peck\u2019s act of stepping out of the apartment indicated that he was free to leave. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">If nothing more, <em>Peck </em>indicates the importance of an officer making inquiries when he believes there is an urgent need to conduct a warrantless search. Today\u2019s ruling teaches that the officer in <em>Peck </em>should not have asked questions, since the answers thereto undermined any asserted justifications to search the apartment. Had that officer merely handcuffed the resident, as the police did here, today\u2019s majority might have found the search there permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Finally, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dugger, supra, </em>603 F.2d 97, a case remarkably similar to this one, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated a warrantless search claimed to be justified by exigent circumstances. There, police responded to a report of a fist-fight at an apartment complex. The police arrived about one hour after the fight had ended and interviewed the alleged victim. \u201cThe officers then followed a trail of blood leading from [the victim] back to Dugger\u2019s apartment, where they observed blood on the front door and keys in the lock. They rang the doorbell \u2018two or three times,\u2019 but heard no response from inside. Then, one of the officers, uninvited, turned the key, pushed the door open, and stepped back away from the open door. The officers then called to Dugger and identified themselves as being from the sheriff\u2019s department. They heard no immediate response. Then, a male within the apartment called out that he was putting on his shoes and would be right out.\u201d (603 F.2d at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>\u201cUpon entering Dugger\u2019s apartment, the officers walked through the darkened living room to the lighted rear bedroom of the dwelling. There they found the defendant putting on his shoes. While one of the officers questioned Dugger, his companion quickly searched the rest of the apartment for other occupants. Then the officers asked Dugger to go with them into the living room. While looking for the light switch in the living room by flashlight, the officers observed what appeared to be marijuana strewn over the living room floor.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The district court had justified the warrantless entry on grounds of exigent circumstances and \u201cthe need to determine if anyone needed immediate medical attention.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court of appeals rejected that reasoning under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. (603 F.2d at pp. 99-100.) The court reasoned that \u201c \u2018the scope of the warrantless search must be commensurate with the rationale that excepts the search from the warrant requirement.\u2019 \u201d (603 F.2d at p. 99, quoting <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1973) 412 U.S. 291, 295 [36 L.Ed.2d 900, 905, 906, 93 S.Ct. 2000].) \u201c[0]nce the officers heard Dugger respond from within that he was coming outside as soon as he put on his shoes, any excuse of an emergency dissipated.\u201d <em>(Dugger, supra, </em>at pp. 99-100.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The similarities between <em>Dugger </em>and the instant case are too obvious to belabor. There, as here, the police were presented with no indication that other persons were in the dwelling. The Ninth Circuit was simply unwilling to uphold that search merely based on \u201cconjecture.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 100, fn. 5.) Today\u2019s majority depart from this logical view and hold that such conjecture <em>is </em>a proper basis for upholding a search, provided it is couched in terms of \u201croutine common sense.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Even assuming that the officers might have had an articulable basis for believing that other persons were present, a sweep search went far beyond action which was \u201cnecessary\u201d to deal with that supposed exigency. Again, the cases are illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Settled principles of law in this area, emanating from two lines of cases, have established the ways in which a sweep search may be \u201cnecessary\u201d in a Roberts-type situation. The first line of cases involves situations in which police arrive at a crime scene and suspect that injured victims are inside but no one is present to give such information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731, 755 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>at pp. 378-379; compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dugger, supra, </em>603 F.2d at p. 100, fh. 5.) In these cases, courts have upheld limited searches for victims within the premises on the ground that such searches were \u201cthe only practical means of determining whether there was anyone inside in need of assistance.\u201d (Hi<em>ll, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The second group of cases involves sweep searches for victims where the only available information about the incident would come from a suspect. In these cases, the search was justified by the fact that the suspect could not reasonably have been expected to give an honest response to police inquiries. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 239; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keener, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 76; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Carney, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 613.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The present case falls within neither of the two lines of authority noted above. Employing the <em>Hill </em>rationale, Officer Klein was not faced with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>situation where his only means of determining the presence of others was to search the apartment. Though injured, petitioner was alert and ambulatory. Therefore, he was fully capable of answering any questions the police may have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">As to the <em>Block </em>rationale, the trial court found that Tamborino simply \u201ccould not be a suspect\u201d since he was obviously an occupant of the apartment and a victim of the robbery. It is not surprising that this critical factual finding is ignored in an attempt to justify the trial court\u2019s ultimate ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The majority hold that when an officer believes that an \u201cemergency\u201d exists, the courts should be reluctant to question whether he or she acted \u201creasonably\u201d with regard to protected Fourth Amendment rights. Apparently the officer need not confine his or her conduct to that which is \u201cnecessary\u201d to preserve and protect life. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 924 &amp; fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">As the above-cited cases illustrate, every court which has permitted \u201cemergency\u201d sweep searches for injured persons or suspects\u2014including those cited by the majority\u2014has required to date a particularized showing that the police action was reasonably necessary in light of the circumstances. The majority\u2019s \u201creluctance to second guess split-second decisions of officers faced with potentially dangerous situations\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 925) seemingly abandons any requirement that the police make the \u201creasonably necessary\u201d showing. Under the majority\u2019s holding, whenever an officer perceives an \u201cemergency,\u201d the courts will not question his or her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">In addition, the majority\u2019s holding is not mandated by \u201croutine common sense\u201d or a \u201cconcern for human life\u201d\u2014the justifications my brethren assert for the warrantless intrusion. Existing exceptions to the warrant requirement already accommodate such reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The law in this area represents a delicate but necessary balance between the legitimate needs of law enforcement and a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. That balance is preserved by excusing Fourth Amendment compliance in <em>Roberts </em>situations only when \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Today\u2019s majority upset that balance, undermining the Constitution in the process. Henceforth, in order to escape the Constitution\u2019s warrant requirement, an officer need merely claim that the crime victim appeared to be a suspect\u2014 no matter how unreasonable that contention\u2014and cite the ever-present possibility of additional individuals inside the dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">In sum, my colleagues dilute the protection of the reasonableness standard in order to accommodate a weak factual showing of necessity in this partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ular case. In so doing, they undermine Fourth Amendment principles and depart from existing law. Such a holding cannot be justified by either \u201croutine common sense\u201d or a \u201cconcern for human life.\u201d Existing principles have served society well in the difficult task of balancing constitutionally protected privacy rights against the need to preserve human life in emergency situations. I see absolutely no reason to subvert these carefully developed principles and curtail the constitutional rights of victims of crime.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The majority accept this statement at face value <em>(ibid.), </em>despite the trial court\u2019s factual finding, based on substantial evidence, that Tamborino simply \u201ccould not be a suspect\u201d and that he was instead obviously \u201can occupant, a victim\u201d of the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\">See <em>People </em>v. <em>Block, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at page 245 (search for other suspects incident to lawful arrest on the premises); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramey </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 263, 276 [127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d 1333] (warrantless entry of premises to effect an arrest where necessary due to imminent danger to life or property, likelihood of flight or destruction of evidence); <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at page 378 (search of crime scene necessary to determine presence of and render aid to injured victims); see generally <em>People </em>v. <em>Dickson, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d at pages 1052-1053 (discussing all three exceptions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">A Ninth Circuit panel recently echoed these observations in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoffman </em>(9th Cir. 1979) 607 F.2d 280, 284, noting that \u201c[t]he Government does not satisfy [its] burden by leading a court to speculate about what \u2018may\u2019 or \u2018might\u2019 have been the circumstances surrounding the warrantless search.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\"><em>Carney </em>held that the motor home was a \u201cdwelling\u201d and not subject to the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement.

While it is true that the police questioned Dugger <em>after </em>they unlawfully entered <em>(id., </em>at p. 98), that fact was irrelevant to the court\u2019s ruling.
