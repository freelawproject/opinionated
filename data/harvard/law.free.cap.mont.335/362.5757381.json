We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in precluding Faw from exercising his right to participate in a dissolution action by entering a final dissolution decree ending the Heidemas\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">\u00b63 Douglas Faw was injured while employed as a ranch hand for brothers Jack and John Heidema in the Heidemas\u2019 ranch operations. The Heidemas did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage at the time Faw was injured. Paw\u2019s medical expenses as a result of his injury exceed $1,000,000. Faw filed suit against Jack and John Heidema and the Heidema Partnership for negligence and failure to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage. He later filed suit against Jack and John and the newly-created Heidema Ranch Limited Partnership for fraudulent transfer of assets into the new partnership. Faw alleged that the limited partnership was created to protect the Heidemas\u2019 assets against the pending lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">\u00b64 In May 2005, Sydne Kay Heidema filed a petition for dissolution of marriage from Jack Heidema. Faw alleged that Sydne and Jack\u2019s dissolution was a sham because the marriage was not irretrievably broken and the dissolution was being sought only to protect Sydne\u2019s inchoate interest in the marital estate against the pending lawsuits. He contended that the Heidemas\u2019 attorney in the tort actions told them that a dissolution would be one way to protect the wives\u2019 interest in the Heidema assets. Incidentally, Sydne\u2019s sister-in-law, Connie Heidema, filed a petition for dissolution against John Heidema that same month. Faw filed a motion to intervene as a matter of right in the dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>action. He asserted that he was not interested in receiving any specific property from the marital assets, but rather, that the petition for dissolution was not legitimate and therefore should not be granted. He also requested that a receiver be appointed to take control of the marital estate to prevent its dissipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b65 The District Court granted Faw\u2019s motion to intervene pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 24. The court stated that the timing of the Heidema wives\u2019 dissolution petitions, along with Faw\u2019s assertion that they were advised that dissolution could protect their inchoate interest in the marital estate, warranted permissive intervention in order for the court to adequately address Faw\u2019s interests. Faw\u2019s response to the dissolution petition deified that the marriage was irretrievably broken.</p>\n<p id=\"AfA\">\u00b66 When Sydne and Jack failed to provide preliminary declarations of disclosure to Faw, Faw filed a motion to compel the declarations, stating he did not waive the exchange. Jack objected to the motion, stating that Faw was attempting to obtain discovery for his tort actions by intervening in the dissolution action, and the asset disclosures had nothing to do with Faw\u2019s assertion that the marriage was not irretrievably broken and the dissolution was being entered into to protect assets. The District Court granted Faw\u2019s motion to compel the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b67 After nearly a month went by and Sydne and Jack failed to provide the preliminary disclosures, Faw filed a motion requesting the court to set a deadline for them to provide the disclosures. The court ordered Sydne and Jack to provide the disclosures by November 17, 2005. However, prior to that date, Sydne and Jack entered into a settlement agreement and asked the court to enter the dissolution decree. Sydne served her preliminary and final declaration of disclosure and declaration of income and expenses, and two days later, Jack produced his disclosure which was identical to Sydne\u2019s. On November 9, 2005, the District Court entered a final decree of dissolution over Faw\u2019s objections. Faw appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2000 MT 16, \u00b6 24, 298 Mont. 101, \u00b6 24, 994 P.2d 1105, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in precluding Faw from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>exercising his right to participate in a dissolution action by entering a final dissolution decree ending the Heidemas\u2019 marriage?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b610 Faw based his original motion to intervene on M. R. Civ. P. 24, asserting that he was entitled to intervene as a matter of right because he claimed an interest relating to property in the marital estate and that he was so situated that distribution of the marital estate in the dissolution would impede or impair his ability to protect his interests. He further stated that his interests were not protected by the existing parties in the dissolution action. The District Court granted Faw\u2019s motion to intervene, stating that permissive intervention was warranted based on the timing of the Heidema wives\u2019 dissolution petitions, along with Faw\u2019s assertion that they were advised that dissolution could protect their inchoate interest in the marital estate. The court further stated that it would \u201cnot be able to adequately address the interests of the proposed intervening party without his participation in the dissolution proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b611 In this case, it is questionable whether the District Court should have allowed Faw to intervene in the first place. The Heidemas have not, however, appealed from that order. Although Faw had, and still has, pending lawsuits against Jack, John, and their partnerships, he does not yet have a judgment. Thus, he has not made a prima facie showing of an actual interest in the Heidemas\u2019 property. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2); <em>Anniballi v. Anniballi, </em>255 Mont. 384, 387, 842 P.2d 342, 344 (1992). Secondly, as demonstrated by the fact that Faw has filed lawsuits against Jack, John, and their partnerships, Faw has other avenues available for protecting his alleged interest in the property. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2); <em>Anniballi, </em>255 Mont. at 386, 842 P.2d at 343. Finally, in determining that permissive intervention was warranted, the District Court failed to determine that Faw had a question of law or fact in common with the main action. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(2); <em>Shilhanek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Faw now asserts that the questions of facts or law in common between his claim and the dissolution action are that both claims are concerned with the size of the marital estate, the dissipation of assets by the parties, and the equitable distribution of marital assets between Jack and Sydne.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b612 Appropriate or not, the court did allow Faw to intervene; thus, the question now is whether Faw was prejudiced by entry of the dissolution decree before the parties responded to Faw\u2019s discovery requests regarding asset disclosure. We hold that he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b613  Marriage arises out of a civil contract between a man and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>woman, and requires the consent of both parties. Section 40-1-103, MCA. When one or both of those parties finds the marriage is irretrievably broken, that party has a basis for dissolution. Section 40-4-101, MCA. Dissolutions are statutory proceedings. The questions to be determined in a dissolution action are whether the marriage is irretrievably broken, and if so, how to allocate marital assets between the parties and provide maintenance and child support if applicable. Sections 40-4-107, 40-4-202, 40-4-203, 40-4-204, MCA. In a dissolution proceeding, the only proper parties are the spouses seeking to be divorced. <em>Nielson v. Thompson, </em>982 P.2d 709, 712 (Wyo. 1999) (citing <em>In re Marriage of Soriano, </em>722 P.2d 132, 133 (Wash. App. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b614  Because Faw is not a party to the marriage, he has no standing to assert that the marriage is or is not irretrievably broken. Furthermore, Faw\u2019s request for relief, that assets be entrusted to third parties, exceeds the jurisdiction of the court. In a dissolution proceeding, the court has authority to apportion marital assets only between the parties. Thus, even if the court committed error in entering the dissolution decree before Faw received the disclosures, such error was harmless because the court could not grant any relief to Faw in the dissolution proceeding. Faw must pursue, and is pursuing, the other remedies he has available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b615 We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
