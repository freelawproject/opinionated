She alleged that ALPS had, two years earlier, engaged in unfair trade practices by failing to settle promptly the legal malpractice suit she had brought against John Kelly Addy (\u201cAddy\u201d), one of ALPS\u2019s insureds. Redies further alleged tortious breaches of statutory duties and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"AYdj\">\u00b62 ALPS answered Redies\u2019 complaint and thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. The court determined that ALPS had \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>242(5), MCA, for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy, that there were no genuine issues of material fact, and that ALPS was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court further determined that all other pending motions were moot. Redies timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\">\u00b63 On appeal, Redies has framed a number of interrelated issues, all of which pertain to the following overarching question: Did the District Court err by granting ALPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b64 In the course of answering this question, we address the following sub-issues raised by Redies: whether the reasonableness of ALPS\u2019s \u201cbasis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy is a question of fact or a question of law; whether genuine issues of material fact remain, thus precluding summary judgment in this case; and, lastly, whether Redies\u2019 \u201creasonable investigation\u201d claim under \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, survives a determination under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AIm\">I. The Conservatorship</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b65 Redies was involved in a bicycling accident on May 29,1995, as a result of which she suffered a traumatic brain injury and was comatose for approximately two weeks. Consequently, Redies\u2019 mother, Rosalie Redies (\u201cRosalie\u201d), and sister, Judy Uerling (\u201cUerling\u201d), filed a petition in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the appointment of a temporary conservator of Redies\u2019 estate. The court granted the petition on June 8, 1995, appointing C. A. Cosner (\u201cCosner\u201d), a certified public accountant with whom the family already had a relationship, to serve in this capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">\u00b66 Redies emerged from her coma in mid-June 1995; however, she remained somewhat disoriented and unaware of her surroundings. Given her persistent incapacity, Rosalie and Uerling petitioned the District Court to make Cosner\u2019s appointment permanent. The court first appointed Vicki W. Dunaway (\u201cDunaway\u201d), who had previously represented Redies in a number of matters, to represent Redies as \u201cattorney ad litem\u201d in conjunction with Rosalie and Uerling\u2019s petition. Following an investigation, Dunaway reported that Redies\u2019 mental condition, although somewhat improved, was still not to the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>being able to handle either her financial affairs or arrangements concerning her person. Accordingly, on September 6, 1995, the court appointed Cosner as permanent conservator, a capacity in which he served through April 25,2000. (This conservatorship, incidentally, was the subject of a previous appeal to this Court. <em>See Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, 309 Mont. 315, 48 P.3d 697.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b67 After his appointment as temporary conservator, Cosner learned that Redies owned significant assets, most of which were heavily encumbered; that she did not have any health insurance; and that she was incurring substantial medical costs due to her injuries. In June 1995, he applied for Medicaid benefits on Redies\u2019 behalf; however, the extent of her assets apparently disqualified her from receiving such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b68 Cosner became concerned that Redies\u2019 mounting medical bills would quickly exceed all equity in her assets. Thus, immediately following his appointment as permanent conservator, he met with Uerling, Dunaway, and Addy to discuss Redies\u2019 financial situation and how best to conserve and manage her estate. Addy-who, as noted above, was an ALPS-insured attorney-was already involved in the case, having been retained by Cosner for legal advice concerning the management and administration of Redies\u2019 estate. Addy also had represented Uerling in an earlier dispute with Redies, which was fully resolved the previous year. <em>See Redies, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b69 Cosner, Uerling, Dunaway, and Addy discussed a number of assets in Redies\u2019 estate and agreed that a management plan should be developed to maximize the amount of Redies\u2019 wealth that would be exempt from recapture by the government or the claims of creditors. Of particular relevance, Addy suggested that Cosner \u201cpauperize\u201d (in other words, impoverish) Redies by selling off most of her assets so that she could qualify for and receive Medicaid payments for her supervised care. For instance, it was decided that Redies\u2019 twenty-acre parcel of land south of Red Lodge should be liquidated; that Cosner should dispose of Redies\u2019 five vehicles; and that Uerling should go into Redies\u2019 home and take anything Uerling thought she could use or that had significant sentimental value to her, particularly a knife set given to Redies by her father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The possibility of filing a bankruptcy petition was also addressed, and Addy recommended that Rosalie\u2019s will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>revised so that any bequest or devise to Redies would lapse in the event that she was still incapacitated at the time of Rosalie\u2019s death. That way, the bequest or devise would not end up going to creditors or the government under the recapture provisions of the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">\u00b610 Cosner proceeded to manage Redies\u2019 property according to the recommendations and decisions made at the September 6, 1995 meeting, selling real and personal property owned by Redies, putting the remaining personal property in storage, paying a number of Redies\u2019 debts, and seeking settlement with her remaining creditors. He successfully avoided bankruptcy and was able to negotiate forgiveness of approximately $123,000 in medical bills, after which Uerling (who had been appointed Redies\u2019 guardian at the same time Cosner was appointed Redies\u2019 conservator) qualified Redies for Medicaid and Social Security Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) coverage. Uerling also arranged medical care for Redies.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b611 By 1998, Redies had made a significant recovery, and she began to question the disposition of her assets, as she was subsisting on SSI payments. Through new counsel, she sought an accounting of her assets and details regarding the management of her estate. Cosner and Uerling attempted to answer Redies\u2019 questions; however, each answer gave rise to new questions. The tone of the correspondence became adversarial, and Cosner and Uerling eventually filed petitions to terminate their respective roles as conservator and guardian. <em>See Redies, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Litigation ensued, which ultimately culminated in Redies\u2019 previous appeal to this Court (which we decided May 2, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">II. Redies v. Addy</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b612 Meanwhile, on or about July 9, 2001, Donald L. Harris (\u201cHarris\u201d), Redies\u2019 counsel at the time, notified Addy and Cosner of a complaint he was prepared to file on Redies\u2019 behalf. Among other things, Harris identified claims for negligence due to Addy and Cosner\u2019s failure, promptly after Redies\u2019 bicycling accident, to establish a trust to protect and preserve her estate. He also indicated that Redies preferred \u201cto resolve this matter without filing a lawsuit if that is possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b613 As it turns out, the parties were unable to negotiate a resolution, and Redies ended up filing a complaint in January 2002. The course of events during the period beginning in July 2001 and ending in December 2002-in particular, ALPS\u2019s refusal to settle Redies\u2019 claims against Addy both before and after she filed her complaint-formed the basis of her present unfair trade practices action against ALPS. Thus, it is necessary to set forth, in some detail, a number of the parties\u2019 communications and court filings during this period. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>negotiations over Redies\u2019 negligence claim against Cosner are not relevant to the issues before us (notably, he was not named in the complaint she ultimately filed), the ensuing discussion focuses solely on the exchanges pertaining to Redies\u2019 claims against Addy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b614 On receipt of Harris\u2019s letter, Addy immediately notified ALPS, which undertook an investigation into the merits of Redies\u2019 claims. The record discloses a number of communications between ALPS and Addy and between ALPS and Harris, as well as research on Harris\u2019s part, during the latter half of 2001. In October, Harris obtained a professional opinion on whether a self-sufficiency trust (see \u00a7\u00a7 53-18-101 to -105, MCA, and Admin. R. M. 37.2.501 to .513) could and should have been established following Redies\u2019 bicycling accident to conserve her assets. He was advised that, given Redies\u2019 disabling brain injury, her substantial medical bills, and her lack of health insurance, the establishment of a self-sufficiency trust would have qualified her for Medicaid while preserving her assets in a trust. He was further advised that income from the trust could have been used to supplement any needs not met by Medicaid or SSI (e.g., spending money, additional food and clothing, health services not otherwise covered, recreational needs).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b615 Harris enclosed a copy of this report with a settlement demand to ALPS dated October 10, 2001. At the outset of his demand letter, he reiterated that \u201cMs. Redies hopes to settle her claims against Mr. Addy . . . without litigation.\u201d He then articulated the theory behind those claims: Under the circumstances that existed immediately following Redies\u2019 bicycling accident, Addy should have promptly recommended the establishment of a self-sufficiency trust for Redies. \u201cLawyers, in particular, are obligated to know about the laws which are relevant to their client\u2019s case. ... To diligently represent Ms. Redies, . . . [Addy] had a duty to do sufficient research to learn about the Montana Self Sufficiency Trust statutes.\u201d As a result of Addy\u2019s failure to do so, \u201cRedies\u2019 estate was quickly depleted\u201d and \u201c[s]he now lives in poverty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Akk\">\u00b616 After receiving Harris\u2019s settlement demand, ALPS commissioned its own professional evaluation of Redies\u2019 claims. Among other things, the authors of the December 4, 2001 evaluation provided to ALPS discussed a possible statute of limitations defense and questioned whether Redies could have qualified as a beneficiary under the self-sufficiency trust provisions. They also questioned whether Redies could even bring this action against Addy, and they disputed the damages figures recited in the settlement demand. Ultimately, they concluded that \u201csufficient questions exist as to the issue of liability so that we believe it is not reasonably clear. At this point, unless the Plaintiff is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>willing [to] agree to a resolution of the case for an amount far below what their current demand is, we believe that a settlement conference would be of little value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\u00b617 Of particular significance in the case at hand is the analysis of whether Redies could even bring the action against Addy. While positing, initially, that \u201cabsent a direct attorney-client relationship between [Redies] and [Addy], no action should be allowed,\u201d the authors of the evaluation went on to caution as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">As you know, however, there have been challenges in the past as to this privity requirement. Most of the erosion of the concept has occurred in connection with beneficiaries of wills being allowed to sue the attorney for the testator. To our knowledge, Montana has not decided the issue of whether a protected person might be able to sue the attorney of the conservator. Clearly, she could sue the conservator. Presumably, the conservator would have a right over against his attorney. Thus, our court may short circuit that process by simply finding that the relationship between the protected person and the conservator\u2019s attorney was close enough to allow suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Given these considerations, they concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">We do not put a great deal of stock in this privity defense, but it represents yet another problem the Plaintiff is going to experience in prosecuting her claim. Given sufficient time and effort, we believe that defense can be circumvented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b618 Within a week of receiving the foregoing report, ALPS notified Harris that it believed the case was defensible for the reasons stated in the December 4, 2001 evaluation and that it was rejecting Redies\u2019 settlement offer. Accordingly, Redies filed a complaint on January 2, 2002, stating negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims against Addy.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b619 Addy (represented by ALPS) answered the complaint and, on or about March 18, 2002, filed a motion for summary judgment. In his motion, Addy maintained that proof that an attorney-client relationship existed is \u201c[e]ssential to a malpractice action\u201d; that his only attorney-client relationships in this matter were with Cosner and Uerling; and that \u201cno attorney-client relationship exists or ever has existed between Plaintiff Redies and Defendant Addy.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201c[s]ome courts, in very limited situations, have extended the duty of an attorney to certain non-clients,\u201d he noted that this Court suggested this possibility in <em>Rhode v. Adams, </em>1998 MT 73, 288 Mont. 278, 957 P.2d 1124. He then argued that if this Court were confronted with the question of whether an attorney owes a duty to a nonclient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>we would adopt the multi-factor balancing test set forth in <em>Trask v. Butler, </em>872 P.2d 1080, 1083 (Wash. 1994), and conclude that an attorney retained by a conservator has no duty to the protected person. (We acknowledged the <em>Trask </em>balancing test in <em>Rhode </em>but found it inapplicable to the factual scenario before us. <em>See Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b620 On May 23, 2002, the District Court, Judge Baugh presiding, denied Addy\u2019s motion on the ground that factual and legal issues regarding the existence of an attorney-client relationship between Addy and Redies existed. It is not clear what negotiations between the parties, if any, immediately followed, but on or about October 11, 2002, Redies filed a motion for pretrial ruling asking the court to find, as a matter of law, that Addy owed her a duty of care when he rendered legal advice to Cosner concerning the management of her estate. Judge Baugh granted this motion on November 21, 2002, reasoning that \u201capplication of the <em>Trask </em>factors to the present case shows that Mr. Addy owed a duty to Ms. Redies when he rendered legal advice to the conservator, Mr. Cosner.\u201d In addition, the court determined that Redies was an \u201cintended beneficiary\u201d of Addy\u2019s advice to Cosner in light of \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the parties settled the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">III. Redies v. ALPS</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b621 On December 9, 2003, Redies filed the instant action alleging, pursuant to \u00a7 33-18-242(1), MCA, that ALPS had violated \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, during the foregoing negotiations in Redies v. Addy. Specifically, with respect to the period (in 2001) before she filed her complaint, she alleged that Addy\u2019s liability to Redies \u201cwas reasonably clear\u201d; that she had \u201cmade a good faith, prompt attempt to settle the claim\u201d; and that ALPS, \u201cwithout statement of any meritorious basis in fact or in law, denied the claim and refused to offer any amount to settle the claim,\u201d instead \u201cembark[ing] upon a course and pattern of delay in the investigation, evaluation, and settlement of the claim, all of which was in bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b622 Redies further alleged that after she filed her complaint in January 2002, ALPS \u201ccontinued their pattern and course of delay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>purposeful frustration of Plaintiffs rights,\u201d though \u201cthe liability of [Addy] was reasonably clear, and such liability was known to [ALPS] or would have been known upon reasonable investigation of all information available.\u201d In addition to her unfair trade practices claim, Redies alleged, in two separate counts, tortious breaches of statutory duties (specifically, \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA) and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">\u00b623 ALPS answered Redies\u2019 complaint and, on October 25,2004, filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that \u201c[a]t all times during the pendency of the underlying case against [Addy] ..., ALPS had a \u2018reasonable basis in law\u2019 for contesting Redies\u2019s claim\u201d-namely, \u201cthat as the attorney for a conservator, [Addy] did not owe a professional duty of care to Redies, the protected person in a conservatorship proceeding.\u201d Taking advantage of language in <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, which we had decided in the interim (on June 8, 2004), ALPS asserted that the defense it had maintained on Addy\u2019s behalf in the underlying action was \u201crock solid (and ALPS was entitled to rely upon it) because Montana law did not recognize a professional duty running from the lawyer for a conservator to a non-client beneficiary such as Redies.\u201d (As discussed below, we noted in <em>Watkins Trust </em>that \u201c[t]he duty owed [by an attorney] to a nonclient beneficiary is a matter of first impression in Montana.\u201d <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>(citing Rhode, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13).)</p>\n<p id=\"AVz\">\u00b624 The District Court, Judge Todd presiding, agreed with ALPS, reasoning that \u201cnot until 2004, when the Montana Supreme Court issued its opinion, in a case of first impression, were Montana attorneys held to owe duties to non-client beneficiaries.\u201d The court acknowledged our statement in <em>Rhode </em>that \u201ca multi-factor balancing test, such as that set out in <em>Trask, </em>may be effective when used to address the duties of attorneys <em>in transactional matters or estate planning and probate </em>practice.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17 (emphasis added). However, the court decided that the <em>Trask </em>test was <em>not </em>applicable to the case at hand because \u201can adversarial situation\u201d existed between Redies and Uerling, which precluded the imposition of a fiduciary duty running from Addy to Redies during the months immediately following Redies\u2019 accident (citing <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u00b625 Having determined that at the time of the alleged malpractice, Addy did not owe a duty to third-party beneficiaries such as Redies, the court concluded that \u201cALPS had a reasonable basis in law for the denial of and defense against Redies\u2019 claim\u201d and that no genuine issues of material fact remained. Accordingly, the court granted ALPS\u2019s motion. Notably, Judge Todd did not rule on a M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion filed by Redies on November 30, 2004, except to say that \u201c[t]his order renders all other motions in the cause of action moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b626 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. <em>Cole v. Valley Ice Garden, L.L.C., </em>2005 MT 115, \u00b6 4, 327 Mont. 99, \u00b6 4, 113 P.3d 275, \u00b6 4. Rule 56(c) provides that a motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Because summary judgment is an extreme remedy which should not be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact, \u201cthe evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences will be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 338, \u00b6 19, 133 P.3d 165, \u00b6 19 (internal quotation marks omitted); In <em>re Dorothy W.

The Reasonable Basis in Law Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b627 As noted above, Redies brought the instant action under the statutory provisions which prohibit unfair trade practices by insurance companies. Specifically, \u00a7 33-18-242(1), MCA, creates an independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>cause of action by an insured or a third-party claimant against an insurer \u201cfor actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.\u201d Redies\u2019 complaint does not specify any particular subsections of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA; however, on appeal she and ALPS confine their respective arguments to subsections (4) and (6), which provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-3\">No person may ... do any of the following: ... (4) refuse to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information;... (6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Section 33-18-201(4), (6), MCA (paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b628 An insurer, however, is not liable under \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, if it had \u201ca reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d Section 33-18-242(5), MCA. An insurer asserting this affirmative defense has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Watters v. Guaranty Nat. Ins.

Thus, we must step into ALPS\u2019s shoes during the communications and negotiations which took place from July 2001 (when Redies, through Harris, first presented Addy with her claims against him) through December 2002 (when the parties finally settled those claims). We then determine, from this perspective, whether the defense proffered by ALPS-namely, that an attorney retained by a conservator does not owe a duty to the protected person-was, at that time, \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims. Before doing so, however, it is necessary first to address the parties\u2019 dispute over whether this issue presents a question of fact or a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">II. Question of Fact or Question of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b630 In Dees <em>v. American Nat. Fire Ins.

Thus, such determinations generally must be based on the facts and circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><em>Dees, </em>260 Mont. at 452, 861 P.2d at 154 (Gray, J., joined by Turnage, C.J., and Nelson, J., specially concurring). We later adopted this proposition in <em>Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. Co., </em>263 Mont. 386, 869 P.2d 256 (1994), where we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">[Reasonableness is generally a question of fact; therefore, it is for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses in determining whether the insurer had a \u201creasonable basis\u201d for denying a claim. This is not a determination that can be made \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d as requested by the Deans and by Austin Mutual. Rather, whether an insurer has a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting a claim or the amount of a claim is to be determined as any other disputed issue of fact based upon the evidence and circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai2\"><em>Dean, </em>263 Mont. at 389, 869 P.2d at 258 (citing the special concurrence in <em>Dees), accord DeBruycker v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co., </em>266 Mont. 294, 298, 880 P.2d 819, 821 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b631 The following year, however, in <em>Watts v. Westland Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>271 Mont. 256, 895 P.2d 626 (1995), we determined that <em>Dean\u2019s </em>trier-of-fact rule did not apply when there was no insurance policy in effect at the time the injury occurred. <em>See Watts, </em>271 Mont. at 263, 895 P.2d at 630 (\u201c[T]here can be no genuine issues of material fact concerning [the insurers\u2019] obligations for damage to the cantaloupe crop\u201d given that \u201cthe binder that temporarily insured the cantaloupe was not in effect at the time of the July 18, 1993 hailstorm.\u201d). This same exception controlled our disposition of an unfair trade practices claim in <em>Bartlett v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>280 Mont. 63, 70, 929 P.2d 227, 231 (1996) (\u201cBartlett did not have an insurable interest in the property and, on that basis, Allstate clearly had a reasonable basis for not paying Bartlett\u2019s claim for insurance proceeds.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b632 We later acknowledged a second exception to the trier-of-fact rule. In <em>Watters, </em>we reasoned that the rule \u201cis not necessary in a summary judgment proceeding where the underlying \u201cbasis <em>in law\u2019 </em>[for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim] is grounded on a legal conclusion, and no issues of fact remain in dispute.\u201d <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 69 (emphasis added). Thus, we determined in <em>Watters </em>that it was for the court, not the trier of fact, to determine whether the applicable legal precedent provided an absolute defense as a matter of law. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b633 In the case at hand, Redies maintains that neither of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>exceptions to the trier-of-fact rule applies in this case and, therefore, that the reasonableness of ALPS\u2019s decision to contest her claims against Addy is a question of fact, thus precluding summary judgment. There is no dispute that Addy, in fact, was insured by ALPS at the time of the alleged malpractice; thus, Redies focuses on the second exception to the rule. Seizing on language in Watters \u2014 specifically, our observation that the case law on which the insurer had relied was \u201clegally conclusive\u201d as to the disposition of the Watters\u2019 claim against its insured, <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 72-she argues that unless there was \u201clegally conclusive\u201d law establishing that the insurer had <em>no </em>obligation to pay the claim, the \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d issue must go to the trier of fact. And since there was no \u201clegally conclusive\u201d law in Montana establishing that a lawyer retained by a conservator does <em>not </em>owe a duty to the protected person, she concludes that the reasonableness of ALPS\u2019s decision to contest her claims on this ground is a factual issue for a jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\">\u00b634 Redies\u2019 narrow interpretation of the second exception to the trier-of-fact rule is incorrect. Tobe sure, we noted in <em>Watters </em>that <em>Juedeman v. National Farmers Union, </em>253 Mont. 278, 833 P.2d 191 (1992), as \u201cthe lone precedent from Montana case law upon which [the insurer] could rely under the circumstances,\u201d was \u201clegally conclusive to the extent there was simply no other authority in Montana at the time.\u201d <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 71, 72. This was not to say, however, that whenever the insurer\u2019s decision to contest a claim is not sustained by \u201clegally conclusive\u201d law, the issue of reasonableness must go to the trier of fact. Rather, our reasoning centered on the fact that the insurer\u2019s basis in law for contesting the claim was \u201cgrounded on a legal conclusion.\u201d <em>See Watters, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b635  Accordingly, we now clarify that while the assessment of reasonableness generally is within the province of the jury (or the court acting as fact-finder), <em>Dean, </em>263 Mont. at 389, 869 P.2d at 258, reasonableness is a question of law for the court to determine when it depends entirely on interpreting relevant legal precedents and evaluating the insurer\u2019s proffered defense under those precedents. This distinction not only reflects the principle that the jury does not decide or determine the law, <em>see </em>\u00a7 25-7-102, MCA, but also honors the relevant language of the statute at issue, <em>see </em>\u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA (\u201cAn insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis <em>in law </em>... for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">III. The Legal Landscape</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b636 Turning now to the relevant legal landscape, we must, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>explained above, determine whether the defense proffered by ALPS on Addy\u2019s behalf-namely, that an attorney retained by a conservator does not owe a duty to the protected person-was \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims in 2001 and 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">A. First-Party Relationship between Addy and Redies</p>\n<p id=\"AOX\">\u00b637 Redies argues briefly that Addy acted not only as attorney for Cosner, but also as attorney for Redies. In essence, she suggests that Addy held himself out as her attorney and, thus, that there was an attorney-client relationship between them. Similarly, Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent articulates a credible argument that an attorney-client relationship exists between a protected person and the attorney retained by the protected person\u2019s conservator to render legal advice concerning the administration of the estate. Although the Dissent does not use the term, it apparently is of the view that the protected person and the attorney are in \u201cprivity of contract.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From this, the Dissent maintains that \u201cRedies was Addy\u2019s client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b638 Redies\u2019 and the Dissent\u2019s arguments, however, overlook the issue at hand, which is whether ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims. To answer this question, we must survey the legal landscape as it <em>actually </em>existed during the parties\u2019 negotiations. In this regard, neither Redies nor Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent cites any Montana authority establishing, or even intimating, that an attorney retained by a conservator represents the protected person. Had such authority existed at the time ALPS contested Redies\u2019 claims, this would be a different case. As it is, however, Redies and the Dissent seem to be faulting ALPS for contesting a theory of liability-namely, that Redies was Addy\u2019s client-whieh Redies and the Dissent believe is compelling but which, nevertheless, was an open question in Montana in 2001 and 2002. (Incidentally, Redies raised this same theory in the District Court, but her primary argument was that an attorney owes a duty of care to certain <em>third </em>parties such as herself.) Such an approach misplaces the focus of our inquiry, which is not on whether we agree with the plaintiffs theories of liability in the underlying suit but, rather, whether the insurer\u2019s grounds for contesting those theories were reasonable under the existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">B. Third-Party Relationship between Addy and Redies</p>\n<p id=\"AeR\">\u00b639 In addressing the issue of whether its defense in the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>suit was \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims, ALPS relies heavily on language in <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620. Specifically, ALPS points out that in <em>Watkins Trust, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he duty owed [by an attorney] to a nonclient beneficiary is <em>a matter of first impression </em>in Montana.\u201d <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 21 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Rhode v. Adams, </em>1998 MT 73, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 288 Mont. 278, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 957 P.2d 1124, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). According to ALPS, based on this language, \u201cthe scope of Add/s legal duty was undecided ... until <em>Watkins Trust </em>was decided on June 8, 2004\u201d; thus, contesting Redies\u2019 claims on the ground that Addy owed no legal duty to Redies \u201cwas reasonable as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\">\u00b640 Yet, when ALPS was investigating and negotiating Redies\u2019 claims in 2001 and 2002, the foregoing \u201cfirst impression\u201d language of <em>Watkins Trust </em>did not yet exist. The reasonableness of ALPS\u2019s decision to contest Redies\u2019 claims on the ground that Addy owed her no duty must be evaluated within the context of our then-existing precedents, not something we said in a later decision. <em>See Graf v. Continental Western Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 105, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 65, \u00b6 17, 89 P.3d 22, \u00b6 17 (\u201cThe [Unfair Trade Practices Act] standards focus on what the insurer knows at a particular point in time-before trial, during the investigative settlement stage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b641 Likewise, just because the scope of Addy\u2019s duty may have been \u201cundecided\u201d in 2001 and 2002, it does not <em>necessarily </em>follow that ALPS\u2019s decision to contest Redies\u2019 claims against Addy was reasonable. It seems that in ALPS\u2019s view, a legal theory for contesting a claim is reasonable <em>per se </em>so long as this Court has not yet explicitly rejected it-even if the theory has been called into serious question by then-existing precedents. We reject this interpretation of the statutory scheme, which turns reasonableness on its head and runs contrary to the public policy of Montana to encourage settlement and avoid unnecessary litigation, <em>see Watters, </em>\u00b6 57. To be sure, a tort defendant and his or her insurer should, as ALPS submits, be able to test the scope and boundaries of legal duties, remedies, and defenses; but, at the same time, an insurer should not be immune from liability under \u00a7 33-18-242(1), MCA, as Redies points out, simply because this Court had not yet <em>explicitly </em>rejected the legal proposition on which the insurer relied in the underlying action. This is precisely the point of evaluating the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the insurer\u2019s proffered defense. <em>Cf. Graf, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18 (rejecting the proposition that a defense verdict in the underlying action provides, as a matter of law, a reasonable basis defense to a subsequent Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cUTPA\u201d) claim, since such a rule would promote the claim settlement abuses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>UTPA was designed to deter-e.g., by encouraging insurers to obtain defense verdicts in the underlying suit at any cost).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b642 In this regard, although <em>Watkins Trust </em>was the first instance in which we explicitly held that an attorney owed a duty to a nonclient third party-specifically, we held that a drafting attorney owes a duty to nonclient beneficiaries named in the drafted instrument, <em>see Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22-our decision was not the watershed event suggested by ALPS and the District Court. Rather, our holding was an extension of existing precedents. Indeed, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">a finding of duty is <em>consistent with existing Montana law. </em>This Court has noted that a multi-factor balancing test adopted in other jurisdictions may be appropriate in deciding the duty owed by attorneys to nonclients in estate planning. <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17. Additionally, we have recognized liability to nonclients in other professional contexts. <em>See, e.g., Thayer v. Hicks </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 138, 793 P.2d 784 (accounting firm liable to nonclient); <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Serv. v. HKM Assoc. </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 878 P.2d 248 (professional engineer liable to nonclient); <em>Turner v. Kerin &amp; Assoc. </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 117, 938 P.2d 1368 (professional engineer liable to nonclient).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\"><em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\u00b643 Accordingly, the determinative question is whether this progression in our case law toward holding an attorney liable to certain nonclients had, by the time Redies stated her claims against Addy, reached the point at which ALPS\u2019s assertion that he owed her no duty no longer constituted \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b644 The starting point for answering this question is <em>Rhode, </em>in which we signaled that an attorney may owe a duty to nonclients in some contexts. Specifically, after noting that we had not before discussed \u201cwhether an attorney owes a duty to third persons to exercise care in the performance of services for his or her client,\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 12, we went on to state that such a duty may arise in some contexts, but not where the attorney is representing a client in adversarial proceedings (as was the case in <em>Rhode), Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17. We further indicated that \u201ca multi-factor balancing test, such as that set out in <em>[Trask v. Butler, </em>872 P.2d 1080, 1083 (Wash. 1994)], may be effective when used to address the duties of attorneys in transactional matters or estate planning and probate practice.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17. Thus, as of our decision in <em>Rhode </em>in 1998, it was clear that an attorney <em>may </em>owe a duty to nonclients in some nonadversarial contexts and that the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>balancing test <em>may </em>be effective for ascertaining the existence of such a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\">\u00b645 Redies suggests that the question of whether an attorney owes a duty to nonclients was not as unsettled as the foregoing language in <em>Rhode </em>implies. She argues that \u201c[l]ong before any claim was asserted against Mr. Addy, this Court had effectively discarded the outdated \u2018privity of contract\u2019 concept.\u201d In support of this proposition, she directs our attention to the three other cases identified in \u00b6 22 of <em>Watkins </em>Trust-namely, <em>Thayer, Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>and <em>Turner </em>\u2014 in which we recognized the existence of a duty to nonclients in a number of professional contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b646 In <em>Thayer, </em>we addressed the extent to which an accountant owes a duty of care to third parties with whom he is not in privity. After discussing three different approaches by which courts determine the extent of an accountant\u2019s duty of care to nonclients, <em>Thayer, </em>243 Mont. at 144-46, 793 P.2d at 788-89, we held that \u201can accountant may owe a duty of care to third parties with whom he is not in privity of contract,\u201d but \u201cthis duty exists only if the accountant actually knows that a specific third party intends to rely upon his work product and only if the reliance is in connection with a particular transaction or transactions of which the accountant is aware when he prepares the work product,\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>243 Mont. at 149, 793 P.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b647 Next, <em>in Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>we addressed whether an engineering firm could be held liable to a contractor with whom it was not in contractual privity. HKM, the engineering firm, argued that an engineer only has a duty to the party with whom it has contracted. <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 502, 878 P.2d at 252. We rejected this contention, noting that HKM\u2019s argument \u201cignores the established law in Montana abolishing the requirement of privity of contract to maintain an action in tort.\u201d <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 502, 878 P.2d at 253 <em>(citing Hawthorne v. Kober Const. Co., Inc., </em>196 Mont. 519, 640 P.2d 467 (1982), and <em>Tynes v. Bankers Life Co., </em>224 Mont. 350, 730 P.2d 1115 (1986)). We went on to hold that \u201ca third party contractor may successfully recover for purely economic loss against a project engineer or architect when the design professional knew or should have foreseen that the particular plaintiff or an identifiable class of plaintiffs were at risk in relying on the information supplied.\u201d <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 506, 878 P.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b648 Finally, in <em>Turner, </em>we considered whether one who succeeds to a mortgagee\u2019s security interest in real property could state a cause of action against a third party for damages to that property which impair his or her security interest. Based on a passage from Prosser, <em>The Law </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>of Torts </em>\u00a7 93 (4th ed., West 1971), which we had also relied on in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>we reasoned that \u201cby contracting with the owners to perform engineering work on the property, Kerin placed itself in a relation toward any party who held a security interest in the property that the law imposed upon him an obligation, sounding in tort and not in contract, to act in such a way that the security interest would not be injured.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>283 Mont. at 126, 938 P.2d at 1374. Accordingly, we held that \u201ca person who, subsequent to the damage to the property, acquires a pre-existing security interest in the property can maintain a cause of action for impairment of that security interest to the extent of the outstanding debt.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>283 Mont. at 127, 938 P.2d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">\u00b649 Relying on these cases, Redies asserts that this Court \u201cabolished the old \u2018privity of contract\u2019 requirement that formed the basis of ALPS\u2019 \u2018no privity\u2019 defense.\u201d Similarly, Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent points out that this Court called the privity concept into doubt twenty years before ALPS relied on this defense to Redies\u2019 claims against Addy. Specifically, we stated in <em>Hawthorne </em>that \u201c[w]e view privity to be a concept having proper application in the area of contract law. There seems to be no sound public policy argument for extending its application to tort.\u201d <em>Hawthorne, </em>196 Mont. at 523, 640 P.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"Aic\">\u00b650  We agree with both Redies and Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent that <em>Hawthorne, Tynes, Thayer, Jim\u2019s Excavating, Turner, </em>and <em>Rhode </em>reflected the demise of the \u201cprivity of contract\u201d requirement historically imposed upon a plaintiff seeking to hold a defendant liable for professional malpractice. Indeed, we indicated in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>that this requirement had been \u201cabolish[ed].\u201d <em>See Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 502, 878 P.2d at 253 (referring to \u201cthe established law in Montana abolishing the requirement of privity of contract to maintain an action in tort\u201d). However, none of these cases abolished the requirement that a plaintiff in a professional malpractice action first prove that the defendant owed her a duty of care, as Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent ably demonstrates with respect to attorneys. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 86-87 (citing <em>Carlson v. Morton, </em>229 Mont. 234, 238, 745 P.2d 1133, 1136 (1987); <em>Lorash v. Epstein, </em>236 Mont. 21, 24, 767 P.2d 1335, 1337 (1989); <em>Merzlak v. Purcell, </em>252 Mont. 527, 529, 830 P.2d 1278, 1279 (1992); and <em>Hauschulz v. Michael Law Firm, </em>2001 MT 160, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 102, \u00b6 11, 30 P.3d 357, \u00b6 11). In other words, the mere absence of a privity requirement does not render a professional liable for the negligent performance of a contract to any and all third parties. To the contrary, in recognizing tort liability in the absence of privity, we have concomitantly limited the class of plaintiffs to identifiable third parties (typically, those who are known or are reasonably foreseeable by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>professional, <em>see Thayer, </em>243 Mont. at 149, 793 P.2d at 791; <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 506, 878 P.2d at 255).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">\u00b651 In this regard, Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent points out that by 2001, at least three different approaches existed in our case law for ascertaining the duty of care owed by a professional to third parties-namely, the rule enunciated by Prosser and applied by this Court in <em>Hawthorne, Tynes, Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>and <em>Turner-, </em>the approach we took in <em>Thayer-, </em>and the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test set forth in <em>Rhode. See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 89-92. Yet, we had not adopted any of these approaches with respect to attorneys specifically. Moreover, we signaled in <em>Rhode </em>that the <em>Trask </em>test, in particular, may be effective for this purpose. <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b652 Thus, the circumstances and extent of any duty owed by an attorney to a nonclient was not nearly as well-defined as Redies and Justice Nelson\u2019s Dissent suggest it was during the period in which ALPS contested Redies\u2019 claims against Addy. We acknowledged in <em>Rhode </em>that we had never before addressed whether an attorney, specifically, owes a duty to third persons to exercise care in the performance of services for his or her client. <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 12. And we left this issue unresolved with respect to nonadversarial situations, stating merely that \u201ca multi-factor balancing test, such as that set out in <em>Trask, may </em>be effective when used to address the duties of attorneys in transactional matters or estate planning and probate practice.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17 (emphasis added). Given this equivocal language, the question of whether an attorney retained by a conservator owed a duty to the protected person was unsettled in 2001 and 2002. Notably, Redies concedes as much by pointing out that until <em>Watkins Trust, </em>there was no \u201clegally conclusive\u201d law in Montana establishing that a lawyer retained by a conservator does or does not have a duty to the protected person. We therefore reject the contention that the law in Montana was decidedly against ALPS\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">IV. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b653 As explained above, it was clear as of our decision in <em>Rhode </em>that an attorney <em>may </em>owe a duty to nonclients in some nonadversarial contexts and that the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test <em>may </em>be effective for ascertaining the existence of such a duty. Not surprisingly, therefore, Addy (represented by ALPS) addressed the <em>Trask </em>test at length in his motion for summary judgment in Redies v. Addy. After pointing out that a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action \u201cmust establish that the professional owed him a duty of care,\u201d he acknowledged that \u201c[s]ome courts ... have extended the duty of an attorney to certain non-clients.\u201d He then asserted that \u201c[a]lthough the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Supreme Court has not unequivocally adopted the multi-factor balancing test, it is clear that even if it was applied, there would be no liability to Janet Redies under these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b654 In <em>Rhode, </em>we listed the six factors which comprise the <em>Trask </em>balancing test: (1) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff; (2) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff; (3) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (4) the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; and (6) the extent to which the profession would be unduly burdened by a finding of liability. <em>See Rhode, </em>\u00b6 14. Applying these factors, Addy argued that Redies was an \u201cincidental beneficiary\u201d of his attorney-client relationship with Cosner; that he \u201chad no authority to act on his own with regard to [Redies\u2019 estate]\u201d and, thus, Redies\u2019 action should be directed against Cosner, the conservator, who was \u201c[t]he only person with that legal authority\u201d; and that public policy considerations counseled against finding a duty in this case because \u201c[t]o hold Mr. Addy had duties to Janet Redies in addition to those of Mr. Cosner would create an irresolvable conflict of interest and division of loyalties for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b655  Given our decision in <em>Watkins Trust, </em>the foregoing argument is now of dubious merit. However, we cannot say that it was unreasonable <em>at the time it was made. </em>Given that we had signaled in <em>Rhode </em>that the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test may be effective for ascertaining the existence and scope of the duty owed by an attorney to nonclients in nonadversarial contexts, it was reasonable for ALPS to apply this test to the factual scenario at hand. Accordingly, we conclude that ALPS had \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b656 Redies points out that the authors of the December 4, 2001 evaluation commissioned by ALPS \u201cdiscounted\u201d the privity defense before ALPS denied Redies\u2019 claims and \u201caccurately predicted\u201d that this defense would not prevail. Thus, she argues, it was unreasonable for ALPS to contest her claims against Addy on the ground that he owed her no duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b657 The legal advice which informed ALPS\u2019s decision to contest Redies\u2019 claim is relevant to whether that decision was grounded in \u201ca reasonable basis in law.\u201d Had ALPS received advice that Addy owed Redies a duty under the existing law, this would be a different case. As it is, however, the evaluation authors\u2019 ultimate assessment was that \u201csufficient questions exist as to the issue of liability so that we believe it is not reasonably clear.\u201d And on the privity issue in particular, they stated that \u201cabsent a direct attorney-client relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>[Redies] and [Addy], no action should be allowed.\u201d Their acknowledgement that \u201cthere have been challenges in the past as to this privity requirement\u201d and their speculation that \u201cour court may ... simply find[] that the relationship between the protected person and the conservator\u2019s attorney [is] close enough to allow suit\u201d did not render ALPS\u2019s subsequent argument based on the <em>Trask </em>test unreasonable under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">\u00b658 We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy. We now turn to the question of whether, given this outcome, any genuine issues of material fact remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">V. Factual Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b659 Redies asserts that a number of factual issues precluded granting summary judgment in this case. First, as described earlier, the District Court reasoned that \u201can adversarial situation\u201d existed between Redies and Uerling and, thus, that Addy did not owe Redies a fiduciary duty dining the months immediately following her accident. Redies maintains that whether any of the relationships relevant to the issues herein were \u201cadversarial\u201d presents a factual issue. Second, the District Court also reasoned that Redies\u2019 interests \u201cshould have been protected by her own attorney,\u201d which presumably is a reference to Dunaway. Redies asserts that whether Dunaway acted as her attorney during that time period (aside from Dunaway\u2019s brief role as attorney ad litem) and whether Cosner relied on Dunaway for advice in managing the conservatorship were issues of fact precluding summary judgment. Finally, Redies argues that whether Addy acted only as the attorney for Cosner, as conservator, or whether, by his statements and actions, he created an attorney-client relationship with Redies and her estate presents a factual issue. However, given our conclusion that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy, resolution of these factual issues is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b660 With respect to Redies\u2019 \u201cpretext\u201d claim, she points out that the authors of the December 4, 2001 evaluation commissioned by ALPS stated that they \u201cdo not put a great deal of stock in this privity defense.\u201d Thus, she argues, there is a factual dispute over \u201cwhether ALPS actually relied upon the \u2018no privity\u2019 defense, or whether that defense was asserted primarily to delay and increase the expense in prosecuting Ms. Redies\u2019 legitimate claim.\u201d Redies raised this issue in the District Court in response to ALPS\u2019s summary judgment motion; however, the court did not rule on it explicitly. Nevertheless, we observe that one of the theories advanced by ALPS in the underlying suit (on Addy\u2019s behalf) came straight out of <em>Rhode, </em>and, as explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>above, it was reasonable for ALPS to apply this precedent (and the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test recited in <em>Rhode) </em>to the factual scenario at hand. Thus, we conclude that Redies\u2019 \u201cpretext\u201d claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b661 Redies also argues that, irrespective of our decision with respect to her \u00a7 33-18-201(6) claim, a trial is still necessary on her \u00a7 33-18-201(4) claim. She points out that in <em>Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2003 MT 122, 315 Mont. 519, 70 P.3d 721, we held that the insurer had a reasonable basis in law for asserting that it was entitled to condition its payment of policy limits on the plaintiffs\u2019 providing it with a release of all claims against its insureds, <em>Shilhanek, </em>\u00b6 30, but that a factual issue remained as to whether the insurer had refused to make advance payments to the plaintiffs to cover their medical expenses without first conducting a reasonable investigation, <em>Shilhanek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34, 36-37. Thus, she maintains, even if ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for contesting her claims against Addy, a factual issue remains as to whether ALPS refused to pay her claims \u201cwithout conducting a reasonable investigation,\u201d \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b662  Redies misapprehends our disposition of the subsection (4) and subsection (6) claims in <em>Shilhanek. </em>As ALPS points out, the question of whether the insurer had violated its duty to make advance payments of medical expenses-a duty the insurer did not dispute it had \u2014 was separate from the question of whether it had a reasonable basis in law for refusing to pay policy limits without a release. <em>Compare Shilhanek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-31, <em>with Shilhanek, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-37. In the case at hand, by contrast, the alleged subsection (6) violation (that ALPS \u201cneglect[ed] to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability ha[d] become reasonably clear\u201d) and the alleged subsection (4) violation (that ALPS \u201crefuse[d] to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information\u201d) are intertwined. At the time ALPS denied Redies\u2019 claims, the record discloses that it had investigated the facts and obtained an evaluation of its options under the law applicable to those facts. This research, ultimately, formed the basis for Addy\u2019s defense in the underlying action-namely, that under <em>Rhode </em>and the <em>Trask </em>test he did not owe a duty to Redies. Thus, the question of whether ALPS conducted a reasonable investigation before refusing to pay Redies\u2019 claims is resolved by ALPS\u2019s \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d defense under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b663  The District Court correctly concluded that ALPS had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>reasonable basis in law for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy and that there were no genuine issues as to any material facts. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that ALPS was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b279-3\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> All of the proceedings discussed herein took place in the District Court for the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> These and other significant decisions reached by Addy, Cosner, Uerling, and Dunaway at the September 6, 1995 meeting were memorialized in a letter written by Addy to Cosner on September 7, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> Section 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA, provides as follows: \u201cA conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which he was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation to... employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even though they are associated with the conservator, to advise or assist him in the performance of his administrative duties; act upon their recommendation without independent investigation; and instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary. . ..\u201d (Paragraph break omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-4\"> As discussed earlier, Judge Baugh reached the opposite conclusion in the underlying action (Redies v.

Then, following its analysis, the Court concludes that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law to contest Redies\u2019 claims against Addy \u201cat the time it was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b666 I agree with these statements but write only to clarify that, in 2001-02, ALPS was defending Addy against allegations he committed malpractice in 1995. Redies\u2019 complaint asserted that Addy negligently failed to recommend or establish a self-sufficiency trust under the circumstances that existed immediately following her bicycling accident which occurred in 1995. <em>See </em>\u00b6 15. Redies claimed that Addy committed malpractice by failing to research and take advantage of statutes as they existed in 1995. Obviously, if 1995 law had not allowed the creation of a self-sufficiency trust, there could be no claim against Addy for failing to recommend or establish one.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b667 Thus, in defending against Redies\u2019 malpractice claim, Addy was entitled to have his actions judged in accordance with the law in effect at the time he acted, in 1995. He, with ALPS defending him, was entitled to argue to a jury (if factual issues precluded summary judgment) or to a judge that, under the law as it existed at the time, he had committed no malpractice or he had no duty to Redies. He made this argument and, although it was rejected by Judge Baugh, the judge\u2019s order nonetheless concluded that Addy owed a duty to Redies at the time \u201cwhen he rendered legal advice to the conservator, Mr. Cosner,\u201d or 1995. This is as it should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b668 Because Addy was entitled to be judged, in the underlying malpractice action, under the law as it existed when he acted, ALPS was likewise entitled, when defending its own actions taken in Adder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defense for purposes of the UTPA claim, to offer the law as it existed in 1995. To be sure, the law evolves, and the applicable law did evolve in the six years between Addy\u2019s actions and the filing of the claims against Addy. However, ALPS should not be judged solely by the law as it existed for purposes of an act of negligence committed in 2001. ALPS was entitled to make, within the UTPA action, the same argument Addy was entitled to make in the malpractice action, i.e., that it did not initially appear that Addy had a duty to Redies, based upon the state of the law in 1995. While the evolvement of the law in 1995 to 2001 is also relevant, the analysis of the law for Redies\u2019 claims properly begins as it existed in 1995. Consideration of the state of the law in 1995 demonstrates even more clearly that ALPS had a reasonable basis in law for initially denying the claims. As we note in the Opinion, it was not until our decision in <em>Rhode </em>in 1998 that \u201cit was clear that an attorney <em>may </em>owe a duty to nonclients in some nonadversarial contexts.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 44 (emphasis in original). Addy\u2019s actions preceded <em>Rhode\u2019s </em>signal that the law with regard to duty may be changing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b669 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b280-5\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"ADO\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b670 I dissent from the basic premise underlying the whole of the Court\u2019s Opinion, that being that Janet Redies is a mere \u201cnonclient\u201d or third-party beneficiary of Addy\u2019s legal services. I therefore dissent from all of the conclusions that flow from this premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b671 Cosner was appointed by the District Court in 1995 to act as Redies\u2019 permanent conservator, in light of Redies\u2019 inability to handle her financial affairs and her personal arrangements. Opinion, \u00b6 6. As we said <em>in In re Estate of Bayers, </em>2000 MT 49, \u00b6 14, 304 Mont. 296, \u00b6 14, 21 P.3d 3, \u00b6 14, \u201c[c]onservatorship proceedings are established to promote the best interests of the protected person.\u201d As conservator, Cosner assumed the role of a fiduciary for Redies as the protected person. Section 72-5-423, MCA. In furtherance of the performance of his fiduciary duties, Cosner retained Addy to advise and assist him, as he was empowered to do under \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA, and the two then met in September 1995 to determine how best to conserve and manage Redies\u2019 estate. \u00b6 8. Once a management plan was developed pursuant to Addy\u2019s advice and counsel, Cosner proceeded to manage Redies\u2019 property in accordance with that plan, selling off her property and paying her debts until such time as Redies qualified for Medicaid and SSI coverage. \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b672 During the early years that Addy advised Cosner concerning Redies\u2019 estate, he referred to himself variously as \u201cI represent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Estate of Janet Redies\u201d (December 1997 correspondence from Addy to Redies\u2019 creditors) and \u201cAttorney for Ms. Redies\u201d (Request for a Fair Hearing filed with the Department of Public Health and Human Services on May 30, 1997). No doubt other filings in this voluminous record reflect similar representations. Matters between Redies on the one hand, and Cosner and Addy on the other, were not at all adversarial until 1998, when Redies had recovered sufficiently to question the disposition of her assets. \u00b6 11. Thus, during the period in question-that being the time period during which Redies\u2019 estate was dissipated-Cosner was acting as a fiduciary for Redies, Addy was advising him how best to fulfill that function, and Addy was representing himself to third parties as Redies\u2019 attorney. And, significantly, Addy\u2019s services were being paid for by Redies\u2019 estate. Given these undisputed facts, it mystifies me that we could conclude, as did the District Court, that Redies was at best a third-party beneficiary to whom Addy did not owe a duty of professional care.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">\u00b673 The Court errs in using <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, as a template. In that case, the defendant attorney Lacosta was retained by Stanley and Carolyn Watkins to draft an estate plan for the two of them. Lacosta drafted their wills and a Revocable Trust Agreement (Trust). <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. It eventually became apparent that the instruments Lacosta drafted did not comport with Stanley\u2019s and Carolyn\u2019s wishes, and that the deficiencies in the instruments would have serious implications for Steve Williamson (Steve), the parties\u2019 son and the intended beneficiary of the Trust. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 13. Ultimately, the Trust and Steve, individually and as Personal Representative of Stanley\u2019s Estate (Appellants), brought a legal malpractice suit against Lacosta, alleging negligence in her drafting of the Trust documents and Stanley\u2019s will. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b674 In addressing the question of whether the Appellants had standing to sue Lacosta, we looked at the relationship between Lacosta and each of them separately. First, we found that, because Stanley had been Lacosta\u2019s client and was now deceased, the Estate stood in his shoes and had standing to sue Lacosta. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 19. Steve\u2019s standing, however, presented a different question, in that he was claiming standing as a <em>nonclient beneficiary of the Estate. </em>We said that the duty owed to a nonclient beneficiary was a matter of first impression in Montana. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 21. It was this analysis that the District Court fastened upon in its Order, concluding it applied to the question of Addy\u2019s duty to Redies (Opinion, \u00b6 24) and it is this same analysis that underpins this Court\u2019s erroneous conclusions in \u00b6\u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>53-58 to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b675 The difference between Steve\u2019s position vis-\u00e1-vis the defendant attorney Lacosta in the <em>Watkins Trust </em>case and Redies\u2019 position vis-avis Addy in this case is, to my mind, readily apparent. Steve was never Lacosta\u2019s client. Lacosta\u2019s duty of professional care ran to her clients, Testators Stanley and Carolyn, and not to Steve as the beneficiary. This is why the question of his standing was always framed as that of a <em>nonclient. </em>Here, by contrast, Addy was hired to serve Redies\u2019 best interests, and he was paid by her estate to perform this function. In short, Redies was Addy\u2019s client. We therefore err when throughout our analysis, we accept as correct the District Court\u2019s flawed presumption, and cast Redies as a nonclient on par with Steve in <em>Watkins Trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXu\">\u00b676 The Court concedes there is some credibility to the position advocated here (see Opinion, \u00b6 37), but ultimately rejects it because there is no Montana authority cited for the proposition that an attorney retained by a conservator to protect the interests of a protected person actually owes that person a duty of care. Indeed, there is no Montana authority on point, perhaps because the proposition is so obviously true that it has not been litigated. I submit that the lack of authority for the proposition I advocate here neither renders it unsupportable, nor justifies ALP\u2019s rejection of Redies\u2019 claims-especially in light <em>of the </em>insurer\u2019s possession of correspondence in which Addy actually represented himself as Redies\u2019 attorney or the attorney for her estate. Moreover, I find it especially unfortunate that, while there is likewise no precedent for the position adopted by the Court here-i.e., that the attorney retained by the conservator owes no duty of care to the protected person-the Court has now supplied a precedent by which future litigants, and in particular \u201cprotected\u201d persons, will be bound to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b677 If one accepts the premise that Redies was Addy\u2019s client and not a mere nonclient beneficiary of his work, then the entire foundation of the District Court\u2019s analysis and this Court\u2019s Opinion crumbles. And it should. We have in effect said here that an attorney hired and paid by one\u2019s estate to serve the best interests of an incapacitated person does not owe that person a direct duty of professional care. We have erred. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b282-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Azy\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b678 I believe that the \u201cfirst-party\u201d theory of liability set forth in Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent-that Redies was Addy\u2019s client-was the correct approach for analyzing Redies claims against Addy. Thus, the contention that an attorney retained by a conservator does not also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>represent the protected person-though the attorney was retained specifically to advise or assist the conservator in the administration of the protected person\u2019s estate-was not \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, for contesting the protected person\u2019s legal malpractice claim. I therefore disagree with the Court\u2019s first-party analysis (\u00b6\u00b6 37-38)-especially here, where Addy, while representing Cosner, signed a document as \u201cAttorney for Ms. Redies\u201d and stated in a letter to Redies\u2019 creditors that \u201cI represent the Estate of Janet Redies.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 72 of Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent. Indeed, ALPS should be bound by Addy\u2019s admissions. For these reasons, I join Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">\u00b679 Given this conclusion, it is not necessary to reach Redies\u2019 \u201cthird-part/\u2019 theory of liability against Addy. However, because the Court, in my view, makes a critical error in its analysis of ALPS\u2019s proffered defense under this theory, it is important to explain why the contention that an attorney retained by a conservator does not owe a duty of care to the protected person also was not <em>\u201ca </em>reasonable basis in law\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA. In this regard, I agree, for the most part, with the Court\u2019s preliminary discussion of this issue. In particular, I agree that our decision depends on the legal landscape as it existed during the negotiations which took place in 2001 and 2002 (\u00b6 29); I agree that the reasonableness of ALPS\u2019s defense is a question of law (\u00b6\u00b6 30-35); I agree that <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, 321 Mont. 432, 92 P.3d 620, does not dictate the outcome of this case (\u00b6\u00b6 39-40); and I agree that an insurer\u2019s proffered defense (on behalf of its insured in the underlying action) is not reasonable <em>per se </em>just because this Court has not yet rejected the defense explicitly (\u00b6\u00b6 41-43).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b680 The point at which I part ways with the Court is its assessment of the legal landscape that existed in late-2001 and 2002. In my view, the Court improperly discounts the advanced progression of our caselaw toward holding a professional liable to third parties whose interests may be expected to be affected by the professional\u2019s negligent performance of a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b681 Furthermore, I disagree with the Court\u2019s assessment of ALPS\u2019s arguments under our then-existing precedents. Even if it was reasonable for ALPS to rely <em>solely </em>on the multi-factor balancing test set forth in <em>Trask v. Butler, </em>872 P.2d 1080, 1083 (Wash. 1994), as a defense to Redies\u2019 third-party theory of liability against Addy, the Court errs in concluding that ALPS\u2019s actual application of that test was reasonable. To the contrary, ALPS\u2019s analysis (on Addy\u2019s behalf) was incomplete, contrary to the facts of this case, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>unreasonable. I therefore do not agree that ALPS proffered \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 third-party theory, and I conclude that summary judgment in favor of ALPS was not proper in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">II. ALPS\u2019s \u201cPrivity of Contract\u201d Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b682 In Addy\u2019s brief in support of his motion for summary judgment in the underlying suit, ALPS relied on two theories: \u201cprivity of contract\u201d and the <em>Trask </em>test. With respect to the former, it took the position that where the plaintiff is not in privity of contract with the defendant, she may not recover damages for the defendant\u2019s negligent performance of the contract. Translated to the case at hand: Because Redies was not in privity with Addy, whose contract to provide legal services (under this third-party theory) was with Cosner, she could not recover damages for his allegedly negligent performance of that contract (advising Cosner to pauperize Redies instead of recommending the establishment of a self-sufficiency trust). According to ALPS, \u201cMr. Addy acted as attorney for Mr. Cosner, the Conservator and Ms. Uerling, the Guardian. That was the extent of his attorney-client relationships in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b683 Yet, twenty years before ALPS relied on this defense to Redies\u2019 claims against Addy, we observed that \u201c[t]his Court was a pioneer in abolishing privity as a requirement for recovery in a personal injury or wrongful death case.\u201d <em>Hawthorne v. Kober Const. Co., Inc., </em>196 Mont. 519, 523, 640 P.2d 467, 469 (1982) (citing <em>Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales, U. S. A., </em>Inc., 162 Mont. 506, 513 P.2d 268 (1973)). We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">We have not felt permanently bound to archaic legal concepts no matter how deeply rooted they may be. We view privity to be a concept having proper application in the area of contract law. <em>There seems to be no sound public policy argument for extending its application to tort.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\"><em>Hawthorne, </em>196 Mont. at 523, 640 P.2d at 469 (emphasis added). We then went on to adopt the following rule enunciated in Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 93, at 622, 623 (4th ed., West 1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">[B]y entering into a contract with A, the defendant may place himself in such a relation toward B that the law will impose upon him an obligation, sounding in tort and not in contract, to act in such a way that B will not be injured. The incidental fact of the existence of the contract with A does not negative the responsibility of the actor <em>when he enters upon a course of affirmative conduct which may be expected to affect the interests of another person.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>... [T]here are situations in which the making of the contract creates a relation between the defendant and the promisee, which is sufficient to impose a tort duty of reasonable care. By the same token, there are situations in which the making of a contract with A may create a relation between the defendant and B, which will create a similar duty toward B, and may result in liability for failure to act. [Emphasis added, footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><em>See Hawthorne, </em>196 Mont. at 523-24, 640 P.2d at 470 (quoting the foregoing text from Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 93).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b684 Consistent with <em>Hawthorne, </em>we have rejected the privity of contract defense in a variety of contexts. <em>See, e.g., Tynes v. Bankers Life Co., </em>224 Mont. 350, 359-60, 730 P.2d 1115, 1121 (1986) (insurer liable in tort to insured\u2019s father, notwithstanding the absence of privity (quoting Prosser\u2019s rule)); <em>Thayer v. Hicks, </em>243 Mont. 138, 149, 793 P.2d 784, 791 (1990) (accountant liable to third parties who he knows intend to rely upon his work product); <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Service v. HKM Assoc., </em>265 Mont. 494, 502, 506, 878 P.2d 248, 253, 255 (1994) (project engineer or architect liable to third parties who foreseeably may rely on the information supplied by the engineer or architect (quoting Prosser\u2019s rule)); <em>Turner v. Kerin &amp; Associates, </em>283 Mont. 117, 125-26, 938 P.2d 1368, 1373-74 (1997) (engineering firm liable to any party who holds or succeeds to a security interest in the property serviced by the firm (quoting Prosser\u2019s rule)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b685 Thus, by 2001, it was firmly established in our caselaw that the requirement of privity of contract to maintain an action in tort had been abolished. Indeed, in <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s privity argument precisely because it ignored \u201cthe <em>established </em>law in Montana abolishing the requirement of privity of contract to maintain an action in tort.\u201d <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 502, 878 P.2d at 253 (emphasis added). And attorney malpractice actions were no exception. In <em>Rhode v. Adams, </em>1998 MT 73, 288 Mont. 278, 957 P.2d 1124, we observed that an attorney may owe a duty to someone other than his or her client, at least in nonadversarial contexts. <em>See Rhode, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-17. This observation was consistent with, our adoption of Prosser\u2019s rule in <em>Hawthorne </em>(though we did not cite Prosser in <em>Rhode), </em>and it confirmed that privity of contract is <em>not </em>required to maintain a malpractice action against an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b686 It is not surprising, therefore, that none of the authorities proffered by ALPS in the underlying action supports the argument that privity-notwithstanding our consistent and repeated rejections of the concept in <em>Hawthorne, Tynes, Thayer, Jim\u2019s Excavating, Turner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and Rhode-was, nevertheless, still required to maintain an attorney malpractice action. ALPS cited <em>Grenz v. Prezeau, </em>244 Mont. 419, 798 P.2d 112 (1990), in Addy\u2019s motion for summary judgment, for the proposition that \u201c[ejssential to a malpractice action is proof that an attorney-client relationship existed.\u201d On appeal, ALPS cites <em>Stott v. Fox, </em>246 Mont. 301, 805 P.2d 1305 (1990), and <em>Carlson v. Morton, </em>229 Mont. 234, 745 P.2d 1133 (1987), for the same proposition. But <em>Grenz, Stott, </em>and <em>Carlson </em>do not stand for a rule that a plaintiff must have \u201cprivity of contract\u201d with the defendant-attorney in order to maintain a malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b687 To the contrary, we stated in <em>Carlson </em>that \u201c[ijn any professional negligence action, the plaintiff must prove that the professional owed him <em>a duty, </em>that the professional failed to live up to that duty, thus causing damages to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>229 Mont. at 238, 745 P.2d at 1136 (emphasis added). Quoting some of this language from <em>Carlson </em>in <em>Merzlak v. Purcell, </em>252 Mont. 527, 830 P.2d 1278 (1992), we explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">Attorney malpractice is professional negligence. In order to recover in a professional negligence action, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that the professional owed him <em>a duty, </em>and that the professional failed to live up to that duty, thus causing damages to the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"><em>Merzlak, </em>252 Mont. at 529, 830 P.2d at 1279 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Lorash v. Epstein, </em>236 Mont. 21, 24, 767 P.2d 1335, 1337 (1989), in turn quoting <em>Carlson, </em>229 Mont. at 238, 745 P.2d at 1136); <em>accord Hauschulz v. Michael Law Firm, </em>2001 MT 160, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 102, \u00b6 11, 30 P.3d 357, \u00b6 11 (\u201cTo recover damages in a legal malpractice claim, a plaintiff must establish each of the following elements: first, that the professional owed him <em>a duty of care-, ...\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Merzlak, </em>252 Mont. at 529, 830 P.2d at 1279)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b688 Thus, our statement in <em>Grenz, </em>244 Mont. at 426, 798 P.2d at 116, and <em>Stott, </em>246 Mont. at 305, 805 P.2d at 1307, that a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must establish that \u201can attorney-client relationship\u201d existed was not a resurrection of the long-discarded requirement of privity of contract. Rather, it was another way of stating that the plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of care. Notably, ALPS effectively conceded this point in the underlying action. Immediately after asserting in Addy\u2019s summary judgment motion that \u201c[ejssential to a malpractice action is proof that an attorney-client relationship existed,\u201d ALPS went on to explain as follows: <em>\u201cPut another way, </em>the Plaintiff must establish that the professional owed him a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of care.\u201d (Emphasis added, citing Hauschulz.) Therefore, the flaw in ALPS\u2019s position that Addy had no duty to Redies (because he was retained by Cosner) was the mistaken premise that \u201cattorney-client relationship\u201d means \u201cprivity of contract.\u201d To the contrary, as our then-existing caselaw established, the requirement of privity to maintain an action in tort had been abolished. Accordingly, a defense that used the long-discarded concept of privity as a template was <em>not </em>\u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 third-party theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">III. Three Approaches for Ascertaining Duty to Third Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b689 The specific question ALPS faced in evaluating Redies\u2019 third-party theory of liability against Addy, therefore, was not whether the two of them were in privity but, rather, whether he owed her a duty of care. In this regard, having acknowledged that \u201c[s]ome courts ... have extended the duty of an attorney to certain non-clients,\u201d ALPS proffered a second theory in support of Addy\u2019s motion for summary judgment-namely, that such a duty should not be extended to a protected person in a conservatorship. As support for this position, ALPS relied solely on the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test. Yet, given our equivocal language in R/iode-specifically, that \u201ca multi-factor balancing test, such as that set out in <em>Trask, may </em>be effective when used to address the duties of attorneys in transactional matters or estate planning and probate practice,\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17 (emphasis added)-it was not reasonable for ALPS to ignore completely, as it did, then-existing alternative approaches for ascertaining the duty of care owed by a professional to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b690 Again, the rule enunciated by Prosser and adopted by this Court in <em>Hawthorne </em>provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">[B]y entering into a contract with A, the defendant may place himself in such a relation toward B that the law will impose upon him an obligation, sounding in tort and not in contract, to act in such a way that B will not be injured. The incidental fact of the existence of the contract with A does not negative the responsibility of the actor when he enters upon a course of affirmative conduct which may be expected to affect the interests of another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 93, at 622. Given our reaffirmations of this rule in <em>Tynes, </em>224 Mont. at 359-60, 730 P.2d at 1121, <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating, </em>265 Mont. at 502, 878 P.2d at 253, and <em>Turner, </em>283 Mont. at 125-26, 938 P.2d at 1373-74, it cannot be disputed that the rule was firmly established in our caselaw by 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\u00b691 However, we have not always invoked Prosser\u2019s rule for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>ascertaining whether a professional owed a duty of care to a nonclient. For instance, in <em>Thayer, </em>we considered three different approaches for determining the extent of an accountant\u2019s duty of care to third parties: \u201cThe first approach limits the duty of care to those third parties who are <em>actually known </em>to the accountant, the second limits the duty to those who are <em>actually foreseen </em>and the third expands the duty to all those who are <em>reasonably </em>foreseeable.\u201d <em>Thayer, </em>243 Mont. at 144, 793 P.2d at 788 (emphases added). Ultimately, given the facts of the case, we applied a modified version of the first approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">[An accountant\u2019s duty of care to third parties with whom he is not in privity of contract] exists only if the accountant <em>actually knows </em>that a specific third party <em>intends to rely </em>upon his work product and only if the reliance is in connection with a particular transaction or transactions of which the accountant is aware when he prepares the work product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Thayer, </em>243 Mont. at 149, 793 P.2d at 791 (emphases added). Notably, this approach is consistent with Prosser\u2019s observation that the incidental fact of the existence of a contract between the defendant and A does not negative the defendant\u2019s responsibility when he enters upon a course of affirmative conduct \u201cwhich may be expected to affect the interests of another person.\u201d Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 93, at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">\u00b692 With respect to attorneys, we stated <em>in Rhode </em>that \u201ca multi-factor balancing test, such as that set out in <em>Trask, </em>may be effective when used <em>to </em>address the duties of attorneys in transactional matters or estate planning and probate practice.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17. (We further clarified that \u201cthis model is not appropriate to define an attorney\u2019s duties while representing clients in adversarial proceedings.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 17.) Yet, while we did not identify <em>Thayer </em>or Prosser\u2019s rule in <em>Rhode, </em>we did not reject these approaches either. Thus, for the purpose of ascertaining in 2001 and 2002 whether an attorney owes a duty of care to a nonclient, our long-standing endorsement of Prosser\u2019s rule and our actual-knowledge-of-intent-to-rely approach in <em>Thayer </em>were still essential considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b693 Indeed, when we ultimately held in <em>Watkins Trust </em>that a drafting attorney owes a duty to nonclient beneficiaries named in the drafted instrument, we cited cases representing all three approaches. Specifically, we explained that \u201ca finding of duty is consistent with existing Montana law,\u201d and we cited <em>Rhode </em>(the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test), <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>(Prosser\u2019s rule), <em>Turner </em>(Prosser\u2019s rule), and <em>Thayer </em>(the actual-knowledge-of-intent-to-rely approach), as examples. <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00b694 For these reasons, I cannot agree that ALPS proffered \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy by relying on one of these approaches and completely ignoring the other two-particularly since the approach relied on by ALPS was the very one we had not actually adopted, having stated merely that it \u201cmay\u201d be effective for ascertaining the duty owed by an attorney to a nonclient. (Indeed, at the outset of applying the <em>Trask </em>test in Addy\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ALPS acknowledged that \u201cthe Supreme Court has not unequivocally adopted the multi-factor balancing test.\u201d) Moreover, we had already applied Prosser\u2019s rule, which is stated in general terms, in a variety of contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">IV. ALPS\u2019s Application of the <em>Trask </em>Test</p>\n<p id=\"A0j\">\u00b695 But even if it was reasonable for ALPS to rely on just the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test as a defense to Redies\u2019 third-party theory of liability, ALPS\u2019s actual application of that test did not constitute \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b696 As we explained in <em>Rhode, </em>the multi-factor test involves a balancing of six factors: (1) the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff; (2) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff; (3) the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (4) the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; and (6) the extent to which the profession would be unduly burdened by a finding of liability. <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1083). (This test can be traced to <em>Lucas v. Hamm, </em>364 P.2d 685, 687-88 (Cal. 1961).) We further explained that the important inquiry under the multifactor balancing test is \u201cwhether the attorney\u2019s services were intended to affect the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>see also Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1083.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">\u00b697 In Addy\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ALPS argued that \u201c[ajlthough the Supreme Court has not unequivocally adopted the multi-factor balancing test, it is clear that even if it was applied, there would be no liability to Janet Redies under these circumstances.\u201d ALPS then proceeded to apply the <em>Trask </em>test, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b698 First, with respect to factor (l)-the extent to which the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>between Addy and Cosner was intended to affect Redies-ALPS argued that \u201cRedies was an incidental beneficiary, a relationship not close enough to satisfy that aspect of the multi-factor balancing test.\u201d But how could Redies-the protected person in the conservatorship-possibly have been a mere \u201cincidental\u201d beneficiary when Addy was retained by Cosner specifically to render legal advice concerning the management and administration of Redies\u2019 estate? ALPS\u2019s assertion is preposterous, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b699 Section 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">A conservator, acting reasonably <em>in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which he was appointed, </em>may act without court authorization or confirmation to . . . employ persons, including <em>attorneys, </em>auditors, investment advisors, or agents, even though they are associated with the conservator, <em>to advise or assist him in the performance of his administrative duties; act upon their recommendation without independent investigation', </em>and instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary.... [Emphases added, paragraph break omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">That is precisely what took place here.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b6100 Indeed, in April 2002, Cosner completed an affidavit in which he stated that \u201cMr. Addy assisted me in performing my duties as temporary conservator, and later as permanent conservator, as those duties are established under Montana law.\u201d Cosner further stated that \u201cin my capacity as temporary and permanent conservator, I relied on Mr. Addy\u2019s counsel and advise [sic] in performing my duties,\u201d and \u201cI relied on Mr. Addy\u2019s advice and recommendations on handling Ms. Redies\u2019 estate, as evidenced and set forth in Mr. Addy\u2019s letter of September 7, 1995.\u201d (That is the letter in which Addy memorialized the management plan. <em>See </em>\u00b6 9 n.2 of the Court\u2019s Opinion.) Finally, and most significantly, Cosner concluded his affidavit with the following statement: \u201cDuring the period [of] time I served as Ms. Redies\u2019 temporary and permanent conservator of Ms. Redies\u2019 estate, <em>I did not retain Mr. Addy as my attorney for any purpose, personal or business, </em>other than as identified above.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b6101 Addy never disputed that his services were retained by Cosner for the sole and specific purpose of advising Cosner regarding the management of Redies\u2019 estate. Notably, Addy\u2019s bills for legal services were paid not by Cosner, but by Redies\u2019 estate. Thus, it was disingenuous to say the least-and perhaps even a flat-out misrepresentation of the facts-for ALPS to assert that Redies was a mere \u201cincidental\u201d beneficiary of Addy\u2019s contract with Cosner. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>contrary, the record firmly establishes that Addy\u2019s services were <em>intended </em>to affect Redies.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\u00b6102 Next in its analysis, ALPS omitted any discussion of factors (2) and (3)-the foreseeability of harm to Redies, and the degree of certainty that Redies suffered injury, respectively-both of which weigh heavily in favor of finding a duty of care. ALPS instead skipped ahead to factor (4)-the closeness of the connection between Addy\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered by Redies. In this regard, ALPS argued as follows: \u201cMr. Addy had no authority to act on his own with regard to the Estate of Janet Redies. The only person with that legal authority was the Conservator, Mr. Cosner.\u201d Thus, \u201cMr. Addy could not have performed any acts which were improper or caused harm to her since Mr. Addy\u2019s actions take form only through the actions of the Conservator.\u201d ALPS suggested that Redies\u2019 proper and exclusive remedy was to sue Cosner.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b6103 Aside from the fact that this appears to be another privity argument, ALPS\u2019s contentions were contrary to the record. Given that Cosner retained Addy solely and specifically to render legal advice concerning the management and administration of Redies\u2019 estate, and given that Cosner in fact \u201crelied on Mr. Addy\u2019s advice and recommendations on handling Ms. Redies\u2019 estate,\u201d there clearly was a close connection-indeed, a direct conduit-between Addy\u2019s conduct and Redies\u2019 injury. Addy not only should have known, but in fact <em>did </em>know, that Cosner would be acting upon Addy\u2019s recommendations, as Cosner was authorized to do by \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6104 Moreover, it was absurd to suggest that Addy could hide behind Cosner under these circumstances. Cosner hired Addy precisely because he (Cosner) did not have the legal expertise to make certain administrative decisions concerning Redies\u2019 estate. Addy could not be shielded from liability to Redies simply because it was Cosner-and not Addy-who implemented Addy\u2019s advice and recommendations. (In this regard, it is not at all clear that Addy in fact did <em>not </em>have \u201cauthority to act on his own with regard to the Estate of Janet Redies,\u201d given that \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA, authorizes a conservator to \u201cemploy one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary.\u201d) Thus, ALPS\u2019s assertion that \u201cAddy had no authority to act on his own,\u201d even if true, was both misleading and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"AWu\">\u00b6105 Next, as with factors (2) and (3), ALPS omitted any discussion of factor (5)-the policy of preventing future harm, which also weighs in favor of finding a duty of care-and focused the remainder of its analysis on factor (6)-the extent to which the legal profession would be unduly burdened by a finding of liability. According to ALPS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Where a duty to a non-client creates a risk of divided loyalties because of conflicting interests, those considerations against finding duties to a non-client outweigh the other considerations. <em>Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1085. It is from this general rule that the <em>Rhode </em>court extracted its determination that there should not [be] a duty to a non-client where there are potentially adversarial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">That is truly the case here. There are currently adversarial proceedings between Janet Redies and her attorneys and Mr. Cosner, the Conservator, and his attorneys, including Mr. Addy. To hold Mr. Addy had duties to Janet Redies in addition to those of Mr. Cosner would create an irresolvable conflict of interest and division of loyalties for him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">ALPS also suggested that an \u201cinherent conflict\u201d exists between a protected person and the attorney retained by her conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b6106 In <em>Rhode, </em>the adversarial proceeding which precluded a finding of duty was a contested child custody case, wherein the defendant-attorney represented one of the parents. <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-8. We concluded that \u201cif an attorney owes the same duty of care to both the parent and the children, he or she will be able to serve neither effectively.\u201d <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 21. In <em>Trask, </em>the adversarial proceeding which precluded a finding of duty was an attorney\u2019s representation of the personal representative of an estate. <em>Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1081-82. The court concluded that a duty is not owed from an attorney hired by the personal representative of an estate to the estate or to the estate beneficiaries, in part because \u201c[a] conflict of interest arises in estate matters whenever the interest of the personal representative is not harmonious with the interest of an heir\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe unresolvable conflict of interest an estate attorney encounters in deciding whether to represent the personal representative, the estate, or the estate heirs unduly burdens the legal profession.\u201d <em>Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b6107 In the case at hand, by contrast, there was no conflict of interest whatsoever between Cosner and Redies; in fact, Redies initially was comatose and then remained incapacitated at least until 1998, when she began to question the disposition of her assets. (In this regard, ALPS\u2019s reliance on adversarial relationships that developed in 1998-three years <em>after </em>Addy had advised Cosner to pauperize Redies-is misplaced.) Had the opposite been true and an adversarial relationship <em>had </em>existed between Cosner and Redies, then he could not have served as her conservator. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-5-423, 72-34-105, MCA. Thus, given the nature and purpose of a conservatorship-particularly, the fact that the interest of the conservator and the interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>protected person are, by definition, harmonious-Addy simply could not have faced an irresolvable conflict of interest in representing Cosner and Redies simultaneously. ALPS\u2019s argument that the existence of a duty to Redies \u201cwould create an irresolvable conflict of interest and division of loyalties\u201d for Addy was not only contrary to the foregoing statutes and devoid of merit, but also unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\u00b6108 In my view, a reasonable application of the <em>Trask </em>factors, in conjunction -with Prosser\u2019s rule, leads to only one conclusion-that Addy owed Redies a duty of care. First, \u201cin efforts to accomplish the purpose for which he was appointed,\u201d Cosner employed Addy \u201cto advise or assist him in the performance of his administrative duties.\u201d See \u00a7 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA. This same provision authorized Cosner to \u201cact upon [Addy\u2019s] recommendation without independent investigation.\u201d Section 72-5-427(3)(w), MCA. It cannot be disputed, therefore, that Addy\u2019s services \u201c[were] intended to affect the plaintiff [Redies].\u201d (Factor 1.) <em>Rhode, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Trask, </em>872 P.2d at 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6109 Likewise, it was certainly foreseeable that Redies would suffer harm-indeed, the type of harm that she in fact suffered here-if Addy advised or assisted Cosner negligently in the administration of Redies\u2019 estate. (Factors 2 and 3.) And, as explained above, there was a direct connection between Addy\u2019s conduct and Redies\u2019 injury, since Cosner retained Addy to render legal advice concerning the administration of Redies\u2019 estate and since Cosner, in fact, acted upon Addy\u2019s advice and recommendations. (Factor 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b6110 Next, given that a conservatorship exists \u201cto promote the best interests of the protected person,\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>2001 MT 49, \u00b6 14, 304 Mont. 296, \u00b6 14, 21 P.3d 3, \u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 72-5-401 to -439, MCA), the policy of preventing the type of harm suffered by Redies from occurring to protected persons in the future weighs heavily in favor of a duty of care. (Factor 5.) Finally, a finding of liability would not unduly burden the legal profession. (Factor 6.) Indeed, the legitimate interests of a conservator are inseparable from those of the protected person. <em>Cf. In re Guardianship of Karan, </em>38 P.3d 396, 401 (Wash.App. Div. 3 2002) (determining, under the <em>Trask </em>factors, that an attorney retained by a guardian owes a duty of care to the ward),</p>\n<p id=\"A3R\">\u00b6111 The record before us establishes that the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for Addy\u2019s providing legal advice to Cosner was to benefit Redies; Addy\u2019s professional relationship with Cosner had no other purpose. Accordingly, by entering into this legal services contract with Cosner, Addy placed himself in such a relation toward Redies that the law imposed upon him an obligation, sounding in tort and not in contract, to act in such a way that Redies would not be injured. The incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>fact that Addy was retained by Cosner, and not by Redies personally, did not negative Addy\u2019s responsibility when he entered upon a course of affirmative conduct which clearly was expected-indeed, was intended-to affect Redies\u2019 interests. This was the established law in 2001 and 2002; and under this established law, the inevitable conclusion is that Addy owed Redies a duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">V. AT .PS\u2019s Reliance on <em>Watkins Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"AY3\">\u00b6112 ALPS makes much of the fact that in <em>Watkins Trust, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he duty owed [by an attorney] to a nonclient beneficiary is <em>a matter of first impression </em>in Montana.\u201d <em>Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6 21 (emphasis added). However, ALPS construes this language to mean something more than it did. A \u201ccase of first impression\u201d is \u201c[a] case that presents the court with issues of law that have not previously been <em>decided </em>in that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>206 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999) (emphasis added). Thus, while we suggested in <em>Rhode </em>that an attorney, in nonadversarial contexts, may owe a duty to third persons to exercise care in the performance of services for his or her client, <em>see Rhode, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 17, we actually found such a duty in <em>Watkins Trust </em>as \u201ca matter of first impression\u2019-notably, relying on <em>Rhode </em>in the process, <em>see Watkins Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b6113 More to the point, the question here is not whether we had previously \u201cdecided\u201d the defense proffered by ALPS in contesting Redies\u2019 third-party theory of liability. Rather, as the Court observes in \u00b6 43, the determinative question is whether that defense was \u201creasonable\u201d under our then-existing precedents, given the progression in our caselaw toward holding an attorney liable to certain nonclients (as we finally did in <em>Watkins Trust). </em>For the reasons set forth above, the answer to this question is \u201cNo.\u201d Our caselaw as of 2001 and 2002-including <em>Thayer, Jim\u2019s Excavating, Turner, </em>and N/iode-unmistakably foreshadowed our holding in <em>Watkins Trust-, </em>the only thing remaining at that point in time was for us to make the holding explicit, as we might well have done in Redies v. Addy, had the case been taken to trial and appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b6114 Indeed, in the same way that <em>Thayer </em>and <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating </em>announced new rules with respect to accountants and engineering firms, respectively, Redies v. Addy could have been the <em>Watkins Trust </em>case with respect to attorneys, had the parties not settled. Our cases certainly were headed in that direction. For this reason, although this Court had not yet found a duty running from an attorney to a nonclient by 2001 and 2002, ALPS nonetheless, in evaluating Redies\u2019 claims against Addy and deciding whether to contest those claims, had to weigh the likelihood that the District Court would find such a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>under our then-existing precedents (as Judge Baugh ultimately did) and that this Court would affirm that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b6115 This is not to say that an insurer must accurately predict future holdings of this Court. Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the standard to which the insurer is held: reasonableness. As the Court notes in \u00b6 41, a tort defendant and his or her insurer should be able to test the scope and boundaries of legal duties, remedies, and defenses, but the insurer should not be immune from liability under the UTPA simply because this Court had not yet <em>explicitly </em>rejected the legal proposition on which the insurer relied in the underlying action. This is precisely the point of evaluating the <em>reasonableness </em>of the insurer\u2019s proffered defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b6116 Of course, if the law in 1995 had held that a conservator\u2019s attorney does <em>not </em>owe a duty to the protected person, then ALPS\u2019s no-duty defense would have been reasonable. Likewise, if the law in 1995 had not provided for the creation of a self-sufficiency trust, then Addy could not have been faulted for failing to establish one. As it is, however, ALPS could not rely on a definitive holding from this Court with respect to the duty owed by a conservator\u2019s attorney to the protected person. Thus, ALPS was required to evaluate pertinent then-existing precedents and base its decision on those cases, mindful of any handwriting on the wall. The reasonableness of that evaluation, in turn, dictates whether ALPS proffered \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy. As explained above, I conclude that ALPS\u2019s evaluation of our then-existing precedents was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b6117 ALPS\u2019s assertion in the underlying action that Addy did not owe Redies a duty of care was not \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d on which to contest her third-party theory of liability. First, ALPS relied on the outdated \u201cprivity of contract\u201d concept, which we had rejected in at least five cases over the 20-year period prior to 2001 and 2002, and which we had rejected with respect to attorneys, in particular, in 1998 in <em>Rhode. </em>ALPS was apprised of this fact in the evaluation it received a week before denying Redies\u2019 claims. Specifically, ALPS was told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">As you know, however, there have been challenges in the past as to this privity requirement. Most of the erosion of the concept has occurred in connection with beneficiaries of wills being allowed to sue the attorney for the testator. To our knowledge, Montana has not decided the issue of whether a protected person might be able to sue the attorney of the conservator. Clearly, she could sue the conservator. Presumably, the conservator would have a right over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>against his attorney. Thus, our court may short circuit that process by simply finding that the relationship between the protected person and the conservator\u2019s attorney was close enough to allow suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">We do not put a great deal of stock in this privity defense, but it represents yet another problem the Plaintiff is going to experience in prosecuting her claim. <em>Given sufficient time and effort, we believe that defense can be </em>circumvented. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APZ\">\u00b6118 In the face of this advice, ALPS nevertheless chose to put Redies through the \u201ctime and effort\u201d of circumventing its privity defense-which she ultimately did when Judge Baugh ruled, correctly, in the underlying action that \u201cMr. Addy owed a duty to Ms. Redies when he rendered legal advice to the conservator, Mr. Cosner.\u201d ALPS\u2019s actions were contrary to \u201cthe declared public policy of this State to encourage settlement and avoid unnecessary litigation,\u201d <em>Augustine v. Simonson, </em>283 Mont. 259, 266, 940 P.2d 116, 120 (1997) (citing <em>Holmberg v. Strong, </em>272 Mont. 101, 106, 899 P.2d 1097, 1100 (1995)), and to the mandates of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA (prohibiting insurers from \u201cneglect[ing] to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6119 Second, three approaches existed in our caselaw in 2001 and 2002 for determining whether a professional owes a duty of care to a third party in the performance of a contract. Unfortunately, in defending against Redies\u2019 third-party theory of liability, ALPS relied on only one of these approaches-the <em>Trask </em>multi-factor balancing test. Furthermore, ALPS misapplied that test by ignoring three of the six factors and by making arguments (under the other three factors) that contradicted the actual facts of this case. As a result, ALPS reached the erroneous conclusion that Addy did not owe Redies a duty of care when he rendered legal advice to her conservator, Cosner. Had ALPS acknowledged that under our then-existing precedents, attorneys may be held liable to nonclients in certain situations (as it did), but then had merely cited the <em>Trask </em>test with no analysis whatsoever, I doubt that we would be reaching the result that the Court reaches today. I cannot fathom, then, how the Court can accept a patent misapplication of the <em>Trask </em>test as \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d for contesting Redies\u2019 claims. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b6120 Indeed, it contradicts the meaning of a \u201creasonable\u201d basis in law defense to permit an insurer to proffer any argument-no matter how outlandish or lacking-as a basis for contesting the plaintiff s claim against its insured. To be sure, ALPS did not have to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>prevailing, or even a highly persuasive, argument under the <em>Trask </em>test; but it did, at the very least, need to apply that test in a reasonable manner, mindful of our adoption of other approaches in <em>Hawthorne, Tynes, Jim\u2019s Excavating, Turner, </em>and <em>Thayer. </em>Had it done so, it would have reached the correct conclusion that Addy owed Redies a duty of care. Instead, ALPS addressed only three of the six factors and, in that process, misstated the nature of the relationships at issue here and the purpose for which Addy had been retained by Cosner. I therefore do not agree with the Court that ALPS\u2019s application of the <em>Trask </em>test satisfied \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\">\u00b6121 Because ALPS did not have \u201ca reasonable basis in law\u201d under \u00a7 33-18-242(5), MCA, for contesting Redies\u2019 claims against Addy-not only because Redies, in actual fact, was Addy\u2019s \u201cclient,\u201d as argued in Justice Cotter\u2019s Dissent, but also because Addy was liable under a third-party theory of liability-I conclude that ALPS was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law in the case at hand. I would reverse the District Court and remand this case for a trial on the merits of Redies\u2019 claims against ALPS. I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"A1FV\">\u00b6122 In closing, while I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision in this case, I trust that, based on the analysis preceding the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion (and I agree with much of that analysis, as noted above), ALPS\u2019s privity argument is finally put to rest and will not be resurrected by a legal malpractice insurer in some future UTPA case. It should be clear, henceforth, that the \u201cprivity of contract\u201d defense will no longer provide an insurer with a reasonable basis in law for denying or contesting a third-party legal malpractice claim, and that the determinative question in such cases is whether the attorney placed himself or herself in such a relation toward the third party that the law will impose upon him or her a duty, sounding in tort, to act in such a way that the third party will not be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b6123 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> Notably, the first four <em>Trask </em>factors mirror the two primary considerations set forth in Prosser\u2019s approach-namely, the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the third party (Did the defendant, by entering into a contract with A, place himself in such a relation toward B that that law will impose upon him an obligation to act in such a way that B will not be injured?), and the degree of certainty that the defendant\u2019s conduct would affect the third partys interests (Did the defendant enter upon a course of affirmative conduct which may be expected to affect the interests of B?).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
