We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in dismissing Campanella\u2019s complaint by determining that Campanella was not entitled to a statutory 120-day extension of the otherwise applicable one-year statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b64 On November 12, 2004, Campanella filed a complaint in District Court alleging that the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT), his former employer, wrongfully terminated his employment on July 16, 2003. Prior to filing his suit, Campanella had filed a grievance regarding his discharge with the Board of Personnel Appeals (BOPA) pursuant to \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA. MDT moved to dismiss the complaint on three separate grounds: that Campanella\u2019s discharge was exempted from the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA), because, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, the discharge was subject to a state statute providing a grievance procedure and remedy for contesting the dispute; that the cause of action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations provided by \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA; and that Campanella had failed to exhaust administrative remedies available to him, as required by \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b65 Following briefing and oral argument on the motion to dismiss, the District Court entered an order determining that it would be necessary to look outside the complaint to decide whether Campanella\u2019s action was exempted, pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, from the WDEA because of the existence of a separate statutory remedy, and that it could not do so at this stage of the proceeding. Alternatively, however, the court determined that Campanella\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations because he was not entitled to the 120-day tolling provided by \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, and his complaint was not filed within one year. Having concluded the complaint must be dismissed for that reason, the District Court did not rule on MDT\u2019s argument regarding failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Campanella appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b66  A complaint may be dismissed under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), only if, assuming the truth of all of the allegations of fact in the complaint, the complaint nevertheless fails to set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted. The determination that a complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation is correct. <em>Boreen v. Christensen, </em>267 Mont. 405, 408, 884 P.2d 761, 762 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Campanella\u2019s complaint by determining that Campanella was not entitled to a statutory 120-day extension of the otherwise applicable one-year statute of limitations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b68  The District Court, in analyzing whether Campanella\u2019s discharge was exempted altogether from the WDEA pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> looked to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tonack v. Montana Bank of Billings, </em>258 Mont. 247, 854 P.2d 326 (1993). In <em>Tonack, </em>the defendant bank argued that \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, prohibited Tonack from recovering under both the Wrongful Discharge Act and the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In evaluating that contention, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">Whether a discharge will ultimately be \u201csubject to any other state or federal statute that provides a procedure or remedy for contesting the dispute\u201d is not immediately known when a claim is filed. This must be determined before it is known whether the Wrongful Discharge Act may be applied. It is established only when a finder of fact has made that determination or when judgment on the claim has otherwise been entered. Therefore, we conclude that claims may be filed concurrently under the Wrongful Discharge Act and other state or federal statutes described in \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, but if an affirmative determination of the claim is obtained under such other statutes, the Wrongful Discharge Act may no longer be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>Tonack, </em>258 Mont. at 255, 854 P.2d at 331. Applying this case, the District Court rejected MDT\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>provided a grievance procedure for MDT employees that exempted application of the WDEA, reasoning that this issue could not yet be determined. Relying on <em>Tonack, </em>the District Court concluded that determining whether this grievance procedure qualified as \u201cany other state or federal statute\u201d for Campanella to contest his discharge for purposes of the exemption set forth in \u00a7 39-2-912(1), MCA, first required an affirmative determination that this grievance mechanism provided a procedure or remedy for contesting Campanella\u2019s discharge, and since the court could not look beyond the complaint, such a finding could not yet be made. We agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning in this regard, and take no position on this issue, despite our further discussion of the BOPA grievance procedure hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b69 The District Court then took up MDT\u2019s next defense-that Campanella had filed his action beyond the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 39-2-911, MCA. It was undisputed that his WDEA action was not filed within one year after his July 16, 2003, discharge. Therefore, unless Campanella was entitled to the maximum 120-day extension provided in the statute for a claimant who had first contested his discharge by pursuing the \u201cwritten internal procedures\u201d of the employer, his action would be time barred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this defense, it was Campanella\u2019s turn to rely on the BOPA grievance procedure provided to MDT employees -under \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA. He argued to the District Court, and does so here, that this procedure constituted his employer\u2019s \u201cwritten internal procedures\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, and, therefore, his pursuit of this relief gave him the 120-day extension of the one-year statute of limitations. The District Court, in denying Campanella the 120-day extension, noted that the BOPA grievance procedure was a statutory creation, and concluded that because \u201cthe grievance procedure for Department of Transportation employees [was] specified by statute,\u201d it could not qualify as a \u201cwritten internal procedure\u201d of the employer for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA. It thus dismissed Campanella\u2019s complaint as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b610 Section 39-2-911(1), MCA, requires that an action under the WDEA \u201cmust be filed within 1 year after the date of discharge.\u201d Section 39-2-911(2), MCA, adds the tolling provision, providing that the one-year limitation period can be tolled for up to 120 days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\"><em>If an employer maintains written internal procedures, other than those specified in 39-2-912, </em>under which an employee may appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a discharge within the organizational structure of the employer, the employee shall first exhaust those procedures prior to filing an action under this part.... The limitation period in subsection (1) is tolled until the procedures are exhausted. In no case may the provisions of the employer\u2019s internal procedures extend the limitation period in subsection (1) more than 120 days. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Therefore, in order to conclude that Campanella\u2019s pursuit of a BOPA grievance under \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, entitles him to a 120-day extension, it must first be determined that the BOPA procedure is a \u201cwritten internal procedure\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA. Campanella contends that it is an internal procedure for MDT employees, who are designated by statute to follow it. MDT counters that the procedure is not internal to the organizational structure of MDT, but rather a statutory procedure outside the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b611 The interpretational difficulty here is created by the Legislature\u2019s enactment of two statutes addressing administrative remedies in the employment context, but without coordination thereof. This particular problem arises only in a case involving a MDT employee, who may want to seek relief under the WDEA, but who is also subject to \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, which the Legislature has uniquely applied to MDT employees. That provision provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">Transportation department personnel grievances-hearing. (1) An employee of the department of transportation aggrieved by a serious matter of his employment based upon work conditions, supervision, or the result of an administrative action and <em>who has exhausted all other administrative remedies </em>is entitled to a hearing before the board of personnel appeals, under the provisions of a grievance procedure to be prescribed by the board, for resolution of the grievance. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b612 Section 2-18-1001, MCA, provides MDT employees with the BOPA grievance procedure for addressing a \u201cserious matter of his employment.\u201d There would seem little disagreement that a discharge is a serious matter of employment, and thus applicable to Campanella\u2019s claim. The issue, however, is whether this procedure is the employer\u2019s \u201cwritten internal procedure\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, of the WDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b613 We disagree with the assertion that merely because this is a statutorily enacted procedure, it cannot be considered the employer\u2019s internal procedure. The MDT is a part of state government, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Legislature has statutorily created a procedure for MDT employees to follow. Even though enacted by statute, such a procedure could be \u201cintemal\u201d to those employees if so designed and intended to be by the statute. Thus, we must look further into the workings of this particular dispute resolution procedure to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\u00b614 A reading of \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, reveals the language, italicized in the above quotation, which we deem to be significant. The statute expressly provides that an MDT employee must first \u201cexhaust[] all other administrative remedies [before being] entitled to a hearing before [BOPA]....\u201d Thus, the statute acknowledges that there may be yet other administrative remedies which an MDT employee must pursue before the employee may turn to the BOPA grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b615 In interpreting a statute, we consider \u201cthe statute\u2019s text, language, structure, and object.\u201d <em>S.L.H. v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 16, 303 Mont. 364, \u00b6 16, 15 P.3d 948, \u00b6 16. Although the Legislature did not coordinate the grievance provisions of \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, with the provisions of the WDEA in \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-911 or 39-2-912, MCA, the two statutes bear a similarity in their construction. The WDEA requires a discharged employee to exhaust the employer\u2019s internal written procedures prior to initiating litigation. Section 39-2-912(2), MCA. Likewise, \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, requires the discharged MDT employee to exhaust other administrative remedies prior to commencing a BOPA grievance proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b616 This correlation leads us to conclude that the BOPA grievance procedure cannot be considered a \u201cwritten internal procedure\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA. Clearly, \u00a7 2-18-2001, MCA, contemplates other administrative remedies for the MDT employee which must be exhausted prior to the initiation of a BOPA proceeding. It is apparent that the Legislature intended these other remedies to be the mandatory \u201cinternal procedures\u201d for those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b617 Consequently, we conclude that the District Court correctly held that Campanella missed the filing deadline for his WDEA action, because the one-year statute of limitations found in \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, expired before Campanella filed his complaint, and the 120-day extension provided for in \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA, was not applicable, as the BOPA procedure provided for in \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA, was not the employer\u2019s written internal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-10\"> Section 39-2-912(1), MCA, states, in part: \u201cExemption.

However, I would limit the discussion to the issue raised and argued by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b620 The overarching issue is whether Campanella is entitled to toll the one-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 39-2-911(1), MCA, of the WDEA pursuant to the tolling provision contained in \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA. The tolling provision is available when a discharged employee must exhaust an employer\u2019s \u201cwritten internal procedures\u201d for appealing the discharge. I agree with the Court that Campanella is not entitled to the tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b621 The subissue, however, is whether \u00a7 2-18-1001, MCA-a statutory personnel grievance procedure enacted by the Legislature for MDT employees-is a \u201cwritten internal procedure\u201d for purposes of the tolling provision in \u00a7 39-2-911(2), MCA. Campanella insists that it is. The Court concludes it is not, and I agree. However, I would reach that result by concluding-simply and cleanly-that the statutory process involving the BOPA, a separate entity not within the MDT, is not, by its terms, a written procedure internal to MDT, the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b622 Thus, I join in the result the Court reaches, which is to affirm the District Court, but not in the entirety of its discussion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
