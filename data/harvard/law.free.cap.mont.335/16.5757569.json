(MMI) alleging trademark infringement. MMI appeals from an Order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, denying its motion for change of venue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u00b62 We review on appeal whether the District Court erred in determining that Gallatin County constituted proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">\u00b63 Circle S is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Gallatin County. MMI is a Montana corporation with its principal place of business in Cascade County. Circle S filed a complaint in the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, alleging trademark infringement by MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">\u00b64 MMI moved for a change of venue on the grounds that Circle S\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>complaint contained only a tort action to which \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, applied. MMI argued that Cascade County would be the only proper venue because MMI resides there and any alleged tort occurred there. Circle S responded that it sought a statutory penalty, and therefore, it argued that the court must look to \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, to determine the appropriate venue. Circle S argued that Gallatin County was a proper venue because its trademark infringement action, or some part thereof, arose in Gallatin County. The District Court determined that \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, applied, and that Gallatin County constituted a proper venue. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b65 The determination of whether a county represents the proper place for trial presents a question of law that involves the application of the venue statutes to pleaded facts. <em>DML, Inc. v. Fulbright, </em>2005 MT 204, \u00b6 7, 328 Mont. 212, \u00b6 7, 119 P.3d 93, \u00b6 7. Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for change of venue is plenary, and we determine whether the district court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>DML, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it determined that Gallatin County constituted proper venue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b67 MMI focuses much of its argument on the contention that Circle S\u2019s complaint contained multiple claims, including a tort claim. MMI made no such argument before the District Court. We decline to consider this change in legal theory on appeal. <em>Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Illinois, </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 67, 329 Mont. 347, \u00b6 67, 125 P.3d 597, \u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">\u00b68 MMI argues next that the District Court erroneously applied \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, the statute for determining venue in an action for recovery of statutory penalty. MMI points out that Circle S\u2019s complaint alleges trademark infringement against MMI, and seeks to enforce rights imposed by common law. MMI argues that these claims are based in tort, and subject to the venue requirements of \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA. MMI argues, based on \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA, that proper venue lies in Cascade County, because any alleged tort would have been committed in its business offices where the decision to use the trademark originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u00b69  The county in which the defendant resides generally provides the proper place for trial in a civil action. Section 25-2-118, MCA. Montana law provides exceptions to the general rule under certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>circumstances. For instance, the proper place for trial of a tort action is where the defendant resides or where the tort was committed. Section 25-2-122(1)(a), (b), MCA. Under \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, venue is proper in an action for the recovery of a statutory penalty in the county where the cause or some part thereof arose. Where venue is proper in more than one county, then any one of the designated counties is the proper place for trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-2-115, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b610 We address first whether the District Court erroneously applied \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. Section 25-2-124, MCA, applies only if Circle S\u2019s complaint seeks recovery of a penalty or forfeiture imposed by statute. This Court has not yet addressed what constitutes a \u201cpenalty\u2019 imposed by statute under \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. We have considered the definition of \u201cpenalty,\u201d however, in applying \u00a7 93-2902 R.C.M. (1947), the predecessor statute to \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b611 In <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch v. Collins, </em>146 Mont. 321, 324, 406 P.2d 365, 366 (1965), the plaintiff sought recovery of monetary damages imposed by \u00a7 67-807 R.C.M. (1947), the statute that allowed an adjoining land owner to recover all costs and damages from any person \u201cwho neglects or refuses to repair or rebuild any partition fence which by law he ought to build or maintain\u201d if proper notice was given of the needed repairs. We determined that a \u201cpenalty,\u201d in the context of the predecessor statute to \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, means \u201c 'a sum of money which the law exacts the payment of by way of punishment for doing some act which is prohibited, <em>or the omission to do some act which is required to be done.\u2019 \u201d Hidden Hollow Ranch, </em>146 Mont. at 326, 406 P.2d at 368, quoting <em>Shubat v. Glacier County, </em>93 Mont. 160, 164, 18 P.2d 614, 615 (1932). Under that definition, we concluded that the liability created under \u00a7 67-807 R.C.M. (1947), was penal in nature and, therefore, venue was proper where the cause or some part thereof arose. <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch, </em>146 Mont. at 326-27, 406 P.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"ACqx\">\u00b612 This Court discussed in <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch </em>other statutes that we previously have classified as penal in nature. For instance, we recognized that a statute imposing liability for the debts of a corporation on its directors for failing to file an annual report constituted a statutory penalty for the purposes of determining venue. <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch, </em>146 Mont. at 327, 406 P.2d at 368, citing <em>National Supply Company-Midwest v. Abell, </em>87 Mont. 555, 289 P. 577 (1930). We acknowledged also that a statute that levied a $100 fine on a person who failed to release an oil and gas lease as required by \u00a7 73-115 R.C.M. (1947), constituted a penalty imposed by statute. <em>Hidden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Hollow Ranch, </em>146 Mont. at 327-28, 406 P.2d at 369, citing <em>Beavers v. Rankin, </em>142 Mont. 570, 385 P.2d 640 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b613 The Court\u2019s examples of statutory penalties in <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch </em>comport with Black\u2019s <em>Law Dictionary\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cpenalty\u2019 as a \u201c[pjunishment imposed on a wrongdoer, usu. in the form of imprisonment or fine; esp., a sum of money exacted as punishment for either a wrong to the state or a civil wrong (as distinguished from compensation for the injured party's loss).\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1168, (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004). <em>Black\u2019s </em>also defines \u201cstatutory penalty\u2019 as a \u201cpenalty imposed for a statutory violation; esp., a penalty imposing automatic liability on a wrongdoer for violation of a statute's terms without reference to any actual damages suffered.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1168. Both legal definitions and the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch </em>suggest that a statutory penalty differs from the mere recovery of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b614 Circle S\u2019s complaint seeks relief under \u00a7 30-13-335, MCA, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117. Section 30-13-335, MCA, grants the district court wide discretion in determining the appropriate remedy for trademark infringement brought under \u00a7\u00a7 30-13-333,30-13-335, MCA. The court may grant an injunction to prevent the use of such trademark. Section 30-13-335, MCA. \u201cThe court may require the defendants to pay to the owner all profits derived from and all damages suffered by reason of the wrongful manufacture, use, display, or sale\u201d of the trademark. Section 30-13-335, MCA. The court also may award treble damages to the prevailing party, upon determining that the defendant \u201ccommitted the wrongful acts with knowledge, in bad faith, or otherwise as according to the circumstances of the case.\u201d Section 30-13-335, MCA. Similarly, the federal counterpart to \u00a7 30-13-335, MCA, affords the court discretion to award treble damages on the finding that the defendant committed such trademark violation, in this case dilution, with knowledge and intent. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b615 We discussed whether discretionary treble damages constituted a penalty in <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984. We considered whether the district court erred in applying the punitive damage standard in denying discretionary treble damages available under the Montana Consumer Protection Act. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 11. We determined that a discretionary award of treble damages is not punitive in nature where the statute fails to require specific intentional conduct on the part of the defendant. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 27. Our conclusion in <em>Plath </em>suggests that \u00a7 30-13-335, MCA, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117, are punitive in nature because they impose treble damages upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the court\u2019s finding of specific intent or knowledge of the trademark infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b616  We determine, however, that the discretionary nature of the treble damages available under \u00a7 30-13-335, MCA, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a), precludes venue determination under \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA. Our definition of \u201cpenalty\u201d in <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch </em>requires that the law exact payment of a sum of money for the purposes of punishing the wrongdoer. No mandatory penalty exists for trademark infringement under the given statutes. Instead, the penalty represents merely an option that the court may elect. We conclude that for the purposes of determining venue the statutes fail to \u201cexact\u201d punishment as required by <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch. </em>The District Court erred therefore in applying \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, to determine proper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b617 MMI argues that Cascade County represents the proper venue for Circle S\u2019s claim on grounds that \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, controls venue determination. Circle S elected to file this action in Gallatin County. Section 25-2-115, MCA, provides that if more than one county qualifies as a proper place of trial for any action, an action brought in any of the quahfying counties is proper, and \u201cno motion may be granted to change the place of trial upon the ground that the action is not brought in a proper county ....\u201d We must determine therefore whether Gallatin County represents an appropriate venue pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA. We review the allegation contained in the complaint in determining proper venue. <em>Allen v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>2005 MT 281, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 230, \u00b6 11, 124 P.3d 132, \u00b6 11. Circle S\u2019s complaint alleges that MMI violated federal and state trademark statutes, engaged in unfair trade practices, intentionally interfered with its business relationships, and damaged its business reputation, good will, and profits. Although part of Circle S\u2019s complaint seeks damages pursuant to specific statutory provisions, the bulk of Circle S\u2019s claim sounds in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b618  A \u201ctort is committed\u201d for the purposes of determining venue \u201cwhere there is a concurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages.\u201d <em>BHC Holding Co. v. Hurly, </em>242 Mont. 4, 6, 788 P.2d 322, 323 (1990). MMI\u2019s duty to refrain from intentionally interfering with Circle S\u2019s business practices, particularly in the use of Circle S\u2019s registered trademark, gives rise to Circle S\u2019s claims. MMI contends that any alleged breach arose at its business office in Cascade County. MMI may have made the decision to use Circle S\u2019s protected trademark at its business office in Cascade County. This action simply started in motion its alleged breach of its duty not to interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Circle S\u2019s business. As a result, Cascade County would be a proper venue for Circle S\u2019s action. Sections 25-2-118, 25-2-122(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A09Q\">\u00b619 MMI\u2019s alleged breach reached fruition, however, when it widely distributed its products containing the allegedly illegal trademark to the marketplace, including Gallatin County. MMI\u2019s widespread distribution of its product to the marketplace rendered Gallatin County, and other possible locales, a proper venue in this matter. Section 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA. Moreover, damages from MMI\u2019s alleged breach would have accrued in Gallatin County, the location of Circle S\u2019s principal place of business, and where it allegedly suffered lost profits and other related damages. The \u201cconcurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages\u201d occurred in Gallatin County. <em>BHC Holding Co., </em>242 Mont. at 6, 788 P.2d at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b620 The Dissent suggests that tying venue to the place where damages are experienced \u201cthreatens to upend our venue jurisprudence.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 26. We emphasize, however, that a \u201ctort claim cannot arise until all the elements of the tort, including damages, are present.\u201d <em>Zempel v. Liberty, </em>2006 MT 220, \u00b6 36 n. 11, 333 Mont. 417, \u00b6 36 n. 11, 143 P.3d 123, \u00b6 36 n. 11; <em>Gabriel v. School Dist. No. 4, Libby, </em>264 Mont. 177, 180-81, 870 P.2d 1351, 1352-53 (1994) (holding that because death is a necessary element in a wrongful death suit, the cause of action arises where the death occurs). \u201c[A] tort is not wrongful conduct in the air; the arrow must hit its mark. Until there is hurt, there is no tort.\u201dHeil <em>v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., </em>863 F.2d 546, 550 (7th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b621  Here the arrow hit its mark in Gallatin County where Circle S allegedly suffered damages and provided the final element of the alleged tort. Section 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA, provides that venue is proper in the county in which the tort was committed. Thus, Gallatin County represents a proper venue in this matter even though the underlying conduct in the form of MMI making the decision to use Circle S\u2019s protected trademark took place at its business office in Cascade County.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b622 Our ruling in no way undermines the proposition set forth in the general venue statute, \u00a7 25-2-118, MCA, that venue is proper in a civil action in the county in which the defendant resides. It simply applies the more specific tort venue statute, \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA, in a manner consistent with its plain language. <em>Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 315, \u00b6 19, 48 P.3d 697, \u00b6 19. This interpretation also comports with the general rule that a specific statute controls over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>a more general statute. <em>Dept. of Revenue v. Kaiser Cement Corp., </em>245 Mont. 502, 506-07, 803 P.2d 1061, 1063-64 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b623  Although the District Court improperly applied \u00a7 25-2-124, MCA, its determination that Gallatin County constituted proper venue is \u201clegally correct\u201d under \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA. <em>DML, </em>\u00b6 7. We conclude, therefore, that Gallatin County represents a proper place for trial in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b47-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b625 I dissent. In concluding that Gallatin County is a proper venue under \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA, we have misconstrued the statute, we have erroneously expanded this Court\u2019s holding in <em>BHC Holding Co. v. Hurly, </em>and we have displaced the historic primacy of the county of the defendant\u2019s residence as the primary place of venue. 242 Mont. 4, 788 P.2d 322 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b626 Upon concluding that Circle S\u2019s claim sounds basically in tort, we proceed to cite <em>BHC Holding Co. </em>for the proposition that a tort is committed, for the purposes of venue, \u201cwhere there is a concurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages.\u201d \u00b6 18. While acknowledging that MMI\u2019s decision to use the Circle S trademark occurred at its business office in Cascade County-which is also the place of residence of the Defendant-we state that the alleged breach \u201creached fruition\u201d when MMI \u201cwidely distributed its products\u201d around the state, including in Gallatin County, and that damages from the breach would have accrued in Gallatin County. \u00b6 19. With all due respect, this conclusion stretches <em>BHC Holding Co. </em>too far. Moreover, in tying venue to the place where damages are experienced, the Court threatens to upend our venue jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">\u00b627 Significant to our holding in <em>BHC Holding Co. </em>was the fact that the tort occurred in Yellowstone County. Thus, under \u00a7 25-2-122(1)(b), MCA, venue was proper there, notwithstanding that Hurly\u2019s place of business was in Valley County. Because of this, our reference to the \u201cconcurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages\u201d was mere surplusage; i.e., the place where the tort occurred was already determinative under the statute. <em>BHC Holding Co., </em>242 Mont. at 6, 788 P.2d at 323. Here, by contrast, the tort occurred in Cascade County at MMI\u2019s place of business where it took action to allegedly infringe upon Circle S\u2019s protected trademark. Thus, in this case, unlike in <em>BHC </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Holding Co., </em>both the locale of the tort <em>and </em>the defendant\u2019s principal place of residence were Cascade County, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b628 Section 25-2-118(1), MCA, provides that the proper place of trial of all civil actions is the county of the defendant\u2019s residence. This is the general venue rule. Section 25-2-122, MCA, addresses venue in tort actions and provides that the proper place of trial is either the county of residence of the defendant or the county in which the tort was committed. In the 2004 Annotations to Title 25, MCA, the Evidence Commission Recommendations for Revisions are noted. <em>See </em>2004 Annotations to the MCA, Volume 4, pages 117-18. The Commission indicates that the location and arrangement of the venue statutes was revised in order to place emphasis upon \u201cthe most fundamental of all venue rules-that the defendant has the right to have the trial in his county of residence . . . .\u201d As the Annotation indicates, we have repeatedly said that the principal rule of venue is that venue is proper where the defendant resides. <em>See Hardenburgh v. </em>Hardenburgh, 115 Mont. 469, 473, 146 P.2d 151, 152 (1944); <em>Love v. Mon-O-Co Oil Corp., </em>133 Mont. 56, 59-60, 319 P.2d 1056, 1058 (1958); and <em>Clark Fork Paving v. Atlas Concrete, </em>178 Mont. 8, 11, 582 P.2d 779, 781 (1978). That general rule is subject to the specific rules that follow, certainly, but those rules in turn must be followed faithfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b629 Here, while Cascade County was both the county of the Defendant\u2019s residence and the locale where the tort occurred, Gallatin County is simply one of the many counties around the state in which the damages occasioned by the alleged toft were felt. <em>See </em>\u00b6 19. No venue statute allows the locale where damages are experienced to dictate venue. I submit that under the rationale of this case-that venue is proper wherever the concurrence of breach of obligation and the occasion of damages reaches fruition-one could successfully argue in virtually any tort action that the concurrence of the two events occurs where the damages are felt, thereby placing the county of the plaintiffs residence on an equal footing with that of the defendant. While there would be nothing wrong with such a rule, the statutes as presently written do not even arguably contemplate such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"AWMR\">\u00b630 Under our longstanding venue rules and jurisprudence, venue in this case was proper in Cascade County, and not in Gallatin County. I would therefore reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-6\">JUSTICE NELSON and JUSTICE RICE join in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
