We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b62 Jacob raises three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in ruling that it has jurisdiction over the custody dispute between Jacob and Jennifer?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in ruling that Jacob is in contempt of court?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">\u00b65 3.

The couple had one child together, Wyatt, born on January 31, 2001. On November 6, 2002, Jennifer filed a petition for dissolution in the District Court, which included a proposed parenting plan for Wyatt. At that time, Jacob was serving with the Air Force in Shreveport, Louisiana. Wyatt continued to live with Jennifer in Great Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b68 On December 21, 2002, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) removed Wyatt involuntarily from Jennifer\u2019s care for suspected child abuse and turned Wyatt over to Jacob. DPHHS determined Jacob had an equal right to custody of Wyatt and left subsequent custody issues to the courts. At the time of DPHHS\u2019s action, Wyatt was nearly two years old and had lived exclusively with Jennifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b69 Jacob returned to Louisiana with Wyatt and filed his own dissolution action in Louisiana on December 30,2002. Wyatt has lived in Louisiana ever since. Shortly thereafter, the Louisiana Thirteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana court) held a hearing concerning the custody of Wyatt. Jennifer did not participate in this hearing and on the next day, the Louisiana court decided it had jurisdiction over the child custody proceedings based upon an emergency situation pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCC JA). <em>See </em>La. Rev. Stat. 13:1702(A)(3). Jennifer never appealed the Louisiana court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b610 On February 11, 2003, the District Court held a telephone conference with the Louisiana court and subsequently issued an order transferring jurisdiction to the Louisiana court reasoning that it was in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of Wyatt for the Louisiana court to have jurisdiction. Jennifer appealed the District Court\u2019s transfer of jurisdiction to the Louisiana court to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b611 On September 11, 2003, we issued our Opinion, <em>In re Marriage of Fontenot (Fontenot I), </em>2003 MT 242, 317 Mont. 298, 77 P.3d 206, which held that the District Court erred in not holding a hearing to determine proper jurisdiction before transferring jurisdiction to the Louisiana court. <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 21. Further, we determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>District Court erred by utilizing the \u201cinterest of the child\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standard in determining that the transfer of jurisdiction to the Louisiana court was proper. <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 16. We reversed and remanded the case to the District Court to hold a proper hearing on the jurisdictional issue. <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b612 On October 1, 2003, the Louisiana court entered a default judgment against Jennifer granting sole custody of Wyatt to Jacob.</p>\n<p id=\"Ani\">\u00b613 The District Court held a hearing to determine whether it had jurisdiction over the child custody issues on April 2, 2004. Based on testimony and argument of counsel along with its interpretation of the holding in <em>Fontenot I, </em>the District Court determined that it had jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA). The District Court\u2019s decision will be discussed more thoroughly below.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b614 On June 16, 2004, the Louisiana court issued a ruling for permanent custody and child support, finding that Jennifer abandoned Wyatt and that it had permanent jurisdiction over the custody proceedings. The Louisiana court reached this decision based on the facts that Jennifer never appealed the emergency jurisdiction ruling in February of 2003 and that Wyatt had lived in Louisiana for eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b615 Jennifer later filed a motion in the District Court to hold Jacob in contempt of court for continuing to pursue legal proceedings in Louisiana after the District Court determined it had jurisdiction over the case. Jennifer objected to the Louisiana court\u2019s jurisdiction for the first time on June 23, 2004, by filing a motion with the Louisiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b616 Jacob sent notice to the District Court stating he did not intend to participate in the Montana proceedings and instead planned to continue to pursue the Louisiana proceedings. In response, the District Court issued an order on July 7, 2004, which granted custody of Wyatt to Jennifer and issued a civil warrant for Jacob\u2019s arrest after finding him in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b617 The Louisiana court then held a hearing on November 16, 2004, regarding the permanent custody of Wyatt. Jennifer personally appeared at this hearing with counsel. The Louisiana court entered judgment in favor of Jacob, giving him full custody of Wyatt. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>judgment was never appealed by Jennifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b618 Subsequently, Jennifer filed a motion with the District Court for Jacob to show cause why he had not fulfilled the requirements of the July 7, 2004 District Court order which granted custody of Wyatt to Jennifer. A hearing was then held wherein Jacob filed a motion to dismiss the contempt charge based on lack of jurisdiction of the District Court. The District Court issued another order on July 28, 2005, again finding that Montana had jurisdiction over the custody dispute and giving Jacob 30 days to relinquish physical custody of Wyatt to Jennifer. When Jacob failed to produce Wyatt to Jennifer, another warrant for arrest for civil contempt was issued against Jacob by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b619 Jacob appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Vannatta v. Boulds, </em>2003 MT 343, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 472, \u00b6 7, 81 P.3d 480, \u00b6 7. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Vannatta, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\u00b621 <em>Did the District Court err in ruling that it has jurisdiction over the custody dispute between Jacob and Jennifer?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">\u00b622 Jacob contends that our holding in <em>Fontenot I </em>was merely that the District Court did not conduct the proper fact finding through a hearing to determine whether or not Montana properly has jurisdiction. Conversely, Jennifer argues that this Court, in <em>Fontenot I, </em>determined Montana has jurisdiction over the dispute. We agree with Jacob. We did state in <em>Fontenot I </em>that \u201c[b]ecause the Louisiana court is not operating under the UCCJEA, we conclude the Louisiana court could not divest the District Court of jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-102(2), MCA.\u201d <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 20. We conclude today that \u00b6 20 of <em>Fontenot I </em>is dictum and not part of the actual holdings of <em>Fontenot I. </em>There are two distinct holdings <em>in Fontenot I. </em>First, the District Court \u201cerred when it relied on an \u2018interest of the child\u2019 standard in its determination regarding jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 16. Second, the District Court \u201cerred by making a determination regarding its jurisdiction without holding a hearing and without making any determinations of fact and law.\u201d <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">\u00b623 Subsequently, the District Court, in its order dated April 12, 2004, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>relied on the <em>Fontenot I </em>dictum in finding that \u201cbecause the Louisiana court was not operating under the UCCJEA, it could not divest this Court of jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-7-107(2), MCA.\u201d The District Court made this conclusion of law based not on the actual holdings of <em>Fontenot I, </em>but rather on the <em>Fontenot I </em>dictum. Dictum is not binding precedent. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 24, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 24, <em>983 </em>P.2d 937, \u00b6 24. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s order and Jennifer\u2019s argument, the holding of <em>Fontenot I </em>was not that the District Court had jurisdiction over the custody dispute, but rather that the proper hearing to determine jurisdiction did not take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b624  Montana operates under the UCCJEA while Louisiana operates under the UCCJA. For purposes of this appeal, the important difference is that the UCCJA incorporates a \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard in a district court\u2019s determination of proper jurisdiction, while this standard was eliminated from the UCCJEA which Montana adopted in 1999. <em>Fontenot I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. The UCCJA was adopted in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2003 MT 25, \u00b6 12, 314 Mont. 139, \u00b6 12, 64 P.3d 997, \u00b6 12. The UCCJA was enacted to solve problems associated with jurisdictional custodial disputes. <em>Paslov v. Cox, </em>2004 MT 325, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 94, \u00b6 25, 104 P.3d 1025, \u00b6 25. The Montana Legislature enacted the UCCJEA in 1999, which repealed and replaced the UCCJA provisions in Montana law. <em>Paslov, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 14. While both acts are considered \u201cuniform,\u201d in actuality they are not uniform with each other. Thus, the standard as to which act to apply in jurisdictional conflicts is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b625  As we said in <em>Paslov, </em>\u00b6 26, \u201c[hjowever helpful the uniform enactments have been, they nonetheless operate in large part at the state level, while the parental conduct they are designed to prevent is essentially interstate in nature.\u201d The federal government\u2019s response to this jurisdictional conflict came in 1980, in the form of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A, which sets forth jurisdictional guidelines in the face of competing custody decisions by sister states. Paslov, \u00b6 23. The PKPA established national standards under which jurisdictions could determine whether they had jurisdiction and what effect to give the decisions by courts of other jurisdictions. The PKPA requires full faith and credit be accorded to decisions of a jurisdiction if the court appropriately exercised jurisdiction under the PKPA standards. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b626  \u201cThe purpose of the PKPA is to prevent the issuance of competing decrees in sister states.\u201d <em>Erler v. Frier, </em>261 Mont. 65, 70, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>862 P.2d 12, 16 (1993) (citing <em>Nielsen v. Nielsen, </em>472 So.2d 133, 136 (La. App. 1985)). In <em>Paslov, </em>competing jurisdictional decrees from a Montana district court and the High Court of American Samoa were issued by both courts in a custody dispute. <em>Paslov, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-19. Because the law governing custodial disputes in Montana is the UCC JEA while American Samoa had not adopted the UCC JEA, we applied the PKPA to determine which court properly possessed jurisdiction of the case. <em>Paslov, </em>\u00b6 37. Here, we are left with competing decrees of jurisdiction between Montana, which utilizes the UCCJEA, and Louisiana, which utilizes the UCCJA. Because the PKPA was intended to remedy these types of conflicts, the District Court may apply the standards set forth in the PKPA in determining which state properly has jurisdiction here.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">\u00b627  We hold that the District Court improperly relied on the dictum from <em>Fontenot I </em>and thus erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that it had jurisdiction over this custody dispute. As a result of not properly determining whether it had jurisdiction, the District Court did not lawfully have authority to issue an order of contempt against Jacob or to issue a custody determination, hence we do not address Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b628 The judgment and order of the District Court is reversed and remanded for a new hearing on the jurisdictional issue ignoring the <em>Fontenot I </em>dictum. We also reverse the issuance of the contempt of court order against Jacob, the arrest warrant, and the District Court\u2019s custody order, without prejudice to the result of further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\"> Although this Court in <em>Fontenot I </em>used the phrase \u201cinterest of the child\u201d in describing the District Court\u2019s error, the proper usage from the text of the UCCJA is \u201cbest interests] of the child.\u201d <em>See </em>La. Rev. Stat. 13:1702(A)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b109-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"Avj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b629 I believe the Court has erred in concluding that this case should be reversed and remanded for application of \u201cthe standards set forth in the PKPA in determining which state properly has jurisdiction,\u201d because that question is not yet before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u00b630 The Court correctly notes that the PKPA sets forth jurisdictional guidelines in the face of competing custody decisions by sister states. However, the issue before this Court, as before the District Court, is not, at least yet, which of two competing state custody decrees should be enforced, but whether an <em>initial </em>custody decree could validly issue in Montana, and whether it could be enforced by a contempt order. Determining whether a state has properly acted under the PKPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>requires application of the two-prong test of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(f)(1) and (f)(2), the first prong of which requires a determination that a state has jurisdiction under its own laws to exercise custody. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(1). That is the issue we are now trying to resolve under Montana law. As Appellant himself argues, \u201c[t]he Montana contempt order against Father should be vacated as the Montana court had no jurisdiction in which to issue it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b631 I disagree with Appellant\u2019s arguments and would affirm the District Court\u2019s order as a valid exercise of custody jurisdiction based upon proper factfinding, for which we remanded in <em>Fontenot I. </em>The parties may then choose to litigate the proper application of the PKPA to two competing custody decrees for a determination of which custody order must prevail.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
