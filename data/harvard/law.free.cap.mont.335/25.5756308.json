Harlson alleges multiple errors both before and during trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b62 Harlson raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to amend the information?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure of the affidavit to show probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Harlson\u2019s motion to sever?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court err in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in prohibiting Harlson\u2019s proposed rebuttal witness concerning the value of the trucks at issue in Counts I and II?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">\u00b68 6. Did the prosecutor improperly comment during closing argument on Harlson\u2019s failure to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">\u00b69 On May 25, 2003, Perry Metcalf and Barbara Hensley were arrested at Hensley\u2019s Billings, Montana, residence and taken to jail. Metcalfs truck was left parked outside Hensley\u2019s house. Hensley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>friend Georgia Frankfurth obtained the keys to Metcalfs truck for the purpose of moving the vehicle to a safer location. However, since Frankfurth did not have a driver\u2019s license, she asked her son, Leon Harlson, to move the truck. Harlson apparently kept the vehicle for several days. On June 1, 2003, Metcalf reported to the Billings Police Department (BPD) that his truck had been stolen. On June 5, 2003, Harlson drove Metcalfs truck to the Wild West Saloon. He pulled up behind Angela Brown as she was cleaning a spilled beverage out of her truck and borrowed a lighter from her. Brown then entered an adjacent business to pick up her step-father. Brown\u2019s step-father saw Harlson drive off in Brown\u2019s truck. Brown reported the theft to the BPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b610 Lieutenant Timothy O\u2019Connell of the BPD observed Harlson driving the truck at about fifty miles per hour in a residential area with a twenty-five mile-per-hour speed limit. He also observed Harlson fail to stop at a stop sign. Officer Tim Hawkins also responded to the report of the stolen truck. He followed the truck and could barely keep up with it while driving sixty miles per hour. Harlson left the truck at 727 Howard Street and ran into a residence. Several police officers arrived and searched the area. Harlson eventually came out of the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b611 Officer Hawkins could smell the odor of alcohol on Harlson and observed that Harlson\u2019s eyes were red and bloodshot. Officer Hawkins noted that Harlson acted lethargic and slurred his speech. He transported Harlson to the DUI processing center, where Harlson failed field sobriety tests. Harlson refused to perform a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\u00b612 The State charged Harlson by information with two counts of felony theft and one count of felony criminal endangerment. The first trial ended in a mistrial when his attorney discovered a conflict of interest. Before the second trial, the State filed an amended information which added a misdemeanor count of driving under the influence (DUI). A jury convicted Harlson of both theft counts and the criminal endangerment count, and found Harlson not guilty of DUI. This appeal followed Harlson\u2019s sentencing. Further facts will be discussed as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b613 ISSUE 1: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to amend the information?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s decision to allow the State to amend a criminal complaint or information for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Allen, </em>278 Mont. 326, 330, 925 P.2d 470, 472 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00b615 Section 46-11-205(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">The court may allow an information to be amended in matters of substance at any time, but not less than 5 days before trial, provided that a motion is filed in a timely manner, states the nature of the proposed amendment, and is accompanied by an affidavit stating facts that show the existence of probable cause to support the charge as amended. A copy of the proposed amended information must be included with the motion to amend the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b616 In analyzing issues arising under \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, we require stricter adherence to the procedural rules when the amendment is one of substance rather than form. <em>State v. Kern, </em>2003 MT 77, \u00b6 41, 315 Mont. 22, \u00b6 41, 67 P.3d 272, \u00b6 41. In this case, the State filed an amended affidavit and motion for leave to file amended information (motion to amend) on March 22, 2004, listing DUI as an additional charge. This amendment was one of substance, since it altered the nature of the offense and essential elements of the crime, and changed the proofs and defenses required by adding a DUI charge. <em>See Kern, </em>\u00b6 42 (citing <em>City of Red Lodge v. Kennedy, </em>2002 MT 89, \u00b6 14, 309 Mont. 330, \u00b6 14, 46 P.3d 602, \u00b6 14). In <em>Kern, </em>even though the State moved to amend the information orally rather than in writing, we determined that the defendant was made aware of each change and his substantial rights were not prejudiced. <em>Kern, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b617 Harlson argues that the State, in filing the amended information against him, failed to follow the requirements of \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA. Harlson alleges that the State failed to timely file the motion to amend. The State, however, filed both the motion to amend and the amended information more than five days before trial as required by \u00a7 46-11-205(1), MCA. Although Harlson alleges that the motion to amend failed to provide a statement as to the nature of the proposed amendment, the motion clearly states that the additional charge was DUI. Harlson also alleges that the failure of the State to file a written notice denied him the time to object. This contention is belied by the record which shows that the State filed the written motion to amend on March 22, 2004, and Harlson objected to this filing by motion on March 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b618 Harlson correctly stated that the State failed to include a copy of the proposed amended information with the motion to amend, as required by \u00a7 46-11-205(1), MCA. As noted, the State filed the motion to amend on March 22,2004, and the amended information three days later. This timely filing cured any possible prejudice to Harlson\u2019s substantial rights. Even with the stricter adherence to the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>rules necessary with an amendment of substance, the State\u2019s failure to include a copy of the proposed amended information with its motion does not amount to reversible error. <em>See Kern, </em>\u00b6 43. This Court previously stated its unwillingness to \u201clay down a rule which would permit the guilty to escape punishment on technical grounds and when all his substantial rights have been protected ....\u201d <em>State v. Wehr, </em>57 Mont. 469, 479, 188 P. 930, 932-33 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b619 Harlson also argues that the State amended the information to add the DUI count in order to introduce evidence, excluded in the first trial, that Harlson was intoxicated. We need not consider this argument, however, since Harlson failed to raise or address it in his motions before the District Court. We will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>2005 MT 154, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 413, \u00b6 13, 114 P.3d 269, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">\u00b620 ISSUE 2: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure of the affidavit to show probable cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s determination that a motion to file an information is supported by probable cause for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 31, 327 Mont. 335, \u00b6 31, 114 P.3d 217, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b622 Harlson contends that the District Court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss the four charges against him in the amended information. He argues that the State failed to include sufficient evidence in the amended affidavit to support a finding of probable cause as required under \u00a7 46-11-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b623 Section 46-11-201, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">(1) The prosecutor may apply directly to the district court for permission to file an information against a named defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">(2) An application must be by affidavit supported by evidence that the judge or chief justice may require. If it appears that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed by the defendant, the judge or chief justice shall grant leave to file the information, otherwise the application is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b624  To establish the sufficiency of charging documents, we must read the information together with the affidavit in support of the motion for leave to file the information. <em>State v. Elliott, </em>2002 MT 26, \u00b6 26, 308 Mont. 227, \u00b6 26, 43 P.3d 279, \u00b6 26. The affidavit in support need not make out a prima facie case that a defendant committed an offense; a mere probability that the defendant committed the offense is sufficient. <em>Elliott, </em>\u00b6 26. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00b625 Counts I and II of the charging documents allege that Harlson committed theft in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">(1) A person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">(a) has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property. The theft of property exceeding $1,000 in value constitutes felony theft. Section 45-6-301(8)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b626 As to the first count of felony theft, the amended information alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">[WJithout authority, Defendant took a vehicle owned by Angela Brown, and had the purpose of depriving her of the vehicle, at or near the Wild West Bar parking lot... and the vehicle is valued in excess of $1,000.00 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The amended affidavit alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">On June 5, 2003, Angela Brown called the Billings Police Department (BPD) and informed BPD her truck had been stolen from the Wild West Bar Parking Lot. She reported to officer Gilluly that she had left her keys in the ignition and entered the bar to pick up her father. Marvin Whinnery told her that a man he knew as a bartender\u2019s ex-husband had just stolen her vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A74\">The amended affidavit also identified the man as Harlson. This affidavit is sufficient in that it establishes a probability that Harlson committed the offense. Harlson faults the amended affidavit for failing to allege that the truck exceeded $1,000 in value; however, the amended information made this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u00b627 Considering the second count of felony theft, the amended information alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">[W]ithout authority, Defendant exerted unauthorized control over the vehicle of Perry Metcalf, and had the purpose of depriving him of the vehicle, at or near the Wild West Bar parking lot... and the vehicle is valued in excess of $1000.00 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">The amended affidavit alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">Angela Brown advised Officer Gilluly that she did not know the Defendant but he had come up to her in the parking lot at the Wild West and asked her for a light. She observed there that the Defendant was driving a green Chevy pickup. The green pickup had been reported stolen by Perry Metcalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Again, this affidavit establishes a probability that Harlson committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">\u00b628 Count III alleged that Harlson committed the crime of criminal endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, which provides in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">(1) A person who knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another commits the offense of criminal endangerment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Relating to this charge, the amended information alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Defendant knowingly drove a stolen vehicle through Billings, near North 28th Street and 1st Avenue North, a vehicle, at speeds approaching 60 miles per hour, creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to people in the area and officers in pursuit ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The amended affidavit alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">The Defendant was arrested, after a chase where the Defendant exceeded 50 miles per hour through downtown Billings, and near Custer, Terry and Miles avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b629  Harlson argues that the charging documents failed to allege a specific location, a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, a speed limit, or the presence of people in the area. We disagree. The charging documents made clear that Harlson drove the vehicle through downtown Billings. There is no question that driving between fifty and sixty miles per hour would violate the speed limit in a downtown area. It is highly probable that there would be pedestrians in the downtown area of Billings, and a car traveling fifty to sixty miles per hour would pose a threat to such pedestrians. The charging documents clearly establish a probability that Harlson committed the offense of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b630  Finally, Harlson argues the charging documents do not establish probable cause to support a DUI charge. Harlson was acquitted of that charge at trial. Thus, even if the alleged error existed, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b631  Since the charging documents sufficiently indicate a probability that Harlson committed all three crimes of which he was convicted, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure of the affidavit to show probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">\u00b632 ISSUE 3: Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Harlson\u2019s motion to sever?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">\u00b633  It is left to the discretion of the district court to decide whether to sever charges which were originally joined for trial. <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 34, 327 Mont. 196, \u00b6 34, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\u00b634 In considering whether joinder is proper, \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-15\">Two or more offenses or different statements of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>offense may be charged in the same charging document in a separate count, or alternatively, if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character or are based on the same transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan. Allegations made in one count may be incorporated by reference in another count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b635 Harlson argues that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to sever the two theft charges from the criminal endangerment and DUI charges because the theft charges were not of the same or similar character, they were not based on the same transaction, and they did not constitute part of a common scheme or plan. He also argues that trying these four charges together prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b636 We disagree with Harlson\u2019s argument that the theft charges were not based on the same transaction as the other charges. According to the amended charging documents, Harlson was seen driving a stolen green truck at the Wild West Saloon. The charging documents further allege he then stole a different truck at the Wild West Saloon, led law enforcement on a chase through downtown Billings, and was under the influence of alcohol while doing so. All the offenses were based on the \u201csame transactions connected together.\u201d Joinder was appropriate pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-404(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b637  A party may move to sever charges that have been joined. Section 46-13-211(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">If it appears that a defendant or the prosecution is prejudiced by a joinder of charges or defendants in an indictment, information, or complaint or by a joinder for trial together, the court may order separate trials, grant a severance of defendants, or provide whatever other relief justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The burden is on the defendant to prove that severing the charges pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-211(1), MCA, is necessary to prevent unfair prejudice. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 34 (citing <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 14, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 14, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 14). This burden cannot be met by proving either that the defendant will face some prejudice from the joint trial or will stand a better chance of acquittal in separate trials; rather, the defendant must prove the prejudice is so great as to prevent a fair trial. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\u00b638 The following three types of prejudice may result from consolidating charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">First, a jury may consider the criminal defendant facing multiple charges a \u201cbad man\u201d and accumulate evidence until it finds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>defendant guilty of something. Second, a jury may use proof of guilt on one count to convict the defendant of a second count even though that proof would be inadmissible at a separate trial on the second count. Third, the defendant may be prejudiced if he or she wishes to testify on one charge but not on another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b639 On appeal, Harlson lists all three types of prejudice and generally alleges that all three occurred; however, Harlson fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced or how any such prejudice prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Harlson has provided no legal authority or evidence to support this contention. Such generalized claims with no supporting authority are insufficient to establish a need for severance under \u00a7 46-13-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b640  Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to sever the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b641 ISSUE 4: Did the District Court err in denying Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b642 Harlson argues that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated by the 408-day delay between his arrest and the beginning of his trial. He argues that the majority of this time should be charged to the State, thereby putting the burden on the State to prove that he suffered no prejudice from the delay. He also argues prejudice from the unavailability of two witnesses at trial, and contends that the delay caused him stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b643 The BPD arrested Harlson on June 5, 2003, and the State filed the initial charging documents on June 10, 2003. The District Court set the case for trial on September 15,2003, but Harlson\u2019s public defender moved for a continuance because his entire office was moving and a material witness was still recuperating from an unrelated shooting. The District Court reset the trial for January 26, 2004. Trial began that day, but Harlson\u2019s public defender then realized that his office was also representing one of the complaining witnesses. The attorney moved for a mistrial on Harlson\u2019s behalf because of this conflict, and the District Court granted the motion. The District Court reset the trial for April 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b644 On March 22, 2004, the State filed the motion to amend. Harlson filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the affidavit supporting the amended information failed to show probable cause (discussed above in Issue 2). He then filed a motion to continue the trial date because the parties were still filing briefs on the motion to dismiss. He also filed a motion to sever (discussed above in Issue 3). The District Court granted the continuance and reset the trial for July 19, 2004, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>trial actually began on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b645 The District Court found that between Harlson\u2019s arrest and his actual trial, he was incarcerated for eighty-three days. Harlson was arrested on the charges in this case on June 5,2003, and was released when he posted bond four days later. In November of 2003, the State filed a motion to have his release revoked in this case and three other cases because he was charged with unrelated drug charges in Missoula Municipal Court. When he failed to show for the hearing on the motion to revoke, the court issued a warrant. He was arrested and held for sixteen days until he posted bond. On May 18, 2004, Harlson\u2019s bonding company revoked his bond and he was incarcerated up to his July 19, 2004, trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b646  It is a question of law whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial, and we review a district court\u2019s determination of this question of law for correctness. <em>State v. Keyes, </em>2000 MT 337, \u00b6 7, 303 Mont. 147, \u00b6 7, 15 P.3d 443, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b647 A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Price, </em>2001 MT 212, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 381, \u00b6 11, 34 P.3d 112, \u00b6 11. The United States Supreme Court established four factors to consider when analyzing a claimed denial of speedy trial: length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s timely assertion of his right to a speedy trial, and the prejudice to the defense caused by the delay. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192 (1972). This Court adopted these factors for analyzing such claims. <em>See City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 148, \u00b6 19, 965 P.2d 866, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\n<em>a. Length of Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b648  The time between Harlson\u2019s arrest and the beginning of trial amounts to 408 days. A delay of 200 or more days triggers further speedy trial analysis. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55. The 408-day delay renders further speedy trial analysis necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\n<em>b. Reason for Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\u00b649  This factor requires us to determine which party is responsible for specific periods of delay and allocate the total time of delay between the parties. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 14. If 275 or more days of delay are attributable to the State, the initial burden is on the State to show that the defendant suffered no prejudice from the delay. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. If fewer than 275 days are attributable to the State, the defendant retains the burden to demonstrate prejudice. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">\u00b650 The initial delay of 102 days between Harlson\u2019s arrest and the first trial setting counts as institutional delay, and therefore is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>attributable to the State. <em>See Price, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b651 The District Court determined that the 132-day delay between the first trial setting and the second trial setting resulted from Harlson\u2019s motion to continue. Harlson argues that he should not be penalized because the Public Defender\u2019s Office was moving or because a witness was recovering from a shooting incident. However, there is no evidence the delay was caused by any conduct on the part of the State; therefore, the delay is attributable to the defendant. State <em>v. Mooney, </em>248 Mont. 115, 119, 809 P.2d 591, 594 (1991). <em>See also State v. Dess, </em>184 Mont. 116, 119, 123-24, 602 P.2d 142, 144, 146 (1979) (delay caused by defendant\u2019s motion for continuance when public defender retired and asked for time for defendant\u2019s new attorney to get caught up on case attributed to defendant); <em>State v. Burt, </em>2000 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28, 299 Mont. 412, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28, 3 P.3d 597, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28 (delay caused by defendant\u2019s motion to continue trial date for medical reasons attributable to defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b652 The District Court determined that the 76-day delay between the second and the third trial setting resulted from Harlson\u2019s motion for a mistrial and his need for new counsel. Harlson argues that any fault for this delay lies with the Public Defender\u2019s Office, because he had no way of knowing about such a conflict. Again, there is no evidence this delay was caused by any conduct on the part of the State. <em>Mooney, </em>248 Mont. at 119, 809 P.2d at 594. <em>See also Dess, </em>184 Mont. at 119, 123-24, 602 P.2d at 144, 146; <em>State v. Harvey, </em>219 Mont. 402, 408, 713 P.2d 517, 521 (1986) (\u201cdelay caused by defendant\u2019s substitution of counsel should not be charged against the State\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Boyer, </em>208 Mont. 258, 262, 676 P.2d 787, 790 (1984)). Therefore, the delay is attributable to Harlson.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b653 The District Court determined that the final 98-day delay between the third trial setting and the actual start of trial resulted from Harlson\u2019s motions to continue the trial to allow the court more time to consider pending defense motions. Harlson argues that this delay resulted from the State\u2019s decision to file an amended information, and should therefore be charged against the State. However, as explained previously, the State satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 46-11-205, MCA, and the State filed the amended information without seeking a continuance. Harlson\u2019s motions caused the delay, which is attributable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b654  In total, of the 408 days of delay, 102 days are attributable to the State, and 306 days are attributable to Harlson. Since fewer than 275 days of the delay are attributable to the State, the burden is on Harlson to demonstrate prejudice from the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>c. <em>Assertion of Right</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b655 To satisfy this factor, the defendant must either demand a speedy trial or file a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial prior to the commencement of trial. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57. Harlson filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial on June 14, 2004, and trial began on July 19, 2004, so he asserted his right to a speedy trial in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>d. Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b656 The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize delay and the prejudice resulting from pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern, and impairment of defense. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 68. As we previously explained, the burden is on Harlson to demonstrate prejudice from the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"Adb\">\u00b657 Harlson alleges that, \u201cas held in all the speedy trial decisions,\u201d his pretrial incarceration prejudiced him. Not all speedy trial analyses hold that prejudice is established simply by the fact of pretrial incarceration. This Court has held that 413 days of pretrial incarceration did not prejudice the defendant. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6\u00b6 25-30. In <em>Jefferson, </em>the defendant\u2019s probation on a prior offense was revoked, so the pretrial incarceration was inevitable. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 25. This Court stated: \u201cWe recognize that the right to a speedy trial is not intended to prevent all pretrial incarceration. It is designed to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration. Our inquiry focuses on whether Jefferson was <em>\u2018unduly prejudiced </em>by his pretrial incarceration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted). In this case, Harlson fails to meet his burden of demonstrating how the eighty-three days of pretrial incarceration \u25a0unduly prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b658 In regard to the second factor, anxiety and concern, Harlson only argues that he was concerned about the trial, and that the delay made him stressed. Since anxiety and concern are an inherent part of being charged with a crime, we focus on the extent to which pretrial delay aggravated a defendant\u2019s anxiety and concern. <em>State v. Bowser, </em>2005 MT 279, \u00b6 17, 329 Mont. 218, \u00b6 17, 123 P.3d 230, \u00b6 17. Since Harlson fails to demonstrate how the pretrial delay aggravated his anxiety and concern, he has not carried the burden of demonstrating prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"AmrO\">\u00b659 Moving to the third factor, impairment of defense, Harlson alleges that the delay prevented him from presenting two witnesses, one of whom died, and one of whom he could no longer locate. In considering the witness who died, Harlson argued to the District Court that this witness would have testified that Harlson knew the victim in Count I; however, the District Court noted that this testimony would not go to any of the elements of theft, and this witness was never disclosed prior to the first trial. In considering the witness who could not be found, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Harlson argued to the District Court that this witness would have testified that the victim in Count II gave his pickup keys to that witness and Harlson\u2019s mother so that the truck could be moved. The District Court noted that Harlson\u2019s mother could testify to these facts, making the unavailable testimony cumulative. Harlson fails to contest these conclusions. We agree with the District Court that the delay did not impair Harlson\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b660  Since Harlson failed to establish any prejudice from the delay in his trial, the District Court correctly denied Harlson\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b661 ISSUE 5: Did the District Court abuse its discretion in prohibiting Harlson\u2019s proposed rebuttal witness concerning the value of the trucks at issue in Counts I and II?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b662 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cesnik, </em>2005 MT 257, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 63, \u00b6 12, 122 P.3d 456, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b663 Harlson argues that the District Court improperly prohibited testimony from a witness he characterizes as a rebuttal witness. Since Harlson fails to support his argument with legal authority, we need not consider it. M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 22, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b664 ISSUE 6: Did the prosecutor improperly comment during closing argument on Harlson\u2019s failure to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u00b665 Harlson argues that, during closing argument, the State improperly commented on his refusal to testify by discussing his failure to provide a breath sample on June 5, 2003. Harlson contends that this comment violated his constitutional right not to testify. That argument relates to the DUI charge of which Harlson was acquitted. Thus the error, if any, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b666 We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
