We reverse and remand for a trial <em>de novo </em>on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b63 Does \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, permit a district court to dismiss an appeal for failure to appear if the defendant\u2019s counsel is present and ready to proceed on a misdemeanor charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b64 On January 27, 2004, Clark was charged with the offense of issuing a bad check in violation of \u00a7 45-6-316(1), MCA. A jury trial was held in the Justice Court of Gallatin County on August 25, 2005. Clark was found guilty. Clark then filed a timely notice of appeal to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court of Gallatin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b65 A jury trial <em>de novo </em>was set by the District Court for December 20, 2005. Clark failed to personally appear, but his counsel was present and expressed his readiness to proceed. The District Court dismissed Clark\u2019s appeal and reinstated the Justice Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u00b66 The District Court concluded it had authority to dismiss the appeal under \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, because Clark had failed to personally appear. The court also reasoned that the circumstances, such as the nature of the appeal, the impending Christmas holiday, and the fact that Clark had \u201calready been given his right to a trial in Justice Court,\u201d along with the fact that Clark\u2019s counsel failed, in the court\u2019s view, to present sufficient good cause for Clark\u2019s absence, warranted dismissal of Clark\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statute is reviewed for correctness. <em>In re </em>T.H., 2005 MT 237, \u00b6 35, 328 Mont. 428, \u00b6 35, 121 P.3d 541, \u00b6 35 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">\u00b68 Does \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, permit a district court to dismiss an appeal for failure to appear if the defendant\u2019s counsel is present and ready to proceed on a misdemeanor charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">\u00b69 Section 46-17-311(5), MCA, simply says that if the defendant does not appear, then the judge may dismiss the appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-15\">If, on appeal to the district court, the defendant fails to appear for a scheduled court date or meet a court deadline, the court may, except for good cause shown, dismiss the appeal on the court\u2019s own initiative or on motion by the prosecution and the right to a jury trial is considered waived by the defendant. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>dismissal, the appealed judgment is reinstated and becomes the operative judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The section does not specifically define \u201cappear,\u201d nor is \u201cappear\u201d defined elsewhere in Chapter 17. However, \u201cappear\u201d is defined, in the context of a misdemeanor charge, at \u00a7 46-16-120, MCA: \u201cIn <em>all cases </em>in which the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor offense, the defendant <em>may appear by counsel only, </em>although the court may require the personal attendance of the defendant at any time\u201d (emphasis added). Also, \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, expressly provides for a trial in absentia if the defendant fails to appear personally in a misdemeanor case and counsel is authorized to act on the defendant\u2019s behalf. In fact, \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, requires the court to proceed with the trial \u201cunless good cause for continuance exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b610 Section 46-16-120, MCA, necessarily applies to \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, in the context of a misdemeanor charge, because \u00a7 46-16-120, MCA, applies to \u201call [misdemeanor] cases.\u201d A defendant, therefore, only \u201cfails to appear\u201d under \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, if both the defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel fail to appear, unless the court had previously informed the defendant that his personal attendance was required. We see no reason why the statute that allows a defendant to appear through counsel only at the justice court trial should not also apply in the district court trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b611 The State, however, disagrees with the above statutory layout, and claims that \u201cfails to appear\u201d under \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, translates to fails to appear <em>personally. </em>The State claims that \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, is a more specific statute than \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, because it expressly applies to appeals from justice court, and, as the more specific statute, it should control. However, the State fails to provide authority for its underlying proposition that \u201cfails to appear,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, refers to the defendant\u2019s personal appearance. The District Court, nonetheless, agreed with the State, and concluded that because the specific language found in \u00a7 46-16-122, MCA, providing for trial in absentia at the justice court level, is missing from \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, \u201cfails to appear,\u201d must be read to mean \u201cfails to personally appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b612  While we agree that Chapter 17 of Title 46 governs criminal procedure in justice and city courts, including appeals from justice court (see <em>State v. Tweedy, </em>277 Mont. 313, 317, 922 P.2d 1134, 1136 (1996)), we disagree that \u201cfails to appear,\u201d as used in \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, refers to the defendant\u2019s personal appearance. As explained above, \u00a7 46-16-120, MCA, applies to all misdemeanor cases without qualification. Its definition of \u201cappear,\u201d which includes appearance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>counsel, thus applies to \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, unless a \u201cprovision for a different procedure is specifically provided by law.\u201d Section 46-1-103(1), MCA. As no different, specific definition of appear is provided in \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, or anywhere else in Chapter 17, the definition provided in \u00a7 46-16-120, MCA, controls. Thus, since Clark\u2019s counsel was present and ready to proceed and the court had not previously required Clark\u2019s personal attendance, the court did not have the authority, under \u00a7 46-17-311(5), MCA, to dismiss Clark\u2019s appeal and reinstate the judgment of the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b613 Consequently, we reverse and remand for a trial <em>de novo </em>in District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
