The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AYI\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \u201cthe sentence imposed by the District Court is presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"AIr\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6N\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\">Done in open Court this 6 th day of March, 2006.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AIU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>DATED this 17th day of March, 2006.</decisiondate>\n<judges id=\"AOZ\">Chairperson, Hon.
